      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will explain the reasons for the substantial increases in office expenses and salaries in 1954-55, as compared with 1953-54, disclosed in the income and expenditure account of Córas Tráchtála Teoranta.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Norton) William Norton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Norton)</NameTxt>
      <P>The increase in office expenses is due mainly to increased rental charges payable to the Office of Public Works for office accommodation <Col N="3" /> in New York, and to additional expenditure on postage, cables, etc., as a result of the larger volume of inquiries handled by the company's New York and Montreal offices.  The increase in rental charge in respect of the New York premises was applied retrospectively from and including the year 1952-53.</P>
      <P>The increased expenditure on salaries is due to the appointment of additional staff at home and abroad to cope with the normal expansion of the company's activities and the extension of those activities to non-dollar markets.  The additional staff comprised two trade advisers and two typists for the Dublin office; one assistant and one shorthand typist for the New York office and one assistant and one typist for the Montreal office.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that, while a large number of our boot and shoe factories are working only three days a week, the market is being swamped with cheap imported shoes, and, if so, if he will take the steps necessary to terminate this situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The total production of footwear of all kinds by Irish factories is of the order of 6,500,000 pairs per year.  Imports of footwear are subject to quota control and total imports in 1954 of footwear, including types of boots and shoes not made here, amounted to 60,060 pairs.  It is clear from these figures that short time working in footwear factories is not caused by imports.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. O'Sullivan) (for the Minister for Agriculture)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the jam manufacturers have offered the same price as last season for the 1955 raspberry crop.  As the Deputy is aware the home market for soft fruit is protected and as there are no restrictions on exports, growers are accordingly free to dispose of their produce at the best possible prices obtainable on the home market or abroad.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, is it not foolish to suggest that soft fruit can be exported when there are no facilities for the preserving of soft fruit in this country, and is it not a fact that soft fruit is being imported by the jam manufacturers at a much higher price than is being paid to the local people?  Will the Minister not consider at least supplying a chairman to the meeting which takes place between the jam manufacturers and the fruit growers in order that a price might be fixed for supplies of soft fruit to the manufacturers?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Further arising out of the reply, is the Parliamentary Secretary not aware that in answer to a query a few weeks ago I was given figures to prove that a big quantity of pulp was imported last year despite the fact that raspberries were left on the growers' hands because they were not given a sufficient price?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if he is aware that a man who served for five years in the Army during the emergency, has been refused appointment as postman from the special Army competition on the grounds that he is three-quarters of an inch too small, although he is eligible for appointment as postman following his success at another confined competition; and, if so, if he will have the regulations for the Army competition amended in this respect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Keyes) Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Keyes)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Keyes)</NameTxt>
      <P>Three competitions for appointment as postman were held by the Civil Service Commission last year. The regulations for the open competition and for the competition confined <Col N="8" /> to certain ex-Army candidates prescribed a minimum height because successful candidates would normally be entering the postman grade for the first time.  The regulations for the competition confined to temporary and auxiliary postmen did not prescribe a minimum height since successful candidates would have already given satisfactory service on postman duties and, moreover, should normally have satisfied the height requirement on temporary recruitment.  The candidate referred to by the Deputy competed in both the ex-Army and the temporary postman competitions and was successful in the educational test for both.  On medical examination he was found to be below the height specified in the regulations for the ex-Army competition and, accordingly, could only be appointed from the temporary postman competition.</P>
      <P>I regret that it would not be possible to amend the regulations for the ex-Army competition as proposed by the Deputy.  I am, however, having the candidate's position under the conditions of service of the other competition specially examined and will communicate the result to the Deputy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>

      <P>Up to a short time ago the position, in certain areas, was as stated by the Deputy.  After consultation with the Minister for Health I made an Order, entitled the Home Assistance Order, 1955, on the 6th May, 1955, which provided that in granting home assistance public assistance authorities shall not take into consideration any allowance payable under the Disabled Persons (Maintenance Allowances) Regulations, 1954, except so far as such allowance exceeds ten shillings per week.  Since this Order was made, only a few complaints have been received in my Department relating to reductions in home assistance in cases of the kind referred to, and these have been taken up with the authorities concerned.  It would appear, therefore, that the Order is being observed generally by public assistance authorities.  I may add that home assistance is granted at the discretion of the public assistance authorities, but, if the Deputy will let me have particulars of any cases in which payment of home assistance has been suspended consequent on the grant of disabled persons' maintenance allowances, I will have them investigated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Everett) James Everett">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Everett)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a <Col N="25" /> Second Time.  The object of the Bill, which is a very short one, is to increase what are known as the <i>cy-pres</i> powers of the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests.</P>
      <P>The expression <i>cy-pres</i> means &ldquo;as nearly as possible&rdquo; and the legal doctrine of <i>cy-pres</i> is this, that where there is a gift or trust for a charity which can be substantially, but not literally, fulfilled it will be made effective by applying it so that the intention of the benefactor may be carried out as nearly as may be practicable. Thus, where a gift is made with a clear charitable intention, the gift will not be allowed to fail because it cannot be applied to the particular purpose originally intended, if such a purpose was specified.  In such a case the law will substitute another way of applying the gift that is as nearly as possible to what the donor wanted. An instance of the application of the <i>cy-pres</i> doctrine is a bequest for the building of a church in a place where there is already a church which had not been built at the time the bequest was made.  In such a case the funds may be applied to the repair and decoration of the church.  Another illustration is a gift to a non-existent or unidentifiable institution, as for example, to a specified but non-existent institution for providing free meals for the poor, in which case the gift may be applied to an existing institution performing the same sort of charitable work.  Likewise, if a gift is declined by a particular charitable organisation it may be applied to another charitable organisation of the same kind which is willing to give effect to the donor's charitable intentions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The powers of administering charitable trusts <i>cy-pres</i> are vested in the High Court, and, to a limited extent, in the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests.  Under Section 6 of the Charitable Donations and Bequests Act (Ireland), 1871, the commissioners' powers are confined to cases not exceeding £300 principal sum or £30 annual amount.  In such cases, where it is found unlawful or impracticable to apply the donation or bequest according to the donor's <Col N="26" /> direction or intention, the commissioners may, if they think fit, apply it or direct its application to such charitable and pious purposes as they shall judge to be best, having regard to the intention of the donor.</P>
    <P>The sums mentioned in Section 6 of the 1871 Act now represent very small charitable gifts on account of the fall in the value of money since 1871, and the commissioners have asked me to have the amounts increased.  The increases suggested, namely £2,000 principal sum, in the case of personal property, £60 rateable valuation in the case of land, and £100 annual sum, are specified in Section 1 of the Bill, which proposes to substitute a new Section for Section 6 of the 1871 Act.</P>
    <P>There are at present about 20 small charitable trusts, exceeding £300, and not exceeding £2,000, in each case, which will have to be administered <i>cypres</i> and, in the ordinary way, applications to frame schemes would have to be made to the High Court. In these cases, the expenses of High Court proceedings would be out of proportion to the amount involved, with the result that there would be a disproportionate loss to the charities concerned.  In these circumstances, the commissioners are holding their hands, so that the Oireachtas may consider an amendment of the law on the lines of this Bill.</P>
    <P>There is in course of preparation a comprehensive Bill to consolidate and amend the whole statute law in relation to charities.  This Bill, as Deputies are aware, has already been introduced.  It will be based to a great extent on the report of a committee established by my predecessor to consider the matter.  Unfortunately, the Bill has taken longer to prepare than we anticipated and Deputies will probably want plenty of time to examine it when it is available in the near future.  In the meantime, I am asking the House to consider the Bill now before it which proposes what, I trust, is a non-controversial amendment of the existing law for the purpose indicated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture (Mr. O. Flanagan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The purpose of this Bill is evident from its Long Title, namely: &ldquo;to provide for superannuation allowances for the permanent staff of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The board which was set up in April, 1952, under the Sea Fisheries Act of that year, is the successor of the Irish Sea Fisheries Association, Ltd., which had been incorporated in 1930 as a friendly society under the Industrial and Provident Societies Acts with the object of developing the national sea fisheries.  Under the 1952 Act the employees of the former association became members of the staff of the board subject to the same conditions of service.</P>
      <P>The former association, as a friendly society, regarded itself as being in a position under its rules to provide pensions for its employees and, in fact, had under consideration for some time before its dissolution the introduction of pension provisions, to which end it had commissioned an actuary to prepare a scheme.  The actuary's report was not received until after the board was constituted and, in the meantime, the legislation establishing the board had been passed without the necessary enabling provisions regarding the pensions scheme, it being assumed that the board would have the same powers as the association in that regard.  The law officers have, however, since advised that specific legislation in the form now submitted is necessary before the board can carry out its intention of providing pensions for its staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill which is, I understand, in the customary form employed for authorising the grant of superannuation allowances to the employees of statutory bodies calls for little by way <Col N="28" /> of explanation or comment.  The only unusual feature is found in sub-section (2) of Section 2 which provides that an approved scheme under the section shall be deemed to have come into operation on the 1st day of July, 1953, and shall be carried out by the board in accordance with its terms.  Provision for a scheme with retrospective effect owes its origin to the fact that the board, shortly after its establishment, on receiving the actuary's report already mentioned, put the scheme recommended by him to the staff who not only accepted it but urged that it be adopted forthwith.  Thereupon, the board proceeded to deduct pensions contributions, subject to the consent of the appropriate Ministers yet to be obtained.  It is conceded, however, that the board acted in good faith in producing deductions in salaries in respect of contributions, and it is, therefore, reasonable to provide that the scheme when finally approved shall have effect as from the 1st July, 1953.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to say that in the most recent discussions that have been held with the staff no major points of difficulty have emerged, and I have every reason to believe that an amended scheme will shortly be submitted through the board which will prove acceptable both to my Department and the Department of Finance. Needless to say, any assistance which I, or the officers of my Department, can render towards that end will be most readily given.</P>

      <P>I remember that when the 1952 Act was going through the question of preparing the pensions scheme was raised and I promised the Deputies of the time that I would do anything I could to ensure that a scheme would be produced.  Difficulties were pointed out to me, one of them being, as I recollect, that some members of the staff had already given very long service and that there might be a difficulty in working out suitable financial provisions to cover cases of that sort.  The Parliamentary Secretary has said that no major difficulty has arisen and I take it, therefore, that any difficulties that I foresaw at the time have either not materialised or have been resolved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="29" /> There are not many persons, I think, in the category to which I refer, but it seemed to me that it would be a major difficulty if, in fact, there was only one officer who had given the greater part of his service and who was about to retire on a meagre or inadequate pension.  I am glad to learn that any difficulties that were anticipated have either not materialised or have been satisfactorily settled.</P>
    <P>There was general agreement in the House when the 1952 Act was going through that a provision of this sort should be made for the employees of the Fisheries Board and that they should be put on an equal footing with the employees of boards financed in a somewhat similar manner out of public funds.  I welcome the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Norton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The principal purposes of this Bill are (i) to authorise an increase from £16,000,000 to £25,000,000 in the statutory limit of expenditure which the E.S.B. may incur on rural <Col N="30" /> electrification and to provide for the making of advances from the Central Fund accordingly; (ii) to extend the borrowing powers of the board so as to authorise it to obtain moneys required for rural electrification from sources other than the Central Fund; and (iii) to terminate the subsidy for rural electrification.  The remaining provision is a minor amendment of the 1954 Act which is required to make it clear that a guarantee given by the Minister for Finance under Section 9 of that Act may extend to the payment of interest on, as well as to the capital repayment of, borrowings made under Section 4 of that Act.</P>
      <P>Section 7 of the Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Act, 1954, authorised an increase from £8,000,000 to £16,000,000 in the total of advances which could be made to the board from the Central Fund for rural electrification and at the time that Act was enacted, it was anticipated that the provision then made would suffice until about March, 1956.  As a result, however, of the considerable increase in the rate of development which has taken place in the meantime, both expenditure and commitments incurred on the scheme have increased more rapidly than was anticipated.  Within the existing limit of £16,000,000 the total already advanced to the board is £13,600,000 and in the year 1955-56 the board's requirements for rural electrification alone are expected to total £4,000,000. The board's total expenditure and commitments at the end of May, 1955, in respect of the scheme were £15,057,769.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is clear that at the present rate of activity the total of expenditure and commitments on the scheme will have exceeded the existing statutory provision of £16,000,000 by the autumn of this year.  It will be appreciated that the statutory provision at any particular time should be sufficient to cover not only expenditure actually incurred on the scheme but also commitments which have to be entered into in advance and which are inherent in the nature of the scheme.  It is essential, therefore, that additional legislative provision should be made as soon as possible.  Taking account of the balance of £2,400,000 still available, the <Col N="31" /> additional amount of £9,000,000 which it is now proposed to provide, will, it is expected, be sufficient to cover expenditure and commitments until 1958.</P>
    <P>The fact that it should be necessary to seek the approval of the Oireachtas for increased provision for rural electrification so much earlier than was originally anticipated is a reflection of the considerable increase in the rate of development which has taken place. In other words, development is now proceeding at a rate double that of two years ago.  The following statistics illustrate the progress.  In the year ended 31st March, 1953, 49 rural areas were completed; 60 were completed in 1953-54 and 75 in 1954-55.  The estimate for 1955-56 is 100 areas.  At 31st March, 1955, the number of rural areas completed since the inception of the scheme totalled 364.</P>
    <P>In all, there are approximately 780 rural areas in the country and, as development in the current year and in future years is expected to proceed at the rate of 100 areas per annum, there is every prospect that the scheme will be extended to all areas by the 31st March, 1959.  As further legislative provision will be required before that date the House will have an opportunity then of reviewing further the progress of the scheme.  Even with the increased rate of development there is no evidence of a slackening in demand for extension of the scheme. In 1953-54 the average percentage of householders who agreed to take supply in the completed areas was 67 per cent. as compared with 65 per cent. in 1952-53 and 60 per cent. in 1951-52.  The urgency of making additional provision now is therefore self-evident.</P>
    <P>The Government have decided that the continuance of subsidy for rural electrification from State funds is no longer necessary or justifiable and sub-section (2) of Section 4 of this Bill is designed to give effect to that decision. There seems to have been a good deal of misunderstanding about the effects of this decision and in particular it has been asserted that it will result in either a slowing down of rural electrification development or an increase in rural charges or both.  That, of course, <Col N="32" /> is not the case.  To clarify the position, I think it would be desirable that I should give the House an outline of the history of this subsidy provision and of the considerations on which the decision to withdraw it was based.</P>
    <P>The problems of rural electrification were examined in a report prepared by the E.S.B. which was submitted to the Minister for Industry and Commerce towards the end of 1942.  This report was published as a White Paper in 1944 and copies of it are available in the Oireachtas Library.  In dealing with the economics of rural electrification it was estimated in the report that the annual capital charges, namely, interest on advances, the provision of a sinking fund to repay the advances together with provisions for depreciation of the assets and for other costs, such as maintenance, and supervision, would amount annually to 12 per cent. of the capital cost of providing supply.</P>
    <P>On the best estimate that could be made at that time the annual revenue from fixed charges was expected not to be likely to exceed 9.7 per cent. of the capital cost.  There would be, therefore, an annual deficit of 2.3 per cent. of the capital cost.  Of the total annual charges of 12 per cent., interest and sinking fund charges were estimated to total 5.5 per cent.  It will be appreciated that these interest and sinking fund charges would not arise if the State provided the capital required for the scheme as a non-repayable grant which would be the equivalent of a 100 per cent. subsidy. On the assumption that the capital required would, as in the case of capital for the board's general purposes, be provided by way of repayable interest-bearing advances from the Central Fund the measure of the subsidy required to make the scheme economic from the board's point of view was the deficit of 2.3 per cent. expressed as a percentage of the interest and sinking fund charges of 5.5 per cent. or 41.82 per cent.</P>
    <P>The Government approved of the report from the E.S.B. in August, 1943, and decided that the scheme should be commenced as soon as materials became available and that the board should be recouped the amount by <Col N="33" /> which the annual fixed charges fell short of the annual capital charges. Effect was given to this decision in Section 41 of the Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Act, 1945, under which capital for the scheme was made available and which also provided that one moiety of the sums advanced to the board from the Central Fund for rural electrification should be repaid by the board and that the other moiety should be repaid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas at such time or times as the Minister for Finance should direct.  The subsidy was fixed at 50 per cent. instead of the 41.82 per cent. originally estimated in view of the increases in costs which had taken place in the meantime.</P>
    <P>The scheme commenced in 1946-47 and it was arranged that one half of the sums advanced to the board in any calendar year should be repaid to the Central Fund from voted moneys in the succeeding financial year.  This payment was charged to the Vote for Industry and Commerce and in the financial years 1948-49 and 1949-50 a total of £550,000, representing one-half of the advances obtained by the board in the calendar years 1947 and 1948 was repaid to the Central Fund from that Vote.  In 1950 the Minister for Finance decided that the amount falling due for repayment to the Central Fund in the financial year 1950-51, and in succeeding years, should be funded and be repaid by way of an annuity payable half-yearly and extending over 50 years.  These were the terms of repayment which applied to the moiety of advances which were repayable by the board and it was felt that the benefit of these terms should be extended to the taxpayer also.  In 1952, the Minister for Finance decided to revert to the procedure of repaying the outstanding moiety to the Central Fund from voted moneys in one sum and, accordingly, in the financial years 1952-53 and 1953-54 one half of the amounts advanced to the board in the two preceding calendar years was repaid to the Central Fund in lump sums totalling £1,300,000.</P>
    <P>In February, 1954, a further modification of the system of repayment was decided upon.  The net result of the <Col N="34" /> previous arrangements was that at the end of March, 1954, the total amount remaining outstanding in respect of the moiety repayable from voted moneys including the undischarged portions of annuities fixed to repay the 1949 and 1950 advances was £2,110,213 and it was decided that this should be repaid by way of simple instalments without interest over 25 years, and that this arrangement would also apply in future years.  The present position is that the board has obtained a total of £13,600,000 by way of advances from the Central Fund and that of the moiety of £6,800,000 repayable from voted moneys a total of £1,974,400 has already been paid.  In other words, rural electrification has been subsidised to that extent.</P>
    <P>I think that, in considering this question of subsidy, it is essential that regard should be had to the circumstances which prevailed when it was originally decided on and to the considerable alteration which has taken place since then.  In 1943, as a result of the unsettled conditions and the difficulties in securing supplies, the board was operating at a loss and in fact continued to operate at a loss right through the remaining war years.  It was not until 1948-49 that the accumulated deficits of these years were finally wiped out.  When the decision to provide a subsidy was taken in 1943, there was every indication that the difficulties under which the board was operating might become even greater and even with the return of peace might be aggravated by the necessity of overhauling, in an era of inflated costs, the arrears of construction which had accumulated during the war years. It was only natural, therefore, that the board should not be expected to undertake any operations, particularly rural electrification, the economics of which were then uncertain.</P>
    <P>To-day, however, the position is vastly different.  Since 1948-49 the board has been able to produce a surplus on its operations in every year with the exception of 1952-53 in which there was a deficit as a result of inflated fuel costs, and this has enabled it not only to make adequate provision for interest on advances, capital repayments and depreciation of its assets <Col N="35" /> but also to provide other reserves which at 31st March, 1955, amounted to nearly £2,000,000.  In the year ended 31st March, 1955, the gross surplus amounted to £928,659.  The provision for interest and capital repayment on the moiety of advances for rural electrification for which the board was liable in that year amounted to £260,567.  It will be evident, therefore, that the board could have borne the full charges for rural electrification in that year and still have shown a substantial surplus.  It was in the light of these altered conditions that the Government decided that the continuance of subsidy was no longer either necessary or justifiable.</P>
    <P>An important feature of the results of 1954-55 was that the rural revenue account showed a surplus of £44,130 as compared with deficits of £9,988 and £30,610 in the two previous years.  The increased rate of development should result in a considerable expansion of sales of current in rural areas and it would be obviously absurd to continue to provide subsidy for a service on which there was every likelihood that surpluses would continue to be produced as long as the subsidy continued. The Government felt that the board had attained the position in which, taking its operations as a whole, it could not only bear all the charges on this service in the future, but could also take care of the undischarged liabilities. In this connection it is important to bear in mind that the board enjoys exceptionally favourable terms for repayment of its liabilities to the State as such repayment is spread over a period of 50 years.</P>
    <P>Electricity development in this country has now reached the stage at which electricity consumers and taxpayers are largely the same persons. There would, therefore, be no point in arranging on the one hand, for a relatively slight reduction if any reduction were possible at all in the price of electricity to consumers and, on the other hand, imposing taxes on them to provide for a continuance of subsidy.  The logical way to look at this is to regard the board's undertaking as one unit which by prudent management has reached the stage where it is self-supporting <Col N="36" /> and can bear the full charges for rural electrification from the surpluses realised on its other activities.</P>
    <P>Since in future there will be no distinction between capital required for general purposes and for rural development in so far as liability for repayment is concerned there is no longer any reason for the board to rely solely on the Central Fund for its rural capital requirements.  Provision has, accordingly, been made in Section 3 of the Bill to authorise the board to borrow, from sources other than the Central Fund, moneys which they may require for rural development.  This is an extension of the powers conferred on the board by Section 4 of the 1954 Act.</P>
    <P>In case any doubts on the subject should still exist I should like to take this opportunity of assuring rural consumers that there will be no increase in electricity charges as a result of making the board bear the full cost of rural electrification nor will there be any reduction in the rate of progress in carrying out the scheme.  In fact the position now is that, as a result of the increase in the rate of development, those who are still awaiting supply may expect to receive it all the earlier.</P>
    <P>The speedy enactment of this Bill will ensure that the board can go ahead with rural development at the present greatly accelerated pace and will hasten the day when practically every member of the rural community will have available to him this modern amenity and aid to increased production. I think it will be agreed that the board deserves to be congratulated on its achievements in this field and on the success which has attended its efforts.  I therefore confidently recommend the Bill for the approval of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The reasons given by the Minister why this Bill has to be rushed on to the Statute Book in the present session are completely misleading. This Bill is not needed in this session either to authorise an increase in the limit of the expenditure which the E.S.B. may undertake on rural electrification or to extend the <Col N="37" /> borrowing powers of the board for that purpose.  It is required now for entirely different reasons.</P>
      <P>The first reason is that the Government owes the E.S.B. under the terms of existing legislation arrears of capital grant for the rural electrification scheme amounting to about £2,800,000; it has decided to default upon that obligation and one purpose of this Bill is to give the Government legal backing for that default.  The second reason is that the Government has decided to put on the E.S.B. a liability to repay £4,825,000 which was already given to the board under the terms of legislation approved by the Dáil as a capital grant for the scheme and which was due under that legislation to be repaid to the Exchequer from moneys voted for the purpose by the Oireachtas; and the third reason, I suspect, is that the Minister is anxious to get this Bill through the Dáil before the E.S.B. accounts for 1954-55 are published.</P>
      <P>The attitude of the Government to this question of subsidy for rural electrification is an extraordinary one. For some cause, apparently, the reasons for their decision have to be clouded in misleading statistics and in forecasts that are likely to prove in the event completely inaccurate.  Even if it is correct that the amount of the additional charges which the Government has decided to put upon the E.S.B., and which will, from the information available from the E.S.B. accounts, produce a very substantial deficit in the board's rural revenue, might deter the public from subscribing to the issue of E.S.B. stock which is due in a few months' time without a Government guarantee of the interest of that stock as well as a guarantee of the principal, that situation could have been secured by a formal announcement of the Government's intentions.  The mere circulation of this Bill would have met that position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason why the Bill is being rushed now, as one of the limited number of measures to be passed before the Adjournment, does not lie there. The Electricity Supply Act of 1954 raised from £8,000,000 to £16,000,000 the amount which could be advanced through the Exchequer for the rural <Col N="38" /> electrification scheme.  That amount was estimated to be sufficient to meet the board's requirements until March, 1956, and, if the board does no better in this year, than it did last year in the matter of speeding up the rate of rural electrification development there will be a substantial surplus available, counting both expenditure and commitments, by next March.</P>
    <P>The Minister has put into this Bill the section which authorises the increase of expenditure on the rural electrification scheme from £16,000,000 to £25,000,000.  No doubt some such legislative measure would have to be, passed by the Dáil before next March, but he goes on, in another section of the Bill, to authorise the board to secure that additional amount, not from the Exchequer but by the issue of its own stock.  The Bill which was passed last year&mdash;the Bill which I a Minister proposed to the Dáil-authorised the E.S.B. to raise capital by the issue of stock to the public to the extent of £25,000,000 for purposes other than the rural electrification scheme.</P>
    <P>The reason given to the Dáil for not enabling the board to raise capital by the issue of its own securities for the rural electrification scheme was the undesirability of asking the public to subscribe capital for a subsidised service. That objection will not now apply, although one might feel that there is equal objection to asking the public to subscribe capital for a losing service. But in any event, the £25,000,000 limit, put on the issue of stock by the E.S.B. was estimated to be sufficient, and no more than sufficient, to cover the board's actual expenditure upon developments other than rural electrification until March next.  It was realised that the board's new commitments on capital account by March, 1956, would considerably exceed £25,000,000, the additional £25,000,000 provided by the 1954 Act.  But the actual outgoings on capital account up to that date would be covered if the board got in £25,000,000 additional capital through the issue of its own securities.</P>
    <P>There cannot, therefore, be any margin to spare to cover the capital requirements of the rural electrification <Col N="39" /> scheme if the board's other developments are proceeding according to plan.  It is only if the board has failed to carry through the new generation programme to the extent and at the rate contemplated in 1954 that there can be any margin available at all, under the 1954 Act, to obtain capital for the rural electrification scheme by the issue of its own stock.</P>
    <P>There is no proposal in this Bill to raise the limit fixed in 1954 to the amount which could be obtained by the issue of its own stock.  I do not know what the amount of the E.S.B. issue contemplated is likely to be; I know that the board has not yet used its power to obtain capital by the issue of its own securities, but it must get, in that way or in some other way, by March of next year £25,000,000 if its generation and other development programmes are proceeding according to plans made in 1953.  The Bill appears to be hastily drafted if there is indeed any serious intention in the mind of the Minister that the board will raise capital for rural electrification through the issue of its own securities.</P>
    <P>Let us turn to this main issue which arises from the Government's proposal as to whether or not this decision of theirs will affect the development of the rural electrification scheme or involve an increase in charges on electricity consumers.  In that respect, I think the Minister has been far from frank with the House.  He has explained that the Act of 1945, which was the Act which authorised and empowered the board to undertake the rural electrification scheme, provided for the giving of one-half of the capital requirements of that scheme to the board by way of an interest-free, non-repayable grant, the other half to be repaid by the board as requested by the Minister for Finance, constituting part of the board's total capital liability.</P>
    <P>The main purpose of this Bill and the reason why Section 4 is incorporated in it is to make the whole of the balance of that money, in so far as it has not been already paid to the Exchequer by moneys voted by the Oireachtas now repayable by the <Col N="40" /> E.S.B.  The Minister has stated in the Dáil already, when this matter was discussed before, his view that the E.S.B. is not merely capable of carrying the State portion of the rural electrification bill but even of having a surplus after doing that and that consequently there is no justification for any increase in charges by the E.S.B.</P>
    <P>Let us have a look at the accounts and try to relate the published accounts of the E.S.B. to these statements of the Minister.  The board's rural revenue account as published in the 27th annual report for the year ending 31st March, 1934, showed a surplus in that year of £9,988 &mdash; the Minister stated to-day that the rural revenue account for 1954-55 may show a surplus of £44,000.  There was charged on the debit side of that account £142,780 in respect of interest and £28,850 in respect of revenue repayments.  By the date up to which this account was prepared, the 31st March, 1954, the board had spent £9,666,000 on the rural electrification scheme.</P>
    <P>One half of that capital expenditure was free of interest and repayment obligation under the terms of the existing legislation.  Under the Government's proposal the interest on £4,800,000 has now to be added to the debit side of the account.  If we assume the board is paying interest at 5 per cent. or that the sum total of the interest and repayment obligations in regard to that new capital liability will amount to 5 per cent., as is proposed in the present Bill, then the total charges under these heads on the debit side of the board's rural revenue account will be increased, according to the information given to the House by the Minister for Finance, by £245,000 per year and, on the basis of the experience of the board in the year 1953-54, the rural revenue account will show a deficit of about £235,000, a somewhat smaller deficit if the surplus revenue in 1954-55 was, as stated by the Minister, £44,000.  That deficit in the board's rural revenue account must, under the Government's proposals, increase year after year and must necessarily involve some increases in charges somewhere, if not upon <Col N="41" /> rural consumers then upon electricity consumers elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The suggestion in the Minister's statement, when this matter was first debated here, was that the board had last year in its accounts a surplus of revenue which would cancel out deficits in the rural revenue account and that, therefore, the board could easily carry out on its general income the increasing loss which is now going to arise on the rural electrification scheme.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the board's accounts for 1954-55 may show but I know what their accounts for the year 1953-54 showed because they have been published.  In the year ending 31st March, 1954, the board had on all those operations a surplus of £223,209. If one adds to that figure its profits upon merchandise trading the surplus was £242,677.  It had, as the Minister stated, in the previous year a deficit of £488,213.  It is clear, therefore, that the increased deficit which is likely to emerge because of the Government's proposals on the rural revenue account will wipe out the whole of the surplus on the board's accounts generally.</P>
    <P>But let us turn to the board's report and find out how the surplus arose in 1953-54.  The board stated that in the year 1953-54 expenditure on fuel was less than in the previous year by £537,508, mainly because of more favourable weather conditions.  We know that the weather was equally favourable to the E.S.B. in 1954 and 1955 as it was in 1953, but we all hope that normal weather conditions will reappear here however unsatisfactory that may be from the point of view of the E.S.B.'s revenue and expenses. If there is, again, next year, normal weather experienced here, then the surplus which the board showed in 1953-54 and which it may show in 1954-55 will be wiped out because that saving on fuel costs &mdash; the saving of more than £500,000 experienced in 1953-54 &mdash; will disappear.  Indeed, the costs of the board's fuel utilisation may be considerably higher than that because, as we know, the price of coal has increased since that year.</P>
    <P>The position, therefore, is that, because of the Government's action in <Col N="42" /> this matter, the board is inevitably facing a substantial deficit on its accounts &mdash; a deficit which will increase very considerably if we should experience a year of normal weather.</P>

      <P>Are we now going to saddle the board with a permanent liability which will amount to a very considerable annual sum because in a year which was exceptional from the point of weather it was able to show a revenue surplus due entirely to saving on fuel costs?  The board itself said that its surplus revenue in 1953-54 was due entirely to that unanticipated saving on fuel costs.  Let us be clear about this.  The Minister is not proposing in this Bill to alter the board's obligations in regard to its rates of charge in any way whatever.</P>
      <P>The obligation fixed on the E.S.B. by the Act of 1927 is very clear.  The board is obliged by that Act to fix such rates of charges for electricity that, taking one year with another, the revenue derived from these charges will be sufficient, and only sufficient, to pay all the lawful outgoings of the board, the salaries, working expenses and outgoings properly chargeable to revenue, including payments on interest and sinking fund on advances. That Act also gave the board complete freedom in respect of the charges made by it, subject to that statutory direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The revenue derived from its charges must be sufficient to meet its outgoings. <Col N="43" /> The Minister for Industry and Commerce is not proposing to alter or restrict the board's freedom of action in respect of charges.  Time and again during the past few weeks, when Deputies asked questions in this House concerning charges for electricity to some particular class of consumers, the Minister's reply invariably was that charges are entirely a matter for the E.S.B. with which he has no power to interfere.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>And I tried to keep it so.  That is still the position.  In any case, when the Minister spoke about seeing what could be done, if the board increased its charges, that was so much hot air.  The Minister has no power to interfere with the charges made by the board for electricity and he is not proposing to take power to interfere.  The statutory obligation on the board is still, as it always was, that it must fix these charges to yield a revenue equal to its outgoings.  If there is a deficit, as I think I will prove conclusively that there must be a deficit on the board's accounts because of the Government's action, then the board is under statutory obligation to increase its charges to offset that deficit, unless the Government proposes by subsequent legislation to alter its obligations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my view, because of the obligations of the board and because of the whole approach of the board to this problem of rural electrification, the Government's decision to withdraw the rural electrification grants must slow down the rate of development.  In fact, I want to suggest that it has already done so.  I do not know that the House appreciates that this decision of the Government to withdraw the grant for rural electrification, although it was not revealed to the Dáil until the Book of Estimates for this year was published, must have been taken very shortly after the Government came into office.  When the Government came into office, there was due to the E.S.B. on the 1st April, 1954, by way of arrears of grant, the sum of £1,178,000.  The board referred <Col N="44" /> to that in the report for that year. They said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;By reason of the delay in the enactment of legislation subsidies for rural development were temporarily not available, and consequently the interest charged to the rural account in the year was exceptionally high.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, it was merely an accident that the Electricity Act of 1954 was not passed by the Oireachtas until shortly before the election of that year.  If it had been passed earlier as intended &mdash; it was in the programme of legislation for 1953&mdash;then these arrears of grant due to the E.S.B. in respect of the expenditure by it on the rural electrification scheme would have been paid. The money was due to the E.S.B. when the present Government came into office.  They did not pay it and they have paid nothing since, the sum of the amount due to the board under the terms of existing legislation and not paid being approximately £2,800,000.</P>
    <P>Therefore, this policy of the Government in holding back from the E.S.B. the capital grant they were entitled to under the 1945 Act has been in operation for two years and we can examine the effect of its operation on the rate of development of the rural electrification scheme.  The Minister stated here to-day, as he stated in his speech on the Estimate for his Department, that the rate of development under the rural electrification scheme is double what it was two years ago.  He repeated that twice during the debate on the Estimate as if he were claiming some credit for the increase in the rate of rural electrification network construction.  The fact is that the decision to increase the rate of rural electrification was taken in 1953.</P>
    <P>In that year, I met the directors of the E.S.B. and, being satisfied that the excuses previously given by them for the failure to speed up the rate of construction, namely, the scarcity of materials, and to some extent of skilled personnel, no longer held good, I told them that the rate of development had to be raised so that in October of 1953 the rate of construction would increase by 50 per cent.  They <Col N="45" /> were requested to achieve another 50 per cent. in the rate of construction in the year 1954-55.  They conceded, without question, the practicability of expanding the rate of construction in 1954-55 to 100 areas completed in that year, and in their report for that year they stated&mdash;I am quoting from their report, page 68:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is intended to effect a further increase in the course of the coming year bringing the rate of construction to 100 acres per annum.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Why did they not achieve a rate of construction of 100 areas per annum in 1954-55?  Why did they, to the extent of 25 per cent., fail to reach the target which was set for them in 1953, and which in their report for the year 1953-54 they said they would be able to reach?  I suggest that the reason for their failure to complete more than 75 areas in the year 1954-55 was the financial strain put upon them by the Government's failure to pay to them the amounts due in respect of the electrification grant under the terms of the existing legislation.</P>
    <P>I do not know why the Minister stated here on the 21st April that construction was proceeding at the rate of 100 areas per year.  He could not have had before him at that time any information from the E.S.B. except the record of their achievement in 1954-55, and it showed that the rate of development was not 100 areas but 75 areas. In the first quarter of this year 25 areas were completed.  While that may suggest that 100 areas will be completed this year, it does not mean that, because the rate of construction is always much greater in the summer months than in the winter, and if there are to be 100 areas completed in the year 1955-56, then the board will have to do much better in the second summer quarter than it succeeded in doing in the first.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that the slowing down of the rate of development under the rural electrification scheme, and of the board's failure to the extent of 25 per cent. to achieve the target set for them in 1953, a target which they said in that year they could achieve, is due entirely to the financial difficulties <Col N="46" /> occasioned by the action of the Government in withholding the £2,800,000 due to them for the purposes of that scheme.</P>
    <P>The original plan for the rural electrification scheme contemplated that the construction of the network would be completed in ten years.  I remember that when I brought the 1945 Act to the House, I pointed out to the Dáil what a considerable achievement that would be, but, nevertheless, I assured the House that, in consultation with the officers of the board, I was satisfied that once the supply difficulties of the war period passed, a rate of development could be established which would enable the network to be fully completed within the ten years.  Work was begun in 1947.  It is true that in 1947, in 1948, 1949 and 1950, and indeed up to 1952, the rate of development was limited by the supply of materials and not by the plans of the board, but by 1953 that difficulty had passed.  We have got, however, to face the fact to-day that it is eight years since the scheme came into operation and that at the 1954-55 rate of development it will take another six years to finish it. I hope that the Minister's estimate, that the construction of the network will be finished in March, 1959, will prove to be correct.  That will mean that the board will want to do better from this on than they succeeded in doing last year.</P>
    <P>Let us have another examination of the effect of the Government's proposals on the costs of the rural electrification scheme.  The Minister is quite correct in saying that the estimate prepared and published in the White Paper in 1944 indicated that, in order to break level on the costs of constructing the network, the board would have to get back from each area, in annual fixed charge revenue, 12 per cent. of the cost of constructing the network for that area.</P>
    <P>The White Paper was prepared upon the basis of the experience gained in the actual construction of the rural network in four specially selected trial areas.  It was introduced in advance of the preparation of the report in these four areas in different parts of the country and the preparation of the <Col N="47" /> scheme and the planning of the networks were both based upon the experience gained in these four areas. That experience indicated that, if the rate of charge to rural consumers was the board's existing rural tariff rate, it was possible to anticipate that 69 per cent. of rural residents would accept the supply under the scheme.  On that calculation it was, as the Minister has stated, discovered that the fixed charge revenue under the board's rural tariff rate would bring in 9.7 per cent. of the capital cost and that was the reason for the Government's decision to meet the difference by way of free capital grant &mdash; by giving half the capital cost free of interest and repayment of loan charges so that the board would be assured of the 12 per cent. of construction costs in revenue.</P>
    <P>That was the reason that was given at that time.  The Minister purported to-day to explain the considerations which led the Government of the day to decide upon giving this capital grant.  I can talk with authority on that matter, at least, for I was Minister for Industry and Commerce at the time and it was my proposals that were accepted by the Government.  We did not take into account the fact that the board was losing money in 1943 or in the war years as a whole but we did take into account the need to provide an electricity service for as many rural consumers as possible.  We were anxious to raise the percentage of rural residents who would be able to take the supply by keeping the charge for the supply at the lowest possible level. We had regard to the fact that every other country in the world which operates a rural electrification scheme has given a subsidy out of State funds for the development and operation of that scheme.  We knew that the loss which the board was incurring in the war years would easily be remedied when normal supplies of materials became available and normal production was resumed.</P>
    <P>The rural electrification scheme was considered apart from the board's other operations.  It was decided to provide a service which was essential for this country, more essential here <Col N="48" /> than in any other country.  Whatever basis there may be for the contention that the primary cause of emigration is economic there is a secondary cause and that is the absence in the rural areas of the amenities which are generally accepted as the normal features of life in towns.  One of the amenities which we decided to provide for rural residents was an electricity supply and we decided to provide it at a cost to the consumer which it would be within his means to pay.</P>
    <P>The fact is, however, and this is where the Minister's calculations are all wrong, that the board has never succeeded in getting from the rural areas developed under the scheme even the 9.7 per cent. of the cost of constructing the network, the revenue in fixed charges which it assumed it would get.  The annual fixed charge revenue which the board is now obtaining falls short by £500,000 of the revenue it would need to get in in order to reach 9.7 per cent. of the capital cost of construction.  To that extent rural electrification is already being subsidised out of the general funds of the board.  We are not objecting to that but there is a limit and there is a strong objection to making this change upon the unsubstantiated contention that it does not necessarily involve higher charges either to rural consumers of electricity or to consumers generally.</P>
    <P>The information which has been given to the House in reply to parliamentary questions shows that the board must get from its rural consumers exactly double the fixed charge revenue it is now obtaining if it is to avoid loss on the servicing of these areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, yes.  We floated a loan once at 2½ per cent.  We did not control the market conditions then any more than you control them now.  The Minister has stated that my calculations are inaccurate because the board is getting money now at less than 5 per cent. &mdash; he said more than 1 per cent. less.  I do not believe it.  It is an obvious mistake.  On the basis of 5 per cent. interest rate on capital the board has to get double its present fixed revenue rates from each of its areas to avoid losing money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree that we must consider the operations of the board as one unit. The Minister said that he was going to give an assurance to rural consumers that they would not have to pay more for their current.  He might have saved his breath.  The prospect of getting in sufficient money in increased charges from rural consumers is nil.  It just could not be done.  The rural electrification report, which Deputies opposite would be well advised to read again, stated that, even under the board's rural tariff, at the rate of charge which it was proposed to bring into operation, the average farmer would have to pay in fixed charges 80 per cent. more than the occupier of a similarly sized dwelling in a town.  The report goes on to <Col N="50" /> justify the higher fixed charges in the rural areas, having regard to the possibility of the rural consumer using electricity for production purposes which the urban house dweller cannot do, or if he does use electricity for industrial purposes he is charged for it at the industrial rate.</P>
    <P>There could be no possibility of increasing that fixed charge, because, as I pointed out, the board has not yet succeeded in all the rural areas connected to date in getting 69 per cent. of the people to accept supply, the percentage of people which it was assumed would be willing to take supply at that price on the basis of their experience in the four trial areas. Because the number of consumers is less than the 69 per cent. assumed, because of the much higher cost of construction, there has been this failure to get in fixed charged revenue anything like the 9.7 per cent. which was required.  In respect of the areas which were wired in 1954-55, the fixed charge revenue equalled only 6 per cent. of the cost of construction and if one adds in the 2½ per cent. capital subsidy, it is still far short of the revenue required by the board to avoid losses on the scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Deputy made any allowance for the increase in the use of electricity by the individual consumers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been talking entirely about fixed charge revenue. The cost of bringing the supply of electricity to a rural consumer comes under two headings.  There is the cost of building up the network and maintaining the network.  That cost remains the same one year with another no matter what quantity of electricity the individual consumers in that area may take.  The board must, therefore, be sure of getting in its fixed annual charges 12 per cent. of that capital cost of construction irrespective of any rise or fall in the quantity of electricity consumed.  That is why the charge to the rural consumer is in two parts, first the fixed annual sum which he must pay for having the wires brought to his house and then a unit charge in respect of <Col N="51" /> the current consumed.  He pays for the current as he uses it and pays only the amount appropriate to his user.</P>
      <P>If the Minister's assurance to rural consumers was merely that their fixed annual charge would not be increased, then it is worth nothing.  The loss on fixed charges has to be made good by an increase in the cost of current. Somebody will have to pay anyway and it does not matter whether he pays on one side of the account or the other. In my view there is no possibility of getting higher revenue under the rural electrification scheme because if you attempt to increase charges, then the percentage of the people that will accept supply will fall still lower and the economy of the scheme will be still further disorganised.</P>
      <P>The deficiency in the fixed charge revenue of the board is mainly due to the fact that the costs of construction are higher but it is partly due to the board's inability so far to get the 69 per cent. connection in all rural areas on an average.  But if the board does not get the higher revenue, which it must get, from the rural consumers, it must get it in some other way.  Let me indicate again what that higher revenue must be in order to avoid losses upon the rural electrification scheme under the Government's proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The board has got to get an additional £2,000 per year per area in revenue.  If there are 100 additional areas completed in this year, as the Minister anticipates, then the board's revenue must be increased from some source by £200,000.  We have just one half of the scheme completed and under these proposals by the time the scheme is completed the board must get an additional revenue of £1,000,000 a year from some source to make good the additional loss which is now going to be experienced under the rural electrification scheme.  The board's total revenue in 1953-54 was £8,500,000 and the additional sum it has got to get in every year from some source on the completion of the rural electrification scheme under the board's proposals is <Col N="52" /> roughly equivalent to 10 per cent. of this 1953-54 revenue.</P>
    <P>The board must get money somewhere. If it does not get money to make good these losses from the electricity consumers, where is it going to get it?  The expansion of revenue to the extent of £200,000 per year up to an expansion of revenue of £1,000,000 per year to make up increased losses under the rural electrification scheme must necessarily involve an increase in charges to some of the board's consumers. The board's statutory obligation is still to adjust its scale of charges in such a way as to ensure that its total revenue will, one year with another, be equivalent to its total outgoings. Its outgoings will be increased to £1,000,000.  Where does the Minister think it is going to get that £1,000,000 except by increasing the cost of electricity if not to rural consumers then to urban consumers?</P>
    <P>That is an appalling price to ask this country to pay so that the Government could come to the House with a Book of Estimates, show a purely nominal saving and take political credit for it. Surely this country is handicapped already in sufficient degree in its industrial development by the high cost of power?  Some foolish Fine Gael Deputy intervened in a recent discussion on this matter to say that electric power costs less here than in any other European country.  It costs more here than in any other European country. One of the handicaps of our industrial development is the high cost of power. Is this cost to be shoved up still more, by 10 per cent. possibly, so that the Government can make the pretence of having carried out some economy, an economy which ultimately will cost the country a great deal more, as all Coalition economies usually do?</P>
    <P>There was a further suggestion in the Minister's speech on the Estimate on this subject that the board had accumulated reserves somewhere on which it could draw to meet rural electrification losses.  That statement is equally untrue, equally misleading. The board's accounts for the year 1952-53 showed its total capital reserves at £17,873,000.  Is the Minister under the impression that these represent <Col N="53" /> liquid resources which can be used to offset revenue deficiencies? That sum is represented by fixed assets.  Included in that £17,873,000 is this £4,800,000 which the Government is now going to ask the board to repay. That £4,800,000 will now appear as a capital liability of the board and will have to disappear from its capital reserves.  Of the balance of £13,000,000 the board states in its report that it is an accumulated sum made available towards the replacement of fixed assets; the report also stated that of that sum £2,272,000 was utilised to wipe off the cost of plant withdrawn from service.  Is it contemplated that the board is not now to make provision out of its reserves for the replacement of its fixed assets?  The £11,000,000 which will appear in the board's accounts after this £4,800,000 has been deducted from its total capital reserves, and deleting £2,272,000 already used to wipe out plant that is no longer in use, represents 16 per cent. of the total cost of its fixed assets on the 31st March, 1954.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>On the 31st March, 1954 they had capital liability of £65,000,000, sundry creditors, £3,000,000, loans from superannuation funds, £1,600,000, a contingencies reserve of £700,000 and other reserves and provisions, £150,000. That contingencies reserve is in my view inadequate having regard to the report.  Remember that in 1952-53 they had a deficiency in their revenue account of £488,000.  Another repetition of that situation and almost the whole of the contingencies reserve is wiped out.  Their depreciation reserves represent 16 per cent. of the total of their present fixed assets and there is no business firm in the country in operation as long as the board who would consider that they had made proper provision for depreciation if in the end of that period they were only showing a depreciation reserve equivalent to 16 per cent. of their investment in buildings and plant.  It is completely misleading to suggest that the reserves could be made available under any circumstances to meet the losses incurred under the rural electrification scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My interest in this matter is because I believe that this rural electrification scheme was one of the best ideas yet conceived in this country for the improvement of conditions of life in rural Ireland and I do not want to see it sacrificed or slowed down merely to justify a bogus claim by the Government that they have carried out economies.  This is not an economy; it still has to be paid by the people of this country and the effect of all this financial juggling that the Government has adopted is shown in the fact that instead of getting 100 areas completed <Col N="55" /> in 1954-55, only 75 per cent. of that target was realised.  If there is going to be a further diminution in the rate of progress because of this financial manoeuvring by the Government the people of this country are going to pay a very high price for the appearance of an alleged economy in the Government's accounts.</P>
    <P>In any case, the position of the board is not changed; it is still an independent authority set up as such by statute and it is not responsible to the Minister for its charges, or for any decision it may take regarding the rate of development under the rural electrification scheme.  We know the board went in originally to minimise its anticipated losses on rural electrification by picking out for early development those areas in respect of which the revenue from fixed charge was likely to be highest.  That process of determining the order of priority among the areas for development was changed by the board on my persuasion in 1953 when a new method was devised which gave due credit to the percentage of residents in an area willing to take the supply.  If the board is now facing a situation where every additional area that it connects is going to prove an additional loss in its accounts of £2,000 per year the board will obviously be driven back to the policy of giving preference to those areas in respect of which the loss is least and of going slowly in the areas in which the loss is greatest and that will ultimately mean, I am certain, that the number of highly uneconomic areas in the country will not eventually be taken up at all.  At any rate, progress generally is going to slow down.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether this idea of withdrawing the rural electrification grant was conceived in the mind of the Minister for Industry and Commerce and suggested by him to the Minister for Finance or whether it was a bright idea of the Minister for Finance in which the Minister for Industry and Commerce acquiesced.  I feel sure it was the latter.  I think the Minister for Industry and Commerce is defaulting in his obligations and responsibilities in allowing himself to be pushed in <Col N="56" /> this matter by the Department of Finance, anxious to make some show of spurious economies in the Estimates.  I hope eventually that the Minister for Industry and Commerce will summon up the fortitude necessary to resist any further demand of the same kind from his colleague in Finance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make only a few remarks on this matter.  Firstly, I should like to join with Deputy Lemass in his remarks on the importance and the value of rural electrification to our people.  The air is thick these days with the lamentations of so-called experts on the evils of emigration and when we examine the proposals put forward in this House over a number of years to solve the problem of emigration and to make conditions in rural Ireland better for our people, I think we will agree that the greatest Act passed in this House in that respect was that which brought about the rural electrification scheme.  Now, if I felt that there was a danger of slowing down the date of development in rural electrification I would have no hesitation in condemning this Government outside every chapel gate in my constituency. I feel, however, that the Minister is a man who has the interests of the rural people at heart and I am prepared to accept from him the assurance he has given that there will be no slowing down whatever of the rate of development of rural electrification.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with that in a moment.  We all notice in the reports issued by various State and semi-State companies that very often they exceed the targets they originally laid out for themselves, and they then proceed to give themselves a clap on the back for having done so.  We should examine their achievements with caution and we should understand that, when these targets were first laid out, they were deliberately laid out on a very cautious basis, so that at a later stage, if it was found possible to exceed the target, it would be of great advantage to the particular State company to be able to say: &ldquo;Not alone <Col N="57" /> have we achieved the target laid out, but we have actually passed it&rdquo;, when in the beginning, in my opinion, very often the actual target laid down should have been double what they achieved.</P>
      <P>We have had reports by outside experts with regard to the work carried on by the E.S.B., Bord na Móna and other bodies, and we have had reports from American experts who had no bias one way or another and they have described the work of the E.S.B. and Bord na Móna as being painfully slow. I do not want to dwell on the actual benefits conferred on rural areas by the introduction of electricity for the various uses to which it is put, but I can assure the Minister that no other benefit conferred by any Government can compare with the good achieved in the rural areas by this amenity.  It is good not alone in the social sense, but in the economic sense and rather than boast that the rate is not slowing down, the Minister should not accept the target of his predecessor, but should be more than anxious to beat that target during the period for which he holds office.</P>
      <P>I understand from the Minister's opening statement that he expects that the rural electrification scheme will be completed in 1959.  He expects &mdash;I should like the Minister to make sure that the programme will be completed and sewn up by 1959.  We have had the reasons from the former Minister for the delay in getting the scheme going to full capacity.  It was due mainly to lack of material and equipment which was experienced from 1946 until 1951 or 1952.  No such excuse is available at present.  There will be a number of difficulties in the way of the E.S.B. and it is important to remember that many of the areas now left for linking up will be the most difficult areas to deal with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I urge the Minister to ensure that the E.S.B. take into account that many of the areas which yet face them in relation to supply of current will be the hardest areas they will have to face, because many of these areas are the poorest and most backward areas, and consequently there may be many awkward developments ahead of the E.S.B. in that regard.  I would not <Col N="58" /> like to think that any awkward development of this nature could be used as an excuse at a later stage for saying that the scheme had to slow down.  I hold that the withdrawal of subsidy or grant from the rural electrification end of the E.S.B. is going to militate against a further expansion of that programme.</P>
    <P>There is one point in connection with this matter to which I want to refer&mdash;the extra service charge imposed by the E.S.B. in the rural areas. We know that, in the setting up of their programme, specific areas are designed into which current is to be supplied and that houses outside a particular area must pay an extra service charge, if they are to be supplied. I think it is a most unfair system.  Very often, we find two or three houses perhaps in a cluster half a mile away from the designed area, and, just because these unfortunate people are unlucky enough to be that half a mile away, they must pay heavily for the line and poles necessary to bring them within the scheme. I know it from experience in my own county and I am sure that Deputies on all sides will agree with me, having had similar experiences in their own constituencies.</P>
    <P>According to the Constitution, all the people of the country are equal and equal rights should be made available to them, but why should a man just because he is unlucky enough to be outside the particular area laid out in respect of the installation of current, have to pay an extra service charge, when he is perhaps the poorest man in the parish?  There is surely no incentive there to the poor people to take advantage of this very important amenity.  Difficulty has been experienced in many areas in getting a sufficient percentage of people within the defined area to accept supply but much of it is due to the fact that our people are&mdash;I was about to say very backward &mdash; hesitant about signing to take in a supply because they have not experienced the benefits of rural electrification.</P>
    <P>When an area is put to the bottom of the list because the percentage acceptance is not so high, the E.S.B. <Col N="59" /> are acting foolishly, because very often, as I am sure they have found out, it is a wise move to install rural electrification in an area which at first sight appears to be rather hesitant about it, even though the percentage acceptance at the beginning is low, because, within perhaps a week of installation in the area, the other people who up to then have not signified their acceptance will come in in droves.  All they are waiting for is to see it in operation and once they have seen the benefits to their neighbours, there will be no lack of applications for its installation in their own homes.</P>
    <P>I want to impress on the Minister the necessity for getting rid of this extra service charge.  I think a sum of £85,000 was handed back out of the rural electrification programme, and, while not being an expert mathematician, I feel sure that even a sum of £85,000 would go a long way all over the country to remove the extra charge now being imposed on the people who live outside the specified areas to which a supply is to be given and I urge the Minister, by further legislation, if necessary, to ensure that the E.S.B. will be given the power to cut out this extra service charge.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether I would be in order, when this comes to the Committee Stage, in moving an amendment to that effect.  If the Minister shows that he is sympathetic towards removing this hardship from those people who were unlucky enough to be outside the specified areas, I feel it would be unnecessary for me to introduce an amendment.  I can assure him that if he shows that he has no intention of meeting the wishes of the majority of this House in that respect, then amendments will be put in before this measure goes through.</P>

    <P>I do not know whether this Bill divorces the E.S.B. from the State and sets it up as an independent body or whether it makes it a kind of in-and-out, semi-independent body, but subsidised <Col N="60" /> all the time by the State and the State ultimately responsible for its finances.  If that is so, if the ultimate responsibility for the proper running of the electricity supply devolves on the State and the Department of Finance and the Government, there are certain matters to which I wish to draw the attention of the House, that is, the inefficient and wasteful way the E.S.B. is run at present and the incompetence of it.

      <P>I may say that I have drawn the attention of the E.S.B. to <Col N="61" /> the facts that I am going to state here and have drawn it in detail.  I have submitted a long statement to the manager of the E.S.B. about the waste of wire and fittings scattered all over the country with nobody apparently responsible for them, bits of this and that being taken by everybody into their own yards.  I also drew the attention of the management to the fact that they were not putting in proper labour hours in rural electrification in the equipment of the villages and towns.  My county council drew the attention of the E.S.B. to the fact that there were nights last winter when there were no lights in the rural towns.  We also drew the attention of the E.S.B. to the fact that when places like Mullingar are lit up for fairs early in the morning, the lights are left on all the day.</P>
      <P>If that is the pattern that we are to have in the future, it is a terrible waste of money to make the board into a quasi-private company and invite the public to subscribe millions of pounds to carry it on in this way.  We should hesitate about giving that power to the board until they mend their hand and run their business as an ordinary business would be run. Ordinary business, if it is not run rightly, ends in the bankruptcy court; but this company, if it is not run rightly, comes to the Exchequer and saves itself every time.  I avail myself of this opportunity to draw the attention of the House&mdash;as I have done already privately to the E.S.B. on more than one occasion&mdash;to the facts I am stating here now and which I stand over.  The Minister and the Government should examine the whole thing. I am not going to annoy the Minister, as he seems not ready to receive any detailed complaints.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has posed a problem to the public in relation to the E.S.B. service that has left everyone puzzled particularly in my constituency.  I cannot give the detail that Deputy Kennedy has given about wasteful practices, but perhaps the Minister would take note of them and pass them on, with a recommendation that the money saved in the elimination of these wasteful practices might very easily and very usefully be utilised to solve the problem Deputy McQuillan has mentioned.  That is a very real problem in my constituency and I take it that it is a general experience in our rural areas.</P>
      <P>Why should the E.S.B. go into an area and erect poles&mdash;where they are satisfied that the houses are sufficiently numerous or, if they are not, that the potential consumption is sufficient, to warrant connecting them&mdash;and leave a cluster of houses out for attention at a later stage?  Is it suggested that the E.S.B. is going to save money by taking away its entire equipment, men and plant when it has its present programme done and in a year's time bringing back all that paraphernalia again to do these clusters now excepted?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely the E.S.B., being a big public utility, ought to take somewhat the same view as an ordinary public authority&mdash;which does not make any <Col N="63" /> profits, just the same as the E.S.B. is supposed not to do?  That public authority, when it comes with a water supply, will run it along the road.  They will not compel beforehand a given number of potential users to sign along the dotted line.  They will supply the service and let the public bring it into their houses if they choose but, in any event, it will be made available at sufficiently convenient points by way of pumps.  I know you cannot pump electricity but I do suggest that, if the E.S.B. has gone into a district and if there are in that district a number of spurs which, on their present calculations, it would be uneconomic to connect, it is merely a case of adjusting the point of view in consideration of what they say themselves they eventually intend to do, namely, to come back again, having first cleared out bag and baggage.  Taking what they are now doing and what they propose to do eventually as one operation in respect of the district to be served, I take it that it is a far more uneconomic proposition to do what they are doing now than it would be to put down the essential connecting services now that they are on the spot with their trucks, men and all the other equipment that they have transported into the area, to finish the area even if all the householders in that district will not connect up immediately.</P>
    <P>That is the point that Deputy McQuillan was making.  That is the point that every Deputy representing a rural area would make because that is the common experience of all of us.</P>
    <P>At the moment the public are puzzled with regard to finances.  The Minister suggests, by the way in which he has informed the public of the withdrawal of the subsidy, that the E.S.B. in fact had too much money and that they asked him to deprive them of some of it and that the Minister took the board at their word.  The puzzle enters into the matter in those districts where the people are being denied the service unless they pay down an extra, special and very heavy charge to get the poles into the villages.  They ask Deputies, if the E.S.B. are complaining that they have too much money, that their income is surplus to what the <Col N="64" /> legislation permits them to have, why, in the name of common sense, will they not use this surplus money to serve people who cannot pay these heavy charges.  These people maintain that they do not have to pay extra charges for water and so on and they ask why should the E.S.B. treat them differently from the way in which they are treated by other public utilities, whether under statutory bodies, elected bodies such as county councils or urban councils and corporations.  These people further suggest that, if the board have a surplus, the people who are paying these very heavy extra charges beyond what the ordinary consumer has to pay have in fact contributed very considerably to that surplus of which the board seem to complain.</P>
    <P>I do not want to say any more on this matter.  This is the aspect of it that agitates me and the people whom I represent.  I have put the matter sufficiently clearly to the Minister for him to be able to transmit to the board a real and very genuine grievance.  These people say that they are being mulcted to create the surplus of which the board, apparently, are complaining.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to protest strongly against the special charges that the E.S.B. are making in respect of a number of people in my constituency. Quite recently I put down a question in the House about these extra, special charges.  I maintain that these charges are totally against the spirit of the Rural Electrification Act. It is completely wrong.  I go further and say that these people should be refunded the money that they have been charged by way of special charges and that they should be put on the same basis of charge as applies in the case of other people who have availed of rural electrification.  This discrimination is unfair and, as I have said, it is diametrically opposed to the spirit of the Rural Electrification Act that John Murphy will have his light at a reduced rate while Peter Murphy, merely because he was unlucky enough not to be connected by the E.S.B. when they were formerly supplying the area, must pay the special charge in perpetuity and that his children and grandchildren will have to pay it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="65" /> In the drafting of the Rural Electrification Act, the then Minister, Deputy Lemass, did not envisage any such extra charge.  The idea in the Dáil at that time was that it was one of the finest pieces of legislation ever enacted and that it would give electricity to the people of rural Ireland at a reasonable cost, subsidised by the Dáil.</P>
    <P>Now, there is this vicious practice. Certain people in my constituency are affected.  I do not want to go into details, which would take up the time of the House.  I have made representations to the E.S.B.  I have asked questions in the House and got the usual stock reply, that the Minister could not interfere with the administration of the E.S.B.  This is the only opportunity I have of raising the matter.</P>
    <P>I do not think that Deputy Lemass or any of us who supported him at that time envisaged any such practice being adopted by the E.S.B.  If there is to be equal treatment for all classes of our people we should see that not alone do we appear to be just but that we are just in every respect.</P>
    <P>I do not blame the present Minister for this particular state of affairs one way or the other, but I do want to point out that a vicious practice has grown up in the administration of the Rural Electrification Act.  I regard it as a vicious and unjust practice.  In County Dublin I could pick out 20 groups of people who narrowly missed being included in the area arranged by the E.S.B. when they were connecting the area.  I cannot believe, nor can any Deputy believe, that the Rural Electrification Act was intended to be used to penalise people.  If the E.S.B., last year, had all the surplus money that they were supposed to have, why do they not refund the special charges which they demanded from these people over a period?  I suggest that they should refund it now.  I have read the Rural Electrification Act as first introduced to see if there was any section in it that would permit the board to make these extra, special charges. There is not one line in the Act giving them permission to do that.  They could give some excuse at one time, but last year they stated that they had <Col N="66" /> money over and there is no further justification.</P>
    <P>I would like to see this Bill amended.  I would like to see those people who had to meet extra charges, even though they were within the rural electrification network, getting a refund of those extra charges immediately or as soon as legislation to that effect can be introduced here.  I press very hard for that because I think this is something which is wrong in principle and should never have been adopted.  It is against the spirit of the Act.  It is an injustice on certain sections of our community who are not in a position to defend themselves and are solely dependent on our defence of them here.  I wonder what would be said if the same policy was adopted in connection with water charges, sewerage and the other amenities of which our people avail.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill is to facilitate our people in the rural areas. Unfortunately, somebody saw in this an opportunity for making special charges and now the present Minister states that the E.S.B. is able to carry on under its own steam, and so the glaring injustice continues day after day.  If this is permitted the possibility is that we shall find ourselves up against more glaring injustices in the future.  That is one of the points I want to make here and until the present position is rectified I will take every opportunity of pressing that point.  I see no reason why certain people should have to pay special charges for a service that their nextdoor neighbours receive at a lower rate.  I hope the Minister will take cognisance of that point.</P>

      <P>Deputy McQuillan has made the rather interesting suggestion that if we had amendments on the Committee Stage of this Bill we might be able to get more closely to grips with the problems associated with electricity development, and particularly with the problems associated with rural electrification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a source of some satisfaction to find that the Minister for Industry and Commerce is able to do duty for the <Col N="67" /> Minister for Finance.  As the Minister for Finance has not intervened in this debate, it has fallen to the Tánaiste and Minister for Industry and Commerce to give the best account possible and he certainly has not let down the Minister for Finance, so to speak, in his treatment of the case for this Bill. It seems to me somewhat unusual perhaps that in this particular conjunction it is the Tánaiste and Minister for Industry and Commerce who is defending the withdrawal of a subsidy. Generally, he is advocating here and elsewhere throughout the country the extension of subsidies.  Of course, all subsidies, as the present Minister for Agriculture reminded us on a celebrated occasion, have to be paid for, presumably by the taxpayer if not by the consumer.  With regard to the general programme of electrical development the present Minister for Industry and Commerce and his predecessor, Deputy Lemass, are in a very fortunate position because on an occasion like this they can from their special knowledge treat of the problems in a way that is not possible to other members of this House.</P>
    <P>We have, too, the interesting situation that this seems to be the only occasion, as the Chair has admitted, when the general work of the E.S.B. can be discussed.  One would imagine from the Minister's attitude in relation to Deputy Kennedy's interpolation that this House was assembled for the sole purpose of according to the E.S.B., or any other State body, through the appropriate Minister of the day, whatever funds the board seeks and once the Minister for Finance, together with the Minister for Industry and Commerce, are satisfied, then presumably all that is necessary is that the Minister should come in here and state the requirements.  The question arises, however, whether in the event of losses arising from the operations of such a body as the E.S.B. it is the community at large or the consuming public using electricity who will have to bear the loss and whether, if profits are accruing, it is the community in general that will benefit or the consumers of the commodity.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="68" /> One can understand the anxiety of the Government, through the Minister for Finance, to escape any liabilities it possibly can.  According to the Minister's opening statement it was the present Administration when they were in office on a former occasion which was responsible for transferring some of these obligations on to a refunding basis through the medium of which the annuity, the loss which would otherwise have had to be met, was put on a terminable annuity basis. I think the Minister mentioned a figure of £2,000,000 repayable over 20 years. Steps have been taken apparently to endeavour to relieve the Exchequer.  I often wonder whether in the case of the particular device known as the terminable annuity what, in fact, is the amount of the actual relief to the taxpayer when he has to pay the interest charges and sinking fund on such an annuity for such a long period as 20 years.  It seems an extraordinary way of financing a corporation which is supplying the public with a commodity which is in daily use in so many thousands of households.</P>
    <P>The point has been made, and I think most people will agree with it, that while there may be something in the Minister's argument that the conditions obtaining in 1943, which were in the minds of the Administration of that day when they were making the arrangements in connection with the subsidy for rural electrification, may not be entirely applicable to the present time.  Nevertheless, it is quite obvious that this is an endeavour on the part of the Exchequer to rid itself of the obligation in so far as that is possible which they at present have to bear for rural electrical development. The case has not been made here and could not, I think, be made unless a committee of this House had an opportunity of going into the matter in detail with members of the board to satisfy themselves, as to whether, in fact, the position is such that rural electrification has been so successful that we can apparently look forward to a progressive increase in revenue arising from further expansion.</P>
    <P>We have no information from the board.  No White Paper has been <Col N="69" /> supplied with regard to the success of rural electrical development up to the present time although we are being asked to provide capital to the extent of £9,000,000.  In addition to what the board have unexpended in their present limit of £2.4 million, the Minister has stated that a further £11.4 million is likely to be required up to 1958.  The Tánaiste has stated that a further £11.4 million is likely to be required up to 1958.  The House has no information from the board.  As Deputy Lemass said, perhaps the exigencies of the Ministers who are anxious to get their holidays as soon as possible may have rendered it necessary to rush this legislation through, but I think it should have been possible in the event of the printed report not being available to members of the House to supply them with the main figures.</P>
    <P>I must say that unless one had responsibility either for the Department of Finance or the Department of Industry and Commerce it would be difficult to get very much material in the accounts that are published as appendices to this report, but I think that where capital requirements to the extent of many millions of pounds have been sought, at least&mdash;whether we are going to have any further procedure in the way of examination of the affairs of this board by special committees or otherwise&mdash;I think we are entitled to get the fullest information.</P>
    <P>It may be that it has not been the procedure in the past for specific memoranda supplied to the Minister by the board to be circulated to members of the House, but we are in the position really, that we are completely dependent for our information on what the Tánaiste said in introducing the debate here this afternoon.</P>
    <P>In regard to certain of the Gaeltacht areas the board seemed to be flatly of opinion some years ago that they were so completely uneconomic that they just could not extend the supply to them.  We all know that there must be a limit to what can be done.  We have always been told that certain things are completely uneconomic, but we have not heard anything about <Col N="70" /> that recently although some years ago we heard that the board had grave doubts about very many things which are now being done and for which a great deal of kudos is being sought and a great deal of publicity secured. That was not with regard to the extension of electricity into particular areas.  That was in regard to the generation of electricity from native fuel.</P>
    <P>I think it would have been a fair demand from the Minister to the board, without interfering with them unduly, to ask that over a period of years they should try as between one year and another to balance in each year the less economic areas with the better areas so that they would not be in the position&mdash;which I fear may be the case &mdash;that some of the least economic areas, a major proportion of these, may be left to the end of the programme. If that is so, it lends point to Deputy Lemass's argument that the present position with regard to revenue or the present percentage of return on the charges may not be the position when the final account is being made out.</P>
    <P>It is a well-known fact that current has been refused in the hearts of certain areas and that isolated households have been left out because of the cost of connection.  Whether later on the board will be able to say that they are able to connect these up with the rest possibly depends on the individual case.  But the general question is whether at the latter end of the programme the board will not have a larger number than they had at the beginning of areas that are less economic and that the less densely populated areas will also figure more in the final stages of the programme.  It is most likely, I think, in all these circumstances, that the final years of the rural electrification programme will be less economic and that the areas that will have to be done in the future may be described as more uneconomic.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste, in connection with the reference to terminating the subsidy in this particular case, advanced the axiom&mdash;which is rather a new one for the Tánaiste&mdash;that it would be better&mdash;<Col N="71" /> I understood him to say, though these may not be his exact words&mdash;for the consumers to forgo a small reduction in the price of electricity rather than that they should have to bear the taxes to meet the costs which would otherwise arise.  The question, therefore, that we would like to ask&mdash;and if the Chairman of the E.S.B. were here I am sure it is one of the first questions he would be asked&mdash;is whether, in fact, if the present measure does not mean an actual increase in charges at some time in the future that, at any rate, it may mean, as the Tánaiste's reference might seem to indicate, that some reduction which might have been possible to the consumers of electricity, would not be given.  If we are to believe what the Tánaiste has told us about the very flourishing condition of the undertaking, one would imagine that it is the consumers who would be the first to benefit from that prosperity after the fixed charges and obligations have been met.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste told us that the accounts&mdash;I take it they were for the last year&mdash;are such that the Government is satisfied that all the liabilities can be taken over by the E.S.B.; that not only would they be able to pay the subsidy for rural electrification but that they would have a surplus. Where, may one ask, does the consumer come in if there had been a surplus? Is it likely that the Tánaiste will have any good word in connection with the rising cost of living in which he used to be so interested in the past? Would he tell the housewife he was happy to be able to inform her that there was a likelihood of a reduction sometime in the near future in regard to her electricity bill?</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste seemed to suggest, in an exchange with Deputy Lemass, that the Exchequer was actually lending money to the E.S.B. at a less rate than they were borrowing.  He spoke of Deputy MacEntee losing the ship for the ha'porth of tar.  Of course, we have to take all the circumstances into consideration. I suppose, unless the Tánaiste were Minister for Finance, he would never see the problem and, <Col N="72" /> perhaps, even then he would not be likely, having a different approach from Deputy MacEntee, to see it from Deputy MacEntee's point of view.</P>
    <P>If we are enjoying a boom here largely as a result of conditions across the water it may be that, when the E.S.B. go to the country, they will be able to get money somewhat cheaper. Deputy MacEntee may be able to give some more information on that point. I am rather doubtful whether it is likely that interest charges, with the creeping inflation we are told is there all the time, are likely to recede but there, again, I am sure if the Tánaiste has any good words he will say them.</P>
    <P>We remember when the Tánaiste was to take over the national credit of the country.  The former Deputy, now Senator, Hickey and himself were to see that everything was made available for capital and other requirements at very little charge&mdash;in fact, at no charge at all.  All you wanted presumably was the necessary machinery to produce the pounds.</P>
    <P>I should like to know what the Tánaiste's reply will be to the point raised by Deputy Lemass that we can scarcely be satisfied that the position is never likely to arise again when the board may be faced with a loss due to some emergency condition but, leaving out the emergency condition altogether, there is the cost of the provision and the price of fuel.  It was pointed out that in the year 1953 there was a loss.  If during the year ending 31st March, 1954, which is the only year about which we have up-to-date information, and the year ended 31st March, 1955, the board got on so well that it was able to build up very large reserves, according to the Tánaiste, and is to be asked not alone to assume liability for the subsidy for rural electrification in the future but also to assume the past liabilities, one has a right to ask whether it is the opinion of the board that the position during the past two years&mdash;the last year was very much better, as the Tánaiste said, than any heretofore&mdash;is likely to continue and whether they have made allowances for the fuel situation and for any other circumstances that might militate against big profits?</P>
    <P>The contingency fund they have built <Col N="73" /> up is not a very large one having regard to the size of the undertaking.  I take it that some share of the pension liability in the future will fall upon the revenue of the board.  If the superannuation scheme is entirely self-supporting that, of course, means that there is no obligation.</P>
    <P>The total reserves are not out of proportion&mdash;in fact, I think they are scarcely adequate having regard to the size of the undertaking.  Because of the fact that it is so widely scattered, that it is subject to accidents of storm, breakdown and so on, no one can say what the trend or the position may be or what further heavy capital expenditure may be required in years to come. The Tánaiste suggested in his opening statement that, when this Bill goes through, we are not likely to hear from the board again.  That is to say, they will not come to this House again looking for a further extension of the limit of their finances.  In any case, I think he mentioned the year 1959 and that we could let the situation develop until 1959 conscious that the programme of rural electrification had been accelerated and that by that year it would have been completed.  But it is rather a long time and there is no other machinery available to members of the House by which they can get information regarding the board's undertakings, the programmes they have in mind and have at present in operation. There is no other method by which we can get information as to how in actual fact the rural electrification policy is working out, what the percentage of loss is on particular schemes, at what point a scheme becomes completely uneconomic, and whether the small increase in the percentage of those taking the electricity&mdash;from 60 per cent. some years ago to 69 per cent.&mdash;is more than compensation for the additional costs of extending the scheme further into more remote and less economic areas.  All these are points about which we have no information.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>If a stranger were to walk into this House the first and most remarkable fact which would strike him and press upon his vision would be, I think, the <Col N="74" /> vast desert of benches that would normally be occupied by members of the Labour Party and the Clann na Talmhan Party.  I think that is something which we ought to call attention to because these two Parties purport to represent the interests which will be most vitally affected by this Bill, and yet they are not here even to hear the Tánaiste defend the Bill, and they are not here even to make a protest on behalf of the special interests which they represent and which will be most directly affected by the Bill.  One can only say that they have been forcibly fed with it in committee: they are fed up with this Bill, they have got a surfeit of it and dare not come in here to reply to the criticisms which can very properly be directed against it.</P>
      <P>We have outside this House bodies which pretend to represent public opinion.  When the price of bacon goes up or comes down, when there is any alteration made in the price of any day to day commodity, these organisations become very vocal.  There is, for instance, the Housewives' Association, and there is the Association of Irish Industries, and yet here is a Bill which affects all of us whether we are householders, whether we are employers, or whether we are employees, whether we are trying to make things or grow things in this country.  I have not seen &mdash;at least I may not have read the papers with sufficient care&mdash;any examination of the effect of this Bill upon any one of the interests which are vitally concerned with it.</P>
      <P>Normally I would not intervene in a debate of this sort, but I think we should try to see what is going to be the effect of this Bill upon the cost of living, what is going to be the effect of this Bill on production costs in industry and on distribution costs, what is going to be the effect of it on the worker and the labourer, what is going to be the effect of it on the housewives, and what is going to be the effect of it in every household in which electricity is used for lighting, cooking or cleaning, whether that household be the household of a labourer, a shopkeeper, a farmer or a manufacturer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it indicates an appalling <Col N="75" /> apathy on the part of the public, and particularly of those organisations which pretend to represent special interests in this country, that this Bill should be allowed to have reached this stage of debate in the House without any particular attention being directed to it.  The whole time of this House, for days on end, was occupied by a Bill which is designed to do the impossible: to curb the ordinary human desire to make easy money but which does not affect anything so far as the economic life of the country is concerned, a Bill which will not affect by one iota the money which goes out of one pocket and into another, and which is probably spent wisely or unwisely in buying things; but here is a Bill which is going to affect the cost of everything that is grown and of everything that is made in this country, which is going to affect the cost of everything that is sold in this country whether it is made here or grown here or is imported.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am, because the main purpose of this Bill, which has been very carefully concealed, is to compel the E.S.B. to raise the charges on consumers of electricity: on the man, for instance, who uses electricity in his workshop, on the man who uses electricity to light his business premises, on the person who uses electricity in the home for cooking or in a vacuum cleaner, a washing machine, or an iron.  This Bill, let me repeat, affects every user of electricity in this country no matter in what capacity he or she may use it.  The whole purpose of the Bill is to compel the E.S.B. to raise the charges on the consumer, and, incidentally, to slow down rural electrification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have, in this House, Deputies who purport to represent the special interests of farmers, and particularly the special interests of farmers in isolated areas.  What classes was the rural electrification designed to benefit most?  Surely those who are living in these isolated areas, the small farmer and the housewife.  There was a social purpose behind the rural electrification <Col N="76" /> scheme.  It was to provide for those who dwell in our rural areas, for those who are the backbone of our economy; it was an endeavour to provide for them some of the amenities which are enjoyed by those who live in our cities.</P>
    <P>That is why the scheme is uneconomic. Rural electrification can never be carried out on the basis that the revenue derived from the units of electricity sold in the rural areas will cover all the charges arising in bringing an electricity supply to rural areas. That is why, when the Fianna Fáil Government introduced this scheme, I had to come here to this House to secure a modification of the then existing Supply Acts&mdash;to enable the E.S.B. to sell electricity at a loss in rural areas because, under the Acts as originally devised by the present Attorney-General, the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy McGilligan, the E.S.B. could not sell electricity unless the full cost of that electricity was recovered by the charges made on the consumer.</P>
    <P>The reason why we have had to subsidise rural electrification is because in this country, in no conceivable circumstances, would it be possible to supply electricity to the ordinary dweller in the country districts at a price which he could pay.  Therefore, we had to decide that, as there were social advantages to be derived from an extension of the electricity supply network to the rural areas, as it was our purpose to try and induce people to remain on the land and to work on the land and as it was our purpose to enable them to produce at the lowest possible cost, it was therefore advantageous to supply them with a ready, easy and convenient source of power for use in their agricultural industry and we had to ask that this charge should not be borne by the general body of electricity users but should be borne by the community as a whole.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the same thing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is not the same thing, and that is just the point, because not everybody in this country takes his electricity from the E.S.B. There are people who still are in a <Col N="77" /> position to supply electricity out of their own resources for themselves. There are others who have not the advantage of being able to take their requirements from the public electrical undertaking.  Therefore, we said, just as it was found necessary during the war to grant subsidies for several purposes, that because there is a social purpose behind rural electrification it is proper that the Government should contribute some part of the cost of that scheme.  Mark what I have said, some part of the cost of that scheme, not the whole cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>You mean the taxpayer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the taxpayer. We said some part of the cost and the cost I gather is in the order of £1,000,000 a year but the total amount paid in subsidy is not of the order of £1,000,000 a year but just about half that sum.  We have now the position that the ordinary consumer of electricity, the general body of users, are providing half the cost of the subsidy and the Government is providing the other half.  I could not think of a more equitable distribution as between the two interests as that is.  There are still people who long ago paid their share of the capital cost of the plant and the network and who are still paying. There are people in this country using electricity for 40 or 50 years and they are still paying as if they had just come on the network as new consumers this year.  They are subsidising, to an even greater degree than the average consumer, the supply of electricity in rural areas.  We do not quarrel with that because in these things there has to be a degree of give and take.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was the policy of the Government when setting up the rural electrification scheme to see that the most good was done to the greatest possible number and therefore it is unfair and unjust that the whole burden of providing electricity for these rural areas should now be transferred to the shoulders of the ordinary consumers of electricity who live in Dublin, Cork or any one of the other towns and villages where electricity has been an economic proposition almost from the start. <Col N="78" /> That is the purpose of this Bill.  That is what this Bill is going to do.  It is going to compel the E.S.B. to raise its charges to the ordinary general consumer in order that the board may pay the capital cost and interest of the network which it has already erected and erected under a pledge given by the Government that the Government would contribute a substantial moiety of that capital cost and those interest charges.  That is the purpose of the Bill.  Certainly then, the effect of the Bill will be to increase the charges to users of electricity very substantially.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes and I will show you how substantially.  The Deputy has apparently not considered this matter very carefully.  It will increase the charges very considerably in the future and it will slow down the progress of rural electrification in this country.  Are those Deputies who are supporting the Tánaiste in favour of that?  Do they think that our farmers are as well equipped as those in Belgium and Holland in regard to the supply of power?  I do not think they are&mdash;not by a long way.  It is one of the great handicaps under which our agricultural industry labours that our competitors, the Danes, the Dutch and the Belgians, who have as ready access to the British market as we have, have cheaper transport and cheaper electricity and cheaper fertilisers.  One of the purposes of this Bill is to add an additional handicap to the efforts of the Irish farmer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I apologise to the Tánaiste that I was not able to be here to listen to his speech, but I gather that he suggested that the E.S.B. is rolling in money and that in the year 1953-54, it made £233,000 and that this year the surplus will be much more.  Who is entitled to the benefit of that surplus? The original Act laid down that the board should so regulate its charges as merely to cover its outgoings and to make provision for contingencies and reserves.  I think the board must be far-sighted and prudent in these matters because if an accident happened, and there is no safeguard <Col N="79" /> against a catastrophic failure in relation to any of these big public undertakings, if a dam was to fail what position would the board be in?  We know that these accidents can happen and in that event the board would find itself the loser to the extent of millions of pounds.</P>

If that were to happen the reserves of the board, which are large and ample, would probably cover it, but they would not be found disproportionate to the risk that could then be run. I am not suggesting that there is any likelihood that we should have such a catastrophic failure in this country but it has happened elsewhere and what has happened elsewhere might happen here.</P>

It is not so many years ago since an accident did happen on the Shannon scheme when an embankment began to give way.  It just shows you the dangers that the E.S.B. has to provide against and the point I am making is that it is not fair to the board or to this House or to the taxpayer and to the consumer to expect the board to run on its bare poles, as it were.  The board must have a lot of reserves and there is no use in coming to this House and saying that the board made £233,000 for the year ending 31st March, 1954, and that it will make much more for the year just passed.  Those were two exceptional years.  We had entirely abnormal rainfall for this country in those years and I remember when we had abnormally dry years in this country.  I remember when we had abnormally dry years and when in 1934 and 1935 we had actually to try to retain some ships to use their engines as prime movers to generate electricity to make good the deficiency <Col N="80" /> in the water from the Shannon.

Do not use the Tánaiste as a mouthpiece.  The Deputy has shown he can vocalise on occasions in this House.  Let him stand up and refute what I am saying if he can.  If the Deputy can do so and convince me that he is right and I am wrong, I shall be able to admit that he has a better understanding of this problem than I have, but I do not think he has.  I may be conceited and I may be self-opinionated but I do not think he has.</P>
      <P>Let us try to get back to this question. I was pointing out that 1953-54 and 1954-55 were two abnormal years in this country, years when there was altogether abnormal rainfall, a phenomenal rainfall, as they said, something which did not occur for a great many years.  Naturally the farmers were not able to take much advantage of the rain but the E.S.B. were and they had a very heavy surplus in 1953-54, amounting to £233,000.  I have not got any later figures than those but I gather the year which ended on the 31st March last will probably show even better figures.  So far so good, two good years.  In one year the E.S.B. made £233,000; the following year it may even have made more.  But what about the year before 1953-54?  In the year which ended on the 31st March, 1953, the E.S.B. did not make any money at all.  It did not make £233,000 but lost nearly £500,000. To be exact, it lost according to the board's own figures, £488,000.  That is the deficiency which the board's accounts showed for the year ended 31st March, 1952.</P>

      <P>In the year ending <Col N="82" /> 31st March, 1953, the E.S.B. lost £488,000.  That is almost £500,000, more than twice what the board made the following year and almost as much as I gather the board made in the year which ended on the 31st March of this year.  What about the year before?  In case anyone thinks that these were exceptional years let us take the year before.  For the year which ended on 31st March, 1952, the board did not make a profit of £500,000, or of £200,000 or of even £1,000.  The board just broke even with a profit of £962&mdash;a profit of £962 derived from sales amounting to £6,500,000.  That is what happened to the board in 1952 and on the basis of those figures there is no justification whatsoever for what the Tánaiste is proposing to do now because the inevitable effect of this Bill, on the basis of the figures which I have quoted, will be to compel, as I have said already, the E.S.B. to raise charges to the consumer.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Expanding sales do not matter if the cost of fuel is going up and it is going up.  The Deputy cannot teach me anything about economics in relation to the E.S.B. and he may make up his mind about that. However, that is not germane to the debate.  There is something very peculiar about the reports as they have been presented to us.  We have here figures which show the average number of units sold, the average price in pence per unit sold, the total number of consumers, the revenue derived from sales to those consumers and the proportion which sales users of industrial power bear to the whole.  Therefore, looking at it roughly&mdash;and I am speaking very roughly&mdash;I would say the number of units sold to the users of industrial power amounts to about 30 per cent. of the total sales of the E.S.B.  Let us consider that just for a moment.  Under this Bill the whole cost of the subsidy which has heretofore been paid to the E.S.B. for expanding the rural electrification network will fall on the consumers of electricity as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have no figures&mdash;and that is the significant omission from these <Col N="83" /> accounts&mdash;showing what revenue is derived by the board from sales of motive power, and therefore we are not in a position to calculate what would be the average price to the manufacturer, to the industrial user of electricity; we are not in a position to calculate what the average price per unit for electricity is to the industrial user.  Of course we can make a rough and ready shot. We know from experience, at any rate, that electricity costs the industrial user between 2d. and 3d. a unit.  A great number of factors enter into what the final price will be, but it is within that range of 2d. to 3d. per unit.  Therefore everyone engaged in industry and who uses a great deal of electricity for power purposes can judge what the position is.</P>
    <P>What is the position in Great Britain? The position is that on the average the British manufacturer pays only 1d. per unit for his electricity supply. Therefore he is to that extent in a very much better position than the Irish industrialist must be, than the Irish industrialist is.  That is bad enough, but what is going to be the position if this Bill is passed?  It is not possible to make anything like an exact calculation, but if the £500,000 which the Government heretofore has been finding for the purposes of rural electrification is now to be passed on to the general consumer the effect of it will be, I think, to increase the cost of electricity to the industrial user by ? of 1d., and it is going to put him under a very severe handicap as compared with, say, his counterpart on the other side of the Irish Sea.</P>
    <P>It is certainly going to be the last straw which will prevent him from getting any sort of foothold on any export market for his products.  We have established a concern for the special purpose of trying to develop Irish industrial exports.  It was originally designed to try and exploit the American market and to sell our produce for dollars but was subsequently widened to embrace the whole earth, and here the Minister tells us about the future of the Shannon which they were decrying six or eight years ago and about the efforts to develop <Col N="84" /> Irish industry and to find markets abroad for our produce.</P>
    <P>Here we have a Bill the only purpose of which is to load the dice more heavily against the Irish manufacturer. Despite the fact that we have two or three organisations supposedly looking after the interests of the Irish manufacturer, there has not been one of them assigned to examine this Bill or express an opinion as to what the likely effects of it would be in so far as Irish industry is concerned.  But any manufacturer who reads this Bill and looks at the accounts, and looks at his own accounts from the E.S.B., can form a very shrewd idea of how much it is going to cost him year in, year out, if the Bill is passed.</P>
    <P>Let nobody think it is going to be the manufacturer only who will be affected by this Bill.  As I have already said the shopkeeper is going to be affected, the farmer is going to be affected, the employee as well as the employer is going to be affected.  There is not a household in this country using electricity that is not going to be compelled by this Bill to pay more for electricity than they have been paying heretofore.  It is not the only contingency which they may have to contend with because if the cost of fuel and other costs go up they will have to pay more again for their electricity because if wages and fuel go up, naturally, under the terms of the Act, the E.S.B. will have to pass these charges on to the consumers.</P>
    <P>That is inevitable under the terms of the E.S.B. covenant with the Government and the people.  But this Bill is gratuitous and unnecessary&mdash; something which cannot be explained. After all the Minister and his Party are the people who set themselves up as wanting to raise the standards of the worker.  The Minister and his Party were the people who said that the whole purpose of their political life was to raise the standard of living of the worker.  Is it going to raise the worker's standard of living to be asked to pay ? of 1d. or perhaps a farthing more for his electricity &mdash;for the electricity he uses for heat, for cooking, if his wife has an iron, if the family has a radiator in a bedroom or if the family has a clothes washer <Col N="85" /> worked by electricity?  Is it going to raise their standard of living to compel them to pay more for this electricity as the Bill proposes?  The Minister for Industry and Commerce knows the effects of the Bill and there is no use in piping down about it because he will not be allowed to do so.</P>
    <P>Neither is there any use in the Labour Party boycotting the debate by absenting themselves from the House nor for the Party which set themselves up as representing the farmers being conspicuous by their absence also, because there are 400,000 users of electricity in this country and every one of them will be adversely affected by this Bill.  They are more numerous&mdash; and the Minister, a good politician, knows this&mdash;than the old age pensioners and he may have given something to the old age pensioners.  But do not forget that he is taking £500,000 a year at least out of the pockets of the consumers and the users of electricity in this country.  He is not going to be allowed to forget that and we will not allow him to forget it either.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>If anybody listening to Deputy MacEntee believes about 10 per cent. of what he said, the only obvious course for him is to get out of the country immediately because Deputy MacEntee has forecast more gloom and misery here in the course of his three-quarter hour speech than I have ever heard from any one dejected Deputy.  He was in his most Cassandra-like mood this evening.  Whatever about any other part of the world, according to Deputy MacEntee this country was certainly racing to its abysmal end.  The poor Deputy was haunted, while speaking, about shortages of water at one stage and the bursting of the Shannon banks at another stage.  In his daft creation he continued to chill his own blood and if the Deputy got any consolation out of that physical exercise I do not suppose the House will begrudge it to him.  But the mistake the House and the country could make would be to take seriously what Deputy MacEntee said, because quite clearly his effort this evening was nothing but a tenth-rate pantomime <Col N="86" /> show which deceives nobody, particularly anybody who knows Deputy MacEntee.</P>
      <P>But I want to get down to the facts of the Bill now before the House.  Here are the plain facts of the situation and of the issues involved.  I think this is the starting point of the discussion or the starting point of our approach to the problem: is the E.S.B. to be as far as possible a self-supporting organisation or is it to be self-supporting in respect of three-quarters of its activities and even be entitled to earn a surplus in that field while in respect of the other quarter of its activities it gets a subsidy from the ordinary taxpayer, even though in respect of the other 75 per cent. it needs no subsidy and has a surplus that could more than meet what is necessary to make it solvent in respect of the other 25 per cent. of its activities?</P>
      <P>Deputy Lemass said frankly that he had no objection in principle to the E.S.B. being regarded as a body which was quite entitled to balance its budget, as a single organisation.  The only question he asked was: what is the best way of doing it?  He took one view and this Bill takes another view.  The simple position is that, when this original rural electrification scheme was first conceived, it was conceived by people who had no previous experience of rural electrification, and the plan for giving effect to it was worked out by a Government which had no previous experience of rural electrification.  In a very large measure, because of the absence of previous experience, it was a case of giving hostages to fortune to see how things would work out.  The scheme has been in operation since 1947 and we are entitled in 1955 to see what way the scheme has operated since it was first introduced in 1947.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1947, the approach was that rural electrification must always be subsidised and that approach was made on the assumption that the fixed revenue charges would only amount to so much and that the outgoings would amount to so much, so that there would be a gap to be bridged and that a subsidy from the taxpayer was necessary to <Col N="87" /> bridge that gap.  I want to show, as indeed I have already shown in my opening speech, that the need for this artificial respiration, this financial artificial respiration, for the E.S.B. no longer exists.  So far as that organisation is concerned, it can now stand on its own feet and more than stand on its own feet.  It is, in fact, one of the most thriving economic organisations in the country and its financial position is one of the soundest in the country.</P>
    <P>Why, therefore, should we continue, in the face of clear evidence of there being no need to do so, to subsidise an organisation whose financial position is exceptionally satisfactory, whose financial position to-day is better than it has ever been in its long history?  The truth of the matter is that you cannot keep the E.S.B. from making progress.  It is making progress more rapidly now than it has ever made it before and I want to put some figures on the record to prove that.</P>
    <P>In the year ended March, 1954, the E.S.B. erected approximately 68,000 poles; in the financial year which ended last March, they erected 91,000 poles.  In the financial year ended March, 1954, they strung out 3,700 miles of wire; in the financial year just ended, they strung out almost 5,000 miles, of wire.  In the year ending March, 1954, they connected up 23,000 odd new consumers; in the financial year ended March, 1955, they connected 29,000&mdash;almost 30,000&mdash;new consumers.</P>
    <P>Look at the production and the units sold.  In 1954, they generated approximately 1,300 million units; in 1955, up to March, 1955, they generated 1,460 million units.  In the year ended March, 1954, they sold electricity to rural consumers to the value of £1,400,000 and in the year ended March, 1955, they sold £1,800,000 worth of current to rural users.  In other words, in a single year, they sold an additional £400,000 worth of units of electricity to rural users.  In the non-rural areas, they sold £7,100,000 worth of current in the year ended March, 1954, and, in the year ended March, 1955, they sold £7,700,000 worth of current to non-rural users.  It is clear <Col N="88" /> from these figures that the board is not only able to generate an increasing number of units, but is selling to-day a greater number of units at a profit than it ever sold before.</P>

He said they had only a small surplus in 1952.  The actual surplus was about £45,000.  What he did not tell you&mdash;and this was clearly deliberate suppression&mdash;were the previous figures.  He did not go back to 1951, when the surplus was £546,000, or to 1950 when it was £262,000, or to 1949 when it was £240,000, or to 1948 when it was £102,000, or to 1947 when it was £265,000, or to 1946 when it was £152,000.  Deputy MacEntee deliberately suppressed those figures, all of which go to show that between 1946 and 1955 the board made a surplus in every year but one&mdash;and that one was due to unprecedented causes in 1953.  In every other single year it has made a surplus and in these years it could have carried the cost of rural electrification without imposing any burden on consumers.</P>

The board has reserves provided for depreciation, renewal of its physical assets, at 31st March, amounting to £12,700,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>In addition to that&mdash; and that is not all&mdash;the board have the following reserves.  They have a contingencies reserve of £1,000,000&mdash; and that £1,000,000 was got by adding £300,000 to that reserve fund this year.  They have a fuel cost equalisation reserve of £500,000.  They have an income-tax reserve of £100,000 and other reserves and provisions amounting to £263,000.  The deficit in 1952-53 was met from the contingencies reserve which had been re-established in 1948-49.  This reduced the reserve to £500,000, but with the surpluses produced in 1953-54 and 1954-55 it has been possible to increase this reserve to its present level of £1,000,000 and in addition to create two new reserves, namely, the income-tax reserve and the fuel cost equalisation reserve, as well as increasing the other reserves and provisions from the 1953-54 level of £150,000 odd to the current figure of £263,000 odd.  In other words, the E.S.B. has more reserves than it ever had and more reserve funds than it ever had and it has reserve funds now for purposes that it never had them for before.</P>

I asked the board to let me know what they have done about the months of April and May, from the point of view of erecting poles and stringing wire. There are only two months' figures available.  Last year, in erecting poles, their record up to the end of March was 91,000.  They are now proceeding at a rate which, taking the two months April and May, and if that rate is maintained will result at the end of the year in 112,000 poles being erected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Col N="93" />
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of miles strung, in the year ending March last, was 5,000.  This year, if the progress is maintained as in April and May, it will be close on 6,500.  In these two months they have completed a further 16 areas.  It you multiply that by six over the year you will see they are on the 100 a year target.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>All that is clear evidence that the board is marching on at a rapid pace.  If we can accelerate this pace we should do so, but there is no reason for despondency in these figures.  These are heartening figures, enthusing figures, figures which will make people have confidence in an organisation such as this.  Further evidence of how well the E.S.B. is selling its wares is to be found in the way in which they are selling electricity to rural dwellers to-day as compared with the average number of units consumed by them when they got electricity first. The extent to which consumption is increasing in areas which were developed in the early period of the scheme may be seen from the following figures, which show the average annual consumption per consumer in representative areas connected during the earlier years.</P>
      <P>In 1949 the average consumption of units was 509; in 1951 it was 905; in 1953 it was 1,119; in 1954 it was 1,238, and in 1955 it was 1,334.  Therefore, the consumer who was using an average of 509 units in 1949 is now using 1,334.  That is clear evidence that rural electrification is popular, that rural electrification has come to stay and that the rural dweller is looking for and using more and more electricity.  You cannot stop rural electrification from making progress; you cannot now prevent the people from wanting it more and more.</P>

      <P>Deputy Lemass talked about acceptances, the difficulty in <Col N="94" /> getting 69 per cent. acceptances.  The average acceptances in 1951-52 were 60 per cent.  That increased to 67 per cent. in 1953-54 and to-day in a great many cases the acceptances are running between 80 and 90 per cent.  Is not that most satisfactory progress?

      <P>Let us talk on the question of sales. Deputy Lemass was on sales.  So far as the E.S.B. sales are concerned, the board are able to report, I think, this year that the increase in the sales of electricity in the year ended March, 1955, is up by over £1,000,000 as compared with last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Col N="95" />
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and that the number of areas developed is a record. I do not want the Deputy to rejoice about these figures if he wants to be despondent but the country is entitled to know what progress the E.S.B. is making and the fact that it is making such steady progress and that it has such a substantial surplus to its credit and such adequate reserves to its credit is all the more reason why it should not be subsidised any longer by the ordinary taxpayer.</P>
      <P>Deputy McQuillan, Deputy Bartley and Deputy Kennedy made some complaints which totted up to allegations of waste and inefficiency against the E.S.B. I will see that these complaints are brought to the notice of the board for investigation.</P>
      <P>Deputy Burke complained about the special charges.  The special charge for the isolated household in a rural area, even an area covered by a rural electrification scheme, has been a feature of the scheme since it was first introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

Deputy Burke then maintained a majestic silence.  He has now got the liberty to open his mouth and he comes in here as if he had heard only yesterday about these electricity charges.  That is not honest.  That deceives nobody.  That is just trying to cash-in on a belief that the fellow outside is just as stupid as Deputy Burke prefers to assume he is for the purpose of soaking up what Deputy Burke says.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at all.  Take note of what I am saying to-day: Next year the board will have another surplus and what they are being asked to do to-day will not prevent them taking on that liability which is now being borne by the ordinary taxpayer because, in so far as the Government provides the subsidy, the money to pay the subsidy has to be raised by the taxpayer and I understood the Deputy was concerned about the taxpayer. When the Finance Bill was under discussion here he moved a whole lot of amendments to give back to the taxpayer what he himself had taken out of the taxpayer's pocket.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Most people believe it was, that there were qualms of conscience and that the Deputy moved amendments to the Finance Bill to give back to the people what he took in 1952.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="97" />
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy had inoculated himself against qualms of conscience&mdash;is that it?  Only a month ago the Deputy was pleading for the interest of the taxpayer, that he must get some relief from the crushing burden, that it was unfair to put all this burden on him and both he and Deputy MacEntee were breast high a couple of months ago to do something about the unfortunate taxpayer.</P>
      <P>We are now taking this burden off the taxpayer's back.  We are relieving him of the responsibility of paying the subsidy to the board.  We are saying to the taxpayer: &ldquo;You do not need to pay that subsidy any more.  We will see that the board will stand as a unit and that out of the surplus which it has it will pay the entire cost of generating and supplying electricity to urban and rural dwellers without putting its hands in your pocket for any further subsidy.&rdquo;  That is a simple position.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lemass says that he does not object in principle to the E.S.B. being conceived as one unit and balancing its rural liabilities with its urban inheritances. That is what this Bill is doing. It is amalgamating the rural and the urban.  It is bringing them together and making sure that the accounts of the E.S.B. will be organised in such a way that the rural electrification scheme will not be subsidised by the general taxpayer who ought not to be asked to pay money to the E.S.B. when it has a surplus on this year's account, on last year's account and on every other year's account, except one, in the last ten years.  There is no need for the subsidy and this Bill is designed to make sure that the consumer will not be asked to give money to an organisation which clearly does not need it on its own account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some suggestions have been made here that the Minister for Industry and Commerce should make the E.S.B. pay the extra charges in rural areas. That requires a decision on the broad question of policy and is a matter, if you like, that could be discussed in the House, but the position is that under the Electricity Bill of 1927 there are <Col N="98" /> certain statutory provisions which give the E.S.B. the responsibility so to adjust its charges that its revenue in any one year shall be sufficient, and only sufficient, to meet all its outgoings. Another section of that Bill empowers the board to make scales fixing the methods of charge and the rates of charge for electricity and to revise or revoke these scales or any part thereof whenever the board thinks fit.  Another sub-section provides that the scales so fixed may apply to the whole of the country or to any part thereof or to any one or more classes of consumers.  Another section prohibits the grant of preferential treatment to consumers within the same area of supply.</P>
    <P>The traditional line taken by a variety and succession of Ministers has been that that is an E.S.B. function and that the Minister as Minister ought not to direct the board to do something contrary to the provisions of the statute. I think, in the long run, there is a good case to be made for allowing this board to function as the controlling organisation of our national electricity undertaking, to allow it to fix the charges in the light of its own requirements.</P>
    <P>I think it would be a bad thing for the Minister to have the power to intervene in fixing the charges because that is capable of manipulation in times of difficulty or times of emergency for a political Party.  I think it is better for the board to fix it.  The board can be informed from time to time as to what the view of this House is as expressed in public debate here but I think it would be wrong for the Minister, as such, to dictate to the board in such manner as to interfere with its functions under the 1927 Act.</P>
    <P>There is just one other matter.  I said, and I want to repeat again, that this Bill will not result in any slowing down of rural electrification.  Rural electrification will be accelerated this year and next year to a pace which it never previously attained.  Secondly, there is no reason in the world why there should be any increase in electricity charges as a result of this Bill. The board's finances can carry the cost <Col N="99" /> of rural electrification without any difficulty and without any obligation to increase on that account its charges for electricity either in rural or urban areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>When this debate was adjourned I was talking about the condition of soldiers' and F.C.A. uniforms and pointing out how badly the men in these forces are clad.  I think the Minister should initiate a reform in this matter at once.  He should bring the uniforms up to date and generally smarten the appearance of our fighting men.  Experts should be called in to design the uniform.  I think smartness is more important than anything else because a well-dressed soldier is invariably a good soldier.  Our people are proud of the Army.  They want to take a pride in it and we should do all we can to help them by making the Army look its best.  The most successful recruiting advertisement is a well-turned out soldier in uniform.  If we attend to that and to the other shortcomings in relation to pay, housing for our married men and pensions we will maintain our Army at full strength with long-serving soldiers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now the F.C.A. is probably the most valuable reserve as compared with any other country, but we treat it very badly.  The uniform is deplorable.  It should be changed and we should not get complaints from F.C.A. officers <Col N="100" /> that they cannot attest men because they have not got the uniforms for them.  The cheapest part of running an army is dressing its soldiers and there should be no complaints about that. We should ensure that the corps is well dressed with an ample clothing reserve.  The men should be well trained.  If we do that we will have a force second to none and we will be doing something at the same time to show our appreciation of those who have helped to keep that force going over the last eight or nine years. F.C.A. officers have done a very good job up and down the country.  They deserve every encouragement.</P>
    <P>A previous speaker referred to the comparative failure of the Army Equitation School.  The people are very disappointed with the results they are getting from the expenditure on this school.  If we are prepared to spend a penny we should be prepared to spend twopence.  From my long and intimate contact with the Army I know that the allowances paid to our officers when they go abroad to represent us are absolutely disgraceful.  It is deplorable that that situation should exist.  It is something of which we ought all to be ashamed, and something we should be ashamed to draw attention to here.</P>
    <P>I do not know what is being done by the Bureau of Military History, and I do not know why this body should be so expensive.  I would like the Minister to give us some information as to what the bureau is doing, what it will ultimately produce and when it will produce it.  There is a feeling in the country that this bureau is a kind of parking place for aged military men.  There is an increase in the Vote this year of £8,000.  The people would like to know for what that sum is required.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond referred to the growing disproportion as between officers and men.  There is another lack of proportion into which I would like inquiry to be made, namely, the relationship as between the Army Civil Service and the Army itself.  When the Army was as high numerically as 50,000 men we had to have a big Civil Service to administer that Army.  Today <Col N="101" /> we have the same Civil Service administering a force one-quarter of that.  I think there is room for economy there.</P>
    <P>We have a very good Army and I think the people want to look upon the Army with affection and pride.  We must do all we can to make Army life attractive.  I think the Minister is regarded very highly by the ordinary people and by the serving soldiers. He is a man who served his country in pre-Truce days and since and he is evidently fitted to be the civil head of the Army.  I appeal to him to put an end to the discontent that has existed in the Army for a great number of years and to make Army service a happier service.</P>
    <P>Finally, when do we intend to honour by monument or memorial the greatest Irish soldier of all time?  Michael Collins has been dead for 33 years.  He was the first Commander-in-Chief of the Army but his work, of course, was largely finished by then.  I think the time has come when we should do honour to his name.  A magnificent head of Michael Collins was designed by the sculptor, Seamus Murphy, and exhibited at the R.H.A. some years ago.  I do not know where it is now but I presume it is still in the country. I think that head should be obtained and erected in some part of the Capital, either at General Headquarters or within the environments of this House. We have let this matter go very far. Strangers ask what have we done to honour the memory of Michael Collins. His name is a legend.  Our children ask where they can see him.  Many of those who fought with him are still alive and something should be done now before his exploits and his achievements become mere legends in the chimney corner.</P>

      <P>A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, ba mhaith liom cur síos ar an Meastachán seo, go mór mhór chomh fada is a bhaineann sé leis an bhForsa Cosanta Aitiúil.  I rith na bliana seo, ar Dhomhnach na Cásca, bhí comóradh ag Auburn in onóir do Shéamus Mac Fhinn.  Do thug duine óráid ar an ócáid seo agus i rith a chuid cainte do labhair sé ar cheist na <Col N="102" /> Teorann.  Do mhol sé na rudaí a thuit amach tamall roimhe sin in Ard Maca agus san Omáigh.  Dúirt sé leis na daoine a bhí ann gur cheart dóibh dúil agus spéis a bheith acu ann agus siúl leo ar an gcasán céana.</P>
      <P>Tamaillín roimhe sin do labhair an Taoiseach anseo agus do leag sé polasaí an Rialtais síos ar cheist na Teorann. D'aontaigh gach duine anseo leis an bpolasaí sin agus d'aontaigh gach dream ins an dTigh leis.  D'aontaigh gach Taoiseach dá raibh i bhfeidhil gach Páirtí leis freisin.</P>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom eolas a bheith agam i dtaobh cé thug an tordú don bhForsa Cosanta Aitiúil a shiúl go dtí an comóradh seo.  Ar rinne an tAirm nó an tAire scrúdú mar gheall ar cén sort óráide a thabharfaí?  Níor ceart go dtuitfeadh aon rud den tsort sin amach agus ní ceart aon rud eile do cheadú a bheadh cosúil leis an rud seo.</P>
      <P>Bhí &ldquo;Civil War&rdquo; amháin againn cheana agus ba bhrónach an rud é agus níl aon dúil ag éinne go mbeadh troid eile ann idir dearbhraithreacha. Táim ag fiafraigh den Aire cé thug an tordú Domhnach na Cásca agus ar thug sé féin an tordú sin?</P>
      <P>I am referring to a commemoration to Seamus Finn in my county in which there was a specific order given to the F.C.A. to parade at the unveiling of a memorial and in which a policy was announced to the Army and the F.C.A. that they were proud of the incidents in Armagh and Omagh and that the Army was only too anxious to follow in the wake of these actions.  I want to know on whose orders the order was given last Easter Sunday for the F.C.A. of South Westmeath to parade to hear that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach announced a policy here in relation to the Border and Partition.  The Leader of the Opposition and the Leaders of every Party together with every individual in this House agreed with it.  We were all of one mind that one civil war in this country was enough, that one civil war in the life of any country is enough. Whoever is responsible, whether it be the Minister or the heads of his Department, when a specific order to parade for a commemoration is given there <Col N="103" /> should be a close examination of what is going to happen.  There were certain groups in the F.C.A. that refused to parade because they knew what was going to happen.  As they had their ears to the ground they knew what was going to happen.  If there is a continuation of this kind of thing it will lead to a very serious situation before the life of this Government is ended.</P>
    <P>Let me quote from the <i>Westmeath Independent</i> dated April 16th, 1955:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;From 1916 to as late as 1944, Irishmen have died in battle and at the hands of the executioner for the principles enshrined in the Easter Week Proclamation.  Right up to the present day&mdash;only last year, in 1954, we know of the gallant exploits of the young men involved in the Armagh and Omagh raids.  Their action, irrespective of whether you agree or disagree with its wisdom, made your hearts throb a little quicker, made your eyes glisten with pride&mdash;that despite all the empty vapourings of politicians there were Irishmen who had the moral courage to disregard all criticism, who had the physical courage to risk life and limb and personal freedom in carrying out an action which they considered well worth while.</P>
    <P>The officers and men of our Irish Army must I'm sure harbour a hope that some day may dawn when they would be called on to strike a blow if necessary for the reunification of Ireland, or in defence of the freedom already won.  If that call ever comes, it will be gladly answered.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Before that, the following was said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In Dáil Eireann we have five different political Parties.  These with their supporters have accepted the British imposed Treaty of 1921.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not debating Partition; I am debating a parade attended by half the men of my county. I want action taken by the Minister and the Department, particularly by <Col N="104" /> the Minister, that this will not occur again.  I have only a few more lines to read:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Through Press and platform each claims to have the salve for all our ills.  On the other hand, we have a considerable section of our people who reject any recognition of that Treaty, and stand where all stood in the pre-Treaty days of national unity &mdash;on the bed-rock of the 32-county republic.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I say that this whole matter is very serious.  There are too many tragedies, even the other day, in connection with this whole matter.  There should be strict supervision when an order is going to be issued for a parade of F.C.A.  What I have spoken of should not be allowed to occur again and we should ensure that officers of the Army will not parade in a matter like this. That is all I have to say in this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few points in connection with this Estimate I should like to bring to the Minister's attention.  Before doing so, I should like to say that I agree with many of the other Deputies who pointed out the importance as a whole of this particular debate.  It is very difficult in this House for Deputies, or for that matter for the Department of Defence or officers in the Army to formulate a defence system or programme for this country in its present tragically divided condition.  It is really very hard, then, to be realistic about what practical steps can be taken to safeguard the welfare of the portion of Ireland which lies under the control of this Parliament.  One thing we should be clear about in our minds is that all possible steps should be taken by this House and by the authorities of this State to protect, in so far as it lies within their power, the community within the State from attacks by any outside Power.  Provided those attacks are made with the recognised weapons of warfare, it should be our aim to make it as costly as possible for any invader who might think it worth his while to utilise this base as a jumping-off ground for attacks on other countries, whatever those countries may be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="105" /> There is little, perhaps, that we can do in the line of defence against atomic or nuclear warfare.  There is little that any country in the world can do about that except depend on Providence to save the lives of the civilian community. Perhaps we should deal a little bit more seriously with aspects of civilian defence in so far as they relate to evacuation, training of our people in the larger centres of population, first-aid precautions and instructions in protection systems from attacks of the atomic kind.  That is about all we can hope to do in that regard.</P>
    <P>If we make up our minds that our aim is to make it as costly as possible for anybody to invade this country, then we should examine what type of defence force is best suited to our needs in that regard.  I think it has generally been accepted that elsewhere armies are very costly items of expense on the community as a whole and people seldom see anything but a very little return for the large expenditure that goes into the upkeep of an army and the purchase of equipment which, we hope, may never be used. We all hope there will never be need to use it in our defence.</P>
    <P>It is, therefore, essential that we scrutinise the policy of the present Government in connection with the defence of the country and, in connection with it, the amount of money it is proposed to expend on an army and the type of army on which this money will be expended.  My personal belief is that we should have a small army composed of personnel on a permanent basis and that this small army should consist of the cream of our soldiers, officers, N.C.O.s and men; that it would be highly-trained and mobile and at the same time capable of very rapid expansion and able to take in, in times of emergencies, larger groups who would be trained on a basis of three or six months a year.  The actual size of this standing Army is something on which we can agree to differ &mdash;there may be differences of opinion as to whether it should be 12,000 or 8,000&mdash;and I do not propose to enter into the lists to discuss that particular aspect of the matter&mdash;I think it should <Col N="106" /> be left to people who are more expert on that than we are to make recommendations as to what the actual size of that small but well trained force should be.</P>
    <P>To augment that permanent force we need large reserves, and this, I think, is the most important point with regard to our defences.  We have a very excellent body in the background known as the F.C.A.  To my mind the idea behind the formation of the F.C.A. was excellent but I do not really think we can say that the F.C.A. to-day is functioning on a practical basis and that in cases of emergency we would have a first-class defence unit in the F.C.A.  Deputy Collins&mdash;and I think other Deputies&mdash;the other day drew attention to the fact that there was a great deal of dissatisfaction&mdash; perhaps I should say lack of interest&mdash; among F.C.A. members.  It is quite natural that that should be so as the type of training which they undergo certainly does not give them much encouragement to follow their period in that force by taking an active interest in Army matters.  There is nothing as damning to a man's enthusiasm as to be subject to the same old routine meeting after meeting, the only real break being when they get a period of Army training which provides them with a little holiday, one might say, and that is all to the good.</P>
    <P>I think we should examine this question of the F.C.A. on a broader basis. I think we must be one of the few countries in the world which depends on a voluntary force for its defence. The Irish people have been led to believe, by historians and others, that they are the greatest fighting race on earth and the idea seems to be abroad that there is no need here to provide or adopt the same methods of defence as other countries.  In other words, we leave the defence of this country to the gallant few who may be prepared to offer their services in cases of emergency. My personal belief is that if this country is worth living in then it is worth fighting for and I think the time has come when the privilege should be offered to every able-bodied man in the country of training himself so that if his services are needed for <Col N="107" /> the defence of the country in the future he will be there to man the gap.</P>
    <P>I have very vivid recollections of my own period of service in the Army during the emergency.  Perhaps I was one of those foolish young fellows who joined up in the defence of this country and, like many others, we hoped that we would have courage to do our duty when faced with the possibilities of an invasion.  There were many young men in the ranks as privates, N.C.O.s and officers, who gave the best&mdash;when I say the best, I mean the richest years of their lives when their characters were being formed and when they would have a chance of success in the outside world &mdash;years of their lives in the Army service.</P>
    <P>What happened?  At the end of the emergency they came out of the Army in droves and there was nothing for them only a small gratuity, which ranged up to about £180, to help them to start their lives in competition with the boyos who stayed outside during the emergency sitting on the side line. Men who took their chance and joined for the period of the emergency had to start at the beginning.  It has to be remembered that the period of Army service, be it five years or seven years, acts as a distinct handicap to any man who has to face a civilian life in the future.  The years in the Army may be well spent so far as training for the defence of the country is concerned but they are rather badly spent where preparing for the combat of civil life is concerned.</P>
    <P>Each one of those thousands of officers, N.C.O.s and men had to face very keen competition when they came out of the Army and the result of that is there and cannot be challenged, that 60 per cent. of the men who served through the emergency served afterwards in armies outside this country. I never want to see that state of affairs in this country again.  I do not want to see the position in which these young men joined the Army and the opportunists and other types were allowed outside to dig themselves in in the good civilian jobs.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="108" /> As I said earlier, if this country is worth living in it is worth preparing oneself to defend it, and I think the Minister should examine seriously the possibility of giving that opportunity to all our young men&mdash;of serving their country for a short period, perhaps, every two years.  This system works out well in other countries, and as far as the manhood of this country is concerned, it would be a decided help to them in their physique and in their outlook.  In my own experience one can pick out an army man anywhere by his standing, his walk and his bearing. The course that a boy of 18 or 20 would undergo in the Army from the physical and educational points of view would be of an immense benefit to him when he would come back into civilian life.  The period of training should be short and should be on a competitive basis.  I believe in the long run this would be the cheapest form of defence force we could have.  That is all I propose to say on that.</P>
    <P>Other Deputies have dwelt on the dissatisfaction which seems to exist in Army circles to-day on various matters and I have no doubt whatever that a great deal of dissatisfaction exists and, I am sure, will exist for all time in the Army, and any little thing we can do in this House to improve conditions for the serving personnel should be done, and every Deputy who is in a position to make representations to the Minister should make them to strengthen his hand, if necessary, when dealing with either departmental officials or with the brass hats in the Army.  I said at one time here before&mdash;I have not changed my opinion and I do not know whether it is as true to-day as it was when I was in the Army&mdash;that under the brass hats there are a lot of brass heads.</P>
    <P>I propose to give to the Minister, and to put on the records of this House some of the reasons why there is a great deal of dissatisfaction, first, in the junior officer ranks and, secondly, amongst the N.C.O.s and men.  In the Army to-day we have quite a number of young officers who were officers during the period of the emergency, that is from 1940 to 1946.  These men <Col N="109" /> were invited to stay on in the Army. To my mind, their conditions in the Army at the present moment are not the conditions which there were guaranteed when they were, shall we say, re-commissioned in 1946.  I think it is better to have all this on the records of the House so that Deputies in the future can read of how these men were treated.</P>
    <P>In 1946, commissions in the regular Army were offered to a number of officers who had served during the period of the emergency.  Most of these were young officers, and they were asked to sign an agreement to the effect that they were willing to accept these commissions. The agreement had to be signed before the 31st March, 1946, for the purpose, mark you, that &ldquo;continuity of service may be observed&rdquo;. This was interpreted to mean that they would continue to serve in the Army but that their status would change from that of temporary officer to that of regular officer.</P>
    <P>This interpretation, by those young officers, was borne out by the fact that they did not receive the gratuity which was given to the temporary, the emergency officers who left the Army in 1946.  This particular gratuity was one that only temporary officers were entitled to.  The regular officers were not entitled to it.  They were also convinced of this on another ground: that the temporary officers who, prior to the 31/3/'46, had relinquished their commissions to become cadets in the Military College had, on the completion of their cadetship, been re-commissioned in their old officer rank.</P>
    <P>As regards the loss of money which they suffered by resigning their temporary commissions and going in as cadets, they were reimbursed for the loss they suffered during the period they were cadets.  That, in the minds of the temporary officers who were invited to stay on in 1946 on a permanent basis, gave them the feeling that continuity of service would be observed, as far as they were concerned.  However, &ldquo;the powers that be&rdquo; seem to have put a different interpretation on this idea of continuity of service.  The emphasis would seem to have been on <Col N="110" /> the word &ldquo;service&rdquo;, so that in November, 1946, all the temporary officers who stayed on were re-commissioned, although none of these officers had at any time relinquished his temporary commission.</P>
    <P>We will see what that meant.  If these men had relinquished their temporary commissions they immediately became entitled to the gratuity which was made available for temporary officers, but they never received that gratuity and they never relinquished their commissions. Yet, they were re-commissioned as permanent officers in November, 1946 and thus they were deprived of the gratuity.  But there was a graver wrong than that done to them.</P>
    <P>I might point out at this stage that all those officers have two commissioning certificates, and yet they were not discharged.  As regards the first commissioning certificate&mdash;I think it was in 1948 or 1949&mdash;a former Minister for Defence, the late Deputy Dr. O'Higgins, stated openly that, in so far as the inter-Party Government of that time was concerned he could assure the Army men that conditions of pay would certainly not worsen during the period of office of the inter-Party Government, and to give credit where credit is due, he sanctioned increases for Army personnel.  The increases which he sanctioned were, mark you, sought by the Army men on the grounds that a severe rise had taken place in the cost of living, and on that basis the then Government decided to make more money available to meet that increase in the cost of living for Army personnel.</P>
    <P>Let us see how this extra money was dished out to the Army personnel. Let us take the rank of second lieutenant, a single man in occupation of, or sharing, a room in the mess. He received an increase of 2/6 per day. This amount was added to his pay and was included in his returns for income-tax. But as soon as he was given that increase of 2/6 per day, which was added to his income-tax, another 2/6 a day was deducted from his pay for accommodation: in other words, for the room in which he was living or sleeping, so that in point of fact he became poorer as a result of getting this 2/6 a <Col N="111" /> day increase because it was now subject to income-tax.  In addition, if that second lieutenant took his 30 days holidays, he was still going to pay that 2/6 for accommodation in the barracks. As far as that second lieutenant was concerned, he would have been better off not to have received the 2/6 at all. The very fact that he received it made him subject to income-tax so that he immediately lost on the transaction.  I would remind Deputies that that increase of 2/6 was given because of the rise in the cost of living.</P>
    <P>Let us take another example of the generous way in which the junior officer personnel in the Army was treated.  Let us take a married lieutenant.  A married lieutenant, under this increase, continued to draw his lieutenant's rate of pay.  There was no increase whatever given to him in spite of the fact that these increases were supposed to meet the increased cost of living.  Instead he was guaranteed promotion to the rank of captain after eight years as lieutenant.  This is the point I want to bring home.  He was guaranteed promotion after eight years' service but those eight years dated from his second commissioning ceremony and if that man had served from 1941 to 1946 as a lieutenant that period of service did not count for promotion when he would be in the line of promotion to the rank of captain.  Instead the second commissioning ceremony when he was re-commissioned in 1946 was the date from which the eight years were counted.</P>
    <P>Let us now take the position in regard to the gentlemen a little higher up in the service.  Under these increases which the then Minister was so good as to grant a married captain got an increase, as far as I can gather from investigations I have made, of 3/- per day; a married commandant got 6/- per day; a married lieutenant-colonel got 8/- per day and a married colonel got 10/- per day.  Mark you these increases were given to meet the increased cost of living.  It must be a terrible thing for a married colonel and a colonel's wife to live on what he got <Col N="112" /> in comparison with the married lieutenant and the lieutenant's wife. The Minister at the time and others since got away with this by saying that they had given an increase and that they had handed over the money to the Army.</P>
    <P>I grant that this House gave the Minister authority to give this money to the Army but what did the Minister do?  He handed it over and the brass hats put their big long arms into the bag and took out what they wanted, and when they had finished there was not much left for the junior ranks.  It was very evasive action on the part of the Minister to allow the senior Army personnel to decide who should get the increases and what the increases should be.</P>
    <P>There is another pointer to the dissatisfaction that can exist in Army circles.  Prior to this increase, which was said to be given in order to meet the increased cost of living, there was an allowance paid for children of married officers of the Army.  Officers with four or more children under 18 years of age received 6d. per day for the fourth and other subsequent children.  But this children's allowance ceased from the 1st April, 1951, except for those officers who already had four children prior to that date.</P>
    <P>Let us see how that works out.  The result of that decision to discontinue those children's allowances on 1st April, 1951, means that you can have at the moment two officers of the same rank, commissioned on the same day and one of them with only four children receiving children's allowance in respect of one child and the other officer with six children receiving none at all.  That is the position that has arisen as a result of the decision to discontinue the allowances from 1st April, 1951.  I do not want to be uncharitable but there is something sinister in the fact that the children of the older and senior personnel were practically reared when that decision was made.</P>
    <P>Another point which shows the dissatisfaction that exists to-day with regard to service in the Army is in reference to the retiring age which was agreed upon by a former Minister in <Col N="113" /> this House.  I want to make it quite clear that I believe myself that, when the decision was made to alter the retiring age, it was done with a view to giving certain preferential treatment to the older men in the Army&mdash;pre-Truce men.  I have no objection to giving preferential treatment to pre-Truce men provided it is not going to do an injustice to the younger people in the Army who expect to get promotion from now on.</P>
    <P>When the decision was made by this former Minister to alter the retiring age many of the senior officers had then reached the retiring age.  Many had their families reared and their houses purchased and were living in quite favourable circumstances.  The retiring age for commandants was extended from 51 to 54 years of age with one year for pre-Truce service; for lieutenant-colonels from 54 to 57 years plus one year for pre-Truce service and for colonels from 57 to 60 years plus one year for pre-Truce service.  If we follow this up it will show how the openings which should be available to-day to the younger men in the Army are closed for many years and when you have officers held down with no hope of promotion you are going to have dissatisfaction.  If that dissatisfaction is present in the commissioned ranks it is going to find its way down into the ranks of the N.C.O.s and privates.</P>
    <P>When the seniority list and the retiring age limit was set up the position to which I referred earlier on with regard to the temporary officers became clear.  The temporary officer who served from 1940 to 1946 and was re-commissioned in 1946 now found himself, as a result of this seniority list, in the position that although he had been a lieutenant from 1940 all during the emergency he now became junior to any lieutenant who had, by November, 1946, been two years out of the Military College.  If that is not favouritism I do not know what favouritism is.  It meant that the man who stayed in the Army in 1946 on the impression that his standing would not be altered found himself junior to the man who went to the Military College from 1944 on.  I do <Col N="114" /> not think that was a fair way to treat those young men but that is not the worst part of the picture.</P>
    <P>In connection with this promotion trouble that exists, we can come up a little closer to the present day than 1951.  It was bad enough to have this situation pan-out in 1951 but in 1954 when it became apparent that this extension of the upper age limit for the senior officers was going to affect the promotion of certain younger officers in the Army, there was a further change made Now when I refer to certain junior officers in the Army I am referring specifically to those who were closely connected with the senior personnel who were about to retire.  It was found that the existing age limits, the retiral ages fixed, would block the avenue of promotion for these younger men.  A step was taken in 1954 to ensure that that would not result in harming the chances of those younger men and the way that was achieved was by giving a further extension.  This extension amounted to two years extra on top of the one year for pre-Truce service.  Therefore, these senior ranks of commandant, lieutenant-colonel and colonel, in addition to getting one year's pre-Truce service in 1951, got two years more in 1954.</P>
    <P>I do not think many members of the House will understand the implications of that move but it amounts to this, that that extra period of service given to those men will enable them to stay on long enough to ensure that those temporary officers who were re-commissioned in 1946 in the Regular Army will now reach the retiring age at the same time as these senior officers.  That means that when these men, shall I describe them as the formerly temporary officers, reach retiring age, at the same time as these senior men, there will be room left for rapid promotion for the remainder of the younger men who are in the Army to whom I have already referred as being closely connected with the senior ranks who got the privilege I mentioned.</P>
    <P>The Minister should make a careful inquiry into this because I am satisfied from the investigations I have made <Col N="115" /> that it is very cleverly organised.  I want to see in the Army equal opportunity for all serving officers whether they were cadets or emergency officers. There should be no discrimination whatever in regard to these men.  I can assure the Minister that this 1954 manoeuvre, as I would describe it, has resulted in a most discontented junior and middle group in the Army.  I might describe it as an ulcerated stomach in the Army and it has had the effect that many of the officers have now a complete lack of interest in Army matters and many of them are turning to sidelines to the detriment of their Army work and of the Army in general.</P>
    <P>I am not the only Deputy in this House to point out this dissatisfaction, but I have given reasons and I am prepared to argue these reasons outside the House.  It is my intention to pursue this matter into the future.  I must confess&mdash;and I might put that on record, too&mdash;that, although I have been in the Army myself, due to the pressure of my constituency work and other work in connection with my position as a public representative, I did not give the time that I should have given to investigating the position of men who served, and with whom I had the privilege of serving, during the period of the emergency.  I did not take the time to ascertain some of their grievances, but I have done so in recent times and the position is far worse than I thought it would have been.</P>
    <P>I have dealt to some extent with the situation in regard to officer personnel. I do not wish to delay the House but I would like to raise a matter in connection with N.C.O.s, privates and other ranks.  I wrote in 1953 to the former Minister, Deputy Traynor, about this, and he was courteous enough to send me a very comprehensive and detailed statement of the position in the Army in regard to personnel who are unfortunate enough to suffer from T.B.  There seems to be an extraordinary mentality abroad at the present time in regard to soldiers who suffer from T.B.  When we look outside at the change in mentality which has taken place in this country in the last eight or nine years <Col N="116" /> on health matters and then consider the mentality in Army circles as to how soldiers who are serving men should be treated when they are unfortunate enough to suffer from T.B., it is high time that the headlights of publicity were turned on that mentality in this House.  To put it very bluntly, a member of the Army who contracts T.B., although he may have seven, eight or nine years' service, will get no disability allowance or pension when he is discharged from the Army unless he is able to prove that he contracted T.B. during the period of the emergency, between 3rd September, 1939 and 2nd September, 1946.  If he is not able to prove that he contracted T.B. during that period, he is out, and he has to depend on civilian life for rehabilitation.  To give an indication of the way the Department look at it, I will quote from the letter dated 12th September, 1953, which I received from the then Minister for Defence, Deputy Traynor, in this connection:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Up to the present the principle has been followed of providing in the Army Pensions Acts for pensions in respect of wounds or injuries attributable to Army service during any period, but for pensions for ill-health due to disease, only in respect of periods such as the April, 1922-September, 1924, active service period and the emergency period, during which the soldier is exposed to an abnormal extent to the risk of disease.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>They are the only two periods during which members of the forces will be recognised as being entitled to disability allowances in respect of T.B. even if they contract that disease while serving in the Army in August, June or July, 1939, or in December of 1946.  If they contract the disease before or after the emergency period they are out; there is no hope for them as regards a disability pension.</P>
    <P>This view of the Department was expressed in the following terms in the letter written to me:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The view which has prevailed as regards peace-time Army service is that the duties of the members of <Col N="117" /> the forces in peace time are no more arduous or exacting than those of many sections of the adult population of military age, and that the much improved conditions of present-day soldiering are conducive to physical fitness and involve at least, no more risk of disease than the normal conditions of work in civil occupations.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the mentality of the Army authorities with regard to the danger of contracting T.B. by Army personnel. I wonder do they take into consideration the fact that during peace time soldiers undergo hardships that are almost as bad as they would be expected to undergo in times of warfare?  I wonder do the people who planned out this realise that the manoeuvres which the troops undergo can have a very severe effect on the health of those young men?  I wonder is it realised that sleeping in bivouacs in wet weather is conducive to T.B.? How many civilians are expected to sleep in the open or in bivouacs or to stay up on route marches for nearly six or seven hours in all kinds of weather?</P>
    <P>There is no comparison and I want the Minister to ensure that the necessary changes are brought about as quickly as possible to enable the Army personnel to enjoy the same benefits in regard to contracting T.B. now as were enjoyed during the emergency period.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister has yet been approached but I know he will be approached by the Organisation of National Ex-Servicemen. The organisation has taken up this matter and we know that the former Minister was sympathetic in his approach to their case and in his meeting with these people.  It takes time in a Department to make changes but I feel sure that if the former Minister were still there these changes would have been made by now and I am asking the present Minister, his successor and a man who, as Deputy Barry mentioned, is well liked by the Army personnel, to show his keen interest in their welfare by tackling that particular grievance which exists among soldiers of all ranks.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="118" /> The other and final point to which I will refer is the necessity for making an examination into the conditions of service and promotions made between 1948 and 1954.  If he makes that examination, the Minister will find that he will have no trouble in establishing the reasons why these soldiers have this feeling of dissatisfaction.  It exists among the junior personnel of the officer rank throughout the country to-day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>In the very serious matter of making financial provision for a military and civil defence system in this country suited to our needs in times of peace or emergency the very first thing is to get our attitude right. The next is to provide the necessaries in personnel and material best suited to our needs and the third would be to train, discipline, uniform and equip an army and naval force to be used to the best advantage in times of stress or emergency.  In consideration of these matters I think we would be very poor remnants of our generation were we to forget that these Twenty-Six Counties do not comprise a country apart but are portion only of an historical Irish nation of 32 Counties, bounded by the sea, as God made it, and that when we are considering military matters the Government of the day and our Army staffs would take into account how they will act should an emergency arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have no ambitions for conquest and no desire for war or conflict but at the same time, in keeping with all the small nations of Europe and of the world generally, we have to keep a force, disciplined and equipped, to face the future of our nation as a unit around which any system of military or civil defence would be built.  We cannot allow a situation to arise again as it did before, as the Minister well knows, when our Army had to capture to-day the guns and ammunition with which it was to fight to-morrow, and when people talk now about an Army in this country being useless I would ask them to cast back their minds over the circumstances of our times&mdash;to the time when an army, released from a great European War, with all the resources and equipment of an Empire, <Col N="119" /> faced practically the untrained peasantry of this country.</P>
    <P>That Army of ours had to build up from day to day the tactics, the spirit and the enthusiasm that led them at least to partial victory and which, but for a division in our ranks, might have led to complete victory.  When we are considering this Estimate for our Defence Forces we must take into account that we must have a well trained, healthy and well equipped army in keeping with modern developments and that it is not good tactics to keep our army personnel for long periods in big centres near big cities from which they would have to go if an emergency arose.</P>
    <P>It should be kept in mind that when the weather is suitable&mdash;I agree with Deputy McQuillan that you must build up a healthy army and that you cannot sacrifice the Army's health in bad weather in a way which would interfere with their strength and spirit for action should such an occasion arise&mdash;many of these companies should be moved from the barrack squares to our seaside towns.  I think a move has been made in that direction already, the idea being that they would co-operate with our small naval force and develop a system of training which would be of advantage in time of need.</P>
    <P>I agree with those who have spoken about the housing of our Army and their families.  I do not agree&mdash;and I have spoken here on this matter in previous years&mdash;with the system of married quarters in barracks for our soldier personnel.  They are part of the community and things are entirely different from what they were long ago, when barrack walls were some defence against attack with the equipment then existing.  A different outlook and a different attitude must be built up in these matters, and the houses for our Army personnel must be set out from the barracks amongst the community, or at least in areas away from these centres of training, where their families will not be in danger should any type of military attack against these centres arise.</P>
    <P>I am quite aware that the State holds lands where houses could be <Col N="120" /> built for the members of the Defence Forces who are married, and I hope the Minister will make a move in that direction, because the need is so great, so far as the ordinary community are concerned, that we would expect the Defence Forces to make their contribution to the housing of those who are in need of housing.  This has been a crying need over the years, and particularly near some of our cities, as many Deputies know, and these people should be moved out into suburban areas or into holdings owned by the Department of Defence itself.  There are places in my constituency, such as Ballincollig and other centres, where there is ample land for housing development.</P>
    <P>Having housed our Army we should undoubtedly give them proper uniforms and equipment, train them properly and pay them well, because, if the call comes, they must give their lifeblood in the service of their country.  They are our first line of defence and we ought to treat them in that spirit and not in any parsimonious manner.  It is rather disconcerting to hear from time to time complaints that the F.C.A., even after joining up for an extended period, cannot get a proper uniform.  That should not be so. The provision of these uniforms will give work in the various tailoring establishments and in the factories producing the material, and&mdash;a most important factor&mdash;make the men satisfied that their needs are receiving attention and that they are being turned out in a decent and respectable way as members of the armed forces set up for the defence of this country.</P>
    <P>The rehabiliation of those who suffer ill-health is very important.  The old outlook was that anyone who contracted T.B. had very little hope of permanent recovery, but there are specific duties attaching to every unit of the Army for which these men, without dangerous hardship, could be used to good purpose, and kept and paid as worthy citizens of our State.  It is wrong to throw them out on the world and to expect the ordinary employer to take back a man when he recovers after operation or treatment.  It is wrong to say that the Army cannot find a <Col N="121" /> place for men who have been restored to health&mdash;not perhaps as fighting men, but at least in some service in the national forces.  That should be looked into and I back up completely the views of Deputy McQuillan on this matter. As every Deputy knows, when people go around at election time, they have the one great opportunity, the one great purpose of an election, of meeting people individually with their families in their homes and of hearing their grievances and seeking to remedy them.  It is well known that that opportunity is given to every man in the House and it means that they get opportunities of meeting the people, of hearing them and dealing with their needs and desires.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barry has spoken of the equitation team.  They have won great victories and both horses and men have been a great advertisement for this nation.  They have won the highest honours at home and abroad, and we are all proud of them, but is it not regrettable that we see our very best riders, after winning the highest honours, leaving the Army more or less with untrained personnel in that department when they go to Canada or elsewhere, or into civil employment, rather than continue in the service for which they were trained and to which they had devoted themselves?  Something must be wrong in that regard. If a man wins the highest honours in the world, surely, if he is not to get a rise in pay through the ordinary channel of his rank, he should be raised to the rank which will enable him to get some recognition of his ability and some reward for his services.  That has not been done and instead we have, as in the case of many other Departments, this rule about so many officers and so many men, with the result that merit is not being adequately rewarded.</P>
    <P>There is provision in the Estimate for medals in recognition of past services. The scrupulous technicalities and investigations that are sometimes imposed on people now advanced in years, who took part years and years ago in the fight for freedom, when the officers who could verify their service in many cases have gone to their eternal <Col N="122" /> reward, to my mind are no great credit to this or to any former Government. Undoubtedly some people may get medals whose services may not meet with all the requirements envisaged when that token was established.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not dealing with it in the spirit of pensions at the moment or in that context.  I am dealing with it in another context.  We had men and women who gave outstanding service, but by reason of some technicality they did not get a service certificate or a medal, they were told they were people to whom the Act did not apply&mdash;an insult to themselves and an insult that their comrades will feel as long as we tread the land for which they fought and helped to free.  If there are inadequacies and if it can be pointed out that these people did give the service, if they were technically not members of Cumann na mBan but they fed the boys in the flying columns when they went around, if they scouted for them and went with them in order to disguise their purpose, it is poor recompense if people like that are to be deprived now of that little token of service, that they would not get that symbol for their deeds for freedom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think it would be right for me to delay the House on matters that have been dealt with already by many <Col N="123" /> other speakers.  I know the Minister himself has gone through it all, that he has met cases of the kind.  It will ill become us, all of us, on that side or this side of the House, if we are not generous, in their declining years, to the few remaining who were prepared to sacrifice all in the interests of the freedom of their native land.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1943" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I have just a few words to say on this Estimate.  Listening here last week and listening over recent years to the statements made on the Army Estimate by various Ministers, in different times, I have usually heard recruiting mentioned.  Why is recruiting not a success?  It is due to the treatment that was given when the Army was demobilised.  Where are the soldiers who served during the emergency?  They are not in Ireland, they had to emigrate.  That was not the fault of this Minister, but of the previous Minister.  There was no encouragement for those men, there were no jobs available and the soldiers did not get the priority they were promised when they came out of the Army.  People got jobs because they belonged to Fianna Fáil clubs, in preference to men from the Army.  That is a well-known fact all over the country. That was a very bad thing.</P>
      <P>We have to-day, as for many years past, our Army in its war dress, with steel helmets.  I think it is unnecessary to have men parading up and down outside Leinster House in full wartime kit in a peaceful country.  I hope that the Army, which always took part in the parade on the anniversary of General Michael Collins, will be allowed this year to honour that man. That was denied by the previous Government. It is a great shame that the Army would not be let take part in a parade on the anniversary of that great soldier.  I hope that will not happen any more and that a parade to that man's memory will always be carried out, whatever Minister is in this House, with full military honours, as it should be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the soldiers' quarters here in Dublin, I often get letters from people who are here in married quarters <Col N="124" /> or waiting to get into married quarters, while at the same time down the country there are fine forts where the Army was stationed during the emergency.  There is every equipment there and money was spent to put them into order for the soldiers, but to-day those forts are locked up, while soldiers are cramped here in the city. They could be down in those centres where they would be an asset to any village or town and where it would be good from a business point of view for the shops there.  It is not right that all our soldiers should be cramped here in the barracks and in the Curragh.  I met young men in the city and the objection they have is that they are sent away to the Curragh where there are only green fields and sheep and where on a race day they might see a few people.  They do not like to be put away like that.  There are fine places round the country where they could be put and where the people want them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>They would be worse than the Curragh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1943" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>We have a fort in County Wexford, in Duncannon, the finest fort you could make for soldiers. The Army was stationed there during the emergency.  That fort is locked up and the people in the area have asked me to raise the matter.  On one or two occasions I put down questions to the previous Minister, to see if he would have soldiers stationed there, but that would not be granted.  The present Minister should make a survey of places where soldiers would be suitable, instead of having them cramped in Collins Barracks and the Curragh. You cannot get young men to join an army if they are going to be put where there is no amusement but only a grave military camp.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the emergency and during the troubled times in my town, Enniscorthy Castle was occupied by troops. That castle is there idle, a burden on the rates, and it could be occupied by some portions of the Army.  It would do good to the town of Enniscorthy. Other places could be dealt with in the same way, instead of having the soldiers cramped in Dublin.  That is why <Col N="125" /> the recruiting drive is not a success. The young men see no future in the Army.  The young men of to-day know that their fathers who served during the emergency are now in England and Scotland.  Those young boys say: &ldquo;What did my father get out of the Army?  He had to emigrate.&rdquo;  These people say that they will not soldier if there is nothing to be got out of soldiering, not even a job.  The Minister should ensure as far as possible that men who are discharged from the Army and who are of good character will get every chance of employment in preference to people who belong to some political Party.</P>
    <P>We have seen two world wars and a civil war.  I hope that we will not see another war.  In the event of another war, an infantry army of soldiers with rifles would be like toys and the atomic bomb and aircraft employed by other nations would blow us away in a few hours.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made by Deputy Kennedy to the North and to the unfortunate things that happen there. These things, I suppose, have to happen. While young men have aspirations, they will go on, whether this House likes it or not, and there is very little we can do about it.  We have sympathy with men who have the courage of their convictions.  We would like to see peace prevailing and this unhappy state of affairs in North and South ended.  The sole cause of it is the people who are talking about peace and preparing for war.  We hear reference on the radio to meetings in Geneva and Salzsburg and other places while the big Powers are getting ready for war.  I cannot understand how peace will be brought about while people talk about peace and prepare for war.  They are spending millions for war and for war materials.</P>
    <P>For five or six years this House paid £7,000,000 to keep an Army.  When the war was over the men were demobbed and there were no millions provided to keep them employed.  We hear people talking about the high cost of this and the high cost of that but if war were to break out to-morrow money would be flowing freely for the purpose of destroying one another and burning the <Col N="126" /> nation.  There would be no scarcity of money.</P>
    <P>It is futile to talk about an army in the Twenty-Six Counties to compete with Russia, Britain and America.  To my mind the Army would be of very little use in face of bombs and aircraft.</P>
    <P>The Minister ought to improve the conditions of the soldiers who are still serving and to provide that when they leave the Army they will get some compensation instead of being thrown on the unemployed list.  There are men who have served the State faithfully and who are to-day, with their wives and families, in a very bad way because they have reached the age when the outside employer does not want them. A man who has served 21 years in the Army is advanced when he comes out and has very little hope of employment. Any man who has served his country should be compensated.</P>
    <P>Look at America.  Look at the pensions American soldiers get.  Look at the fine uniform they have and how well-dressed they are.  That is where the encouragement is.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the F.C.A. is a good thing or not.  It may have been all right during the emergency.  To-day a certain number of people go to Gormanston on their holidays.  They have a fortnight's holiday with pay and they get money from the Army as well. That is the only attraction there is in the F.C.A.  That is the reason they are in it.  If a man wants to be a soldier, it is in the Army he should be.  In the F.C.A. they can come and go as they like.  There is not much discipline there.  It is what I call a cheap army. It is taking recruits away from the Regular Army.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister will allow the Army and the Army bands to take part this year in the anniversary commemoration of Michael Collins.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Deputies for the interest they have taken in the Army.  At the outset I want to say that I am satisfied that the Army is a loyal, well-disciplined Army and that they are prepared to render service and loyalty to the State and to the elected Government of the country at all times.  As far as I am concerned, every effort will be made by <Col N="127" /> me to make the conditions of service the best that I can make them.  I am anxious that the Army would be contented and that every effort would be made to make it possible for them to render the service that the country expects from them in a joyous and friendly way.  I have no doubt that they will do that and I would ask Deputies not to bring the Army into the realm of political debate, whether it be Deputy McQuillan who is going to hold an investigation, since he had not time prior to this, or Deputy MacCarthy, because he was trotting around in the local elections meeting them for the first time.</P>

I think they are equal to, if not better than, the men that we have all the talk about, the men of my day and of Deputy MacCarthy's day and others' day.  As volunteers, they are of a higher and of a better standard than we were and that is not telling a bad story about them.  They are an excellent force.</P>
      <P>I will deal with some of the minor things first.  I get vexed myself when I see the uniform.  It is not fair to a voluntary force like them to have the uniform the way they have it but, if they had any pride, they have a mother or a sister who could put a stitch in it and pull it in here and there and not have it sticking out.</P>

      <P>There is a slipping-up somewhere in connection with certain articles of equipment.  I would like to take now some of the more serious points made by Deputy Traynor.  He said that recruiting was half-hearted and that it was the policy of the Government to reduce the Army to a certain strength.  That is not the policy of the Government.  The policy of the Government is to keep the Army at the highest possible level.  Deputy Traynor says my effort to recruit men was half-hearted.  I will give the comparative figures now showing the difference over the same period during his recruiting drive and mine.  The difference between us is not more than ten or 12 per month.  If my drive was half-hearted surely my predecessor's was equally half-hearted.</P>

There <Col N="129" /> was a certain political drive.  That is not there now.  I have done my best and I shall continue to do my best to keep the Army at the highest possible level.  I have budgeted this year for the Army I think I will have.  I think that is a reasonable course of action. There is no use my bringing in an Estimate for troops I will not have: I could give the comparative figures, but I do not think that would serve any useful purpose.</P>

It is true that men are not coming in since the end of the recruiting drive in the same numbers in which they came in during it.  That is the only difference.  In February, 1954, Deputy Traynor, then Minister for Defence, got 199 recruits.  In 1955 we got 113.  In March, 1954, Deputy Traynor got 168; in March, 1955, we got 182.</P>

      <P>It is true that Deputy Traynor, as Minister for Defence, kept up recruiting in 1953 and 1954 until he went out of office.  I am talking now about continuity, and I am taking 1954 and comparing it with 1955.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not my point of view.  It is the fact.  In February, 1954, when Deputy Traynor was Minister the number of recruits was 199.  In February of this year I got 113.  In March, 1954, Deputy Traynor got 168; in March, 1955, I got 182.  Now, where is the difference?</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Traynor had his heart in it just as well as I had and that is the best he could do. I am not complaining.  But the Deputy should not blame me for not being able to get all the men we would like.  The argument to-day is that one must have compulsory service.</P>

      <P>The Deputy himself said he was not as successful last year as he would have liked, but he did his best.  So did I.  I will continue to do my best and I am satisfied that the number going out now is less than was anticipated.  I am also glad to say that what has gone out is going on to the Reserve and staying on it.  The F.C.A. is increasing in numbers and between the two Forces we will in time have a well-balanced Army and we will be able to look after our own defence and implement the defence policy decided upon by our Government.  I have no doubt about that.</P>

      <P>All I can say is that a precedent has been established. One can recruit in the winter and spring.  One cannot recruit in the summer when the young men are wanted on the farms.  That has been the pattern for a considerable period. Why should the Deputy want me to change it?  If it is not a good thing, surely my predecessor should have changed it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="131" /> Deputy Traynor referred to the reduction in the Estimate this year for civil defence.  Now Deputy Traynor is a director of the <i>Irish Press</i> and, judging by the report in that paper, he has more information on this matter than I have myself.  The <i>Irish Press</i> says we are doing a lot of things, things I am very glad to learn about, but I do not think the statement is exactly correct; nevertheless the <i>Irish Press</i> has informed the public as to what we are doing.  I will give the figures now for civil defence for a number of years past.  In 1951-52, the Estimate for civil defence was £120,390; we spent £2,718.  In 1952-53, the Estimate was £63,359; we spent £10,382.  In 1953-54, the Estimate was £56,139; we spent £23,000.  In 1954-55 the Estimate was £60,658; all we spent was £17,700.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>And the Minister knows why.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the use of my putting in a lump sum of £120,000 when I know I will not spend it?  Is it not better to put in a figure I believe I can spend and one that I will make every effort to spend?  We are going ahead with expenditure now and is it not better for me to put down the exact figure rather than an inflated figure which will never be reached?  What was the good of my predecessor putting in a figure of £63,359 in 1952-53 and only spending £10,000?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>We were always hoping.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>If I spend £45,000 this year, will that not be more than four times better than Deputy Traynor was hoping to spend in the year 1952-53? That is not a bad figure.  I am not satisfied in relation to uniforms. I want to improve them.  I want to improve the conditions of the soldiers and make soldiers generally as comfortable as they can be.  Every effort will be made by me to make every man in the Army proud of his uniform.  I agree that for walking-out, and events like that, a uniform should be attractive and that it should be of good <Col N="132" /> quality which will wear well as well as look well.  I hope that at an early stage some improvement will be made in regard to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister was referring to a surplus of uniforms, was he referring to a surplus of F.C.A. uniforms?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  There is a surplus generally, but there is a deficiency in some items.  On the question of the Naval Service, the strength for which provision is made is unchanged as compared with last year and, therefore, the charge of a reduction is without any foundation.  There is no reduction but an increase.  There was reference to the new naval vessels, and in regard to these, my predecessor had entered into commitments.  The fitting and equipment of them is somewhat slow but they are coming.  Deputy Desmond, I think, considers we should not have taken them.  He thinks that Cork could have done better.  I do not want to say anything about that except that this commitment had been entered into and we could not get out of it even if we wished to do so.  But I am satisfied that the boats are of good quality and will serve the purpose for which we require them.</P>
      <P>Deputy Desmond referred to winches and a mobile crane and that sort of thing.  All I want to say in regard to that is that all these things are not idle.  I think the Deputy was not quite fair in some of the remarks he made concerning them.  The crane which he mentioned is being utilised.  Certain weaknesses have been discovered on the road in which the crane is used but these will be corrected in a short time.</P>
      <P>Deputy Traynor referred to Army marriage allowances and these are a fairly stable element in our Army's expenditure and show a tendency to increase. I think it is not a bad thing that men are prepared to get married in the Army and I would not like to be responsible for stopping or slowing down that tendency.  I think it is wise to have the provision there, and then if they get married we have it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are proceeding as rapidly as we can with the improvement of barracks conditions and married quarters <Col N="133" /> generally.  In the last Estimate £117,000 was provided for certain new buildings and there is provision in this year's Estimate of £41,750 to complete these particular buildings.  I brought in a Supplementary Estimate for £10.  We had sufficient savings to cover that particular building but there is now £41,750 in the Estimate this year to complete that and other buildings.</P>
    <P>Deputy Traynor thought I should not have mentioned the sum of £1,800,000 shown last year for defensive equipment and then reduced it by a certain sum.  That, it appears, is a financial arrangement and it has to appear in a subsequent year.</P>
    <P>On the question of borrowing to provide portion of the defensive equipment the situation this year is the same as last year.  The Minister for Finance referred to that in his Budget statement. Barracks stores and services are also the same.  It is very hard to estimate that item but for 1954-55 we have based it upon an increase, that the next year will show an increase of £7,400.  We were out considerably last year.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies referred to the Army School of Equitation and I think many of them were misinformed about the situation.  The team is good, and I would like to point out that at Nice this year our young team met the world's champions, one a Spaniard and the other a German, but notwithstanding that, the Irish team at Nice won 12 money prizes including the Grand Prix which is awarded in one of the biggest competitions there. We got very little publicity for it.  We won 12 money prizes and two third places.  Here is a report by an out-places. Here is a report by an observer:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The manner in which one of our young officers won the Grand Prix after two rounds, the second round at speed, brought credit to the fame of the Irish horse.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is something of which we can be proud.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>And they are a young team.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>And they got no <Col N="134" /> credit for it.  In Rome, all the Nice competitors were there plus the Italian team which included three really accomplished riders.  During the nine-day Show all the events were divided between three Italians and two Frenchmen but our team gained 13 money prizes, including two third prizes.  One of these events was a Puissance.  The winner had two jumps in the last round&mdash;a fence of 6 ft. 8 ins. and another of 7 ft.  The other event was a speed competition and the winner was only three seconds ahead of the Irish officer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that is very creditable but I hope there is no significance in the fact that it was money prizes they won.  Does the Minister agree that the allowances given to the Irish officers really compare with the allowances given to French, German, Spanish, Italian and other officers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come back to that.  I am talking about the prizes they won.  The criticism of the Army team was that they were not as wonderful this year as they had been in the past.  I am only showing that they were up to the best standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a young team and they are a great team.  Some of them never rode a horse until they came into the Army.  That is splendid work.  If we had a large number from which to make a selection it would have been different.  I am perfectly satisfied that with the material available they are doing well.  I hope to improve the position.  This week we suffered the loss of a very valuable horse which had shown great promise. These things happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think there is very much more to which I should advert except the question of expenses of the Army officers going abroad on courses or in connection with equitation events.  That has been a bone of contention.  The only thing I can say is that they are generally guests of a country.  While they are in a country their expenses are high but, perhaps, not as high as <Col N="135" /> they might be but, whether they are or not, I believe in the principle that when we send a team of Army officers to jumping events or any other kind of events they should be able to do as well as anybody else, if not better.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I am concerned I will make every effort. Mother Hubbard still remains in the Department of Finance but I know well that the present Minister for Finance is as anxious as any of us that Army officers, particularly those in the Equitation School, would get a fair crack of the whip.  Finally, on this question of promotions and of extending the service of certain Army officers, the number is small.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Deputy would wait.  With regard to extending the Army service of certain officers the number is, as I have already said, small.  A very great number is not affected.  A good many were foundation members of the Army and there would not have been any Army at all were it not for some of them.  I felt we could extend their service for the two years.  It is not much.  I want to make sure that there will be compensation at the other end for the junior officers.  I will make an effort to have that brought in at an early date.  Proposals are already being examined as to what is the best method.  But whatever method is established, whether it is by way of automatic promotion after a certain number of years, I will see to it that they will not suffer anything because of this extension of service in respect of the senior officers.</P>
      <P>I do not think there is anything sinister in regard to the &ldquo;brass hats&rdquo;. The &ldquo;brass hats&rdquo;&mdash;I think my predecessors will agree with me&mdash;had not the disbursement of the money.  They did not come in and say: &ldquo;Here is so much for each one.&rdquo;  That was not the way it was done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister be prepared to consider giving a reasonably good uniform allowance to every man in a jumping team?  It is very important that when our officers go to the Continent they would have plenty of uniforms and sufficient changes of boots.  If it happens that it rains they often have to turn out in uniforms that have had to be pressed and they might not be as well turned out as the Minister would like to have them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the Minister, in his rather comprehensive reply, omitted to deal with the question of army personnel who suffer from T.B.

If I do not improve on that state of affairs I certainly will not worsen it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (General MacEoin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £1,072,700 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1956, for Wound and Disability Pensions, further Pensions and Married Pensions, Allowances and Gratuities (No. 26 of 1923, No. 12 of 1927, No. 24 of 1932, No. 15 of 1937, No. 2 of 1941, No. 14 of 1943, No. 3 of 1946, Nos. 19 and 28 of 1949 and No. 23 of 1953); Military Service Pensions, Allowances and Gratuities (No. 48 of 1924, No. 26 of 1932, No. 43 of 1934, No. 33 of 1938, No. 5 of 1944, Nos. 11 and 34 of 1945, Nos. 7 and 28 of 1949 and No. 5 of 1953); Pensions, Allowances and Gratuities (No. 37 of 1936, No. 9 of 1948, No. 30 of 1950, No. 27 of 1952 and No. 4 of 1953); Payments in respect of Compensation for Members of the Local Defence Forces (No. 19 of 1946 and No. 15 of 1949); and for sundry Contributions and Expenses in respect thereof, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main provisions in this Estimate are for pensions under the Military Service Pensions Acts; wound and disability pensions, special allowances, dependents' allowances and gratuities <Col N="138" /> under the Army Pensions Acts; service pensions and gratuities under the Defence Forces (Pensions) Schemes in respect of service in the Permanent Defence Force.</P>
    <P>The total sum required for 1955-56 is £1,609,000, which is an increase of £134,600 on the Estimate for 1954-55. The main increases occur in sub-heads F, I, J and O.</P>
    <P>The increase of £31,336 in sub-head F&mdash;Allowances and Gratuities to Dependents, etc.&mdash;is due to provision for additional cases under the Army Pensions Act, 1953, which will come on pay during the year.  These allowances and gratuities are payable to widows, parents and, in certain circumstances, brothers and sisters of persons who had pre-Truce service and who gave their lives in the struggle of the 1916 to 1923 period.</P>
    <P>The increases of £10,860 in sub-head I&mdash;Military Service Pensions&mdash; and £18,200 in sub-head J&mdash;Defence Forces (Pensions) Schemes&mdash;are due to provision for additional cases coming on pay during the year.  In addition, provision has been made in sub-head J for increases in pensions and gratuities to personnel retired or discharged since 1st November, 1952, from which date increased pay came into operation.</P>
    <P>In sub-head O the increase is £81,000.  This is the sub-head under which special allowances are paid to Old I.R.A. men, etc., who satisfy the statutory conditions.  The increase is due to provision for additional cases which will qualify during the year.</P>
    <P>I trust that this brief outline of the reasons for the increased provisions will help Deputies in their examination of the Estimate.  If more detailed explanations are required I shall be happy to give them.</P>
    <P>Last year, I stated, in relation to Military Service Pensions, that I proposed to allow the present phase to be completed under existing legislation when I hoped to have a picture of the situation which would assist me in considering whether anything further would need to be done.  At that time there were about 5,000 cases to be reported upon, together with such additional new applications as would be <Col N="139" /> received up to the 18th March, 1955, the closing date for these applications. Since the 1st June last the number of new applications received is 450.  In the ordinary course a substantial number of the 5,000 cases which were outstanding at 31st May, 1954, would have been dealt with by the end of December, 1954.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, owing to the untimely death of the Referee in September, 1954, it was not possible to get ahead with the examination of outstanding cases as quickly as I had hoped.  The new Referee was not available until 1st January, 1955, and the work is now proceeding as rapidly as possible.  I am advised that the disposal of outstanding cases will take about two years, but I am hopeful that it may be possible to reduce this period.  Until these cases are out of the way, I do not think that it would be advisable to come to any decision as to the future course of action.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>There does not appear to be anything of a very controversial nature in the sub-heads which go to make up this Estimate.  I notice a small decrease of £100 in sub-head D for travelling expenses.  I was hoping that this did not mean that there would be any decrease in the travelling of members of the board to the country to examine cases rather than in having that work done in the board's offices.  As well as I remember, when the board went to the various counties to examine cases that practice was very successful from the point of view of the number of cases which the board was able to deal with. The general impression created on my mind at the time was that that practice was rather useful from the point of view of an expeditious clearance of these particular cases.  I would be sorry to think that the decrease in the sub-head, which is relatively small, would in any way affect that plan of the members gong around to deal with cases outside the board's offices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice that under sub-head E&mdash; Wound and Disability Pensions and Gratuities, etc.&mdash;there is a decrease of £8,907.  I presume that is due to <Col N="140" /> deaths or it might be due perhaps to a lowering of the pension disability.  The decrease, however, represents a rather large sum and I should like to hear the Minister explain the reason for it.  I am glad to see that under sub-head F there is an increase of £31,336.  In connection with this sub-head I note with very great pleasure that something like 182 widows, parents and others are now benefiting under the 1953 Act.  That is something which I think the House generally can be proud of because the Deputies gave very unanimous support to that particular Act when it was going through the Dáil.</P>
    <P>Sub-head H which deals with hospital treatment shows a decrease of £550.  I have been wondering what is the cause of the decrease, if it is due to a decline in the number of patients or perhaps to the difficulty of applicants becoming entitled to hospital treatment.  Sub-head I shows an increase of £10,860.  It is interesting to note that the number of persons now benefiting under the Military Service Pensions Acts of 1924 and 1934 is practically 14,000 and that these Acts are being administered at a cost of £614,404, with probable additional charges.  I think that is all to the good.  At least, it shows that the State is carrying out its commitments to the people who have been successful under this sub-head.</P>
    <P>Sub-head O, to which the Minister made reference, deals with special allowances.  This sub-head shows an increase of £81,000.  Again, it will be, I am sure, of great interest, to Deputies to know that the number of people who are now benefiting under that particular Act is in the region of 4,000, and that it is costing the State £381,000.</P>
    <P>In connection with that sub-head, it has been brought to my notice that there are numbers of cases in which men made application for pensions. They made the application in a period which would entitle them, had they made the application for a medal, to be granted a medal, but having made an application for a pension&mdash;as we all know &ldquo;hope springs eternal in the human breast&rdquo;&mdash;they felt certain that <Col N="141" /> their claim would succeed.  Their hopes were, unfortunately, dashed, because the period within which they could have applied for the medal had expired.  The result was that they fell to the ground, between the two stools. As a result they lost the right to apply for the special allowance although the former Minister had approved of the issue of the medal without the medal carrying the allowance.</P>
    <P>We have a number of individuals who were in receipt of medals but through some slight technicality are deprived of the right of applying for a special allowance.  When Deputy MacCarthy was speaking on the Defence Estimate he raised the question of the medals and I think he had something like that in mind and that he was being confronted by a number of individuals in that position.  I would be glad if the Minister would look into the question of whether anything can be done to rectify that position which could not be foreseen by the unfortunate people who are involved in it.  These people felt that in making the application for the pension they were within the period and fairly safe to qualify for the special allowance.  Unfortunately it did not turn out that way.</P>
    <P>As a matter of interest, I would like to know from the Minister how many persons have been successful in securing pensions under the 1949 Act. I had these returns fairly regularly and I am sure the Minister is getting them just as regularly as I was getting them. When I was leaving office the number was in the region of well over 1,000 and I am wondering how many have been added since then.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EugeneGilbride" hpid="Mr. Gilbride Mr. Gilbride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilbride</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say a word or two regarding one or two points which mostly come under sub-head O in connection with the special allowance.  I am glad to see that the Minister has increased the amount by £81,000 but I regret very much to say that in my area a large number of the people who were in receipt of the special allowance are being knocked out of it.  I have already brought a few cases to the notice of the Minister. During the last few days not a single <Col N="142" /> day passes but that I receive a notice telling a person that the allowance has ceased.  I see that the number in receipt of it has gone from 2,906 in 1953-54 to 3,896 in 1954-55.  From what I can see there must be a terrible lot of new people going on to the list because in my native parish practically two thirds of the people who received the special allowance since the thing started are being knocked off.  I hope that will not continue and I hope the Minister will look into the matter and see that it is rectified.</P>
      <P>I regret that the Minister could not see his way to accept a motion which I have tabled in regard to another matter&mdash;the award of special allowances for the medal.  Why I brought this before his notice was that I came across a case of an application made for a very long period and the case was hanging fire all the time.  In one particular case it was put back from time to time for eight or nine years.  This case was not decided until after the claimant died on the 31st August, 1954. These people were then told that they did not qualify for a certificate.  They felt that if they had applied for a medal previous to that that it would have lessened their chance of getting a certificate and a lot of them thought that one application was quite enough &mdash;and that when they applied for a certificate it should have covered the application for a medal as well.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister should take steps to remedy that matter.  The Minister may say that he advocated this at the time the Bill was going through the House but it is in his hands now to do it.  There is no Bill but requires amendment from time to time.  This, in my opinion, is a case for an amendment because there are cases of persons who would not qualify for a certificate but would qualify for a pension.  I ask the Minister to seriously consider that case and to do something about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the same sub-head there is a very hard case.  I have a letter here from the Minister's office but I will not give the name of the person referred to for obvious reasons.  This is the case of a woman who applied for a <Col N="143" /> special allowance in respect of the death of her son.  Her case was considered and at the time of her death I think the claim was actually passed. She died some time in May, 1954, and her family was told that as the allowance was not granted until some time in August, 1954, no other member of the family could obtain it.  Now they come along and state that sub-section (2) of Section 5 of the Act says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Where on the death of a relative while in receipt of an allowance under this Part, there are one or more surviving relatives (being relatives mentioned in Section 4 of this Act) of such deceased person, the Minister may, on application being made to him, grant to such one of said surviving relatives of such deceased person as he may direct, such allowance mentioned in this Part as may be appropriate.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These people were under the impression that when the pension was awarded the next of kin would qualify and now they are told that that is not so and that so long as the money was not actually being paid the relatives were debarred from getting the money. In this case it was the daughter.  I think that is a case that the Minister could fix up without any legislation whatever.  I do not want to give the name but the Minister will know who I am speaking about.  Representations were made to the Minister by another Deputy and I think this is a case of very grave injustice.</P>
    <P>This man lost his life in the service of his country.  His mother applied under the 1953 Act and was going to be granted an allowance or, in fact, it was actually granted.  Due to no fault of hers, but due to the delay of the Department, the money was not paid before her death and because the money was not actually paid, her daughter is now debarred from receiving this allowance.</P>
    <P>These are just a few of the things I would like to point out to the Minister and I would ask him to take steps to have them remedied.  As regards the case of the medal, I am told that the Minister was prepared to take the <Col N="144" /> motion and deal with it and I was informed then a few days ago that the Minister was not prepared to take it. I think he will agree with the justice of the claims of these people.  These people have been left for a long number of years through no fault of their own, but because of delay by the Pensions Board in dealing with their cases.  Some of them who might not have been eligible for an allowance according to the Act might have qualified for a medal, but because they did not make separate application for that medal before the end of August, 1954, nothing could be done about it.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to see that justice is done in regard to these people.  They are getting old and it is very nearly time that all this business was wound up.  It is now over 30 years going on and I think the quicker it is wound up the better.  I would remind the Minister that he promised that if he got into power he would deal with all these matters and see that the Old I.R.A. men and their dependents were properly treated.  He has this matter in his own hands now and I can assure him that as far as this side of the House is concerned, anything he does to help these people will have our full support.  I would also ask him to look into the question of special allowances.  I could produce evidence of people who have been in receipt of a special allowance since the Act came into force but who are being deprived of it day after day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilbride</NameTxt>
      <P>In one particular case there were no grounds stated.  In another case it was because the man's wife became of age for the old age pension.  I do not know whether, when a woman comes to 70 years of age and is in receipt of a pension, that is sufficient cause for withdrawing the allowance.  This man was in receipt of £80 a year and he was deprived of the whole amount.  There is another case I know of where a man is in very bad health.  His family are grown up and are out working.  One young man is driving a lorry.  He has to be fed and clothed and kept in that house and <Col N="145" /> every Deputy will realise that when a young man hands his mother £2 or £3 a week there is very little profit from it at the end of the week.  This young man I am speaking about is on the point of getting married and is trying to save up a few pounds and naturally that makes for a very difficult situation. I would ask the Minister to look into these problems and remedy the situation.</P>

      <P>Where are they coming from?  After all, the 1916 men are passing away; they are getting old and we still have 5,000 looking for pensions. There is one thing that Deputy Gilbride must remember, that only for the Act that was brought in by the Minister for Defence in 1949, a good many of the Old I.R.A. men would not have special allowances, to-day.  They were deprived of them by the ex-Minister, Deputy Traynor, and his Party.  I know there are genuine cases of men still deprived of them.  In my own particular case when I made application I was turned down.  I happened to be on a different platform from my colleagues; my comrades got the pension but I was refused as a person to whom the Act did not apply.  These are the things I see as wrong.  They have happened no later than in the past year, where the Referee went the rounds and political influence was used.  If you were not a Fianna Fáil supporter you were deprived of the pension.  In regard to the special allowance I had a case, the particulars of which I sent to the Department.  This man was refused a special allowance; he was a man on crutches and to my mind was a deserving case, but he was considered ineligible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a I have said, many of the old 1916 men are passing away.  There were very few towns actually involved except Galway, Dublin and Enniscorthy, my own native town.  There <Col N="146" /> are 1916 men in Enniscorthy who have no pension but who were imprisoned while other people who had not taken an active part got a pension through influence.  I think that caused a serious grievance among Old I.R.A. men. The Minister met a deputation of Old I.R.A. men from my constituency not long ago.  We were hoping the Act would be brought in for the benefit of people who deserved consideration. However, I cannot see for the life of me why 5,000 are still waiting, because if we had all those 5,000 in 1916 we would have swept the British Army out in a few days.  As I said, the I.R.A. men were centred around a few places. We had them in the City of Dublin we had them in Galway and Enniscorthy Town.  Those were the three principal places which took part in the Rising.</P>
    <P>In my native town, we have men who have been deprived by previous Governments of their rights.  These injustices existed to a greater extent up to 1949 and it is only under the Act of 1949 that some people belonging to the Old I.R.A. are enjoying their pension and special allowance.  I would like to know why Deputy Kilbride, seeing that he is in the House over such a long period, did not raise these matters when his Party was in power and when these injustices still existed. In regard to some people from my town who complained not so long ago to the Minister of their grievances in regard to 1916 service, the Minister in his reply stated that he could do nothing until a legislative provision was brought in to cover them.  Many of these people will be gone to Heaven if the Act is not brought in soon and no reward will have been given to them in compensation for their services to the nation.</P>
    <P>They have been let down badly by previous Ministers for Defence with regard to pensions.  The whole pension scheme was designed on a political basis, and, in the case of some who soldiered side by side during 1916, some got it and some did not, while people who took part in the civil war had no bother about getting it.  There were more pensions given to people who took part in the civil war than were given to people who took part in <Col N="147" /> 1916 and it was for the latter people that the Act was designed.</P>
    <P>We had the same thing happening in the case of the Connaught Rangers, and in my town there is a man who took part in the mutiny in India who was deprived of a pension.  He was almost shot in India for his part in the mutiny, but he could not get the pension, while other people who did not take any active part at all in it got through by the use of influence.  I myself went before the Court of Referees and was put into the witness box.  I produced all the documents and papers but I got a letter back from the Department saying I was not a person to whom the Act applied. There are probably people drawing pensions who should not be drawing them.  Thank God, I do not want a pension, because I have my health and strength, but people who really deserve them should get them.</P>
    <P>An Old I.R.A. man comes to your house and shows you a form.  His special allowance is held up, and, when you get in touch with the Department, you get the usual reply that they are reviewed every year, which means that some of these men must wait two and three months before getting their allowances back.  When a man undergoes a medical examination in Glasnevin and is passed for a disability pension or special allowance, it should be left there and should not be subject to review every year, with resulting anxiety to a man and his family for two or three months. The allowance has been granted on medical grounds and it should not be stopped for any review.  Yet, the situation is that we are told that these special allowances are granted only from year to year.  I suggest that the Minister should look into it and remedy that situation.</P>
    <P>No later than this morning an Old I.R.A. man came in to me with his form.  He asked me if he was being cut off.  The form merely showed that he was to get £65 up to June, 1956 but, the poor man did not know what it was.  There are men who are very sore because of the way they have <Col N="148" /> been treated&mdash;genuine Old I.R.A. men who suffered terms of imprisonment, and were on the run.  These men to-day have nothing, while they see others who prabably did not give as much service as they gave enjoying big pensions. It is giving rise to grievances and unhappiness amongst sections of the people.</P>
    <P>The greatest scandal of all is that, when an Old I.R.A. man dies, his wife is thrown on the scrap-heap.  All she can get is a non-contributory pension. In the case of British legislation, when such a pensioner dies the pension goes on to his widow and surely this House will look after the widow of an Old I.R.A. man instead of leaving her to live on a non-contributory pension or on home assistance.  These Old I.R.A. men are dying out and there must be a saving every year for that reason.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the system by which these allowances are subject to review every year is wrong and I urge the Minister to remedy that situation. There is no Old I.R.A. man to-day happy because he does not know whether this allowance will be taken from him next year.  There is no security for him and the Minister should look into it, because, in a few years time, there will be very few of these Old I.R.A. men left.  In the case of the widow of an Old I.R.A. man, because her husband had not got stamps, she is entitled not to a contributory pension but only to the mere pittance provided by a non-contributory pension.  I am putting these facts before the Minister earnestly and in all good faith because these people should get the best the country can give them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFlynn" hpid="Mr. J. Flynn Mr. J. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer to the point made by Deputy Gilbride about the medals and people in receipt of the special allowance, from another angle.  I noticed that the Minister was inclined to query his statement.  Down our way, people have been deprived of the special allowance on the ground that they were not eligible for the medal, in the first instance.  I have no objection whatever to inquiries being put through all the proper channels, but junior officers, who are not conversant <Col N="149" /> with the facts, have been asked to submit evidence in regard to these matters, while senior officers, men who had service with the applicants and who should know the facts as to their eligibility in the first instance, are ignored.  I should like to see some review of the whole position being undertaken by the Department.</P>
      <P>The point at issue mainly is that the men concerned did not have continuous active service or continuous service for three months prior to July, 1921.  That is the qnalifying period, but who is the best judge of that?  Is it the company officer, the battalion officer or the brigade officer?  I have known cases where men have been communicated with who did not fall into any of these categories and their evidence was accepted.  Is it not quite possible that there could be a miscarriage of justice in these cases, that a query could be sent up by some man with malice against a particular applicant?  I am not saying that it did happen, but it could, and I would now, therefore, plead to have the whole position reviewed so that there would be a different approach to the whole question by the Department.</P>
      <P>I tabled a question here some time ago asking the Minister if he were prepared to make a statement in regard to the men who applied for service pensions under the 1949 Act and in his reply he stated that that would be done when the present phase was completed.  In a statement here this evening he said there are 5,000 cases to be considered and that it will take two years to complete consideration of these claims.  Therefore, if the present phase were extended for another two years the Minister's reply to my question was a very safe one but a very forlorn and hopeless reply from the point of view of the men who will have to wait for another two years, who are already old men and who have to wait patiently for some decision or another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as I can remember, the Minister made a statement during the last general election campaign that if a Government were elected in which he <Col N="150" /> would be a Minister he guaranteed that he would introduce legislation dealing once and for all with all these cases and that he would have introduced a satisfactory measure guaranteeing that justice would be done to these men.  I have no doubt that the Minister had the best intentions in the world but if it happens, as it is now happening, that he has to wait until the present phase is completed the men who accepted his statement in good faith during the last election campaign will be hopelessly disappointed.</P>
    <P>There is one other point that I should like to raise before I finish and it concerns a question raised a few moments ago by Deputy O'Leary with regard to the widows of men in receipt of special allowances.  I think a great case could be made on their behalf and I concur with every word which Deputy O'Leary and other Deputies have said on their behalf.  I think something should be done for them.  In reply to a question tabled by me on this point, the Minister said he had no intention of introducing legislation to improve their position.  Despite that, I would like to appeal again to the Minister to consider their case because, as we are aware, and as Deputy O'Leary stated, they are thrown on the scrap-heap.  They have nothing to come back on except a non-contributory pension and in every country in the world the dependents of men who are in receipt of pensions for services rendered to their countries are provided for in some measure.  This is the least we could expect on behalf of the widows and the dependents of such men here.</P>

      <P>I did not intend to intervene in this discussion or to delay the Minister, but I feel I must do so because of statements made by Deputy O'Leary.  He stated here, and I am sure he has stated this outside the House, that the pensions given during the Fianna Fáil term of office were given on political grounds.  We have had statements of that kind made at various times and in respect of various Governments.  I know there is no truth in that statement whatsoever. I know also that the boards appointed <Col N="151" /> by the respective Ministers were composed of honourable men and that the Referees were honourable men and I am sure every one concerned understands that as well as Deputy O'Leary or any other member of the House.</P>

      <P>That was the Deputy's own business.  Perhaps he knew well why he should not get a pension&mdash;that there was nothing in his case.  A great deal depends on what verifying officers can prove, on the board and the Referees, on what the evidence given in the first instance is.  A great deal depends on the verification of the verifying officers and very often the verifying officers have an easy way out when they meet people of Deputy O'Leary's type who do not have a case.  They say: &ldquo;This is the best we can do for you&rdquo; and they pass on the buck and the Referees and the board are blamed that the pensions were withheld on political grounds.  Deputy O'Leary also mentioned that a number of old I.R.A. men would be getting special allowances were it not for the action of Fianna Fáil.</P>

      <P>I would like to remind the House that a provision dealing with the claiming of medals for service was brought in here in 1941-42 and that in 1946 an amending Bill was brought in which carried with it a pension for those who had received medals, under certain conditions of course, such as infirmity.  It also carried the means test.  That Act was improved in 1949 by way of increasing the amounts. Deputy O'Leary now tries to make the people believe through the newspapers that Fianna Fáil did nothing for the I.R.A.  It was in fact Fianna Fáil who were responsible for enacting legislation to cover the 1916 men who were not provided for under the 1924 Act if my recollection is right.  Why make statements of that kind and why bring in matters which make for acrimonious discussion in the House?</P>

      <P>Do we not all know very well that all Governments were inclined to do whatever they could for the old I.R.A. and why should they not?  Were it not for the activities of those men we would not be here at all. A number of them have been overlooked because of defects in legislation but these defects should be pointed out and it should then be left to the good judgment of the Minister concerned and the Government of the day to have these defects remedied.  That is what is being asked in this motion which Deputy Gilbride said the Minister would not accept.  The Minister is here listening, anyway, and even if he is not accepting the motion I am very grateful to him for remaining here and listening to what has been said in regard to those people who made applications for service certificates and whose cases had not been decided until after the time had expired as in the case of applications for medals. Another aspect of the matter mentioned by Deputy O'Leary is that we had I.R.A. organisations all over the <Col N="153" /> country who foolishly advised their members not to apply for medals within the stipulated period if by doing so it would be detrimental to their claims for military service certificates. In view of that, the Minister should examine the position and if at all possible he should bring in an amendment to cover those people.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I may say that of all the Acts brought in to help the Old I.R.A., to assist them in their old age and their difficulties and to show them some recognition for the, services they rendered, the 1946 Act, carrying the special allowances for those who had service in the I.R.A., was the best pension Act of the whole lot.  There are people to-day drawing special allowances in their infirmity and old age who, if they had qualified for a military service pension, would not be getting a fraction of the amount they are getting as a special allowance.</P>

      <P>I rise to support the points that have been made about the medals.  It seems to me to be quite inequitable that men who hold the same medal should be treated differently. The question of the date, if it was going to be treated as sacrosanct, should have prohibited the issuing of further medals.  It creates great dissatisfaction if men who get the same medal get different treatment as a result when they come into similar circumstances.</P>
      <P>Undoubtedly, a number of men were persuaded not to apply for a medal on the ground that it would injure the claims they had then current for pension. I think we all know a number of men affected in that way.  By the time they got the result of their application for the ordinary military service pension, they found themselves out of date in regard to applying for the medal. I do not see that there should be any great administrative difficulty in treating the application for the pension, whether turned down or not, as an application for a medal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This whole question of dates is an old difficulty.  The Minister himself, I remember, spoke very strongly about it and we all agreed with him.  He has the opportunity now of trying to do <Col N="154" /> something about it.  We know his difficulties and what he will be up against. I suggest and plead to him that the former Minister made a good advance in the 1953 Act, although there were some things, like dates, in it that none of us liked.  He might be able to persuade his Government to go a step further in removing some of the difficulties. There is no doubt about the great benefit that the special allowance has been to a number of Old I.R.A. men now reaching advancing years and who find themselves in poor circumstances. There will be unanimity in this House if such grievances as have arisen under this question&mdash;of some medals entitling a man to the special allowance and others not doing so&mdash; can be removed.</P>
    <P>There is a further question in connection with the 1953 Act that I find cropping up, that is a question of dates again.  It was general in that Act, as regards the pensions to widows, sisters and other relatives, that they had to apply within a year.  I have found some cases in which the people did not even know of it until after a year.  I suppose that for the most part, being womenkind and owing to the duties they have, they do not follow the papers and apparently were unlucky in that nobody told them.  I know one case of a sister who, from what I know of the circumstances, would be absolutely entitled to the pension, but who did not know it until December, 1954&mdash; and I think the application should have been in by August, 1954.  She applied to the Department and of course got the reply that the date was over and that the case could not now be considered.  I know of some other cases, too, on the same basis but in this particular case I have mentioned I know the circumstances and there is not a doubt about the person being entitled to the pension.  She is in poor circumstances and in bad health, which makes it a good deal worse.  I would appeal to the Minister to see if he could do anything about that.</P>
    <P>We all know that in all these cases of dates there had to be extensions to meet genuine cases in the past.  I do not think there is any use thinking that the date in the 1953 Act will not have <Col N="155" /> to be extended&mdash;any more than all the other dates&mdash;and I suggest and appeal to the Minister that it be done at once rather than wait for a few years, because in all those cases the people are getting older and getting very old in some cases.  I suggest that there should not be any delay on it, if possible. If the Minister can succeed in doing away with the dates altogether, we will all be only too happy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>We can, if we wish, bring in the official records and quote back the Ministers' speeches on the 1953 Act and on some of the Estimates in regard to pensions, to show when people should be entitled to pensions. Quite recently, men who were preparing a case for the Minister, through the associated organisations of the Old I.R.A., quoted the Minister's speech and used it as an argument, that they were going to get immediately a rectification of whatever grievances they suffered in regard to service pensions, disability pensions and special allowances. I do not propose to go into that here to-night, but I want to deal with the administration of the special allowances.</P>
      <P>There is no commencing date in the Act for special allowances.  When a man applies he has to wait his turn before his case is dealt with by the Army Pensions Board, the medical board, and a decision arrived at as to whether he is entitled to a special allowance or not.  I find that the special allowance does not commence to be paid from the date of his application. It is doubtful if payment commences from the date on which the board makes its decision that the man is incapable of self-support by reason of infirmity of body or mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think I am right in saying that the Department of Finance enters into the question of the date from which the applicant is entitled to be paid his special allowance.  When the social welfare officer investigates the applicant's means under the Act, if there is considerable delay between the date of that investigation and the date on which the Department of Finance or the Department of Defence decide that a special allowance should be paid, a <Col N="156" /> second investigation into the applicant's means takes place.  I do not think that that second investigation should be carried out.  In several instances there has been a second investigation into the applicant's means.  If a man applies for a special allowance and if the medical board is satisfied that he is totally incapable of self-support by reason of infirmity of body or mind&mdash;the words laid down in the Act&mdash;from the date on which he is examined or from the date on which he made the application, such person is entitled to and should be paid the special allowance and not from a subsequent date or a date which somebody in the Department of Finance or the Department of Defence desires.</P>
    <P>I came across a case in which a man was subjected to a second investigation. Somebody, either in the Department of Social Welfare or the Department of Defence, decided that the man was in receipt of 36/- a week National Health Insurance benefit.  He had other income, of course, and this 36/-, that he was alleged to be in receipt of, put him over the appropriate sum named in the Act and he was refused the allowance.  When the matter was pursued further it came to light that the man was not in receipt of 36/- a week National Health Insurance benefit. The Department of Social Welfare informed me that he had never been entitled to and had never been in receipt of this National Health Insurance benefit.  I went back to the Department of Social Welfare for confirmation and that is the information I received.</P>
    <P>The Department of Defence say that they cannot under any circumstances review the decision that was made by which this man was deprived of one year's special allowance as a result of a mistake made by somebody either in the Department of Defence or in the Department of Social Welfare.  I do not think the matter should be allowed to lie.  The Department of Defence say that they have no legal authority to interfere with the refusal.  It is because of that particular instance that I rose to intervene in this debate.</P>
    <P>I press the Minister to deal with the outstanding grievances of Old I.R.A. <Col N="157" /> men.  He will be hearing them soon by way of a deputation of the Old I.R.A. organisation.  I understand that these people believe they will get a new Bill soon and will not have to wait until the 5,000 cases in which decisions are pending are concluded.  They expect to get a new Bill this year. I do not know whether they will or not but, if the Government intend to deal with outstanding cases of grievances of the Old I.R.A. men, they should deal with them now and not wait for a year or two years.</P>

      <P>I suffer some disability this evening myself.  I understood that on an Estimate it is not permissible to advocate legislation.  I have had a surfeit of such advocacy. I understood that I could not advocate legislation in my opening remarks. Therefore, I do not intend to make any statement in that matter at the moment.</P>
      <P>This Vote is always a very difficult one to deal with.  Most of the comments I have heard in regard to the administration of the Vote I expressed myself time after time.  There is only one view that has been expressed that I do not accept, namely, that there was any partisanship on the part of any Referee or board.  I think the law was carried out impartially by the Referee and board at all times.  The cases may not have been made as well as they should have been and there was wide scope for difference of opinion.  I would not like to say that I had ever any evidence that the board was partial to any political side. I disagreed very often with the decisions.  I disagree with them yet, I presume.  But that situation will arise.  I have tried to get a good board and I have asked them to expedite the cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has very little function <Col N="158" /> in having cases speeded up.  There were 1,598 certificates issued under the 1948 Act up to the end of May.  There are now approximately 4,100 cases to be dealt with.  That appears a very large number.  A period of two years was the time named when I pressed the Referee and board to say about how long it would take to deal with them. I cannot express any view as to when or how amending legislation may be brought in or if it will be brought in, but I think everybody in the House knows my views on that matter without my expressing them here now.  All I can say is that the promise that I made that justice would be done to every Old I.R.A. man, whether he fought with me or against me, as far as I am concerned, will be honoured to the full and there will be no question about it.</P>
    <P>A question was raised about the allowance.  I am not so happy about this special allowance and the medal, but before I proceed I want to say that in my opinion&mdash;this view is not taken by the legal people&mdash;an application for a military service pension automatically meant an application for the medal.  I argued with my predecessor that an application for the major included the minor, that the greater included the lesser.  That view is not taken.  I do know that many applicants and many people who have service did not apply for a medal because they were convinced that by doing so they would lessen their claim for a certificate of service.  I move to report progress.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Wednesday, 6th July, 1955.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state, in respect of the Lima 1201 excavators and the Marion 111 M excavators, (a) the special tasks for which they were acquired by the Office of Public Works, (b) what, if any, ancillary equipment and facilities have to be provided, and (c) the dates of acquisition; further, if he will make available in the Oireachtas Library copies of the log-sheets of these excavators, indicating specially <Col N="23" /> the periods during which they were engaged on the special tasks.</P>

      <P>These excavators were acquired as a necessary addition to smaller capacity plant and are employed on heavy digging and for work on the wider rivers included in arterial drainage schemes.  Apart from buckets and mats no ancillary equipment or facilities have to be provided.  The Lima machines were acquired in April, 1951, and the Marion machines in August and September, 1951.  I do not think it would be desirable or would serve any purpose to make copies of the log-sheets available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>

      <P>The premises and equipment at Inchicore taken over from C.I.E. for the central engineering workshops and held under two leases, one for a term of 50 years from 2nd April, 1951, at a rent of £13,500 a year and the other for a coterminous period from 15th April, 1955, at a rent of £1,750 a year.  In each case the lessees are responsible for the payment of rates and for maintenance.  The lessees are at liberty to terminate the leases on the 2nd April, 1981, or at the end of each succeeding five-year period by six months' notice.  The lessors also have power to terminate the leases on certain conditions.</P>
