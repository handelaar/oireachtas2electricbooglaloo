      <P>I am informed by the Local Appointments Commissioners that interviews for the filling of this post were held in June, 1954.  Difficulties, however, arose that made it necessary to obtain legal advice.  It is hoped that the matter at issue will soon be decided, and the commissioners would thereupon be enabled to make their recommendation without further delay.</P>

It is estimated, however, that on farms or parts of farms separately enumerated for agricultural statistics purposes, there were about 160 instances in 1954 where the acreage of wheat grown exceeded 100.  No information is available with regard to (b) of the Deputy's question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Dillon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1955, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Agriculture, including certain Services administered by that Office, and for payment of certain Subsidies and sundry Grants-in-Aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it might be more convenient for the House if I began by mentioning the sources from which the savings of £447,390 are derived to offset the supplementary sum of £424,400 plus £23,000 of deficiency in Appropriations-in-Aid. There are savings of £447,390 on sub-heads M (9), O (5) and O O (5). Sub-head M (9) relates to the land rehabilitation project.  I think the House will understand that the same circumstances that created our difficulties <Col N="679" /> in the Shannon Valley of excessive rainfall and bad weather restricted the ability of contractors working under the land rehabilitation project to carry out as much work as it was hoped they would.  The result is that we have £122,390 on hands which we expected the contractors to have earned before the 31st March but which, owing to the inclemency of the weather, they were actually unable to earn.  Of course, that money will come in course of payment next year if the work is done.</P>
    <P>With regard to Sub-head O (5), there is a saving of £25,000 on the sum provided for the redemption of fertiliser vouchers tendered for payment.  It was anticipated that a sum of £41,783 would be claimed by holders of fertiliser vouchers but, in fact, it was not.  This is a dwindling service and we have to make a very approximate Estimate in each financial year for a sum which will come in course of payment for these vouchers.  The payments cannot be made if the vouchers are not tendered but, according as they are tendered, they will be paid.</P>
    <P>Sub-head O O (5) relates to the Grain Storage Loans Act.  As is so often the case in matters of this kind, legal procedures relating to mortgages, deeds, and so forth, take a great deal longer to carry to completion than any rational anticipation can provide for. A number of the loans on foot of works done towards increasing storage and drying accommodation cannot be advanced until title documents have been completed.  We estimate that the £300,000 which we expected to be in a position to disburse to applicants this year will not, in fact, be disbursed in this financial year, but will have to be found next year, as soon as the legal formalities in connection with title and such like matters are completed.</P>
    <P>Now to come to the sub-heads of the Vote.  Sub-head E (5) relates to the inquiry into costs of milk production. It was hoped that this inquiry would have completed its work before this financial year began at all and therefore only a token sum was provided. In fact, however, a variety of circumstances have arisen which make <Col N="680" /> it, as we are informed, necessary for the clerical and statistical staff on the inquiry to continue their work for some time, co-relating and evaluating the material which has been collected by field workers.  In that connection, I think it right to say that I am not infrequently asked why I do not provide the public with the report of the Milk Costings Commission.  The answer is that I cannot provide the public with a report of the Milk Costings Commission until that commission provide me with their report.  I do not think it is expedient that I should press upon them that they should waive any procedure that they, in their discretion, think necessary to produce their report.  Therefore, I can only await the completion of their operations.  As soon as the report is available to me I will make it available to everybody else.</P>
    <P>Sub-head G (3) provides for £40,000. This sum is required to complete the winding-up of Eggsports, Limited, which has been in the hands of a liquidator, Mr. Vincent Crowley, of Messrs. Kennedy and Crowley, Limited, Dublin.  Mr. Vincent Crowley was appointed official liquidator.  I think he has now reached the end of his labours and this sum represents a final payment in the winding-up of Eggsports, Limited.  It is well known to the House that my predecessor and myself were not in entire agreement on the expediency of winding-up this business. However, I do not believe any useful purpose would be served in stirring up the ashes of a now dead controversy. Whatever the merits of the case may be, Eggsports, Limited, have been wound up and, once the matter has been placed in the hands of the liquidator, it only remains to enable him to finish the job this House decided he should undertake, in the period of my predecessor's occupation of office.</P>
    <P>Sub-head H requires £8,000 and this Charge comes in course of payment on foot of a scheme operated in the previous financial year under which the Government undertook to recoup the county committees of agriculture for certain demonstration plots which they were asked to establish to demonstrate the value of the user of <Col N="681" /> appropriate fertiliser mixtures and, in certain areas, the remedying of cobalt deficiencies.  It was possible in the vast majority of cases to recoup the local authority for the expenditure in the financial year in which the plots were laid down, but certain of the local authorities were not able to complete their vouching in that year and this £8,000 represents the balance of unvouched expenditure which was vouched in the course of the present financial year and for which provision has to be made.</P>
    <P>Sub-head L (2) represents the total outlay of the Department of Agriculture in the discharge of the duty put upon it by the Government to maintain and supervise the Bryce bequest. This bequest came to the Government under the will of the late Mr. Roland L'Estrange Bryce, who died on the 4th December, 1953, and left certain property at Glengarriff, including Garnish Island, to the Taoiseach in trust for the State until some special body would be set up for such purpose.  I do not think I need go into a detailed description of Garnish Island, when I tell the House that having attempted to discharge the duties involved in its supervision and maintenance for some time, I approached the Government and said that in my judgment the Department of Agriculture was not properly equipped to deal with such matters at all and that the property ought to be transferred to the custody of the Minister for Finance and the Board of Works, who have machinery for handling property of this kind.  The Government accepted that view and therefore, as from the 31st March of this year, responsibility for the maintenance of Garnish Island will be transferred to the Board of Works&mdash; and doubtless on an appropriate occasion an account will be given to the House by the Minister for Finance as to the future of the bequest.</P>
    <P>In regard to sub-head M (3), for a sum of £2,000, this includes £595 for the printing of a volume of the register of dairy cattle and £1,405 for the printing of the Department's agricultural leaflets.  As the House is aware, we have to print leaflets as they are <Col N="682" /> required.  We are constantly trying to revise the leaflets, to withdraw those that have become out of date, and to substitute up-to-date leaflets for those withdrawn.  In addition to that, I am glad to inform the House that we have at last filled one serious lacuna in the leaflets available from the Department, that is, that the leaflet on sheep has now been prepared and is in process of being printed.  When we have it available I think it will constitute a very valuable addition to the range of leaflets available for the public. Perhaps I might take this occasion to remind the public and the farmers of this country that they can get any of the Department's leaflets for nothing&mdash; simply by asking for them.  A &ldquo;halfpenny postcard&rdquo;&mdash;or indeed a postcard without a stamp on it at all&mdash;addressed to the Department of Agriculture asking for any leaflet published by the Department will I hope be answered by return of post with a copy of the leaflet&mdash;free, gratis and for nothing&mdash; to any farmer in good faith who wants to peruse it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I sympathise with the Deputy's anxiety to see it restored. I am hoping that before this day 12 months all four volumes will be available. We have given up the practice of binding one volume and we now bind the leaflets in four volumes, each one containing related matter.  I hope they will be available, but I cannot undertake to provide them free of charge.  They have to be purchased from the Government Publications Office for a very modest sum and I think the Deputy will agree that anyone who invests in them gets ten or 100 times the value in money.</P>
      <P>Sub-head M (5) is for the provision of a sum of £13,400.  This is in connection with the scheme for payments on foot of the guarantee given to the Agricultural Credit Corporation, Limited, to recoup irrecoverable losses on loans made by them under the schemes of loans for the purchase of cattle and sheep and agricultural implements and machinery, including milking machines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="683" /> The additional provision of £13,400 includes £310 subvention paid to the corporation for their services in the administration of the scheme of loans for the purchase of fertilisers and ground limestone.  For its services in operating this scheme, which was introduced on 26th January, 1954, for a period of 12 months, the corporation receive a subvention of 3/4 per cent. per annum on the average daily balance of loans outstanding from time to time under the scheme.  This subvention fell due on 25th January last.  Seven hundred and five advances were made by the banks involving a total of £57,000.  This scheme is being continued up to 30th June, 1955.</P>
    <P>It also provides for the principal and interest payable to the Agricultural Credit Corporation on behalf of the Co-operative Fruit Growers' Society, Limited, Dungarvan.  This society was founded in 1950 for the production and marketing of apples on a co-operative basis.  Two loans, one of £95,000, the other of £20,000, were obtained from the Agricultural Credit Corporation, Limited, the Exchequer guaranteeing both as to principal and interest.  As the society's initial capital outlay was considerably in excess of the sum originally estimated for, lack of working capital became a serious embarrassment to the society.  Growers' confidence in the venture weakened; they felt little encouragement to increase their acreage under apples.  At the end of 1953, the society's membership had not increased to any extent since its foundation and the acreage was considerably less than the final target of 800 acres of dessert apples.</P>
    <P>In order, therefore, to restore the growers' confidence in the venture, it was decided, with the approval of the Government, that payments of interest due by the society on the advances totalling £115,000 should be made by this Department for the period 2-5-1953&mdash;1-5-1959 and that payment of instalments of principal should be made by this Department in any year, up to 1st May, 1957, where the society is unable to pay such instalments.  Any sum so paid by this Department in respect of principal will be repayable by <Col N="684" /> the society after 1st May, 1957.  In the current year a total of £13,078 4s. 3d. consisting of £4,937 7s. 7d. principal and £8,140 16s. 8d. interest has been paid by the Department to the corporation.</P>
    <P>A token provision of £10 in respect of the scheme of loans free of interest for farmers who suffered serious losses of live stock, fodder or fuel as a result of the recent flooding in the Shannon area constitutes the third item in this total.</P>
    <P>Sub-head M (8) deals with grants for the construction and improvement of farm buildings, £250,000.  This is an interesting sub-head, because the demand for farm buildings grants has so far exceeded the Estimate prepared at the beginning of the year that we had to provide an additional sum of £250,000.</P>

      <P>Is it not a pleasant thing?  Business is good.  The Deputy will remember that, each year he was Minister, I was constrained to say I found great difficulty in moving to refer his Estimate back, because I found the general policy pursued by him corresponded so closely to mine. But for the fact that I thought the Deputy a bit seedy on the job, I found some difficulty in proposing the motion to refer back his Vote.  I think the Deputy and myself have every reason to congratulate ourselves that we clove so closely to the line laid down by me in 1948 right down to to-day that we can look our colleagues in the face and say that, in very truth, <Col N="685" /> agriculture is what matters in this country and but for agriculture for which the Deputy and I have spoken for the past eight years the rest of the country would be in a very serious plight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree with the Deputy that it is a most admirable thing to discover that the farmers find themselves encouraged by the system of farm building grants and the state of their general finances to build what should have been built years ago, the hay barns, without which their farms are manifestly incomplete.  They are building them now in great style, with the remarkable result that we have to make this very substantial additional provision for the farm buildings scheme, and I need hardly tell the House that it is a pleasure to the Government to be called upon to make it, because it is evidence of a growing appreciation on the part of the agricultural community of the necessity for equipping their farmyards adequately with hay barns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should draw the attention of the House to the fact that on 14th December, 1954, it was decided that no grant would be paid after 15th January, 1955, in respect of a hay barn which was not covered with galvanised iron of domestic production.  That arrangement caused some concern amongst merchants who had laid in stocks of galvanised iron of foreign manufacture and everybody proceeded to get hot under the collar, but with a little patience and forbearance, I think a very satisfactory way is being found out of this difficulty by providing that where erectors of hay barns, that is, contractors who erect hay barns, had large stocks of imported iron, they will be allowed to use up to 50 per cent. of their stocks of 22 gauge and a somewhat lesser percentage of 24 gauge iron during the next 12 months. We have no doubt that, as time goes on, we will be able to help them to work off whatever stocks of imported iron they have on hands, so that the changeover to the exclusive user of <Col N="686" /> galvanised iron of domestic production for sheds or buildings subsidised under the farm buildings scheme will be accomplished without causing anybody inconvenience, and, more especially, without causing unemployment in the establishment of any hay barn contractor.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy, having been Minister for Agriculture, will fully realise, his anxiety and mine is to see the hay barns put up and covered.  Both of us have colleagues whose great anxiety is to see their pet industries kept humming, and just as the Deputy on occasion was obliged to work these things out with his colleagues, so I worked these things out with my colleagues, and I hope that better success will attend the deliberations of my colleagues and myself in meeting the legitimate requirements of the farmers and, at the same time, providing a steady market for the Haulbowline corrugated iron factory than perhaps attended efforts at an earlier stage.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a sum of £85,000 under sub-head M (13) for the bovine T.B. <Col N="687" /> eradication scheme and perhaps I had better say a word about that.  This scheme, as the House knows, was launched on 1st of last September and it is being operated on two separate lines: (1) in the intensive areas, and (2) generally throughout the whole country.  I think the House may be interested in certain statistical material.  The intensive areas constitute the Counties of Sligo and Clare and an area which, for convenience, we may describe as the greater Bansha area.  The greater Bansha area for the purpose of to-day's discussion consists of the eight parishes of Bansha, Cahir, Galbally, Golden, Lattin, New Inn, Oola and Soloheadbeg and Tipperary. Certain interesting facts have already emerged, one of which is that, in County Sligo, only about 6 per cent. of the cows so far tested have proved to be reactors.  In Limerick, the percentage is very much higher.  In the greater Bansha area&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The full measure of this present scheme was not in operation in Bansha.  A very much more attenuated scheme was in operation there.  In regard to County Clare, 12.8 of all animals tested up to the end of February have proved reactors and 22.5 of all cows tested have failed to pass the test.</P>
      <P>I think the House may wish to know that the numbers of application forms received to date from the general and special areas combined are 22,442 covering 215,195 cows and heifers and 224,666 other stock so that the demand for the facilities available has exceeded our most optimistic anticipations.  We are, I believe, keeping abreast of it but I cannot disguise to the House that the resources of the Department are being taxed to the limit to keep abreast with the demand.  That is a very good thing.  I think the House will now, perhaps, realise why I was obliged to withstand urgent pressure from many Deputies to extend the intensive areas.  If I had given way to that pressure, when the matter first came before the House, I simply would not have been able to deal with it.  I hope that when we have got the back of the work broken in these areas and the machine working smoothly we will be able to take in other areas with a reasonable measure of dispatch.</P>
      <P>I want to remind the House of the fact that the eradication of bovine T.B. is a long-term enterprise.  No country in the world has completed it yet, I think, but those countries who have got near to completion have been from 20 to 25 years on the job.  It will take us something like that.  It is a big job over the whole country.  I am satisfied that we are getting along so far satisfactorily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to inform the House that, whereas at first I was obliged to say that we could provide the double grant in respect of cow byres to those who joined the scheme only in the intensive areas, I am now authorised by the <Col N="689" /> Government to say that participants in the scheme, whether they live in intensive areas or outside them, will become entitled to the double grant if they collaborate with the Department in converting their holding into an attested holding and provision is being made from the National Development Fund to meet this charge.</P>
    <P>Grants will be made available for the extension of a piped water supply to farmyards and farms in the case of participants in the scheme.  Deputies will remember that under the land rehabilitation project it was possible for a farmer to bring water to his kitchen tap but not beyond it.  It was represented very strongly to us that it would greatly assist in raising the standard of live stock and husbandry on attested farms if it were possible for the farmer to bring the water to his farmyard.  Accordingly, provision is being made for those who participate in this scheme whereby they will be entitled to grants to enable that to be done.  I need hardly tell the House that I am dealing relatively inadequately with the sub-heads but I put myself at the disposal of Deputies to answer any queries they may raise in the course of discussion.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the last item which constitutes part of this Supplementary Estimate.  That is the item where provision is made for the relief of the Shannon floods situation.  I wish I were in a position to tell the House that the outlay of £20,000 satisfactorily disposed of the problem in regard to the flooding of the Shannon valley but I am sorry to say that any such representation would be far from the truth. A very careful investigation regarding the circumstances obtaining in that area obliged the Government to come to the House with what appears to me to be a pretty staggering commitment.</P>
    <P>Under the general authority given to me to collaborate with the local people in the relief of urgent and immediate distress certain disbursements were made the terms of which I shall furnish to the House in a moment.  Over and above that, the House will bear in mind that we undertook effectively to remedy the position of persons whose <Col N="690" /> homes were perennially flooded by the Shannon in that area, either by their transfer to other areas where an exchange holding would be provided for them or by such change in their housing conditions on their existing land as would render it impossible in the future for their homes to be invaded by flood water in any circumstances.  I am obliged to tell the House that we estimate that the total cost of that operation may involve the Exchequer in a charge of up to £90,000.</P>
    <P>Further, we have decided that it is proper that we should arrive as near to certainty as we can on the question of in how far it is prudent to carry out public works on the Shannon river itself and to restrict it more closely to what is commonly known as its summer bed.  We had this matter examined in years gone by by the engineers of the E.S.B. and the engineers of the Board of Works and it was thought on the whole that if public confidence was to be secured the best thing to do was to ask the Government of the United States of America kindly to place at our disposal engineering consultants who in consultation with our own experts would offer the Irish Government a conclusive opinion of how best the problem of flooding in the Shannon valley could be dealt with.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, communications have been proceeding between the American Ambassador and the Government and His Excellency has very kindly undertaken to represent to the Government of the United States that such expert advice should be placed at our disposal. Just as soon as the American Ambassador is in a position to inform us of what experts the Government of the United States can offer, we propose to arrange for a suitable survey to be held.  Depending on the completion of that investigation, we cannot accurately estimate what the charge will be which will come in course of payment on foot of whatever recommendations these engineering consultants may make to our Government and on foot of whatever decisions Oireachtas Éireann may take on foot of whatever recommendations it becomes our duty to place before them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="691" /> I think the House will agree, although the sum is substantial, that you could not continue to have every four or five years a situation arising in which emergency measures had to be taken and the Army taken out to evacuate people from their homes and require them to make their way home and to town in boats and spend a considerable part of their life tramping around the kitchen in gum boots. Therefore, a survey has been made by inspectors of the Land Commission and those persons resident in the area who have asked to be migrated will be provided with alternative holdings elsewhere. I am not surprised to discover that the great majority of the people canvassed in the area do not want to be migrated, but they do want to be transferred to houses which will, in future, be immune to flood.</P>
    <P>There is one point I think I ought to mention.  This is something which has not been resolved but which, I think, will have to be resolved finally. A good many of those people who have shown extraordinary fortitude and attachment to their homes would press upon us the desirability of raising the floor of the kitchens, or even raising the fireplace, and raising the floor of the stables so that they could continue to live in flooded premises, keep a coal fire on the hearth and ensure, oddly enough, that their cattle would not be left standing in the wet.  They would be quite prepared to stand in it themselves.  I doubt if such an arrangement would be prudent.</P>
    <P>I do not see the point in asking Oireachtas Éireann to provide vast sums of money to carry out radical improvements in this area if, having carried them out, we are to be faced with a situation year after year hereafter that these people are themselves trampling around in one or two feet of water in the kitchen, with the fire lifted above the flood and the cattle in the cowhouses, likewise, lifted above the flood.  Therefore, I feel we ought to say to the residents in this area: &ldquo;You will have to agree, if you want to have your household conditions improved, to a house being erected <Col N="692" /> on ground sufficiently high to ensure that in no foreseeable subsequent inundation of the Shannon valley will the water reach your kitchen floor.&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the Minister to give us evidence that that feeling is there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is my information. However, whether it is there or whether it is not, I would like the House to endorse the view I am submitting now.  I think we ought to say: &ldquo;No.&rdquo;  I think we ought to say: &ldquo;We are prepared to provide you with housing that will exempt you from any probable possibility of inundation hereafter but we are not prepared to spend public money lifting the cattle and the fire out of the flood and leaving you and your children to trample about in one or two feet of water on the kitchen floor.&rdquo;  But even though we reject their view, let us not fail in sympathy and understanding to people who are intensely attached to their homes.  Remember, somebody who has been living in a house and has not seen it flooded, except maybe once in ten or 15 pears, does not find the prospect of moving easy.  It is very hard to say to that person: &ldquo;We will not do anything unless you give up your old home.&rdquo;  Suppose they reply that <Col N="693" /> they will not give up their old home, I do not think there is any power in this House to make them give it up. But I think we are entitled to say to them: &ldquo;If you make up your mind you will not give up your old home, I will not ask Dáil Éireann to spend public money to carry out certain improvements in that old home which fail to achieve the primary purpose Dáil Éireann has in mind, namely to lift you and your children out of the flood.&rdquo;</P>

I am quite prepared to help the public health inspectors in public places, but anyone who comes in to sniffle around my house will be thrown out; and the same goes for my neighbours in the Shannon valley, and if they want help from me in that respect I will be glad to go down and help them and, if we find ourselves in the dock&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not think anybody ought to go around sniffing about in houses&mdash;either my house or the Deputy's&mdash;if we are rearing our families as we should rear them.  That is a general principle.  I am obliged to concede there are exceptions to it.  It is a general principle that the less people there are knocking their way into private homes the better it is. However, I think we are entitled, when asked to spend public money inside a person's home, to insist upon certain minimum conditions; if the inhabitants do not accept these minimum conditions, then I think we are entitled to say we will not spend any public money, and there will be no hard feelings. I would be glad to have from the House confirmation of the view that we should not spend public money unless we have some certainty that this evil from flooding will not occur in some future year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="694" /> I have a list here of all those affected.  We surveyed 2,000 odd holdings in detail.  I have a detailed list of the circumstances of each one.  I had, as the House knows, the invaluable co-operation of Colonel Collins-Powell, without whom, I want to say in public on this first opportunity I have, control of this situation could not have been secured.  The work done by Colonel Collins-Powell night and day throughout this whole area is beyond praise.  This episode has resulted in a fuller appreciation by the people of how much we owe the Army and the men who command it, not only for their primary duty of defending the country but for their invaluable availability in times of emergency on behalf of our people, rich and poor.</P>
    <P>In paying that tribute to Colonel Collins-Powell, I know he would wish me to add this: it speaks volumes. When I first went down to survey this area I called at Kiltoom where a number of affected families were being looked after by the Army.  I think I mentioned this in the House before&mdash;I made no apology for repeating it&mdash;the day I called at Kiltoom the officer representing Colonel Collins-Powell was at headquarters in Athlone transacting some business there, and there were only N.C.O.s and men in Kiltoom. When I went in I expected to speak to people who had been moved from inundated homes and to hear little but bitter complaint about the grievous sufferings they were undergoing.  I was both astonished and delighted to hear from them nothing but praise and admiration for the soldiers and the N.C.O.s because of how good they had been to them and the excellent care they were taking of them.  I thought it was an admirable thing to see our people being looked after by soldiers and I suddenly recalled that this was neighbour looking after neighbour, and that that was the way they felt about it.  To the humblest private on the Athlone unit, to the officer in charge of the whole area, I think everybody in this country has every reason to be particularly grateful for the invaluable help they gave, help which nobody else could have given in the initial stages of this emergency and right throughout <Col N="695" /> it to the very last day when I wound up the committee in Athlone last Monday.</P>
    <P>I should be very remiss if I did not mention the invaluable assistance that Colonel Collins-Powell and I had from the county managers, the county agricultural officers and secretaries of county committees of agriculture in the area who, by their specialist knowledge and advice, and indeed, who by the operation of their own local services, made invaluable contributions to the work we did.  One must not forget also the agricultural instructors, and, of course, it goes without saying that the officers of the Department of Agriculture tried to fill every gap.  I forbear from uttering any words of praise for the officers of the Department of Agriculture. They did no more and no less than I expected of them.  They did everything that required to be done. If they did less I should have been shocked.  That they did all that was necessary was merely a vindication of my confidence in the invaluable public service that they continue to give day in and day out.</P>
    <P>I think, perhaps, I should tell the House how we went about it.  Where it was necessary to remove the people into Army accommodation, we fed them and housed them and looked after them while the houses were flooded.  Where it was necessary we moved their live stock either on to neighbours' land or on to Army land and we foddered their cattle until it was possible to put them back to the land whence we had taken them. When the floods subsided sufficiently to permit the people to go home, there were, I think, 97 families whose houses had actually been invaded by the waters and in each of these cases a local relief committee in Athlone granted them on our recommendation, £20 and one ton of coal to help them to dry out the houses.  Furthermore, the local committee gave to each family where there were children a supplementary grant of £5 per child under the age of 16 years in each house. Where there was a shortage of fodder we asked farmers all over the country <Col N="696" /> to send us fodder and where they were not able to send it, they accumulated it around their own districts and we sent Army transport for it and brought it to Athlone.</P>
    <P>A number of commercial firms whose generosity has been recognised in the public Press sent gifts of concentrated feeding stuffs and feeding material of one kind or another.  A great number of individuals sent fodder of one kind or another.  Macra na Feirme, I believe, are sending a substantial sum of money.  Muintir na Tíre helped to gather fodder and foodstuffs of one kind or another for live stock and these were distributed to the people. The Sugar Company made available a certain amount of concentrates at, I think, £28 per ton and as much as they sent us was sold to people who wanted it at cost, or whatever was charged for it without any profit.  All that we got for nothing, we distributed gratis and in addition we bought some fodder where that was necessary in order to supplement what we had received by way of gifts.</P>
    <P>The next problem, after providing those who required it with hay and feeding stuff and roots, was to try and shorten the time as much as we could when relief of any kind would be necessary and with this in view we surveyed all inundated farms to find out if we could find a four- or five-acre paddock which we would intensively fertilise with a view to getting early grass thus rendering them independent of hay or fodder from the previous harvest.  So I think on about 97 holdings we distributed a specially compounded fertiliser in concentrated form &ldquo;free, gratis and for nothing&rdquo;, so as to avail of the earliest possible bite of grass for live stock on the holdings.</P>
    <P>I felt&mdash;and Deputies in this House felt&mdash;that there would be a danger of serious outbreaks of parasitic diseases among live stock in the area consequent on this flooding and so we examined every beast on every farm, and we dosed 2,000 cattle in the area with a suitable mixture and left a supply with every farmer to repeat the dose after a suitable interval.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="697" /> Finally, we went all over these cases again with a view to determining where hardship threatened.  The House will remember that I was emphatic when introducing the Estimate in asking advice from every side of the House and I think I got it from every side of the House, that in so far as making compensation on the basis of loss was concerned we simply could not do it because we had not the resources to do it and that we must confine ourselves to relieving distress.  Therefore, when we carried out all these remedial measures and the Shannon had returned to its bed and physical flooding was no longer there we made a survey of the area to see what persons could be truly said to be suffering from distress as a result of the experience through which they had passed. Having determined that list of persons, grants ranging from £20 to £105 per family were paid in cash of which in every case the local relief fund paid the first £20.  If a man got only £20 the local fund paid him £20 and we paid him nothing.  If a man was found to require as much as £105 the local fund gave £20 and we gave £85.  I understand that all that having been done there is still a not inconsiderable sum remaining in the hands of the relief committee in Athlone.  If any exceptional case of hardship emerges which has escaped our dragnet I have no doubt such a case will be sympathetically considered by the local committee.</P>
    <P>I am bound to say I am very conscious that no matter how much we did in this area we cannot hope to have pleased everybody.  We did not at any stage anticipate that our best efforts would be hailed as an unqualified success, but this I can say with a clear conscience: we left after us no case of distress which had not been relieved and if we erred at all in the cases which we fell to consider, invariably we erred on the side of generosity rather than parsimony, believing that in doing so we correctly interpreted the mind of the Dáil under whose authority we were acting.</P>
    <P>A final word about the special circumstances that existed in Castle-hackett area, that is the Tuam area. <Col N="698" /> His Grace the Archbishop of Tuam sponsored a relief fund for a flooded area in East Galway and as he had no machinery at his disposal for carrying out a survey similar to that which we were in process of making in the Shannon valley, he asked if we would assist by surveying the area for which he felt himself to be responsible and make suggestions to him for the carrying out, where required, of relief of distress.  We were happy to be able to do that.  We did make such a survey and placed all the information we thought requisite for proper dealing with the situation in the hands of the committee set up by the Archbishop. I am glad to say that so far as I know they had ample funds at their disposal to meet every proper requirement of those who experienced distress in that area.  So far as we know the area in question is unlikely to constitute any charge on public funds for the relief of distress.</P>
    <P>I remember when this matter was under review in December last, both the Taoiseach and the Leader of the Opposition emphasised how eminently desirable it was that although the State had expressed itself as ready to bear the burden if necessary, it was no less eminently desirable that voluntary effort among our own people would produce substantial contributions to the relief of our neighbours' distress.  I think we have reason to be proud of the fact that such generous gifts were forthcoming both in cash and kind from all sorts of people who were distressed by these events.</P>
    <P>I do not think it would be right if I did not say that many offers of help were forthcoming from generous friends and neighbours in countries all over the world but, by unanimous agreement of the House, we felt that the dimensions of our difficulty would not justify our trespassing on the benevolence of willing helpers had we thought fit to call upon them and so we did not accept subventions of an inter-governmental kind from any source.  But the fact that we did not accept them should not prevent us availing of this occasion to say how truly grateful and appreciative we were of the many offers that were <Col N="699" /> made and how happy we were to know that there were good friends in Governments all over the world who, had we required their help, were eager and willing to give it.  I think we should take this occasion to say that should similar circumstances afflict other countries in similar conditions, if our help were needed, small as it might be measured by the sum of our resources, we would hope to place it as cheerfully at our neighbours' disposal as our neighbours so generously expressed their readiness to help us in the months now happily past.</P>
    <P>To give an adequate and detailed survey of matters of this kind would mean talking at altogether inordinate length in an introductory statement of this kind.  I do not propose to inflict that upon the House but I repeat that if there is any aspect of this matter with which I have failed to deal adequately I only await interrogation so that I may repair any omission.</P>

      <P>Well, the Minister mentioned the flooding.  My belief is, rightly or wrongly, that we would have heard nothing from the Government about the Shannon flooding if it were not for the bursting of the Tolka banks.  It was only then that we heard that the Government in their generosity were giving £20,000 to the sufferers on the Shannon and they think they have done everything that could be done for the unfortunate people there.  The floods in September, October and November of last year were not confined to the Shannon. There were floods on the Suir, the Nore and the Barrow but we did not hear anything from the Government regarding compensation for the people who were flooded there.  It was only <Col N="700" /> when an outcry was raised in Fairview and other quarters in Dublin that the Government adverted to the question of doing something for the people on the Shannon who were suffering.</P>

      <P>I am sure it was not very pleasant for the Minister to come to the House this evening and inform the House that he was unable to spend £500,000 that was voted for agriculture last year.  I know the Estimates were not his Estimates; they were my Estimates.  I find that the one work that the Minister would have wished to have carried out was the one he failed to carry out, that is, land reclamation.  He found that he was unable to spend £122,000 on that work.  I wonder what the people sitting on the opposite benches would have said to me if I had come into the House last year and informed them that I was unable to spend £100,000 out of the Vote on land reclamation.  I see the Minister for Lands is looking through the list now to see what I did spend.  He need not go to the trouble.  I can tell him.  It was about £2,400,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister makes the excuse now that he needed umbrellas last year but when the unfortunate people were trying to save the harvest <Col N="701" /> he said that there was not 3 per cent. of the wheat lost.  You cannot have it both ways.  If there was not 3 per cent. of the wheat lost last year the land was not wet enough to be unable to carry a tractor.  It was a difficult year in which to carry out reclamation work but reclamation work does not consist entirely of drainage.  Removal of scrub is part of that work and that seems to be one of the jobs that have been neglected over the past 12 months.  In 1952-53, between drainage and removal of scrub, we reclaimed 100,000 acres.  I know there are parts of the year when drainage cannot be carried out.  That applied in 1952-53 as well as in 1953-54 or 1954-55.  It applies every year.  In October, November and December work cannot be carried out on drainage schemes but there is other work that can be carried out, such as the removal of scrub.  We carried out that type of work with the result that we were able to spend very nearly £2,500,000 in a year on the reclamation of 100,000 acres.</P>
      <P>There is another item here&mdash;the grain storage hold up, as I call it&mdash; which the Minister states was due to legal difficulties.  I do not believe a word of it.  I believe it was due principally, if not solely, to the change of Government last June.</P>

We cannot advance the money to the firms concerned with the building of the storage accommodation for the recoupments to their bankers until they clear the title, if the Deputy understands me.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied with that and I accept it.  I do not, of course, know whether we have sufficient storage or not yet.  That is not a matter that should engage our attention at the moment; we shall have plenty of opportunities to raise that question at a later date.  I shall turn instead to the other side of the question&mdash;the moneys that are now needed.  I shall deal first of all with the £4,000 for milk costings.  I can well understand why there has been such a delay in the submission of that committee's report.  First of all how many officials are engaged in preparing or compiling the necessary figures?  I understand the figures have not been supplied to the committee to date.  When the committee deal with the figures available they will submit their report to the Minister.  At the beginning of the compilation of these figures there were 25 people engaged in the work.  Would the Minister tell the House how many <Col N="704" /> are engaged in the work at the moment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if the Minister for Finance would say the same thing. According to the Minister now, the delay is not his fault but the fault of the people dealing with the milk costings.  Let us assess the blame where it should fall.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen a statement made by the president of the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers' Association, who is a member of the committee, asking why the figures have not been submitted.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should let <Col N="705" /> the people know who is at fault.  I am sure it will be made known before this debate is finished.  The Minister has already said that it is these people who are at fault not merely for the delay in the preparation of the report, but for failing to get sufficient staff to compile the figures.  I know that when the committee was being set up in the first instance I was asked to supply the staff.  Ten of the members were given from the Department of Agriculture and we got 13 graduates as well.  I understood that there were two others added later.  The Minister's figures now indicate that there were 23 appointed altogether, and we will take that as being correct.  The Minister dealt at length with this question of the non-payment of grants for imported iron for hay barns and farm buildings.  I could produce documents to prove that the people responsible for the supply of iron throughout the country are unable to supply it.  I know of one case where a person ordered a ton of five, six, seven, eight, nine foot sheets.  All he could be supplied with were five foot sheets in May.  He could not get the other types of iron until August.  Must the farmers' work be held up in this way, especially during the summer period, which is the best time for the carrying out of all improvement jobs, because there is no iron in the country or because the Minister has decided that grants are not payable on imported iron?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department has already been informed of this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am told it is the same. If the Deputy will help me in this <Col N="706" /> matter I shall be very glad to have it remedied if possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>This information should already be in the Department's possession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Deputy send it in?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I sent some in myself and I know that other evidence was sent forward.  What effect is this going to have on farm improvements generally? It is going to mean a widespread hold up.  I am just as anxious as the next man to see that Irish industry makes progress and that it flourishes. I am very anxious that we should produce as much as we can at home, especially of materials which go towards the development of our agricultural economy, but if there are cases where the home industry is unable to supply the home needs it is a different matter.  I have documentary evidence that iron is not procurable in the quantities required and I hope the Minister will do something better than the 50 per cent. he is doing at the moment for the people who are already well stocked with foreign iron.  A number of people have had applications made for grants and they were unable to go on with the work at the time.  Now, however, they find that if they had not the work completed before a certain date their applications in respect of foreign iron will not be accepted for grant purposes.  Their applications would not be acceptable if the work had not been inspected before a certain date even though the application was lodged in time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If the work had not been approved before the 18th January.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The supervisor might not have called round at that particular time.  I was informed of one particular case where the application was made before the 18th January but approval had not been received on that date.  The applicant has since been informed that if he uses foreign iron he will not get the grant.  I was very surprised when the Minister mentioned the results of the Bansha scheme for T.B.  It is five years in existence now <Col N="707" /> and I might as well say that I was never overfond of it because I realised that neither the Minister of 1949-50 nor myself in 1951, 1952 or 1953 got the co-operation we should have got in the carrying out of the scheme.</P>
      <P>Why I say I am surprised and unhappy about the situation is this.  If you were unable to get co-operation in the parish of Bansha, where you have Canon Hayes leading Muintir na Tíre and where possibly you would get greater co-operation than in any other parish in Ireland, I have grave doubts if we are going to eradicate T.B. in the time we hope it will be eradicated. Unless there is co-operation there is no hope of eradicating it.  I can give an instance.  I remember people coming up to Dublin in 1952, going down to Grange to inspect heifers there, looking at them and saying they were not as good as the ones that could be purchased at the fair, coming back to the Department, getting money, going down to County Tipperary and buying heifers there.  These were well tested. They were tested in Grange but they refused to take them with the result that 50 per cent. of the heifers that went in there were reactors.  My recollection is that around 1952 the incidence of T.B. in Bansha was about 12 per cent.  I see it has gone back to 24 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Was it 12 per cent. of all cattle?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>No, 12 per cent. of cows. That looks very bad for the future of the eradication of T.B. all over the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy would not mind my interrupting him for a moment, I will give him this information. If the people have their applications registered prior to the 15th January, 1955, even though an inspection does not take place until subsequently, they can use foreign iron. If the Deputy knows of any case in which that is not authorised, if he will get in touch with me, I will put it right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I see that Sligo has only <Col N="708" /> 6 per cent. reactors.  Is it the Minister's intention or the intention of the Department to concentrate on Sligo for the purpose of replacements in the other areas?  Clare, with the incidence of 12½ per cent. of cattle or 22.8 per cent. cows does not seem now to be the most suitable place for getting replacements.  Sligo seems to be better. Has the Minister that in mind?  Having regard to the low incidence of T.B. in Sligo it might be selected as a county from which he could get replacements because, if we are going to make a success of eradication, the replacement is going to be the big problem.  There is at least 10 per. cent. wastage, representing about 120,000 cows each year to be brought back.  We have 1,250,000 and we need 120,000 for replacement all over the country.  If Sligo could be selected and held as a replacement centre it would be one of the ways in which you could help the Clare, Limerick and Tipperary areas to build up. Otherwise I am afraid that if you are going to rely on the present method of having replacements made from the Department farms you will never succeed.</P>
      <P>The only other question I wanted to speak about was this question of Dungarvan, not a pleasant baby&mdash;I know the Minister realises that now.  Here again it is a lack of co-operation.  If there was co-operation from the apple growers in that area, things might have been better.  My first criticism is that it was placed in the wrong area. It should never have gone to Dungarvan. If it had been erected in the apple-growing district in Piltown, Kilkenny, it would possibly have been a success.  But from my experience of the Dungarvan people there is an annual trip to Dublin now for money and I see the Minister is just continuing that.  I had for the past couple of years been paying over money and I wonder when is that going to stop? I did not like to do anything that might injure the Minister's baby.  I nourished it as much as I could while I was there.  I think there is pretty good evidence of that but I see the Minister himself still continuing that so far as Dungarvan is concerned.</P>

      <P>It is my information that it is true.  In the Shannon area and not merely in the Shannon area but, as I have said, in the Nore, Suir and Barrow areas, where we had severe <Col N="711" /> flooding, there was no compensation for these unfortunate people.  There would not have been any compensation for anybody in the rural areas had it not been for the people on the Tolka. However, there are Deputies in the House who are better qualified to talk about the Shannon and I will leave it to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government (Mr. Davin) William Davin">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government (Mr. Davin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer, and only very briefly, to that portion of the statement made by the Minister in connection with the Shannon flooding, the distress and the problems arising therefrom.  I was personally very glad that the Minister himself, at the request of the local association of residents and farmers, came to the very representative meeting that was held at Banagher in the early days of January.  Previous to that, the Minister, by personal visits, made himself fully acquainted with the position in the area at that time.  I intervened in this debate because it was only yesterday, at very short notice, that I met the selected spokesman of the residents' association who came here without any previous notice, as far as I am concerned, in the hope that he would get the Minister to discuss the present position and certain proposals that he wished to put to him on behalf of the local people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Shannon flooding has got to be faced from two different angles.  One is, how far the Minister or the Government can go to relieve the immediate distress which confronts the people in the area affected.  The Minister has given particulars here to-day of what has been done up to the moment, but I understand there are problems yet to be faced and dealt with, namely, what is likely to be the position in regard to fodder for the live stock in the area in the autumn of this year.  I am not going to put before the House or the Minister the points which were made to me yesterday at short notice, because I pointed out to the spokesman concerned that I would prefer, in the first instance, to have a discussion with all my colleagues in this House who represent <Col N="712" /> the constituencies that surround the Shannon area, namely, Roscommon, Galway, Longford, Westmeath, Laois and Offaly.  Deputies of those areas met on many occasions previous to the flooding.</P>
    <P>I would like, before going to the Minister, or before making any suggestions to him in this House, or outside the House, to hear the position fully explained by the officers of the Shannon Residents' Association, and then, perhaps, the Minister would be good enough to hear a small deputation of Deputies who would put before him not alone the views of the residents' association, but their own views, so far as they were prepared to support the views and proposals of the residents' association.</P>
    <P>It may be said, and has been said, that the Shannon Residents' Association is not fully representative of all the people concerned.  That may be so, and there may be some other committee that can claim to speak on behalf of the people affected in other parts of the Shannon valley area.  I would like members of this committee to put their heads together, and then to approach Deputies.  I would like the Minister to give an assurance that, at some later stage after these discussions, he will be good enough to hear the considered opinion of the Deputies representing the affected areas, and a small number of those representing the residents affected.</P>
    <P>I was delighted to hear the Minister, when he spoke with the authority of the Government at Banagher, announce that, through the good offices of the American Ambassador, application had been made for engineering experts who are internationally known in matters of this kind, to come from America.  I hope the arrangements will be completed at an early date, and that, when these experts visit the Shannon valley area, they will consult beforehand with our own experts before this year is out. The sooner this is done the better. You have to deal with the immediate distress and the reasonable requests of the people concerned, and try to get agreement between the engineering <Col N="713" /> experts who have promised to come here, and our own experts, as to what can be done, as soon as possible, to prevent a recurrence of the disastrous flooding which took place, particularly in December of last year.</P>
    <P>I will join with the Minister, as I did elsewhere, in paying a well deserved tribute to Colonel Collins-Powell, to every one of his officers, and to the members of the Army, for the invaluable assistance they rendered at the right time.  I think that, without their assistance at a critical time, and their intervention in the effective way in which they undertook their duties, many lives would have been lost, and much more property destroyed.  No words of mine could convey to them the grateful thanks of the residents for whom I claim to speak.  I also want to say that, from the information at my disposal, the people concerned acted in a very cool and reasonable way, and that the claims so far as I know made by them to the local committee, and probably directly to the Minister himself, could be regarded in the majority of cases as very reasonable.  I do not know whether it would be possible to meet all their claims fully.  I suppose it would not.</P>
    <P>I heard the Minister, in his statement&mdash;I had not heard it before&mdash;referring to the request that some of the people living in the affected area should be provided with financial assistance from the State to enable them to remain in their homes even under flooded conditions.  If I have an opportunity of conversation in the near future, I will certainly discourage anybody who would make silly suggestions of the kind referred to by the Minister. I do not think public money should be wasted, as I believe it would be wasted, in meeting, I suppose, what would be regarded as a small number of people making applications of that kind.  I do not think it would be wise from the point of view of the number of people who should be asked to accept alternative holdings elsewhere. I think, before this is pressed home on the people concerned, a decision should be taken by the Government, arising out of the report of the engineering <Col N="714" /> experts, as to what, if anything, could be done to prevent a recurrence of the flooding.  It might be possible for the Government, acting on the advice of the American experts and our own engineers, to prevent a recurrence of the disastrous flooding, either by building embankments, deepening the river, or widening it.  Let us wait to hear the collective wisdom of those experts who are coming here, before pressing the people who live in the Shannon valley area to go to alternative holdings.</P>
    <P>I can assure Deputy Walsh that when I was down there I had very painful experiences.  I have had the honour to represent the constituency for nearly 34 years, and I never met men who experienced anything like what was seen following the disastrous flooding of December last.  In my view, a lot of the people who insisted on remaining in their homes to watch their live stock as well as their families are entitled to our congratulations for their courage in doing so&mdash;especially under circumstances such as those under which I saw some of the people trying to exist during that particular period.  Not alone could you not use the lower portion of some of the houses at Shannon harbour but you would have to get a boat to bring you from a certain point alongside the Shannon to a house and then you would have to use a ladder to get to the second storey of the house, where two-storey houses were affected, as, to a great extent, they were affected by the flooding.</P>
    <P>I make this appeal to the Minister&mdash; and I am sure he will listen to it&mdash;to try and use his good offices to get these American engineering experts here as soon as he can and, in the first place, to get them to consult with our own engineering experts.  I would put this final suggestion to the Minister that, before the engineering experts who are coming here take a final decision, presumably after consultation with our own experts, they should first hear the viewpoint of some of the engineering advisers who have been helping the Shannon Farmers' Protection Association for some years on this vital and very difficult problem.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="715" /> When the Minister is replying I should like him to tell us who was responsible for the allocation of fertilisers that were recently distributed to many of the farmers living in the flooded areas.  I have been informed that some of the people who were lucky enough to get a supply of fertilisers neither applied for them nor were expecting to get them and that some people who had made application and believed they were entitled to get a share of them have not so far received them.  I should be very glad to know who was responsible for the allocation and distribution of these fertilisers that were recently distributed to those concerned in the area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to say a few words in connection with the alleviation of distress caused by flooding in the Shannon valley.  I have already referred on a number of occasions in this House and outside it to the methods used by the Government to deal with this distress.  In the course of a debate, the Minister interjected during the speech of the former Minister for Agriculture to emphasise that he fell into the Shannon himself.  He was trying to convey, in other words, that he knew all about the Shannon flooding and the serious conditions that obtained in that valley long before disaster overtook the residents in the area.  I do not dispute that he knew all about it: he did.  As he himself said, he was nearly drowned in the Shannon when he went to visit the area and have a pow-wow with those people whose homes and land were flooded.  We are all delighted and thankful that he was not swept away in the Shannon floods.  However, when he did visit the area the best hope he could hold out to the people there was interest-free loans.  He held up his hands in horror at the idea of compensation and gave it as his view that no Government could for a moment tolerate the idea of compensation. However, he said that interest-free loans would receive his sympathetic consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Quite a number of people in the area felt very depressed when they heard this news but, a few weeks <Col N="716" /> afterwards, the Tolka came to their rescue.  A few weeks later, the River Tolka took a trip outside its banks and did a certain amount of damage in Dublin.  Then every Deputy in Dublin City, whether Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Labour or Independent, tied himself up in knots in his efforts to get into the Taoiseach's office to ensure that the unfortunate people of Dublin would be compensated for the losses they suffered at a result of flooding by the River Tolka.  Of course, it was the first time that Dublin residents and Deputies realised that water can be used for more purposes than for washing themselves or for making tea.  It was the first time they realised what the unfortunate people living along the banks of the Shannon have had to undergo by way of hardship year after year for the past 30 years.  I have, of course, the greatest personal sympathy for those people living in the Tolka area who suffered losses and whose homes were damaged as a result of the flooding.  However, as the saying has it, out of evil cometh good.  The fact that the Tolka overflowed gave hope to the people living in the flooded Shannon areas that they would be compensated.</P>
    <P>I have always regarded the Minister as a strong-minded and strong-willed man.  As an individual, he gives the impression to the public that, no matter what Government may be in office, he is one man who will stand up for the rural community.  I know that certainly he can throw his weight around.  However, when we compare what he has squeezed out of the Government for the people in rural areas with what has been squeezed out of the Government by the Minister for Local Government for those whose homes have been flooded in Dublin we can see that the battle was won by the Tolka residents.  The amount of money in this Supplementary Estimate in respect of the Tolka flooding is £110,000.  That is the sum for the alleviation of distress caused by the flooding of the Tolka.</P>
    <P>What is the position so far as the unfortunate sufferers in the flooded Shannon areas are concerned?  Bear in mind that the Shannon valley <Col N="717" /> occupies quite a considerable area. The amount for the Shannon area is in the region of £20,000.  Therefore, we have the spectacle of the Tolka winning by £90,000 on the question of the alleviation of distress.  The Minister states that a further £90,000 is coming to the Shannon area.  We see nothing in this Supplementary Estimate in that regard.  We are told it is in connection with land transfer, the erection of new houses and the giving of new holdings in other areas to people in the Shannon area.  I have not seen the provision here for that.</P>
    <P>We have just heard Deputy Davin say that he believes the Government or the Department of Lands should be slow to transfer people out of this area until we have got the report from the American experts.  Personally, I could not disagree more with Deputy Davin in that attitude.  The frame of mind he has shown is typified by the chairman of the committee set up to represent the interests of the people who were so adversely affected by the flooding of the Shannon.  That gentleman&mdash;he is a clergyman&mdash;does not represent the views of the majority of the people who are affected.</P>

Was that statement made by Mr. Hughes to the Minister or not?</P>

I have no objection, and never had, to people applying to the Land Commission for holdings in exchange, if they want to leave their own holdings.

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear that point.  There is no suggestion by anybody that compulsory action be used to get people to leave the Shannon area.  I am not advocating that and never advocated it.  I am sure that there are individuals outside who would suggest that my method would be to use compulsion.  If people in the Shannon area wish to leave, it is the duty of the Minister for Lands to ensure they are given alternative holdings.  What I am afraid of all along is this.  Deputy Davin knows the <Col N="720" /> Land Commission as well as I do; he is 30 years trying to get them to do it.</P>

      <P>If the Land Commission get any excuse in the world put up to them that they should not move fast, they will certainly take that advice.  If the Land Commission get any excuse, on the ground that no action should be taken in this area to transfer people out of it on the basis that we should wait for the report of the American experts, then you may be sure the Land Commission will not be seen next or near the Clonown area or any other area for as long as they can avoid going there. That is only natural to expect of a big body like the Land Commission which moves so slowly.  Now, I have suggested here that the Tolka people have won this battle on the question of compensation or alleviation of distress.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>So far we are hoping that, by the time the matter is properly discussed and the position clarified as far as the Shannon is concerned, there will be no doubt in the final analysis as to who will win and who ought to win.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, in the course of his long statement, suggested that quite a number of people in the Shannon area are anxious to stay in houses that are flooded and that what they want is the State to raise the fireplaces.  I presume that the suggestion to the Minister would entail the provision of stilts for those people to move in and out of their houses.  I want the Minister to let me know and to let the House know the number of such applications that have been made to him from the flooded area.  We want to know, in regard to my constituency, in the Clonown area, how many people wish to remain in the flooded houses and how many people have made application to have the fireplaces raised. There is nothing as bad as to condemn a whole area on the basis that there are two or three awkward individuals in it.  There is not a parish in Ireland <Col N="721" /> in which you will not find two or three awkward individuals, but it is very wrong to pick out those two or three and depict them here or elsewhere as typical of the remainder of the people.</P>
    <P>Deputy Davin, in the course of his remarks, suggested there were two problems&mdash;the immediate alleviation of distress in the area and the long-term question of fixing up those people in the area and having something done with the Shannon.  That is quite true. We must take into consideration, when dealing with methods of giving immediate relief, the fact that it may be years before anything will be done with the River Shannon itself.  Therefore, I would urge that if the Land Commission have embarked on a scheme to build new houses and give new holdings of land to a number of farmers, they should go full tilt ahead with that programme and not be diverted from their aims by the hope that the American experts will give a report that action could be taken to relieve the flooding.</P>
    <P>I believe that in order to satisfy everybody concerned it is desirable to get the report of these American experts, but no matter what that report may be, whether it is favourable towards carrying out temporary measures of drainage on the Shannon or whether it gives hope of relief by the erection of embankments, we must bear in mind that it will take years before these reports and findings can be put into operation.  In the meantime, this annual flooding takes place. It is only natural for all of us to hope that we will never again see the like of the floods we had last winter.  We have no guarantee that we will not have them, but I want the House to know that next winter and the winter after that and every other winter in the Clonown area there will be houses flooded.  Only four years ago I brought to the attention of some people here in Dublin the serious conditions that existed in the Shannon area and some of the Sunday newspapers were good enough to send down to that area photographers who took photographs that are available now of houses flooded exactly as they were flooded last winter.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="722" /> It may be admitted that the water was only 18 inches high in the houses at that time and that it was three feet or four feet in the recent flooding, but most Deputies will admit that a flood of 18 inches in any house will cause as much damage as three feet would. Once the water comes into the house at all, it practically renders it useless for a month at least afterwards.  That condition has obtained with many of those unfortunate people for years past.  I ask that we take steps to provide alternative holdings for everyone who wishes to go.  For the remainder, where suitable sites are available, grants should be given for the erection of new houses and this work should be put in hands at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>
    <P>I understood from the Minister that once the Government had made up its mind to move into an area the whole question of distress would be viewed on a broad basis&mdash;not merely on the basis of giving a grant of £20 and a ton of coal but on the basis of deciding how these people were to get into and out of their houses.  It is a well-known fact that, on the road from Athlone into Clonown, there were three feet of water last winter and that people had no means of getting out of the flooded area, except by a very narrow road which was almost impassable at times.  That is a case where a special grant must be made available so that proper roads can be provided for these people to enable them to get in and out and so that their tractors, their carts and so forth may be utilised.</P>
    <P>It is no good reconstructing houses in these areas unless you give the people the means of getting in and out.  I do not want to see the county councils in Laois-Offaly, in Roscommon or in Galway saddled with the burden of providing the necessary money for carrying out these important works out of the rates.  It should be a national charge and it is a matter&mdash;I am not suggesting that the Government will not do it&mdash;which should be borne in mind.  That charge should be borne by the Government and not by the rates. The various county councils have quite enough to do in the normal maintenance <Col N="723" /> and repair of roads without having to foot the bill for abnormal cases like this.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government mentioned the distribution of fertiliser and said that a certain amount of dissatisfaction exists.  I have had similar complaints.  I do not propose to bore the House and the Minister with them, but I have sheafs of letters from people who are dissatisfied with the method adopted by this committee in Athlone for the relief of distress.  I am not in a position to judge whether the committee is at fault or not, but I am in agreement with the view expressed by the Parliamentary Secretary as to the desirability of all the Deputies representing the Shannon valley having a meeting with the representatives of the farmers concerned, apart altogether from the Shannon committee, to thrash out the difficulties that have arisen.  We can then go to the Minister in the form of a deputation and put our views and the views of the people concerned before him.</P>
    <P>I want to conclude by stating again &mdash;the Minister will not like my taking this line&mdash;that I am dissatisfied to see rural Ireland taking second place to the Dublin area in this matter of the alleviation of distress.</P>

      <P>I am sorry if I was abrupt with the Parliamentary Secretary. I want to point out that there is a lot more than damage to houses concerned and a lot more than the purchase of Odearest mattresses for individuals. There is the point that many of the people in Dublin, in spite of the fact that their houses were flooded, could walk out and get their pay packets of £6, £7 and £8 each week, but in the case of the farmers in the Shannon valley, their land was flooded and their means of existence <Col N="724" /> gone.  They had nothing.  The damage done to houses in the Tolka area does not compare at all with the damage done in the Shannon valley because the damage done to land must be taken into account&mdash;the damage done to a man's means of livelihood.  So far as the Dublin people are concerned, I am all for them, and more power to them.</P>

It has proved that the Dublin Deputy, the Dublin representative, can bring stronger pressure to bear on the Government than a Deputy from rural Ireland can.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Great play was made by the Minister with the fact that the local relief committee in Athlone, the committee which functions under very Rev. Dean Crowe, has given a considerable amount of help to the people who have suffered losses and whose houses have been flooded and that wherever a grant was given by that local committee, it was taken into account by the Minister's Department in giving further grants.  If we compare the total amount of money made available in the Lord Mayor's fund with the amount of money in the fund under the administration of the Very Rev.  Dean Crowe in Athlone, we will see what the comparison is.  The entire voluntary funds available in Athlone will be expended within the next week, but I do not think that situation will apply so far as the voluntary funds in Dublin are concerned.  These funds have been in excellent hands and the citizens of Dublin are privileged and lucky that they will have such a sympathetic man to help them, if the State does not relieve them to the full extent in relation to the losses suffered, but I am afraid the people in the Shannon <Col N="726" /> area will not be so lucky because there will be no fund left after this week, although there will be many cases still to be dealt with.</P>
      <P>However, I hope we will have a meeting very soon at which all these difficulties can be discussed and suggestions as to the best means of alleviating the distress of those remaining can be put forward.  I think it would be better for us to have that discussion outside the House.  In view of the remarks made by Deputy Davin I will restrain myself from making any further comments on this particular item mentioned by the Minister.</P>

      <P>I thoroughly agree with the suggestion made by Deputy McQuillan regarding the condition of the roads in the flooded area.  I was surprised that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government spoke at length and made no reference whatever to the condition of the roads in the flooded areas, especially in the Shannon valley.  One would think that the first care of the Minister for Local Government would be the resurfacing of the roads.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Deputy allow me?  I think the Deputy knows that on the 7th January a grant of £100,000 <Col N="727" /> was notified to the local authorities, including the local authorities for that area.  They were directed, not advised, to spend that money in the areas where the flooding took place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary is as well aware as I am that £100,000 would go no distance towards repairing the roads in the area seeing the amount of money which was made available to the City of Dublin.  I make no bones about saying that it is the duty of the Government, apart even from the local authorities, to make a special grant available for the area affected.  The Minister for Agriculture, when introducing his Supplementary Estimate, talked at length about the Shannon and, as we heard in Banagher, he dwelt on the subject of bringing over American experts here.  We all know that the Shannon Valley has been subjected to floods in the last century and in this century and the British Government, when they were here, carried out numerous investigations into the Shannon flooding.  Up to, I think, around 1882, according to the report of the Drainage Commission, something like £850,000 was expended on the stretch of Shannon from Lough Allen to Corbally Lake in order to relieve and prevent flooding.  The Minister knows as well as any Deputy from the area that there is nothing the American experts can offer by way of alterations to the Shannon that cannot be offered by our own engineers at home and which have not, in fact, been put on paper for them in the Drainage Commission Report of 1938-1940.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said at the outset, there are something like 24,000 acres of land involved in this problem and strange to relate during the lifetime of this House nothing of a constructive character was done to relieve the situation other than to issue the Drainage Commission report.  Up to 1952, 34,500 acres of land were subjected to flooding.  As a result of the improvements carried out up to that date it fell to 24,000 acres.</P>
      <P>I am not concerned with the political aspects of this problem but I am concerned to see that something of a constructive character is done to relieve the flooding.  This area was subjected to flooding three times inside something like a century and, as was mentioned by other speakers, farmers in those parts lost all they had.</P>
      <P>They lost the harvest.  They lost all the produce they had in their haggards and they were left practically on the road so that I say it is up to the Government not to rely on the advice they may receive from the American experts.  It is up to them to put the advice of their own experts into operation. The adage: &ldquo;Live horse and you will get grass&rdquo; is no good to the Shannon valley farmers who are subjected to this flooding.  In any contemplated scheme towards the relief of flooding in this area the various voluntary organisations should be taken into consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Davin, spoke about a deputation approaching the Minister for Agriculture <Col N="730" /> with a view to straightening out the difficulties which may obtain at the moment in relation to the allocation of money, or goods.  I think that Macra na Feirme and Muintir na Tíre and other voluntary organisations which have proved their worth by providing funds, food and fodder for the farmers should be included on any deputation that waits upon the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>And the Red Cross?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>The Red Cross, certainly. There are some organisations I might leave out, but I would not leave out those I have mentioned.  The suggestion that there might be some differences of opinion about the way in which the money or goods are allocated is one that could be resolved by the local committees responsible for making representations.  I am sure any applicant with a good case would receive consideration.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned propaganda and leaflets.  He said the leaflets would be available again, and that extra leaflets were published.  We welcome that, but I do not see why these leaflets should not be made available in the offices of the agricultural committees throughout the country.  We talk about decentralisation of Government; this may be only a very small contribution towards that object, but I do not see why those leaflets should not be made available in every county. Granted, a farmer can avail of the leaflets by sending a letter to the Secretary of the Department of Agriculture and he will have the leaflets by return of post.  That is not the point. It is the principle I am concerned with; I would like to see these leaflets available in the offices of the county committees of agriculture in every county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad that the farm buildings scheme is progressing and that an increased number of applications is coming forward in connection with the installation of water supplies.  I have had experience of dealing with applications in that direction and I think it is a pity that the scheme could not be co-ordinated with the provision of pumps under the local authorities.  I <Col N="731" /> know of isolated villages which could avail of the scheme jointly but which, because of lack of an adequate source of supply, are unable to avail of it at the moment.  I asked a question recently as to the number of applicants in my county who applied for this scheme jointly and I was informed that only one area made representations, and even that was not carried through eventually.  That is a pity.  When a pump is provided by a local authority some foresight should be used and it should be erected at a point where the greatest possible use could be made of it in order to co-ordinate it with a scheme for the laying on of water to farmers' houses and farmyards in general.</P>
    <P>I have often thought it a pity that there is not more collaboration or cooperation between the Department of Local Government and Department of Agriculture in that direction.  The Department of Local Government would have some advice to offer and, similarly, I presume the Department of Agriculture could tell Local Government something about it.  There should be some method of consultation inter-departmentally.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed to learn the figures for certain areas in connection with the T.B. eradication scheme. To my mind, it denotes an ill which, as the Minister said, will have to be cured as fast as possible.  It is one item about which too much propaganda cannot be made.</P>
    <P>I see under sub-head A, Grants to County Committees of Agriculture, an additional sum of £8,000 is required. I was not here when the Minister was explaining the sub-head, but I presume it is for demonstration plots.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;of this House and the Office of Public Works.  I notice the Minister was inclined to congratulate himself on the state of agriculture. I understand on this Vote we are more or less confined to the items that are in the sub-heads as they appear in the White Paper.  But there is nothing to be complacent about in my opinion regarding our over-all agricultural effort.  Were it not for the prices that live stock is fetching on the hoof at the moment I think our effort would amount to next to nothing.  I hope <Col N="733" /> that cattle on the hoof will continue to fetch high prices.</P>

On the main Estimate, we will get a chance to talk about this; it would not be fair to bore the House with it on a Supplementary Estimate. I wish to wind up by saying that I am glad this question of the imports of galvanised iron will be resolved because there is a certain amount of confusion in various areas regarding it. Some people who had iron purchased for the erection of haysheds do not know whether or not to go ahead and erect the sheds.  Having purchased the iron and drawn it to their farmyard, and laid it on the ground they are still in a quandary.  The Department of Agriculture which usually facilitates a Deputy every time he makes a query and goes to all rounds to get the information required, was not in a position to give a ruling as to whether payment would be made on imported iron after the date announced by the Minister. If the shed was not in course of erection&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Only one of the Deputies who spoke so far on this subject tried to misrepresent the position and although he vehemently protested he was not making political use of it he did his best to do so.  I want to recall to Deputy McQuillan that at that meeting in Banagher which he mentioned <Col N="734" /> in connection with the Shannon flooding&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>At that meeting the Minister for Agriculture and myself gave an outline of what the Government's intentions were, so far as the Land Commission side was concerned, regarding some kind of permanent alleviation of the flooded Shannon areas.  I found one person after another getting up and disassociating themselves from the very idea of migrating people from the Shannon valley.  After an hour of that kind of thing I began to feel I was an arch-criminal, a scheming scoundrel coming down to the Shannon valley with a plan to migrate the people from the valley and leave it barren and deserted. I was constrained to say before the end of the meeting that I had no such nefarious intention at all.  I made that clear.  I was told that Deputy McQuillan was the only person who said there should be migration, and let me say now in case there should be any misunderstanding that I agree with him&mdash;that there should be a certain amount of migration from the Shannon valley.</P>
      <P>Watch the terms I use&mdash;&ldquo; a certain amount&rdquo;.  I believe there should be a certain amount of migration despite all the protests of the people there and I think it is not good enough to leave people in holdings, particularly small holdings, that will always be subject to flooding in the Shannon valley.  Unless very strong representations are made to me to the contrary I intend to proceed, and the Government intends to proceed, with a certain amount of migration there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One thing I have never been quite able to see was this.  The meeting was a fairly large one with, I should say, between 700 and 800 people present and I could not understand why not one of them gave me an idea of what their intentions were.  I do not know <Col N="735" /> whether Deputy McQuillan was speaking for Clonown people or not&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Did any representative of Clonown speak to you?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Some gentleman spoke to me briefly after the meeting but I could never understand if he felt that way why he did not raise his voice when he found the design of the meeting going against his opinion.  He had the same freedom of speech as anyone else.  I want to say I certainly felt&mdash;and had the Minister for Agriculture been there I am sure he would have felt&mdash;that we were both being pictured as two gentlemen who had come down there determined to do something to injure the whole Shannon valley.  Such was not our intention at all.  I think we expressed our opinions and I think we were expressing the opinions of the majority of the people who had suffered from the freak floods, the terrible floods of last winter.</P>
      <P>Let me say this: a certain amount of doubt has been cast on the value of the American experts which the present Government has asked to come over here with a view to attacking this flooding problem.  We have the River Shannon as a permanent feature of this country and from time to time it breaks loose and floods the surrounding countryside.  We have to do one or other of two things and since it is impossible to jack-up the country high enough so that the Shannon cannot flood it we have to see if there is any other means of controlling the flooding. That is what we have asked these experts to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Carter who said that there was nothing the Americans could tell us that our own engineers could not tell us.  I have the greatest respect for our own engineers, but I believe that two heads are wiser than one.  We must not forget, too, that the experts we have asked over here are those who have carried into effect the Tennessee drainage&mdash;I am sure most Deputies have got the booklet concerning this vast scheme&mdash; and surely those who have been associated with that gigantic task must be able to give the benefit of <Col N="736" /> their experience in the case of a river like ours.  In comparison with what they dealt with, the River Shannon is only a minor stream and their experience is bound to be of some use to us.  I do not see anything wrong, and the Government acted wisely, in asking those people to come here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Furthermore, I would like to see something permanent done with the Shannon.  I think it was Deputy Carter who said there were 24,000 acres flooded at present but I think in the very area of Athlone there would be almost that much flooded by the freak floods of last winter.  I think the 24,000 acres would be an underestimate. Let the arterial drainage schemes for the major rivers be put into operation for the purpose of tackling this problem and bringing permanent relief to the people who are affected by flooding.  The Government is not afraid of its responsibilities in this respect.  Some Deputy said that the Government should loosen the purse-strings, but the Government has not tightened the purse-strings.  The Government is fully aware that the flooding by rivers is doing immense damage.</P>
      <P>The Land Commission has made a detailed survey and has the most intimate details of every house in the whole flooded area.  They have a plan for doing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>When will they take the steps?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Do not mind when they will take the steps.  I want to point out to Deputy McQuillan that during the time that the Land Commission inspectors were visiting the Shannon area, doing that, Deputy McQuillan was tabling anything from 15 to 30 questions to me and on many occasions the inspectors had to drop the work on the Shannon area and ferret out the information that Deputy McQuillan was seeking, and in respect of half the information he was seeking I do not know what he wanted it for.  I am not protesting that Deputy McQuillan has not the right to put down parliamentary questions on any subject but it is <Col N="737" /> only right to let him know that every question must be answered truthfully and as accurately as the officials of the Department can provide the information. I am quite prepared to answer the Deputy when he puts down a parliamentary question but it is only right that Deputies should know that the tabling of awkward questions may involve a great deal of official time. Occasionally it happens that the Minister has to reply to the effect that to give the information sought would involve the expenditure of time and money which would not be justifiable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I to take it that the Minister has suggested that I have held up investigation work in the Clonown area by putting down questions about land division?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>And not one of them about Clonown or the flooded area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>It was most remarkable that the flood of questions came just at the time the inspectors, under my instructions&mdash;and my instructions were from the Government&mdash;were making a complete comb-out of that area.  The Deputy can put down 40 or 50 questions a day from now on but I am letting him know that it is not without a certain amount of waste of officials' time because the information must be given accurately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>You do not like the questions.  I can see that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the privilege of the Deputy and any other Deputy to put down as many questions on as many subjects as he likes but it is only right that the Deputy should know that the Minister does not walk over to his office, open a book and find the information he gives.  It may mean sending three or four Land Commission inspectors chasing all over their area, interviewing people, finding, when they go to the houses, that the person they wish to see is at a fair or a market or the bog.  It <Col N="738" /> struck me as being most peculiar that at the time the inspectors were engaged in this work, and Deputy McQuillan must have known they were engaged in this work, that that was the time he chose to put down a flood of questions in order, in my opinion, to distract them from the work they were engaged on.  I think it was most unfair of the Deputy to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order. Can I take it that the Minister is making a definite charge that I put down these questions in order to prevent the Land Commission officials from carrying out a survey of the Clonown area?  Is that the charge the Minister is making?  Say either yes or no.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The problems created by the flooding of the Shannon and the flooding of the Tolka valley are different.  There is a certain difference. I think it was Deputy Denis Larkin who interjected to say that the people in this area had all their furniture and household goods in one room.  That is perfectly true.  I was through a great deal of the flooded area in the Shannon.  I was in houses where the water was three feet high.  It was a most depressing and desolate sight. Homes that had been neat and tidy had water lapping around the walls and slapping the doors.  It was as if they were dumped in the middle of a lake.  Only the roof and half the windows were above water.</P>
      <P>We have dealt as generously as possible with the people of the Shannon. It must be admitted that there was a much greater number of houses damaged in the Tolka flood than in the Shannon valley because down the years the people along the banks of the Shannon had the opportunity to choose dry sites.  Many did so and were out of reach of even the highest floods.  Unfortunately there were some who had not a suitable site or sufficient money to move to a new area.  We intend to come to their rescue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McQuillan seemed to be very interested in the number of people who decided not to move, who decided to remain on the old site.  We will not force anyone to go.  I do not think we have law to do so and, if we had, we would not use it.  There are certain sentimental ties that attach everyone <Col N="740" /> to his hearthstone, the place where he was bred, born and reared.  If a person feels so strongly that he will not surrender that, neither I nor any member of the present Government would dream of forcing such a person to move.  Despite what the Minister for Agriculture has said, I would feel like making these people an offer, at least, to raise the whole floor, to spend a little public money on raising the road into the house, the yard, and so on.</P>
    <P>I intend putting that proposal to the Government some day.  While at first glance it would seem that if a person gets an offer of a new house, new out-offices on his own land, it is churlish on his part to refuse, nevertheless, in some cases, as I know too well in migration schemes, some people have sentimental strings tying them to the old place and will not tear themselves away.  Many rearrangement and migration schemes have fallen down because of that, and no Minister for Lands has ever sought power in the Dáil to force them to give up the old spot if they do not do so of their own free will.  If they feel so strongly attached to the old site and the old house, I would feel like helping them and spending a little to raise them above the water level.</P>

      <P>The alleviation of flooding in the different areas where it has occurred has properly occupied a considerable portion of this debate. I shall confine myself to drawing the Minister's attention to the fact that <Col N="743" /> very little has been done following the inquiries made by the Milk Costings Committee.  I appreciate the fact that the findings have not as yet been submitted to the Minister, but I do think the Minister had an opportunity to-day of weighing the minds of the dairy farmers throughout the country and that he should make a detailed statement on the entire position.  Not a day passes on which we pick up a daily paper when we do not see a protest from somebody or other urging the Minister for Agriculture to have the findings of the Costings Committee published, and surely the Minister will agree that if a delay exists&mdash;and obviously it does&mdash;and an emergency exists for the dairy farmers, the Minister should do something to expedite the publication of the Costings Committee. At no time was it envisaged that the findings of the Costings Committee would take so long.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>When the committee was originally set up by the former Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Walsh, it was never envisaged that the Costings Committee would take so long to promulgate their findings and I would impress on the Minister that an emergency now exists in the dairying industry and that due to the fact that an emergency does exist he should take some concrete steps to alleviate the hardships being suffered by this much maligned section of the community.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach, Deputy O'Sullivan, was sitting there in the seat of the Minister for Agriculture when he went out and I was hoping that he would be here and that he would possibly give us the benefits of his expert knowledge on the dairying industry, because since he went over to that side of the House he has completely forgotten all the promises he gave when in opposition to the dairy farmers.  He advocated an immediate increase in the price of milk and actually the Minister for Agriculture himself, when in opposition, advocated <Col N="744" /> an increase in the price of milk.  In fact, he said that the then Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Walsh, did not go far enough when he gave an increase of one penny a gallon.  Deputy Dillon then advocated a further increase.  I shall refresh the Minister's mind on that.  At column 674, Volume 126 of the Official Report, Deputy Dillon said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The policy of the inter-Party Government was and continues to be to raise the average yield of our cattle from 365 gallons per cow ultimately to an average somewhere between 400 and 800 gallons, fully conscious of the fact that to arrive at anything like an 800-gallon average was a very long term policy, but that to arrive at a 500-gallon average was a reasonable objective.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I want to go on record as saying that the Irish creamery milk suppliers would be well occupied in advocating that the suppliers and producers should devote their energies to getting increased productivity and increased yields.  It is all very well to talk about a &ldquo;drink more milk&rdquo; campaign and to urge a Government to give an increase in the price of milk but they, on the other hand, have an onus on them and an obligation to the community as a whole.  It is my opinion that because of their present conduct and attitude they are not meeting those obligations.  However, I do say that the Minister should turn around, in view of the delay of the Costings Commission, and give an interim increase of 1d. per gallon, maybe after the local elections.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to point out that the wheat subsidy saved a considerable amount of money and the reason the Minister for Agriculture and the Government took that decision was evidently that they alleged that the producers of wheat were exploiting the community as a whole.  Now that that money has been saved, why will not the Minister turn around and give an interim increase of 1d. a gallon to dairy farmers?  I understand that on an estimated annual production of 740,000 cwt. of creamery butter the cost to the Exchequer of an increase of 1d. a gallon, with no increase in butter, would be £801,666.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I really have no serious complaint to make about the general <Col N="747" /> approach of the House to the Supplementary Estimate which I have introduced. I think I would like to refer to one or two points that were made by Deputy Walsh.  Dungarvan, to which he made reference, has not had an easy time, but it is an experiment in cooperation which I do not regret and which I have high hope may yet justify itself very fully.  But I am obliged to confess that they have not been lucky.  They started just at a time when circumstances made apples for industrial use relatively valuable and the result is that the service they have to give the apple grower has not been as indispensable as it used to be, but it will be again in time.</P>
      <P>Secondly, they started at a time when other branches of agriculture, owing to the beneficent operations of the inter-Party Government, had become extremely remunerative and in those circumstances it is very difficult to get farmers to plant orchards.  The fact is that the farmer who plants an acre of apples in 1955 will get no return from that acre until 1960, for it takes five years for an apple orchard to mature.  However, I think it is only just to the farmers' co-operative in Dungarvan to say that they met reverses which came their way with resilience and courage, that they are diversifying their activities.  If their members and the rest of us are prepared to help them through these difficult years, we have every reason to hope that this apple-packing station will amply justify itself and will continue to be what it now is, as well equipped and as good an apple storage unit as there is in the British Isles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope I have now made it clear what the position is in regard to the user of foreign galvanised iron on buildings built with the assistance of grants under the farm building scheme. I would like to recapitulate the facts briefly so that they may be on record. In respect of any application for a farm building grant which the Department received on or before 15th January the applicant is entitled to use any iron he likes, foreign or domestic manufacture. In respect of applications reaching the Department after the 15th <Col N="748" /> January, 1955, grantees are required to use galvanised iron of Irish manufacture to qualify for the grant.</P>
    <P>But that regulation is qualified by this exception, that in order to meet the difficulty of hay barn contractors who had large stocks of foreign iron on hands prior to 15th January, the Department is prepared in certain cases&mdash;and notification has been sent to those people who are entitled to this concession&mdash;to allow that in respect of 50 per cent. of the stock of foreign iron they now hold they may use it on the construction of buildings to be paid for in part, at least, out of grants under the farm buildings scheme.  I think that arrangement is working out all right.  If any Deputy has a special case in mind on which he thinks misunderstanding has arisen, or somebody has not got their rights, if he will write to me personally or to the Secretary of my Department, we will immediately examine the specific case in which he is interested, in order to see that what can be done is done to meet the convenience of all parties concerned.</P>
    <P>Deputy Walsh also said that he had some anxiety because he was informed that people who wanted to construct hay barns were unable to get supplies of iron of Irish manufacture, and that therefore the whole farm buildings scheme might be held up.  I would be glad if the Deputy would draw my attention to any such cases of which the Deputy knows.  General allegations of that kind are often made, and yet, when you come to pinpoint them, you find that the complainant is very hard put to state a positive case.  It is important to ensure that, if there are genuine complaints, they will not be overlooked.  The only way I can assure that is to depend on my colleagues in this House, from whatever side, to write to me personally or, if not to me, to my Department, drawing my or the Department's attention to the specific cases.  If they are misinformed, they will receive the facts as we know them, and we will appreciate their efforts to help us even though, on further inquiry, it may appear that the information given to them was not as watertight as it appeared when it was related to us.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="749" /> I recoil from the old concept that we ought all to enter into a horrible kind of competition in this House for opportunities to shovel out public money without any regard to the merits of the case.  It is much easier for me, when I am Minister for Agriculture, or when Deputy Walsh is Minister for Agriculture, to come in here and announce that we are going to shovel out public money to anybody.  That is always a popular thing to do.  If I interpreted correctly the direction I got from this House, in so far as the Shannon floods were concerned, I was to examine the case of everybody whose farm or homestead was inordinately flooded, and to relieve distress, erring on the side of liberality rather than parsimony.  It was in that spirit that I undertook the task.</P>
    <P>I do not think we left any individual in the Shannon valley labouring under disress.  I call in evidence the fact that if that were so, if we were leaving disress after us, the local fund in Athlone town and Tuam town would be exhausted long since, and the position would be that I would have a large area of uncompensated distress; but that is not the fact.  There is a subsantial balance left in the Athlone find unappropriated.  My information is that the fund in Tuam is more than sufficient to look after everybody who experienced distress in that area.  I suppose any of us could have found means to rattle out more public money to the residents of the Shannon valley, of that was the purpose for which we went there.  It is true to say that I was rather concerned that people would look down their noses at me for being improvidently ambitious in envisaging a liability of £90,000 for the rehabilitation of families in the flooded area, together with an unascertainable possible outlay for the control of the river, on the advice tendered to us by American engineering experts, in consultation with our own.  I do not think anybody could come into this House and ask us to take steps to undertake a liability of anything between £100,000 and £200,000 to deal with the problem in that particular restricted area.  I think it is a formidable sum.  If I interpreted the mind of the Dáil correctly, <Col N="750" /> it was that they were determined that there should not be a recurrence of the kind of problem with which we have had to grapple in the Shannon valley during the autumn and winter of last year.</P>
    <P>It is in that spirit that I have put these proposals before the House, but I do not think we should regard them as a trivial expense into which we can walk lightheartedly.  It is not a small sum, but I think it is a sum that we would be justified in spending if it gave us reasonable assurance for the future that we had effectively abated the problem which has perplexed us in the past few months.  I would urge the House not to make it an issue of confusion and bewilderment as to what we are going to do in the rehabilitation of the living circumstances of those people.  It is quite plain, and I think it is a good thing, that we can, in some matters in this House, argue <i>bona fide</i> on all sides, without finding ourselves falling into the ordinary political phalanx for the purpose of the discussions.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear that the Minister for Lands is much more sold than I am, on the desirability of reconstructing houses where they now stand to alleviate the circumstances of the residents.  I agree with Deputy McQuillan that, if a person wants to stay on the old hearthstone, and endure perennial flooding, none of us have the right to force him out of it. We can say: &ldquo;Very well, if you want to stay there, well and good, but do not ask us to raise public money to be spent on the floor or spent on the fireplace, because no matter what arrangements we make, if there is bad flooding, instead of having two feet of water in the kitchen, you will have 12 inches of water.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I can understand that the Minister for Lands has really a more intimate knowledge of the housing conditions in rural Ireland.  He is obsessed with the intense devotion which we all know certain people have for their homes.  People will find this hard to believe but it is true.  At the worst period, when we were seriously apprehensive of certain houses getting completely flooded, responsible representatives <Col N="751" /> of the Athlone committee went into a house in the Shannon valley where an old man lived alone. They found he had his bed suspended from the rafters and he was tramping around the kitchen in high boots. When night fell he climbed on to his bed suspended from the rafters&mdash;and the water was then up to the handle of the door.</P>
    <P>A responsible Army officer said to him&mdash;they were trying to persuade him to evacuate but he would not go&mdash;&ldquo;The water is now up to the handle of the door.  What will you do if it goes as high as the lintel of the door?  How will you get down?&rdquo;  The old man replied: &ldquo;I have provided for that.  I have loosened a sheet of iron in the roof and I can climb into a boat I have tied to the gable.&rdquo;  You could not force that old man to leave the house. As a matter of fact, he was not a very old man: he was an active man in his sixties.</P>
    <P>To most of us it seems approximate to madness that a man would seriously insist on remaining in a house where the water was three feet high in the kitchen and where the bed was suspended from the rafters and a sheet of iron was loosened in the roof and a boat tied to the gable.  As it happened the water did not go as high as the bed.  You have to allow for that type of mentality.  That is what the Minister for Lands has in mind when he says he feels we should try to help those people in their existing homes. My feeling is that if you put a foot under that man's floor the only difference it would make is that, instead of having his kitchen flooded by three feet of water, as was the case last December, it would be flooded by two feet.  In my view, to do so would be a waste of public money because, no matter what alternation you make to the house, you cannot guarantee effectively that he will not be sloshing about in water in his kitchen if the Shannon goes on the rampage again at any future time.</P>
    <P>I do not think we have to make any apology for the fact that the Minister for Lands and myself revealed to our <Col N="752" /> colleagues a certain difference of opinion on this matter for the purpose of eliciting views from Deputies on all sides of the House.  I say that we should say to those persons: &ldquo;If you agree to move, we will shift you either to a new holding or to a new site, and if you will not move we will not spend public money on reducing the possibility of your kitchen being flooded by three feet to the possibility of its being flooded by two feet.&rdquo;  As far as I can find out, the weight of the opinion expressed here to-day by Deputies on all sides of the House is rather against the view of the Minister for Lands and more in favour of my view.  There may be some Deputies in the House who have not spoken and who incline more to the view of the Minister for Lands.  I can assure them that if they make their opinions known their opinions will be valued and considered in whatever the final decision must be.</P>
    <P>Dean Crowe's fund, the Athlone fund, as I understand it, is still receiving subscriptions.  Deputy Carter asks: &ldquo;Why get any engineers from abroad?&rdquo;  I think the Minister for Lands answered that question.  When I went down to Shannonbridge to the meeting and announced the Government's decision to call in American consultants&mdash;I think Deputy Carter was there&mdash;I said: &ldquo;I do not think foreign consultants would give us an information which our own adviser have not already given us but it will ease the public mind if, having called in the best consultants we can and put them in touch with our own engineers the consensus of foreign and domestic opinion is the same.&rdquo;  I think that is useful even if they have nothing new to tell us.  I think it is important to convince the people that we have left no stone unturned to find a remedy, if one can be found, and, if one cannot be found, the people will know it was not for the want of looking for one.</P>
    <P>I think Deputy Davin asked who decided where the fertilisers should be put.  We did.  The primary purpose of the fertilisers was to try and get early grazing on as many holdings as we could so as to avoid the possibility of people being left without fodder between now and the growth of grass <Col N="753" /> in May and June.  I did not quite follow what the Parliamentary Secretary meant when he said that a lot of people were uneasy about the fodder situation in the Shannon valley next autumn.  If there is one part of Ireland in which there is no prospect of such a shortage next autumn it is the Shannon valley, which has the richest fallow meadows of any part of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Deputy Carter referred to the condition of the roads in that area.  I understand that, over the years, most of the roads in that area have been raised.  It is remarkable that it was only at the very apex of the floods in those areas that the roads disappeared. I went along roads there and, though the land seemed to be inundated for miles, the roads remained above the flood.  In the Clonown area the road disappeared beneath the flood but down between Clonown and Barrow&mdash; the place where I fell into the flood&mdash; though the flood extended for many square miles the road was above the flood and it was only when the flood undercut the road that the edge of the road gave way.  I know that the county engineers of the area have the question of the roads present in their minds and I believe the matter is under review.</P>
    <P>I did not mention to-day, although perhaps I should have, that, over and above the work I reported to the House of a specific character designed to relieve distress, there remains in operation the general offer of interest free loans to anyone who lost stock, fuel or fodder as a result of the floods. That is on a much more general scale than the question of distress, in regard to the committee which was charged with relief of distress.  The offer of interest free loans extends to anybody who has suffered the loss of stock, fuel or fodder&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Let us deal with one thing at a time.  If the Deputy knows of a case of dire distress and refers it to the Red Cross, I imagine the distress will be promptly relieved.  When it comes to the interest-free loans, interest-free loans are provided not for the relief of dire distress but for the relief of persons who had losses of fodder, fuel or stock in the exceptional flooding of the Shannon valley.  Now, I am asking the Deputy if that criterion had been applied to the whole country and if every farmer who had suffered a loss of fuel, stock or fodder had a right to free loans, would not practically every farmer qualify for it?</P>

      <P>Deputy Carter spoke of the desirability of installing stocks of the Department leaflets in the county committee of agriculture offices.  Now, if the Deputy presses that view strongly upon me I will give it very careful consideration, but I think that if he discusses it with Deputy Walsh, Deputy Walsh would share my view that if you started sending leaflets in bulk to county committee offices it would be awfully hard to keep them clean and neat.  You need a regular installation to keep leaflets of that kind clean and in order and readily accessible.  The county committees have not all got the kind of accommodation which they could use for that purpose.  The danger of this kind of leaflet getting scattered about is not inconsiderable.  In addition to that, the leaflets are always kept under review in the Department and sometimes <Col N="757" /> we have to take a whole 200 or 300 copies of a leaflet and throw them away and put into the pigeon hole a new leaflet.  If you scatter them all over the country, it is not easy to do that&mdash;it is not impossible, but it is not easy.</P>
      <P>I do not doubt that if any C.A.O. in Ireland sends to the Department and asks for a dozen copies of a leaflet he will get them&mdash;and if he is not entitled to get them I will see he is.  If he wants a dozen copies to give to farmers at a lecture or demonstration of some kind, I am sure Deputy Walsh would agree it would be very desirable to facilitate him in that way. Ordinarily, however, if the farmers are made aware that by writing in they can get any leaflet they like, it is probably the best way to distribute them. If Deputy Carter has in mind that the C.A.O. should have the right to bespeak a dozen or two dozen copies of a leaflet on potatoes, where one of his officers is going to give a lecture on potatoes, I have no doubt that can be arranged.</P>
      <P>Deputy Walsh asked were we going to lean on Sligo for replacements of eliminated cows in intensive areas. The answer is that at this stage of our plans, where we have as yet created no attested areas, our aim is to try to get replacements from within the herd. Our ideal would be to persuade the farmer not to bring in any strange beasts after reactors had been eliminated; or, if he must bring in some, to get them tuberculin tested before he brings them on to the same part of the land where he has the tuberculin free herd.  Do not forget there is going to be in every intensive area a period of compulsion.  When we reach a stage when about 90 per cent. of the farms in the area are attested farms, we will then have to bring legislation into this House to get power to require the remaining 10 per cent. to bring their farms up to the attestation level.  Until we get every farm in an area attested we cannot call it an attested area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask a question? In the case of an individual farmer who wishes to get his farm tested, how <Col N="758" /> does he arrange regarding the fencing, his fences with another farm?  Is there provision for that in any of the schemes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so. I think he has to do that himself. There is no subsidy for fencing, not that I know of.  I am pretty certain that answer is right.  Deputy Walsh knows this himself, but may I say to others that nothing gratifies the Department of Agriculture more than that responsible Deputies should formulate inquiries of that kind, so that we can give them authoritative answers which they can communicate to their constituents?  Deputies will be asked every kind and variation of question.</P>
      <P>I know they cannot send them all to us, but if they are asked a question as to what the people are entitled to under a particular scheme, let them not hesitate to write it on a sheet of paper and send it to the Department, so that we may send them a categorical answer that they can use thereafter in informing their constituents. I know it is hard for Deputies to know all the ins and outs of a scheme like the bovine T.B. eradication scheme at this stage, because it is all new.  Especially in the case of Deputies like Deputy Gilbride or one coming from one of the intensive areas, I hope they will not hesitate to press on the Department any inquiries they get, so that we can provide them with the material to disseminate amongst their constituents. Eventually there will come a time when 90 per cent. of the farms in Sligo are attested.  We will then have to come into the House and look for power to compel the remaining 10 per cent.  Then all Sligo will be an attested area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Will you not be up against that before you reach the 90 per cent.?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am told not.  I am told that the experience elsewhere has been that to proceed up to about <Col N="759" /> 80 per cent. on a voluntary basis is the soundest procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>One farmer in six can throw you out, can put you out of gear completely, regarding the fencing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am assured that experience has taught that the best way to proceed is to proceed on a voluntary basis up to a certain level and then, when you reach the optimum on the voluntary basis, you must come for compulsory powers, but that it is futile to seek compulsory powers before you have got the maximum co-operation that voluntary effort can evoke.  When you get Sligo attested and it is declared an attested area, it then becomes what Deputy Walsh was thinking of, a fountainhead for supplies of attested cattle and, in those circumstances, the people of County Sligo are riding high, wide and handsome, because, as things are going at present, it appears almost certain that Sligo will be an attested area years before any other area around and that must put a very substantial premium on dairy cattle from County Sligo, so that I hope and pray that, at this crucial hour, the Sligo people will not make the appalling mistake of throwing away their foundation shorthorn stock.</P>
      <P>I want to make this prophecy, and prophecies are dangerous things to make, that this day five years the shorthorn heifer from County Sligo will be worth from £10 to £15 more than a shorthorn heifer from any other part of Ireland.  The people who have shorthorn herds in County Sligo will find that the progeny of these herds of dual-purpose shorthorn cattle, and particularly the female progeny, are worth from £10 to £15 a head more than heifers of equal age and quality from any other county in Ireland.  The awful danger is that, instead of appreciating the immense potentialities of that preferential position, the farmers in Sligo will suffer themselves to be swept away by the present passion for Aberdeen-Angus cattle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no harm in crossing a good shorthorn cow with an Aberdeen-Angus bull, if you want a saleable store beast, but if they have good cows <Col N="760" /> that could produce good heifers, let the farmers of Sligo bring them to dual-purpose shorthorn bulls which we will place for them in County Sligo.  If they turn out to be bulls, let them burn the horns off them in the first week of their lives.  If they are heifers, I would take the horns off them in any case, but that is as each farmer thinks best for himself to do.  With or without horns, the heifers will be worth from £10 to £15 more than any other heifers and if you burn the horns off a good shorthorn bullock at two and a half years old, fat, there will be very little difference between him and the best blue or black bullock that ever was bred.</P>
    <P>I shall be much obliged, as I said before, to Deputy Walsh or any other Deputy who hears of a case of somebody who is seriously inconvenienced by inability to get supplies of Irish galvanised iron, if he will give me particulars, so that we may investigate the case without delay.</P>
    <P>Lest there be any ambiguity or doubt about the difficulties in regard to the milk prices tribunal, the decline in the staff may not have been remedied because there is no use in getting untrained staff.  It is not like getting staff for the land project or some similar enterprise which you can train in a relatively short time.  The staff required for a costings body must be a fairly highly trained staff, or they will be no good at all.  You cannot just go out and get half a dozen highly trained fellows for an enterprise of that kind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know the ins and outs, but the difference is that, if you are looking for semi-trained staff, they are quite easy to get, but, if you are looking for trained staff, they are apparently not so easy to get.</P>

      <P>All I can say is&mdash;and I say this with full authority as Minister for Agriculture&mdash;let not the Costings Commission delay their deliberations <Col N="761" /> for the want of staff.  If they want staff, I will give it to them, if I have it, but I cannot manufacture highly trained staff, if they are not there.  It may not be worth while training them. If it takes six months to train a suitable man, the Costings Commission, having been asked to get a report out in six months, there is no use in training a man for a job which will be over before his training is finished.  I do not know what the procedure is.  I have never interfered, mixed or meddled with it, but let them not delay their deliberations for want of staff.  On the other hand, I say to them with equal emphasis: let them not be bustled or hustled or bamboozled into making precipitate or premature reports because they think the public are getting impatient.  Let them do their job right as they think it right to do it, and, as soon as it is finished, whatever report they give me, I will communicate to the public, but when I communicate it to the public, let us bear this fact in mind: there is no human creature left on the face of God's earth who wants to buy butter at the price at which we are prepared to produce it.  That is the bleak, inescapable fact.  The verdict of no Costings Commission in this country is going to alter the fact which Deputy Walsh had to face when he was Minister and which I have to face now, that we can subsidise the price of butter on the domestic market&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I cannot make people outside Ireland pay more for butter than they want to pay.  It is a source of gratification to me at present that, for such exports of Irish butter as we are making, we are getting, I think, the highest price paid to any exporting country in the world, for the small surplus we have to export, but, even so, <Col N="762" /> we have to pay a heavy subsidy in order to get it out, so let us start thinking about that inescapable fact.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. O'Donnell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1955, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Local Government, including Grants to Local Authorities, Grants and other Expenses in connection with Housing, and Miscellaneous Grants, including a Grant-in-Aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the second Supplementary Estimate introduced for the alleviation of distress caused by flooding in Dublin City on the 8th and 9th December last.  The first Estimate was for a token Grant-in-Aid of £10 pending the compilation of an estimate of the provision required.  The amount required is now estimated at £110,000.  Deducting savings on other sub-heads of the Vote for Local Government in the current year, the net sum now required is a provision of £10.  As in the case of the first Supplementary Estimate, issues out of the Grant-in-Aid are made towards expenditure incurred by any body or organisation duly authorised <Col N="765" /> by the Government in alleviating the distress caused by the flooding in Dublin City.  The Estimate makes provision for grants towards expenditure incurred by three bodies, namely, the Dublin Flood Relief Committee, Dublin Corporation and the Irish Red Cross Society.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Flood Relief Committee was appointed by me to assist in alleviating the distress caused by the flooding, the expenditure of grants by the committee being subject to conditions laid down by me with the consent of the Minister for Finance. Subject to these conditions, the administration of the grants is entirely in the hands of the committee and the awards made by them are not subject to review.  The members of the committee are the Honourable Mr. Justice Cecil Lavery as Chairman, Mrs. Denis Kelly, Edward J. Duffy, Dr. Patrick J. Hernon and Michael L. Burke.  These persons were selected because of their knowledge and special experience of analogous work.  Estimated disbursements by the committee amount to £81,000.  The exact figure is not yet known as payments of grants are still outstanding in some cases and some claims recently received are still under examination.  I understand that grants have been made or will be made by the committee in about 2,000 cases.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity of publicly thanking the committee for giving so much time and energy to the task assigned to them.</P>
    <P>A provision is made of approximately £11,000 in respect of expenditure incurred by the Dublin Corporation, the principal items being the purchase and distribution of coal, pumping out of basements, clearing of house drains and execution of essential first-aid repairs to houses in order to render them habitable.</P>
    <P>The Irish Red Cross Society incurred expenditure of approximately £18,000 in the Dublin City area, principally on the issue of bedding, clothing, fuel and food and it is proposed to reimburse the society by way of the Grant-in-Aid.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. D. Larkin Mr. D. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>In speaking on this Supplementary Estimate introduced by <Col N="766" /> the Minister for Local Government, may I express our disappointment at the fact that up to the present the Minister indicates that the total amount which will be made available to those who suffered by the flooding in the Tolka area on December 8th and 9th last is approximately £81,000?  Might I remind the House of the fact that, when this matter was previously before it, Deputies, representing the area involved, pressed the Minister and the Government for some clear indication as to the heading under which the emergency would be dealt with?  When I use the word &ldquo;emergency&rdquo; in relation to this particular problem I think every Deputy will accept that the situation in the Tolka area, the North Strand, Fairview and Richmond Road on December 8th and 9th was a situation of emergency.</P>
      <P>It is no intention of mine to enter into comparisons such as those drawn by Deputy McQuillan earlier to-day, but it is essential to point out, since I represent Dublin North-East and that was the area involved, that Deputy McQuillan's references were, to say the least of it, unfortunate.  As I pointed out on a previous occasion we were dealing in the North Strand with a situation arising from the flooding of December 8th and 9th.  We were not dealing with a situation arising from the effects of possible periodic flooding. We were not dealing with a situation arising from foreseeable flooding or the effects of foreseeable flooding. We were dealing with a situation confronting, as the Minister has told us, 200 persons.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">

    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. D. Larkin Mr. D. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>What was the situation? Deputy McQuillan was good enough to say that in his opinion Deputies representing Dublin seemed to have more influence with the Minister for Local Government as compared with Deputies representing the <Col N="767" /> areas affected by the flooding of the Shannon, but when I see the figure which is presented to us now I doubt as to whether there is any foundation for Deputy McQuillan's suggestion.  In the North Strand area there are 2,000 families covering an area of approximately one mile by a quarter of a mile; that was the area affected by the onrush of the flood waters, waters which inundated their homes within a period of almost one hour, wrecked those homes and in many cases ruined every solitary possession they had.</P>
      <P>Rural Deputies may not be familiar with the area involved in the Tolka flooding.  There is one feature which renders that area specific because a substantial number of the dwellings affected are actually situated below the level of the road.  I am referring to the basement type single-storey house which might almost be described as leaning against the road.  In the front rooms of these houses flood waters reached a depth of four to five feet.  The Minister for Lands speaking earlier here to-day made some reference to the situation in the Shannon area.  I do not think that the Minister for Lands would run any personal risk entering a flooded house in the Shannon area but anyone entering the houses in the North Strand area under flood conditions ran a serious risk because the weight of the water affected the flooring and the foundations were liable to give way at any moment.  In hundreds of cases, particularly in the North Strand, heavy articles of furniture, such as pianos and sideboards, actually broke through the floors on which they rested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the course of the debate in December last when the Minister introduced a token Vote Deputies asked under what headings it was proposed to deal with this emergency.  It was suggested that the first heading for consideration should be damage to personal property, furniture and personal effects.  Then there was actual damage to the structure of the dwelling houses themselves.  There was a third heading and that was the loss suffered by business people as a result of the <Col N="768" /> flooding.  To-day the Minister told us he was making provision for £81,000 and that some further cases might still remain to be dealt with.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I should correct the Deputy.  I am making provision for £110,000, not £81,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. D. Larkin Mr. D. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am dealing with the position of people directly affected and when I refer to £81,000 I am deliberately leaving out the £11,000 which is being provided for the Dublin Corporation in respect of the steps taken by that body to provide coal, clean up the dwelling-houses and carry out emergency repairs, and I have deliberately refrained from referring to the amount to be provided to recoup the Red Cross for expenditure incurred. The Minister will accept, therefore, that I am referring now only to the amount to be provided directly to the people involved at the present moment.</P>
      <P>I will go back to making the point that in my estimation the sum of £81,000 will not represent any kind of a reasonable amount to be provided for those who suffered as a result of the flooding of 8th December and 9th December.  On the question of the amount to be provided by Dublin Corporation by way of grants, the expenditure of the corporation on coal was undertaken in an effort to provide immediate emergency relief for families who were left entirely without any means of heating or drying their houses.  May I say on this particular point that it is now the 24th March, over three clear months from the date of the flooding, and I think I can say without any fear of contradiction whatsoever that a very substantial number of the houses in the area affected by the flooding are still damp.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>What was the figure spent by the corporation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. D. Larkin Mr. D. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the figure spent by the corporation&mdash;we were informed more than a month or so ago &mdash;was some £25,000.  Of course that figure included the cost of purchasing the coal and the cost of paying the <Col N="769" /> workers engaged in cleaning out operations and emergency repairs.  I think it is correct to say that in many hundreds of houses it will be months before they are completely dried out. Not only that but it was estimated shortly after the flooding took place and when building surveyors employed by the corporation had an opportunity to examine some of the houses that it would take at least six months before the effects of the flooding would show up.  In other words, it would take at least six months before any competent building surveyor would be able to say clearly and definitely whether a house was safe or whether its foundations were not dangerous.</P>
      <P>This is the situation which exists in the roads adjoining the North Strand because, as I said earlier, many of the houses consist of a storey level with the road and another storey down eight or ten steps below the level of the road.  Many of these houses did not have very secure foundations and when flood water rushed into them it resulted in about four or five feet of water being in the front rooms and up to eight feet or more in the lower rooms.</P>
      <P>Many of the houses occupied and affected by the floods are occupied by people who had lived there in many cases for many years, and their families before them in many hundreds of cases.  Furniture and personal effects accumulated over years by gradual saving were just wiped out and disappeared overnight.  Valuable pieces of antique furniture saved up from generation to generation were caught by the flood waters and wrecked beyond repair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister indicates that a sum of £81,000 appears to be nearly the total amount that will be granted to the 2,000 cases.  I would like to get from the Minister a clear indication as to the actual categories of cases that are being dealt with by this amount of money referred to in the Estimate.  There is the damage to furniture and personal effects and there is the damage to the structure of the houses some of which are owned by the people themselves, some <Col N="770" /> of them being purchased through insurance societies, etc., some of them being rented by the occupants, and in very few cases are the people living in these houses in a position to restore them to their pre-flood condition.</P>
    <P>Surely the Minister and the Government will have some consideration for those who suffered serious loss or damage to their stocks in the small shops round that area.  Very many families living in the North Strand and Fairview and Richmond Road areas were relying on their vocation of shopkeepers serving the needs of the immediate neighbourhood to obtain a reasonable living, and a very high proportion of these shops suffered not only damage to the structure but the goods were ruined irretrievably.  Has any reasonable consideration been given to the position of these people?</P>
    <P>The Tolka area to my mind, and speaking again as a Deputy for the constituency affected, is in a completely different position from the other areas in our country affected by flooding.  Some few weeks ago I endeavoured to obtain an answer from the Minister for Local Government as to the cause or the alleged cause of the flooding in the Tolka area.  He was unable, I understand, to provide the information.  We were, however, informed in another place that flooding in this area was occasioned by a number of factors&mdash;unusually heavy rainfall, unusually high spring tides and the collapse of a railway bridge.</P>
    <P>It is the opinion of many of those affected that that railway bridge should not have collapsed under the conditions then existing and that if steps had been taken in earlier years to ensure proper drainage and flow from the River Tolka hundreds of people would not have been driven out from their homes in the middle of the night of December 8th, 1954.  It is nearly time that some authoritative statement was issued as to the cause of the flooding and as to whether the collapse of the bridge over the G.N.R. at the East Wall was responsible in any way for the flooding of the North Strand.  May I be permitted to put it to the Minister that, if there is any <Col N="771" /> basis for the suggestion that the collapse of that bridge was in any way responsible for the flooding out of the men, women and children in that area on December 8th, the situation must be dealt with on a basis slightly different from that of a normal flood?</P>
    <P>We endeavoured in December to make the case in this House that the flooding in the Tolka area was unprecedented. Deputies, like Deputy McQuillan, representing other constituencies, particularly rural constituencies, paid us the compliment of saying that if flooding had not taken place in the Tolka area and if the Dublin Deputies had not opened their mouths in this House there would have been very little consideration given to the people affected by the flooding in the Shannon valley.  I do not think there is any Deputy representing a Dublin constituency who is so vain as to think for one moment that the sentiments he expresses will carry greater weight than those expressed by a Deputy from a rural constituency.  I would hazard a guess that the reverse would have more truth in it.  I do say, from my short experience in the House, that Deputies from the Dublin constituencies do not always get a great opportunity to take part in debates because of the fact that they are outnumbered, out-spoken, out-talked, by rural Deputies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>And when our constituents are faced with emergencies and suffer as the constituents of the Deputies in Dublin North East suffered, we will open our mouths as wide as possible and talk as long as we can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that a number of the people affected by the flooding have received grants and allowances from the Flood Relief Committee and that there is the most widespread dissatisfaction among the people concerned. <Col N="772" /> I am not in any way impugning the committee set up by the Minister for Local Government.  They had a task that anyone in the House would quail from facing.  I have never been satisfied as to their terms of reference. I have not found it possible to get a clear indication in this House as to exactly what are their terms of reference.</P>
    <P>In December, after the flooding, a token Vote of £10 was passed and there was a specific general heading for that token Vote&mdash;a Grant-in-Aid to relieve distress.  If dwelling-houses, shops and places of business in this area were flooded and if the cause of the flooding can be traced in any way to the failure of public bodies or undertakings like the G.N.R. to keep the river bed clean and open or to maintain their bridges in secure condition, the situation must be considered in terms other than terms of a Grant-in-Aid.</P>
    <P>May I put it to the Minister that if one house in the North Strand was flooded and that that was as a result of the collapse of the railway bridge in the East Wall Road, the householder concerned who may have lost all his possessions is entitled to be treated on a basis other than a basis of a Grant-in-Aid?</P>
    <P>I expressed the view in December&mdash; and I make no apology to any Deputy in this House or to anybody outside this House&mdash;that there is no comparison in the situation that developed on the 8th and the 9th December in the Tolka area and that which developed in the Shannon valley area.  I think it only right to say, as a Dublin Deputy, that everything that could should be done to alleviate the position of those who suffered from flooding in the Shannon or in any other part of the country.  I leave the question of what the means should be or how families affected by flooding in those areas could be relieved to the representatives from the areas affected because I am satisfied that they would be much more competent than I to make a case for the people concerned.</P>
    <P>I have heard of people living in Leinster Avenue, North Strand, and <Col N="773" /> in other avenues off that&mdash;avenues which I think the Minister, and which I am quite sure the Parliamentary Secretary to the Government, saw in company with Deputy Belton and myself &mdash;who sustained extraordinary damage. I have heard in some of these cases that families received amounts as low as £20 compensation.  They received cheques for £20, £25 and £30 to alleviate and to deal with the results of a situation unprecedented in that particular area.  I have heard many, many, far too many, expressions of dissatisfaction. It appears to be the expressed opinion of many people in the North Strand, in Fairview, in the Drumcondra area that the higher the claim you submitted the more compensation you got.  It is very difficult to check on the situation because to my mind this is unlike all other occasions and it had to be dealt with by a flooding relief committee which had varied terms of reference.  These terms of reference appear to be very vague.</P>
    <P>I understand that recently assessors called round to shopkeepers in the areas affected.  They called round to chemists' shops, to grocers' shops, to sweet shops, to tobacconists and to shops which provide liquor to the people.  Some of these calls were made as late as a few days ago to assess what damage was caused.  I know of cases where shopkeepers and chemists had kept goods in their stores from December 8th or 9th up to the present day almost because they could not get any definite decision as to whether the damage suffered by them would be the subject of examination or would be the subject of consideration or whether it was safe for them to keep the damaged goods as evidence that they suffered damage or whether it would be best to throw out goods and forget about them.  In the early days of the emergency, particularly in the period when the corporation workmen were going around trying to clear out the filth and slime from the dwelling-houses, personal effects and the goods and stocks of shopkeepers were littered on the pavements of every street in the area.</P>
    <P>May I express my appreciation of the fact that the Minister came to the <Col N="774" /> Dublin Corporation and told us there that, speaking as the Minister responsible on that occasion, he was most anxious that red tape would not interfere with the efforts of those charged with dealing with the emergency?  May I also say when expressing that appreciation that the Minister's point of view may have been most unfortunate because from then on the situation got worse and an opinion grew stronger as the days passed by that the people who suffered were entitled to have their cases dealt with on the basis of full compensation.  I, like other Deputies in this House, attended at meetings of people affected by the flooding in the North Strand and I should like to assure the Minister that it was heart-rending to hear the sufferings endured by many of those people.</P>
    <P>May I, even at this stage, appeal to the Minister, and through him to the Government, to look at this situation again and to look at it in the light of the fact that in living memory the Dublin area, and particularly the Tolka catchment area, suffered an emergency never known before?  I should like that the Government would in addition examine the question as to whether there is a basis for the suggestion that the causes of the flooding could be removed.  Proper attention should be displayed by the responsible authorities to at least two of those suggested causes&mdash;the structure of the bridge at East Wall and the cleaning and the clearing of the Tolka river itself.</P>
    <P>I do not want to delay the House unduly on this matter but I think this is an occasion when we, representing this constituency, have the responsibility of speaking on behalf of our constituents.  It would be unjust to them, unjust to ourselves and unfair to the Minister concerned if we did not express clearly that the citizens in this area have formed the opinion very strongly that they have not been treated with justice.  I do not suggest that every applicant who submitted a case or a claim for consideration should automatically have that claim allowed in full, but I do suggest that <Col N="775" /> the approach to the claim submitted by the applicants should be on the basis of treating their application as an application arising from an unprecedented situation, an emergency, and not an application arising from a situation that may be a periodic condition in the area.  I would ask the Minister when replying to this debate to give an assurance that further consideration and more sympathetic consideration shall be given to the damage to structure, to the damage to dwelling-houses affected by the flooding.</P>
    <P>I have been in some of these houses and I want to assure Deputies that some of them I have been in, even with the emergency repairs that have been carried out, I would be most reluctant to trust myself in again.  I am not very light in weight and it is no pleasant experience when one walks through the doorway to find the timbers in the hallway shaking under your weight, when you enter the room to feel the floor give way under you and to observe in house after house floor boards broken away.</P>
    <P>It is true that emergency repairs were carried out but the extent of the emergency repairs was, I think, very, very small.  As far as I can gather, in many cases what occurred was that if there was a hole in the floor a patch was put in it.  But many of these floors are carried on joists which are four or five feet above the level of the ground below and, as Deputies in this House can bear out, in many of the floors the level sank from one side or the other because floors carried on light joists are not built to stand the weight of four and five feet of water in on top of them.</P>
    <P>I would say the majority of the people in the North Strand area would not leave that area.  Many of them left temporarily for a day or two.  Hundreds of them had to be provided with emergency accommodation in the Central Model Schools, looked after by the Red Cross, and in St. John Ambulance Brigade Headquarters in Gt. Strand Street.  Many more were looked after by relatives.  Numbers were taken to hospital and a few to St. <Col N="776" /> Kevin's Hospital.  Yet the majority of the families in the worst affected area returned to their homes, and returned to homes that even to-day they do not know whether they are safe or not. They do not know whether in one, two or three months' time they may discover their house falling down on top of them.</P>
    <P>It would be proper here, I think, once again to pay, on behalf of the people of the North Strand, Fairview, Richmond Road and Drumcondra areas a most sincere tribute to the members of all the services who came to the rescue on the night of December 8th. We had the Dublin Fire Brigade and I do not think one can use words of praise high enough for the services rendered by that body to the people in the emergency.  We had the members of the Red Cross Society who directly helped out, whose services were available day and night, who provided, as the Minister mentioned in introducing the Estimate, bedding and clothing, food and fuel for the people affected and who cared for the people in the Central Model Schools where families had to be taken.  There were the members of the St. John Ambulance Brigade who likewise threw their weight in 100 per cent.  There were the members of the Garda Síochána.  Sometimes in Dublin, as in other areas, members of the Garda Síochána are not always looked on with the most beneficent eyes; we sometimes feel that they are a little bit too officious, but those members of our police force did yeomen's service on that occasion.</P>
    <P>I think it is only right to say that we take great pride in the fact that employees of the municipality worked night and day endeavouring to restore water supplies to the East Wall, and did yeoman work helping to clear out the filth and dirt from the houses affected by the floods.  We do not forget them for one moment.  We also cannot forget the Army, and many more too numerous to mention, who did great service.  It would not be right to close my participation in this debate without paying a tribute to them for their help in every direction.</P>
    <P>However, after having paid that <Col N="777" /> tribute there is still, as far as the people are concerned, a question of what is going to happen, and whether or not the considerations advanced by me in this matter are going to receive the attention of the Minister.  Will the Minister, when replying to this debate, indicate what steps it is proposed to take to ensure, as far as is humanly possible, that that situation shall not recur?  Will the Minister ensure that the whole Tolka River catchment area will be examined, and will he tell us if he is prepared to take definite steps to ensure that the river continues to empty itself into the sea, and not into the North Strand?</P>
    <P>On the night of December 8th last year, Richmond Road, Fairview, was not a road.  It was not even a road where water had seeped in; it was a river round about three to four feet deep.  The banks of the Tolka burst, and the people living in the area suffered by it.  I think we should urge on the Minister to make some definite statement as to what his intentions are towards endeavouring to obviate such a situation recurring.  In addition, I would press on the Minister to tell us, clearly and definitely, whether this figure of £81,000 is in or around the total which will be expended in direct payment to those affected by the flooding, and to tell us whether or not consideration will be given to the question of structural damage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I bow to the Chair's ruling.  It is very difficult to deal with this question without referring more than once to certain aspects.  May I request the Minister to give the House, if not now, when he is dealing with the Estimate, but in the near future, details of how some of the £81,000 has been expended?  There are 2,000 cases. It is known to everyone who is familiar with the area that the damage caused as a result of the flooding varied considerably.  In some cases people's homes were affected by the ingress of possibly three, four, five or six inches <Col N="778" /> of flood water, and as the houses approached nearer the centre and the more seriously affected area, the damage caused to the furniture, fittings and possessions of the occupants naturally became greater. Consequently, the occupants' loss became more severe, and their claim for consideration became, in my view, greater than the claims of those less severely affected.</P>
      <P>There is one category of people affected to which I have not yet referred, and that is, those who were unable to follow their normal means of earning their livelihood.  The numbers coming under this category may not be great, but the individual losses they sustained were indeed severe.  I refer to the class of citizen employed in the delivery of vegetables, coal, and so on, in the areas affected by the flooding. I have in mind also those citizens who were living in the flooded area and who, in addition to being unable to earn their livelihood by delivering their goods in the particular area, were unable, because of the damage to their vehicles, to deliver goods such as coal, vegetables, and so forth, outside the area.</P>
      <P>Not many persons suffered loss of wages as a result of the flooding and as a result of their being unable to go to their place of employment.  Only a relatively small number suffered hardship in that way.  Quite a number of persons were unable to go to their place of employment and attend to their work.  Fortunately, in the majority of cases, they were employed by employers with a humane, progressive outlook.</P>
      <P>The flooding of the North Strand area by the River Tolka occurred on the 8th to the 9th December.  The effects of that flooding are not over yet.  It would be very difficult to say definitely when the situation will be completely cleared up.  I suggest that particular consideration be given to the question of future dangers to houses arising from the flooding that took place on December the 8th and 9th last.</P>

      <P>I am very sorry I was not here for the Minister's statement <Col N="779" /> but, judging by what Deputy Larkin has just said, he did not explain a matter which I, too, am very anxious to have explained and that is the basis on which this sum of £119,000 is calculated and what type of damage or loss is covered by it.  I live in the area in question and I have some idea of the loss or damage that has been incurred there.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HarryColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not meet the point I am trying to make, unfortunately. Seemingly the people got an idea that at least a big part of the damage to their premises and to their furniture and of their losses in respect of clothing, and so forth, would be met. Now they find that what they have got or are likely to get does not at all cover what they lost.  In saying these things, I am speaking of genuine losses.  I know that attempts have been made to make preposterous claims: I suppose that always happens in such cases.  However, I am speaking now of what people genuinely lost.  So far, they have got small compensation apparently to cover clothes, and so forth.  I know cases where what the people got was not at all sufficient&mdash; not even in the case of workmen's houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here is what happened in the bulk of the cases.  As we all remember, it had been a desperately wet day.  Quite a number of those people I have in mind had been out in the bad weather. In the evening, as is usual in such houses, the clothing these people wore, and which was their main possession in that respect, was hung up in the kitchen to dry during the night.  Then the floods came and destroyed the kitchen and destroyed the clothing.  I know personally of a case of a father and a mother and seven young children who were living in a basement.  It was not the kind of basement described by Deputy Larkin, ten feet down: it was a sort of semi-basement.  This family who were living in the lower part of the house had to go upstairs when the <Col N="780" /> floods rose and, after a short while, could not even get down the stairs at all.  The floods rose to the ceiling of their part of the house and everything they possessed was covered with water. Consider the case of that ordinary workman who is the father of seven young children.</P>
    <P>In view of that man's losses, he would certainly need to be dealt with generously.  It is not easy for him to provide for himself, his wife and his seven young children, but to have to provide for them all completely and at the one time is certainly a very big thing to ask him to do.  As a matter of fact, this man was out ill the week previous to the floods, and when he was able to get back to his work after the floods he was not even able to wear his overcoat.  I am aware that kind friends tried to help him when they realised his plight.  It seems to me that we ought to try to be as generous as possible in cases such as that.</P>
    <P>Consider now the position of people who had their premises insured.  There are some cases, from what I hear, where people who had insurance on their premises did not get compensation. Let me try and explain the position. It seems that, as soon as the investigators discovered there was an insurance, they did not recognise a claim as far as the contents of the house were concerned.  I am informed that in some cases the insurance company have paid only for the loss of the clothing to the man and his wife and state that they are not liable for losses in respect, for instance, of a daughter's goods.  The position, then, is that the investigators have cut out the family completely on the ground that they are covered by insurance and yet difficulties arise even where there has been insurance.  In my view, a point like that ought to be investigated and it is possible that, in many cases, more than one child is left unprovided for.</P>
    <P>Shopkeepers in the flooded Tolka area are complaining very bitterly about their losses.  Deputy Larkin went into detail in that connection and I will not go over it all again.  The fact, however, is that some of them lost very heavily in regard to stock, and apparently they are very much dissatisfied <Col N="781" /> with the treatment they have received.  I know that in some particular lines the losses were made up by manufacturers, but in other cases they suffered very heavily.  The Government should try to do something to help some of them, because the time has not been bright even for the ordinary shopkeeper who did not suffer these things and it is very hard on these people to try and carry on.</P>
    <P>I know of other cases where people who were tenants of houses were able to get out because of the condition of the house.  They got out and fortunately were able to find alternative accommodation.  But the landlord, in this case a woman&mdash;not by any means rich, in fact the rent of the house was a big part of her income&mdash;is left with the house on her hands.  She cannot let it because of its condition, but of course she is forced to pay rates and so on.  I think there is a case there for investigation, that type of case.  All in all, as I see it, I must say I am disappointed with the amount of the Estimate, because with the number of cases involved I cannot see how it is going to provide any sort of reasonable compensation to those people for the losses that they have suffered.</P>
    <P>Some of the houses, as we have seen them at the moment, are in a bad condition. They have not dried out at all yet.  More of them are showing greater response, seemingly, but some of them are looking nearly as bad as the day it happened.  It is serious, as we are told that in some cases, may be in all, the defects may not really show until after a long period.  A number of people are definitely afraid of their floors because they feel that the joists under them, having been so long in the flood, will develop dry rot and give way.  I think that all these points are definitely worthy of consideration, because the big majority of the people affected are not in a position financially to put their houses into any sort of good condition.  No matter how willing they might be to do it on their own, they are not in a financial position to do it.  Certainly I know they are very disgruntled and that they are grumbling about the whole situation.</P>
    <P>As to the causes of the flooding, I <Col N="782" /> suppose that will be debated for a long time to come.  I was interested to hear Deputy Larkin speak about the collapse of the railway bridge.  I know it is held fairly generally around the Fairview district that the collapse of the railway bridge was responsible for a big extension of the flooding, that some of the flooding would not have occurred only for it.  They say it would never have extended so far and one man who happened to be up and watching things, who had his own house flooded, holds definitely, whether he was right or not, that the flooding would not have reached his house only for the collapse of the railway bridge, that it was immediately after that that it started to rise and rose up around his area.  It would be worth while having some sort of a real engineering inquiry into that, to see that steps are taken that such could not happen again.</P>
    <P>Again, there is the position that is found on Annesley Bridge.  When you look down towards the railway arch, it is quite evident to anyone that the Tolka at the point underneath the railway arch, where it is entering the sea, is much narrower than the river at Annesley Bridge some hundred yards away and that it naturally would compress itself and rise there, and with the falling of the bridge into that very spot it leads an ordinary layman at any rate to believe that it would help to raise the height of the floods very considerably in the adjacent area.  I hope that something will be done to try and deal with this for the future. We never know when there may be a coincident of high tide and very heavy rain, as we are told was the cause of this.  We may have it again; we have often had it before.  I hope that, in any steps that are being taken to try to deal with this, the question of the mouth of the Tolka where it enters the sea, the width of it, the depth of it and all that, will be gone into thoroughly and that some steps will be taken to deal with it.</P>
    <P>Knowing what happened around the Richmond Road, where the Tolka burst its banks&mdash;and from what I heard about further up, but did not actually see, up around Botanic Avenue&mdash;I <Col N="783" /> think that steps should be taken to wall the Tolka the whole way through the housing areas.  It may be a big job, it may be a costly job, but it would be very good work for the Development Fund.  It would save a tremendous lot, not alone in the financial way; and it would avoid such a thing as this. From the point of view of the health and comfort of the people and the avoidance of losses that no Government or corporation will be able to meet, it is something that should be investigated.  From my point of view, the layman's point of view, while you can and should dredge the Tolka to some extent, it will not stop flooding unless a proper wall is built on each side of it, along the housing area.  I would suggest, too, that further out on the Tolka, outside the housing area, provision could be made for catchment areas or lakes, to take some of the flood waters on occasions like this. What I have in mind is something I was reading about the Tennessee valley and what was done there in that connection.  Something should be done.  There are areas adjacent to the Tolka that could easily be worked in &mdash;they would need only a dam and proper levelling to put them right.</P>
    <P>I make these suggestions because it is a terrible thing to think that, unless we do start moving, and moving quickly, this situation might arise again next winter and maybe even before then.  That whole area around Ballybough and the North Strand and down towards the sea is a low-lying area.  I have seen it without any bursting of the Tolka, and I have seen the water bubbling up through the manholes because the sewers were unable to take it away because of the levels there.  I have seen that on several occasions.  I have lived there and I know what I am talking about.  It is, maybe, an even bigger problem from an engineering point of view than appears on the surface because of the levels, but it is the last area that I know in Dublin that could afford to have the bursting of the Tolka added to it in heavy rain.</P>
    <P>That is why I am putting forward this suggestion, and, even if it may be <Col N="784" /> costly, I think it would be worthwhile if some proper steps were taken to prevent the Tolka from bursting its banks.  Every year for years the Tolka had burst its banks up at Drumcondra and has flooded the cottages around there and in view of the tremendous number of houses which have been built in that area, a large number of which have suffered in this flooding, it is surely time that something was done to protect these people and to give them what the ordinary man in other areas gets in the way of protection from such flooding as we had on 8th December.</P>
    <P>Let me also, as a Deputy for the area, try to convey the thanks that were conveyed to me by a number of these people to all those who gave such good service during the height of the floods&mdash;the Army, the Garda, the Red Cross, the St. John Ambulance Brigade and the private volunteer. The people I met were all loud in their praise of them and very thankful to them.  With Deputy Larkin, I should like to ask the Minister to consider again this whole question.  If he does, I think he will be able to put up a case for funds to meet the claims of these people much more generously than he can possibly do on the basis of the amount in the Estimate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Government (Mr. O'Donovan) John O'Donovan (Dublin South-East)">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Government (Mr. O'Donovan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I visited both areas&mdash;the Shannon area and the Tolka area&mdash;at the time of the floods and it seemed to me that there was a difference between them.  The Tolka flooding was a sudden unexpected catastrophe and a very severe shock to the people in the area; the Shannon floods came on slowly, the water rising from day to day, with the result that the people whose homes were flooded were able to save their furniture, either by removing it or by taking it upstairs in their homes. Moreover, a proof of the difference is that no live stock at all were lost in the Shannon area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It did seem to me that the case which was made by a couple of Deputies would be made, that £110,000 was being provided in relief of the distress caused by flooding in the Tolka area and only £20,000 for the Shannon area. <Col N="785" /> In actual fact, if we get down to arithmetic, we find that the amount expended per case was larger in the Shannon area than in Dublin.  The Minister for Agriculture mentioned that just under 100 homes were flooded in the Shannon area, and, as the Minister for Local Government mentioned, about 2,000 cases of flooding occurred in the Tolka area.  The amount in the Estimate is £110,000 and the Lord Mayor's fund amounted to £40,000, giving a total expenditure for each case of somewhere around £75, averaging it all out, for what such an average is worth.</P>
    <P>In the case of the Shannon area, the total number of farms subject to any severe flooding was about 200.  The amount in the Estimate is £20,000 and the Athlone fund was about £20,000, giving an average of £200 for each case of flooding.  It seems to me then that the case made earlier here to-day that the country areas are not looked after by the Government, who do everything possible for the City of Dublin is not borne out either by the facts, or, I am glad to say, by the case made by Deputy Larkin and Deputy Colley.</P>
    <P>There is one other point I might mention as showing the amount of money available.  In Dublin, the Lord Mayor, having assessed the amount of his fund, made a cash payment of £10 in every case where there was flooding and, in addition, the people got a quarter ton of coal.  In the Shannon area, the cash payment was £20 and one ton of coal was distributed.  I know that it is suggested that there were losses of crops and so on in the Shannon area, which did not occur in Dublin, but that was covered in part by the fact that the Dublin people lost their entire belongings.</P>

      <P>There is still, I understand, despite what has been suggested here, a considerable balance of moneys available in both the Athlone and Tuam funds.  I am very glad there is, but I cannot see much point in making the case that these funds will be exhausted in a week or two.  We are now in the last week of March, and, if the funds have lasted for the relief of distress from December to March, I think most reasonable people will agree that they were adequate.  On the whole, I think the Government were well aware in advance that the situation would arise of the comparison between £20,000 and the £110,000, but in reply to that case it can be pointed out that the people who administered the relief fund in Dublin and the moneys made available by the Government seemed to have been more careful.  At any rate, the amounts would indicate that they were a bit tighter if anything than the people in the country.  I am not saying they were; I am saying the amounts would suggest it.</P>
      <P>I would say for the main Opposition Party that certainly this evening they made no attempt to make any personal capital out of this matter.  The debate was conducted in a very fair way.  That was the sole point I wished to make. I am not going to attempt to reply to the case made by the two Dublin Deputies.  I feel that is the function of the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief as Deputy Lynch is very anxious to speak and I do not propose to detain him. I think the most significant point made here this evening was the fact that after giving a certain amount of relief to the people affected in both areas&mdash; a very substantial amount in both cases &mdash;there was a surplus.  We were assured time and again that cases of extreme necessity outside those areas would be catered for by the Red Cross.  I would like to know if the people who made <Col N="787" /> those statements to the House had the authority of the Red Cross to make them.  I dealt with some of the people affected.  Some of them live on the Tolka and apparently because they lived outside Dublin City it did not matter whether they lost all their property, some of their property or suffered other losses.  I would like to know if authority was given by the Red Cross to say they would be prepared to administer certain funds in order to alleviate distress outside that area because, except in very rare circumstances, the Red Cross did not do so.</P>
      <P>I am not trying to blame the Red Cross.  I think in some cases they very rightly refused.  I just want to make it plain that the statements made in this House should be backed up afterwards by actual deeds.  There was no reason at all why it should be passed on to the Red Cross to deal with cases outside the two areas concerned, when the Red Cross either were not in a position to deal with it or prepared to deal with it.  I had experience in regard to one particular town&mdash;the town of Navan, where very bad flooding occurred.  The people there were told that the Red Cross would look after them.</P>

      <P>I know.  It was made very clear that it was for the Shannon valley and not the Tolka area but Dublin city.  Of course, the Tolka runs through part of the County Meath.  Since there is a surplus and considering that both the Athlone funds and the Lord Mayor's fund amounted to a very big sum in addition to the Government grants, even at this late stage I wonder whether some consideration could be given to <Col N="788" /> the people to whom so much was promised and for whom so little was done.</P>

      <P>Let me paraphrase a famous saying.  I have never heard so little said in so many words.  People's homes were flooded in my constituency where we have recurring floods.  They dried out their houses but nobody came along to give them £20.  They went about their business and said nothing about it.  I say I am a very bad Deputy when I did not come up and shout about it.  It is a good thing to protect our people from disaster. If my memory serves me right, the Ministers did not say they were going to give compensation but that they were going to give relief, which is a different thing altogether.  Our thanks are due to the people who helped in the floods but that is what we would expect Irish people to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my constituency I could give an example of a farmer who lost a very valuable dairy herd through fire.  I never heard of a farmer who had his live stock insured.  His neighbours sent him in stock and everything he wanted next day and there was £2,700 made up for him.  Neither I nor my colleagues came up here to start shouting.  I think the Ministers should get a lot more thanks for the prompt way in which they dealt with the floods.  The Minister for Local Government was on the job right away.  I read a statement in the newspapers in regard to the floods in which the Minister said that everything possible would be done and that there would be no red tape.  I also read about the various things that were done for the people and how they were <Col N="789" /> helped.  A great number of people rendered assistance.  That is as it should be.</P>
    <P>During the course of another debate on floods to-day it was said that this was the first time in living memory that anything such as the Tolka flooding struck Dublin.  Unless my memory serves me badly I remember that 25 years ago there was a big flood in the Tolka.  The people had to be taken out of their houses by the then Lord Mayor who happens to be the present Lord Mayor.  They were brought to the Mansion House and various places in Dublin.  If the Minister for Local Government is to deal promptly with this, I hope he will not take example from the way the matter was debated here this evening.</P>
    <P>We should remember that there are people around the country who lose things and who do not rush up to make claims.  I deplore the attitude of the Deputies who said here this evening that it was just because the Tolka was flooded that there was any recognition made of the Shannon floods at all.  The Shannon floods being more disastrous this year than they were for many years, I think the matter would have been looked after.  The Vote for this is £100,000.</P>

      <P>Tell the lady to put up a notice saying: &ldquo;House to let&rdquo; in the window and then get a couple of Guards to keep her from being knocked down in the rush.  The approach to this Estimate should be from the point of view that this money is being provided to relieve a certain section of our community.  I know the House will gladly do that.  I do not, however, <Col N="790" /> like to see this £110,000 being treated as if it were only buttons.  Some Deputies have said that people will put in exaggerated claims.  Others have said that claims should be dealt with immediately.  We all know reasonable care must be taken.  It would, of course, be better to err on the right side.  I know that the Minister and his officials will do that in administering these flood relief moneys.</P>
      <P>The suggestion of building a wall along each bank of the Tolka rather intrigued me.  How would bridges be constructed?  I suppose that would be a matter for the engineers.  Perhaps, instead of having bridges over it, they would have tunnels underneath it.</P>
      <P>I want to warn the Minister for Local Government now and the Minister for Agriculture that in future the people in Waterford will not remain silent when floods arise.  We will try to cash in.  We should have as good a right to do that as anybody else.  Possibly the citizens of Waterford are just good citizens, foolish perhaps, who meet their misfortunes like men, clean up their houses when the waters subside and start afresh.</P>

      <P>We had a spate of water in the month of December last. We have certainly had a spate of oratory this evening.  I would like the House to recall the reason why this Estimate is before us.  On the night of 8th December last we had an unprecedented flood, and unprecedented action was taken by the Government to deal with that flood.  Immediately the Government became aware of the magnitude of the flood and the flood problem the Taoiseach himself instructed me that all red tape should be cut and nothing was to stand in the way of relieving distress.  I immediately so instructed the city manager, and I am very glad to say that he acted on those instructions and cut all red tape.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like here and now to pay a tribute not only to the various officials to whom reference has already been made by several Deputies, but also to the Lord Mayor of Dublin for his action on that occasion.  I personally had the privilege of accompanying him around the flooded area.  I know the amount <Col N="791" /> of work he did, not only then but later on, through his energy, his popularity and his charity in procuring a large sum of money for distribution among the victims of this disaster.</P>
    <P>What was the action of the Government? The very first thing the Government did was to come before the House here and ask for a token Vote, not to compensate the victims of the flooding but to relieve distress.  It was made abundantly clear then that the intention of the Government was to relieve distress, and that was accepted by the House without a division.  The next step the Government took was to set up a committee to deal with the victims of the flooding.  Who were the members of that committee?  The chairman was a judge of the Supreme Court.  Another member was the President of the Council of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.  The third, lady, was vice-president of the Infant Aid Society; another was an expert of the Dublin Corporation in charge of housing; and the last was the city manager, a man who had been in touch with the flooded area from the very beginning.  Indeed, two of the members of that committee had been in close touch from the outset.</P>
    <P>This committee was set up and certain instructions were given to them. They were told to investigate the position, the situation and the circumstances of the various victims and to assess the amount of distress suffered by every applicant who came before them.  They were told that when that assessment had been made the Government would pay in cash, and that the Government did.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made here on a number of occasions to the terms of reference of that committee.  I think it is right that I should read them at this stage.  They are as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;1.  The committee will be concerned with the alleviation of distress caused by abnormal flooding in the City of Dublin area on the 8th and 9th December, 1954.  It is not intended that the committee shall consider awards on the basis of compensation for damage sustained.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="792" /> That was made quite clear here in the debate on the token Estimate.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;2.  The committee will have regard to the assistance already given and to the other funds available for the relief of distress as well as to the existence of insurance cover in determining the net distress requiring alleviation.  The facilities provided by the Board of Assistance should also be taken into account.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think no person can take exception to those two.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;3.  Repairs to private houses are not to be provided for.  Redecoration will, however, be within the province of the committee to consider, where distress is involved.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think it is right I should comment on that particular one.  Repairs to private houses are not to be provided for: the reason for that is because, under Section 12 of the Housing Act, 1954, applicants may apply for grants for repairs to their houses.  The victims of this flooding are not unaware of that.</P>
    <P>Eighty applications have already been received by the corporation and further applications are being received at the rate of five per day.  I now publicly tell any victims of the flooding who require grants for the repair of their houses that all they have to do is apply to the corporation and the corporation will very liberally construe the regulations governing such grants. I think that answers the point made by Deputy D. Larkin.  The moneys already paid are obviously not the only relief the victims will receive.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;4.  Assistance may be given in the form of cash grants.  In determining the amount of assistance regard shall be had to the number of persons in the household and to their general circumstances, financial and otherwise. No payment shall be made until each case has been considered and investigated by the committee. Assistance to cover current maintenance expenses in respect of items such as food and fuel is a function of the Board of Assistance.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think that is quite in order and that nobody could take exception to it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="793" />&ldquo;5.  All payments approved and directed by the committee shall be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.  A record shall be kept of all payments made, the persons to whom they are made and the purpose for which issued.</P>
    <P>6.  Receipts should be obtained for all payments made.</P>
    <P>7.  The committee may receive claims for loss on stock-in-trade and should it think fit, report to the Minister on them but no payment should be made on foot thereof unless such damage falls within the above principle of alleviating distrees.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In other words, within the principle approved by this House when the token Vote was taken.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;8.  The Minister for Local Government has full confidence in the committee and appreciates that the funds will be administered with the greatest sense of responsibility.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think the House will agree that those were very fair terms of reference, in view of what was said here when the token grant was before the House.  The Government met all payments recommended by the committee and the applicants have been paid.  In addition, if there are outstanding claims for repairs to houses the applicants may make application to the corporation under the 1954 Act and their claims will be generously construed by the corporation.  In addition to that the Lord Mayor was successful in procuring a fund totalling £40,000&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I did, at the beginning. Some comment was made on the fact&mdash;by Deputy Larkin, I think&mdash;that owners of business premises were not informed as to whether their claims would receive any consideration.  That is not true.  A deputation representative of the Tolka area was told by the Flood Relief Committee at the end of January that traders could dispose of damaged stock if they so wished as assessors are skilled in assessing damaged stock which could not be produced. After a fire those assessors can go in and estimate the value of stock destroyed despite the fact that there is very little evidence left.  This committee had the assistance of very eminent assessors in disposing of all these claims and had the information before them.  They were not taking a chance, as I think Deputy Larkin said, on the principle that the higher your claim the more money you got.  That is not true.  The committee had before them the amounts assessed by these eminent assessors before they reached a decision.</P>
      <P>I should mention the fact that Dublin Corporation did a considerable amount in the provision of coal and the cleaning of houses, and attending to waterworks and roads and the corporation has submitted a bill for £10,483 10s. to the Government which will be paid by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been asked by many Deputies what I am doing to inquire into the cause of the flooding.  That is not a matter for which I am directly responsible. If Dublin Corporation wishes to submit detailed plans or schemes for the prevention of future flooding to me for approval then I can go into the matter.  Otherwise I cannot do so. I think it is not fair to ask the ratepayers at this stage to take responsibility <Col N="795" /> for investigating this problem and possibly doing something about it.</P>

But it is a matter for them.  The onus of responsibility is on them and if they do submit a scheme to my Department it will be considered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that I did.  I said there was an unfortunate coincidence.  We had this very heavy rainfall and high tide at the same time but against that it is a blessing that a train did not fall into the gully that night thereby blocking it completely. It would have been a serious disaster for the city if that had occurred.  Things could have been worse than they were.</P>
      <P>Let me conclude by telling the House this: Off the coast of Donegal in my constituency is an island called Iniskeera. While up to three years ago we had 14 families living on the island, owing to unprecedented tides in recent years there is not one family left to-day on the island.  These families were composed of fishermen and migrants and out of their meagre savings they have had to transfer to the mainland and endeavour to purchase farms there on the instalment system.  They have not asked Donegal County Council or the Government to provide a penny for them.  I think the victims of the Dublin flooding are grateful to the Government for what they have done for them and I feel proud to be a member of the Government which did so much for these victims on such an occasion and I hope such an occasion will not arise again.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>In speaking on this Estimate yesterday I was trying in my own way to explain where we actually stand as regards the whole question of industry in the country and our position in relation to Irish industrialists as, perhaps, against the necessity of encouraging foreign financial investment in this country.  I went so far as to say that we have to admit that in many instances Irish industrialists refuse to take advantage of the present situation in which in many cases the market is not provided with the maximum amount of merchandise or manufactured articles demanded by the people as consumers.  It is, as we know, also true to say that in many instances the Irish industrialists are not prepared either to extend their premises or to move into other areas to take advantage of many of the measures offered by various Governments in this State.  I believe we can all say that every Party represented in this House is very much interested in seeing Irish industry flourish, but it is fantastic in the extreme for us to carry on in the same way by letting things slide and hoping that from the industrial viewpoint things will be better in a year or two than they are at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any criticisms we may have to offer are offered to the Minister and to the House solely from the point of view of trying to improve the over-all situation as regards industry in this country which ultimately must of necessity be of benefit to the manufacturer and the various people interested in industry and engaged in it and to the general consumer.  We all know that, even at this stage, it is necessary to consider the problem of price control.  We are all aware that it was only because it was found necessary that Deputy Lemass, when <Col N="797" /> Minister for Industry and Commerce, went as far as to set up a Fair Trade Commission to investigate certain problems arising out of the industrial activities of people in this country.</P>
    <P>We must admit that, in spite of our best endeavours to encourage Irish industry as a whole, the tragedy is that various sections of the community seem to be so far removed from one another that the publication of price lists is necessary to protect the working people, the consumers, the housewives, in their efforts to secure fair prices and to establish competition on such a basis as to prevent advantage being taken of the consumers, as has been the case for many years past.</P>
    <P>If it had not been for the outbreak of the Second World War, the situation might not have developed as it did, but the members of the Labour Party realise the seriousness of the situation confronting us, even now.  For some years after the war the problem was one of supplies and ever-increasing demand.  In those circumstances it was difficult to control prices and to get industrialists to realise that they had a responsibility to produce a good article and to market it at a fair price, just as we admit that the worker has his responsibility towards his employer.</P>
    <P>There is no use in Deputy Lemass or any other Deputy commenting on the possible dangers in the approach of the present Minister for Industry and Commerce or, indeed, that of the Government as a whole, to industry.</P>
    <P>It is shameful that even in 1954 and 1955 such damning evidence could appear in the public Press of the activities of sections of industry in operating monopolies and price rings. Deputy Lemass apparently tried to castigate the Minister in respect of the existing problem of prices.  When we consider the over-all problem of prices in relation to wages and the cost of living, it is obvious that, not only must prices be regulated to give a fair margin of profit but that small groups must not be allowed, at their whim and pleasure, to dictate prices by forming rings and cartels such as exist in great countries like America.  There is no room in this country for such activities and we strongly urge the Minister to <Col N="798" /> ensure that the matter will not end with the receipt of reports from the Fair Trade Commission or elsewhere but that speedy action will ensue, not merely to curb, but to crush the activities of people who would hold up to ransom the ordinary people of this country.</P>
    <P>There is another matter that I would ask the Minister to consider in relation to the problem of prices, namely, the problem of correct weight.  It is a common complaint, not only in large cities like Dublin and Cork, but in towns and villages, that, in spite of the so-called Christian ideals and principles of people in business, some people find giving short measure a convenient way to make a little extra profit.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Would not that be a matter for Justice, Deputy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I was coming to that, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  I was about to ask the Minister to see that not alone is it a case for Justice but that justice will be done and that the inspectors' reports in the matter would be investigated by the Department of Justice and that the Minister for Industry and Commerce would play an active part in a matter which affects every housewife and every working man and his family.</P>
      <P>The Minister drew attention to the over-all increase in the general turnover in manufactured articles and, which was very welcome news, the resultant increase in employment.  While this is heartening information, we cannot be complacent about the position when we know that, even with this increase in output and the noticeable increase in employment in industry and transport, the over-all problem is still far from being solved.  I would emphasise the necessity for co-ordination and co-operation between the Minister's Department, which is primarily responsible for industry and commerce, and the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Lands in an effort to solve the problems of industry and commerce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say that, because I know that the Minister is aware that not alone is <Col N="799" /> that the view of every member of this Party, but that it is the view of the members of all the Parties in this House who come from areas outside Dublin.  They know that at the present time it is Dublin everything, even Dublin for flooding, and it is flooding the country, unfortunately, with a greater measure of unemployment and a greater measure of emigration than ever before.  Too long and too often has it been the case here of members pressing unsuccessfully for the decentralisation of industry.  I believe the time has come now when it must be tackled.  It is poor satisfaction to the members of this House who leave here on a Friday to see as they go down the country that industrial projects are arising month by month and year by year and spreading just outside the city suburbs all the time.</P>
    <P>I, or any other member from a rural area like me, must not begrudge Dublin as the capital of this small country of ours the prosperity it enjoys, but I am afraid it is enjoying too much prosperity at the expense of the country.  I am afraid that if we are really interested in the industrial development of the country we should not continue to keep building up our industries in Dublin.  Our method for some time past has been somewhat on the same lines as that in Britain, which built up an industrial empire, forgetting about the rest of the country.  The only difference, of course, is that where Britain could fall back on what she called her Commonwealth, to feed her people, we have no such storehouse on which to draw.  This matter of our industries must be tackled properly and soon.</P>
    <P>I am not just pleading with the Minister.  I am asking him to realise that it is time something concrete was done about the entire country where industries are concerned.  It is about time that would-be industrialists were told that while they may be anxious to be near the hub of all industrial activities in the country, there cannot be much more room for them in Dublin, whereas we have 25 counties clamouring for industries&mdash;25 counties in which there are much more suitable places <Col N="800" /> for industries than around Dublin. Some of these industrialists may say that if they made such a move away from Dublin the over-all economic results would not be to their advantage, but I would refer them to a part of the Minister's statement when he dealt with the Undeveloped Areas Bill. Certain provisions were made in that measure and surely these provisions should act as an incentive to any industrialist who may be anxious to establish himself in this country to go outside Dublin.</P>
    <P>The Minister's statement pointed out quite clearly the financial advantages to be gained under the Undeveloped Areas Bill by industrialists building and operating in the country areas.  I am not blaming the Minister or his predecessor for the situation that has arisen in regard to industries.  I quite understand that an industry could start overnight in any part of the country and I realise that of necessity the Department officials must be careful in their examination of any proposals that may come within the ambit of this important measure.  It is a couple of years now since that measure became law and if we are to take notice of the figures as presented by the Minister, the picture in that regard is not what we would hope for.  If the Minister holds the same views as he did when he was leader of our Party here when in Opposition, he will be satisfied that the tragedy of that Bill was that provision was not made whereby there would be a much larger measure of decentralisation of industry.</P>
    <P>I think a situation should be brought about whereby some semi-State body such as Bord na Móna or the E.S.B. would set up industries throughout the country.  There are great prospects in this country for such industrial activities which might be outside the scope of ordinary industrialists themselves. Those people might not be so anxious to undertake the risk of going into some new line of activity or embarking on some new industrial channel not hitherto opened up.  It is in such a sphere that the semi-State body would assert itself.</P>
    <P>We know that in other countries, notably Sweden, advantage is taken of <Col N="801" /> the by-products of the particular country-such as kelp and seaweed. We have been told that advantage is being taken of such natural resources here, but I believe that the use we are making of them is negligible.  The position is that we are afraid to take chances in this country.  We should not be afraid to take chances when the livelihood of 70,000 unemployed people would depend to such a large extent on our making use of such chances.  We should consider also the advantages that would accrue to the State through the development of these resources and through the activities of our people in their utilisation.  There are brains in the country which could be brought into action whether they are those of scientists or not.  It would be greatly to the advantage of the country if we were to take up a bold enough policy to utilise our resources and to build up industries, utilising the ability of our people.  We would be helping to keep that ability at home rather than sending it to foreign countries.</P>
    <P>Again, the Minister made mention of the visits of the I.D.A. abroad.  It is undoubtedly most beneficial to this country that these people would go abroad.  It is most satisfying for us as a nation to see these I.D.A. people going overseas and seeing for themselves the conditions that prevail and the industrial pursuits in other countries.  But the benefits of the visits of these people will be lost to us unless they have some field of operations into which they can put the benefits of their newly acquired knowledge.</P>
    <P>All this is related directly to our unemployment problem.  Again, I would say to the Minister that the problems of unemployment and emigration will not, I am convinced, be remedied by simply providing industry in Dublin.  We know that in regard to many industries that may be set up in this State we may be handicapped because of the lack of raw material.  Why, therefore, is it not possible to concentrate, in rural Ireland, some small industries?  Let us forget the gigantic factory that in any short space of time can supply the whole needs of our country.  Instead <Col N="802" /> of speaking solely of the huge factory that can meet our local home demands and go into the market for export, which is an advantage in itself, let us realise that such small industries, rural activities, will help to ease the problem in rural Ireland and ultimately be of advantage to Dublin.</P>
    <P>In regard to various parts of this country, I fail to see why we cannot take advantage of small canning industries. Fruit of various descriptions cannot be bought by the people here in Dublin or in Cork except at an exorbitant price, and, at the same time, at various seasons of the year fruit is going to waste in many parts of rural Ireland because we are too slow to take advantage of the possibilities of utilising what may be of advantage to the people as a whole.</P>
    <P>I should like very briefly to mention in that respect also that I believe in the advantages of the Undeveloped Areas Bill, and I would refer to a problem that is crying out for attention in Cork.  Now I am not speaking simply for the constituency I have the honour of representing, but of neighbouring areas.  I know I cannot go into the matter in detail except with regard to having the Ministers concerned examine it in consultation.  The problem I have in mind is that of flax growing and if that problem is solved there is the possibility not alone of a return to the people growing it but also of keeping young people in that area from emigrating.</P>
    <P>The Minister has, I believe, in his statement made it quite clear that one side of the rural picture is being helped greatly by the export of whiskey to America.  Whether in one form or another, we realise that even the individual companies set up will give great possibilities for employment. Not alone that, but by the co-ordination of the efforts of industry, commerce and agriculture, rural Ireland can ultimately benefit through the crop of barley.  That is why I believe it is vitally important for us to remember that we cannot afford to have the activities of industry and commerce divorced completely from agriculture and from lands when we are dealing with this problem of industrial prosperity in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="803" /> In relation to rural electrification, of which mention was made here the other day in the course of a question by Deputy Lemass and the answer by the Minister, I suppose that we will all have to admit that one of the great benefits conferred on this country was the provision of electric current through the Shannon scheme in the late 'twenties and the 1930 period.  We equally realise the importance of the benefits conferred on the community in rural Ireland due to the rural electrification system.  From the point of view of the over-all picture it is helpful to the people and satisfactory even to people coming to this country on holidays to see the great changes that have taken place in Ireland.  We may be divided here at times, we may have different views, but it is satisfactory to all of us, whatever Party we belong to, when outsiders will admit that the activities of all Parties in the last 25 or 30 years have been such as to help towards this great improvement.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, I am not satisfied on the over-all aspect of this question of rural electrification because, in spite of the benefits that it can bestow on the people in rural areas, it may be necessary for the Minister, as he mentioned in answer to this question yesterday, in the course of considering the over-all problem of E.S.B. charges, to take into full consideration the fantastically high charges that are made, not alone in the case of rural electrification but so far as the E.S.B. as a whole is concerned.</P>
    <P>If the Minister will take into consideration again the necessity of the co-ordination of effort between his Department and the Department of Local Government, he will find that local authorities in every part of this country are actually being fleeced by the severely high charges imposed upon them and imposed upon the ratepayers through the exorbitant prices charged by the E.S.B. for public lighting.  As the Minister mentioned here, the E.S.B. are a non-profit making concern and it seems quite obvious from his statement yesterday that the financial returns of the last five or six years have been such that there is no necessity <Col N="804" /> to continue giving them certain financial advantages.  While it may be a non-profit making concern, the question of necessity arises in view of the exorbitant charges that are being imposed upon the consumer.  I believe that when rural electrification is completed there will be no justification for the continuation of those charges. Why should they, therefore, in respect of a long-term policy, which they are, of course, entitled to pursue, impose upon the present generation the severe burden which is fleecing them now?  I believe it will be urgently necessary for the Minister, in any dealings he may have in this matter, in any preparation of legislation he may consider necessary to bring in in the future, to take into consideration this important problem.</P>
    <P>The Minister also mentioned C.I.E. in his statement.  I have no intention of discussing it except to say that it is satisfactory to see that the over-all picture is undoubtedly what we may call a bright one for C.I.E. as a going concern.  For many years each Government was confronted with the problem of the ghost train.  Thanks be to God that time seems to have gone.  I hope that as year after year goes by, the position of C.I.E. will improve.  But now that it is improving I would like to say to the Minister&mdash;perhaps it might be considered as one of the day-to-day activities of the C.I.E. Board, as we are sometimes told&mdash;that it is about time that as the railways are helping to pay for themselves some relief should be given to the unfortunate people who are being saddled with the burden, those people who have to use the buses and pay the bus fares which were raised to such a high level to keep the railways going.  We will go no further than that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass mentioned the position of the Cork airport.  Perhaps it was because I come from Cork that I was very disappointed that no mention was made in the Minister's speech about this problem of Cork airport. I do not mind the approach of Deputy Lemass in that matter.  He recalled that a couple of years ago it was mentioned in the newspapers that £1,000,000 was provided.  I am not <Col N="805" /> interested in past history or anything like it, but I do say that we in Cork are entitled to say: &ldquo;It is poor consolation for us to hear in this House of the growing prosperity of Shannon airport, and the increasing returns from it, while at the same time Cork is considered as a small provincial town.&rdquo;  I would earnestly ask the Minister to do something about this matter in the near future, so that our hopes may be realised of seeing Cork placed in the position to which it is entitled, and that is, the capital of Munster.</P>
    <P>There is one part of the Minister's speech that I must take exception to, and that is&mdash;we have the advantage at least under this Government of speaking very openly and frankly on matters as we see them&mdash;the part where he mentioned the possibility of a transatlantic passenger service from Cork Harbour. It is a common occurrence to see liners of different companies in that harbour on any day of the week, notably on Sundays.  We know the extraordinary price that would have to be paid for the construction of transatlantic liners in order to carry out this service.  I cannot imagine Irish or Irish-Americans waiting for a couple of weeks at New York or Boston for an Irish liner, when they have at their disposal liners of various companies.  I believe if we are to spend money on a passenger service, it should be spent on a service between here and England.  Undoubtedly, credit is due to the Minister for the way he has approached this problem of the airport about which we heard so much.</P>
    <P>Complaints have been voiced about the facilities at Dún Laoghaire.  The tragedy is that thousands of people, many of whom are Irishmen and women, are treated in an inhuman way.  It is therefore important that we should realise the importance of providing these facilities ourselves, instead of depending on an outside source which gives little consideration to the people of this country who are entitled to such facilities.</P>
    <P>The Minister also mentioned problems in connection with An Tóstal. <Col N="806" /> From reports which have been recently published, it would seem that the people who stand to gain most are the business people in Dublin.  Let us face this problem realistically.  These people in Dublin are putting the money in their banking accounts and having a laugh at the fools who provided it. Those who are gaining most from An Tóstal are not prepared to lend their weight to make it a success.  Let them decide the best way to run their Tóstal, because the people in rural Ireland can run theirs in their own way.</P>
    <P>I have to deal with one item which I cannot refrain from mentioning.  We are, as it were, inclined to be local in our views.  What is going to happen as regards this refinery?  The Minister has been most truthful and helpful in his approach to this problem, in spite of the remarks of Deputy Lemass.  I could express many views on the subject, but I believe that Cork has the advantages for its location.  There is no part of the country which has such natural advantages from a shipping point of view.  The shipping industry there is undoubtedly in a deplorable condition.  We understand how hard it is even to keep it going in repair work.  With Cork's natural advantages, we hope we may be lucky to secure this important project.</P>
    <P>I was sorry when I read in the Press certain questions which Deputy Lemass asked in the House in respect of this. I was glad to hear the Minister for Industry and Commerce say in his speech yesterday that his predecessor was as interested as anyone as regards the introduction of this industry to this country.  While publicity was given to the fact that this was supposed to be done in 1951, Deputy Lemass questioned the Minister severely in this House as to why he did not impose various restrictions on these companies, which, in themselves, would be a hindrance rather than a help towards securing this industry.  Please God, the coming year will see the development of this industry, and that the standard of its products will be equal to anything which have been previously imported.  I hope that industrialists and manufacturers will come to understand that, while they <Col N="807" /> have a place in this community, they have a Christian obligation not to make exorbitant profits.  This will not be tolerated by members of the Labour Party.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister what is his intention as regards Cork airport.  I understand Deputy Lemass said yesterday that, before he left office, he was promised that the survey of the airport at Ballygarvan would be completed in four and a half months, and that the Government had decided to have the airport there.  Would the Minister tell us what happened since then?  Did he decide to leave the matter there?  We know they did away with our transatlantic air service and that they are prejudiced against any development in that line.</P>
      <P>Quite recently, the Cork Corporation wrote to the Minister and asked him to receive a deputation on the matter of this airport.  The reply the Minister sent back to the corporation was that as soon as he could get over the rush of work in the Dáil he would see this deputation&mdash;a deputation, I might say, of Deputies who are here in the House when the House is sitting and who are prepared to come at any other time to meet the Minister.  Does the Minister think that that is proper treatment for the representatives of the second city in this State?  Does he think we will lie down and quietly accept that sort of treatment, just like children? In reply to a question which I put in 1947, I was told the matter was under consideration.  The Coalition Government came into office in 1948 and, between 1948 and 1951, when they went out of office, we heard nothing about it.  When Fianna Fáil resumed office in 1951 Deputy Lemass, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, got the matter under way again.  There was a great deal of trouble and delay in connection with meteorological and other surveys but, shortly before Fianna Fáil went out of office last year, he was promised a report in the matter of this private survey of the Ballygarvan site.</P>

      <P>Deputy Casey will have an opportunity of making his speech later.  I want to know if the Minister is being prevented from going ahead on this question by the Fine Gael Party and by the Fine Gael Minister for Finance.  I ask that question in view of the fact that when Deputy Anthony Barry was questioned at Blackpool during the election as to how they proposed to bring about a reduction of expenditure his reply was: we will save £1,000,000 on Cork airport. Let Deputy Casey answer that, if he likes.  I should like to know if that is the principle that is holding back the development of an airport at Cork.</P>
      <P>We believe that the second city in this State is entitled to an airport.  We believed and I understand Aer Lingus believed that the service would be obtained.  I might quote here what our Bishop, the Most Rev. Dr. Lucey, said on St. Patrick's Day when we went to see him.  He said that we had a representative for the land and a representative for the water, the Chairman of the Cork Harbour Board, but that we had no representative for the air and he asked why Cork City has not an airport and an air service.  It is about time this &ldquo;active consideration&rdquo; reply were stopped.  Why should businessmen coming to Cork or going from Cork have to travel to Dublin by train in order to take a 'plane to London or wherever they may be going?  The other alternative is to leave by the Cork boat to Fishguard and spend seven hours in the train from Fishguard to London.  Why should they have to suffer such inconvenience when they could reach their destination in an hour if we had the air service?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are tired of getting these noncommittal replies&mdash;and I do not care whether it be from this Government or from the previous Government.  It is about time we were treated as the second city in this State and got our share of the money being expended on <Col N="809" /> air services.  We want a scheduled air service to and from Cork.  We are told that, at present, the field at Farmer's Cross will not get the scheduled air service&mdash;that it can be used only for chartered trips.  We want to know definitely whether or not that is a fact. We want to know definitely whether or not we are going to get an airport and, if we are, we want to know definitely when we are getting it.  It is about time we got satisfactory replies to those questions.</P>
    <P>Is it the policy of the Fine Gael Minister for Finance that is responsible for holding back the Minister for Industry and Commerce in this matter of air services for Cork?  Is it the desire of the Minister for Finance to save £1,000,000 on Cork airport that is responsible for all this delay?  Deputy Anthony Barry said that that was one of the ways in which they were going to cut down expenditure.  However, I will not dwell on that matter any further now, but I wish to impress on the Minister that the people of Cork will not put up with this type of answer from any Government&mdash;and it is about time the Minister realised the position.  The idea of telling the Corporation of Cork that he would see the deputation as soon as he could get over the rush of work in the Dáil&mdash;in my view, that is a scandalous way to treat the people of Cork.</P>
    <P>Another matter in which the people of Cork have been shabbily treated concerns the bus depôt there.  The Minister talks about C.I.E.  We have heard a lot of talk from time to time in this House about the way horses are treated when they are being exported to Belgium and other countries.  I am sure Deputy Casey will agree with me that, during the summer months, the people waiting at the Cork bus depôt suffer very considerable hardship.  They have to queue there for hours in order to get a bus to bring them to the seaside. I might say, also, that the bus drivers experience considerable difficulty in backing their buses, and so forth, there.  It is pitiful to see thousands of people standing there in the summer-time just like a lot of cattle and waiting for hours in order to get a bus to bring them to the seaside.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="810" /> If they do not wait they know they have no chance of getting away.  I have received letters from people in America and other places stating that the bus depôt at Cork is a disgrace to Ireland and I have sent letters to the Chairman of C.I.E. and to our local director in C.I.E. concerning the matter.</P>
    <P>There is no use in talking about An Bord Fáilte, Fógra Fáilte or the Irish Tourist Association doing this or that, if you are going to expect tourists&mdash; and there are many tourists who travel by bus&mdash;to put up with that treatment in the summer-time, in a city which is a fairly good centre for tourists.  I think somebody should end this disgrace. I spoke to the Chairman of C.I.E. on the telephone here from Dublin two or three weeks ago and he said there was too much noise about it, that they were going ahead with it.  I think there is not enough noise about it.  I think the people have the greatest patience in the world to stand there for hours, since most of them cannot get a seat to sit down on.  I have stood so myself for a couple of hours on a Saturday afternoon.  There is no use in other people coming in here and talking about the cruelty to horses that are being exported, when the human beings are subjected to this.</P>
    <P>In regard to the recent scarcity of coal in Cork, about which a deputation came up to see the Minister, we must try to safeguard the position for the future.  Were it not for the coal in the dumps, as Deputy Lemass said yesterday, there was a possibility that coal would be rationed in this country. The Minister is aware that all the coal in the Cork dumps was cleared out. There were 250,000 tons in the Phoenix Park here and I understand that is down to about 140,000 tons.  Thousands of tons had to be taken from the Phoenix Park, railed to Cork and drawn and sold by the merchants in Cork.  While the Dublin merchant could get this American coal at £5 11s a ton, the merchant in Cork had to pay £5 11s. plus 29/11 railage to Cork. He was supposed to sell it, as he was selling the American coal all along, at £7.  We all know that the prospects of getting coal from England will be less and less every year.  England has <Col N="811" /> been importing coal for some time and they say they have been losing on every ton imported.  It looks as if we will have to do something about the future, whether it is American coal or some other coal.</P>
    <P>With all the talk there was about the coal being in the dumps for years&mdash; and I was one of those who kicked up a row myself about the coal being stored&mdash;it seems very reasonable now to expect that some provision like that will have to be made for the future. We will need dumps in Cork and maybe in Limerick, Waterford and other places, if we are to safeguard ourselves against next winter.</P>
    <P>I believe that in Cork we were paying too high a rental for our dump when we had it, but there are plenty of sites available at reasonable rates for storing coal.  The Minister should seriously consider having a reserve in the country.  We had 250,000 tons in the Phoenix Park, we have about half of that there now; and I understand that if we do not make that provision and if we get a hard winter like last winter we will be in a very bad way.  No one expects to make a profit on coal that is brought in to safeguard us against an emergency.  We lost a good deal on it, I know, but it was a very good insurance and we would have been in a very bad way this winter but for it. The Minister knows that as well as I do.  We should not be in the position of having to load coal in the Phoenix Park, carry it on a lorry to the railway, pay 29/11 to take it to Cork and then load it again into lorries to bring it to the merchants' stores.  There should be dumps in different parts of the country and the coal should be sold at the same price in those areas.</P>
    <P>When turf was being used during the Emergency, we had a national price for the whole country; the fellow who was 100 miles from the bog paid only the same price as the fellow 20 miles from the bog.  If we have this scarcity, which is very likely to happen, since we have no coal here and we will not get as much from England as we were getting&mdash;we know that the miners in England are looking for a raise now, which will mean an increase of 10/- or 11/- a ton and <Col N="812" /> that they are importing coal&mdash;it is the duty of the Minister to see we will not have to revert to the rationing of coal.</P>
    <P>In Cork we have been looking for a long time for facilities for oil bunkering. If we get a refinery there, it might help to solve the difficulties, but no one knows where the refinery is going.  As the Minister said, that has to be decided by the people who are spending the money.  While we hope and believe that we in Cork have as great a chance of it as anyone else, personally I would be quite satisfied as long as it is not brought to Dublin. We know that Dublin is overloaded. We know that the Commission on Emigration stressed that very point and that if we do not do something to balance the rest of the country, emigration will continue on as great a scale as ever.  We all know that emigration is going on now as much as it ever was and in spite of that we have 70,000 unemployed.</P>
    <P>To get back to the oil bunkering, there are facilities there now for the discharge of transatlantic oil tankers &mdash;with the small exception of dredging, I understand, costing a few thousand pounds, dredging the new pier that was built alongside Haul- bowline&mdash;and when that dredging is done the biggest transatlantic tanker will be able to pull alongside.  Even if there is very big storage for oil at Haulbowline, there is another aspect to it that will have to be looked after.  We approached Deputy Lemass, when he was Minister for Industry and Commerce, on the question of getting somebody to use the facilities for commercial bunkering, that is, to get some of the commercial oil companies to undertake to do the job.  We know that will present a difficulty, in getting these people to undertake the bunkering of ships, but we believe that it is necessary.  We know that ships have called there for bunkers and we know that some of them have been facilitated just by good luck when coastal tankers were on the spot and were able to bunker them.  I move to report progress.</P>

      <P>Deputy Ormonde has given notice of his intention to raise on the Adjournment the subject matter of Questions Nos. 7 and 8 on yesterday's Order Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOrmonde" hpid="Mr. Ormonde Mr. Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Minister to appreciate that, in raising this matter on the Adjournment, I was not influenced by any desire to make Party or political propaganda, or to score any petty point against the Government.  I am well aware and ready to admit that this situation which has arisen in Portlaw tannery was not created by any action of this Government or the previous Government and that, although these workers were put on part-time about the time of the incoming of the Coalition Government, the critical situation which began then and which has now reached a climax had been developing for some time prior to the advent of the Coalition Government.</P>
      <P>I am mainly concerned to endeavour to create a situation which will ensure the continuation in employment of some 300 workers of Irish Tanners, Limited, and to put an end to the anxiety and worry of some 1,000 dependents, women and children, who see staring them in the face, if not hunger, complete separation from their menfolk who will have to seek the emigrant ship in an endeavour to make provision for them in another country.</P>
      <P>The questions I put down for answer yesterday and my question of a fortnight ago were actuated by a desire to focus the attention of the Dáil on this matter and to urge the Minister to immediate action.  In reply to my questions yesterday, the Minister was not able to add anything to his reply of a fortnight ago, except a nebulous statement in regard to the limitation of the quantities of substitute soling materials which will be admitted under duty-free licences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must confess that I am somewhat disappointed by the Minister's reply. It is apparent that if he is not completely indifferent to the situation there, he certainly lacks an appreciation <Col N="814" /> of the truly critical and serious nature of the position of this tannery. I have no doubt that representations have been made to the Minister long before now from other quarters in regard to the situation there and that he must or should have satisfied himself that the position there is exactly as I have represented it.  Why, then, he has taken no action, and not only has taken no action but has sanctioned the establishment of an industry in another southern town, thereby killing all hope of recovery for the Portlaw concern, is inexplicable.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister, in view of the very serious and urgent situation prevailing there, to state in his reply to-night what steps, if any, he is taking or proposes to take to keep this industry going.  We would welcome also his view on the importation of these substitute materials which are being imported in such large quantities and crippling and killing the Irish leather trade.  If the Minister approves of the importation of these materials in such quantities as to put a one-time flourishing home industry completely out of action, he should say so and give his reasons therefor, and he should be further prepared to arrange for the utilisation of part of the premises, the plant and equipment, and the employees of Irish Tanners, Limited, in the production of these imported materials which are being brought in in such large quantities by our boot factories, the majority of which are under the control of English directors and English managers.</P>
    <P>In reply to a supplementary of mine yesterday, the Minister stated that the Portlaw tannery has a 12 months supply of leather in stock, without making any additional leather.  That is so, but is it not a fact that the Portlaw tannery was required to undertake to supply the home market with leather before exporting any of their products; that there was no reciprocal arrangement or undertaking by the boot manufacturers to take the leather from the Portlaw tannery; and that, when there was a turn over to rubber, the boot manufacturers refused to take the leather from Portlaw?  That is the reason why these stocks are on hands <Col N="815" /> now.  They were not able to get a foreign market for them.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the directors and management of Irish Tanners, Limited, have sought the co-operation of the Government in an endeavour to get rid of these surplus stocks and in an endeavour to keep the industry going.  Are we to assume then that this threatened complete close down of the factory, following so closely on the closing down last November of the hide federation known as Associated Tanners, Limited, involving the dismissal of, I think, 34 workers, 32 of whom were married men who have since left the country, means that that co-operation was not forthcoming?</P>
    <P>Since the closing down of that hide federation and the dismissal of these 34 employees, there has been a constant stream of dismissals from this factory in recent weeks.  Many of these workers, seeing no prospect of work at home, have left for England and more of them have made arrangements to leave for England leaving their wives and families after them.  It was brought to my notice last week that some of the wives who were left behind in the straitened circumstances in which they find themselves are unable to pay the rent of their houses and have returned to their parents' homes seeking shelter and food until such time as their menfolk can make provision for them.</P>
    <P>The Minister and his colleagues have been somewhat boastful about what they claim to be the downward trend in unemployment, and, while taking credit for that, they assert that there is yet no reason for complacency with regard to the position.  I say that there is complacency on the part of the Government, that there is actual indifference in regard to the threatened disemployment of some 300 workers in this part of my constituency.  The Minister can, by taking definite action, put an end to the situation prevailing there and can ensure that, in this part of the country at any rate, employment will be maintained.  We expect definite action from the Minister and will hold him responsible, if there are any further dismissals from this factory.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="816" /> Although the present Government, or the preceding Government, for that matter, are in no way responsible for the position in the Portlaw tannery, it will be forever held against the Minister if this industry which took so much time and effort to build up, is allowed to collapse and disappear.</P>
    <P>One would expect more concern, more sympathy, from a Labour Minister for Industry and Commerce in a matter which affects the employment and the livelihood of such a large body of workers and their dependents than the Minister has so far displayed.  One would expect immediate preventive action&mdash;something more than the curtailment of the importation of these synthetic materials.  I have no doubt and I have no hesitation in expressing the conviction that, in similar circumstances, the Minister's predecessor would have taken immediate and effective steps to safeguard this important industry and to ensure a continuation of the employment, the cessation of which will sound the death knell of a whole town and a wide countryside.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to prolong the arguments on this matter, but I conclude by pointing out to the Minister that every household in this town of 1,000 inhabitants and every individual in every small cottage and dwelling in a wide surrounding area is entirely dependent on this tannery for an existence.  If the Minister succeeds in securing to them this employment and safeguarding it for them, he will have the undying gratitude of those people and the deep appreciation of the people of the whole constituency of Waterford.  On the other hand, if he fails to succour them in their time of need he will incur and merit their odium.  All I ask is the right for those people to live their lives in freedom from want and hunger and the right to secure and safeguard the employment that is there for them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Norton) William Norton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Norton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the difficulties of this situation will be solved by the exaggerations of Deputy Ormonde or by the simple rules which he has suggested of trying to put the <Col N="817" /> responsibility upon shoulders to which that responsibility does not belong. The plain fact of the matter is&mdash;and the local employment exchange statistics prove it&mdash;that the workers at Portlaw tannery have been on halftime since April of last year, and the Fianna Fáil Government was in office in April of last year.  Does Deputy Ormonde deny that?</P>
      <P>The position is that the tannery at Portlaw is overstocked with material which it cannot clear.  Let me give the Deputy these figures.  The demand for the products of the tanneries, that is, the Portlaw tannery and the subsidiary tannery at New Ross, has fallen from 24,000 bends a month to an average of about 14,000 bends a month.  The stock of bend leather is sufficient to supply the requirements of the home market on the reduced demand for leather for the next 12 months and that 12 months supply in advance has been accumulated in the two tanneries.</P>
      <P>These two tanneries formerly did a considerable export trade, but the position to-day is that they have no export trade.  They have lost it for a number of reasons.  The first thing is hides.  The price of hides on the British market has fallen considerably. Britain, which imported hides, is not now able to absorb all the hides which she produces herself.  America is now exporting a considerable number of hides and hides now are not available on the home market at the artificially low price at which they were available previously.  Who is responsible if Portlaw cannot sell leather in Britain? Is any Government here responsible?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position is that anybody who competes on an extern market takes all the risks of that market.  The Portlaw tannery and the New Ross tannery have found that they cannot now find a market in Britain for leather and for the same reasons that they cannot find a market in Britain they cannot find a market here for heavy sole leather.  There has been a considerable increase in the use of synthetic soling materials.  A British publication described as <i>The Shoe and Leather News</i> stated recently that the consumption of leather in England for soling footwear <Col N="818" /> was 86 per cent. in 1942 and that was down to 63 per cent. in 1953, while the non-leather soling increased from a user of 14 per cent. in 1942 to 37 per cent. in 1953.  The figures of the users of synthetic soling materials are much higher to-day in Britain and Ireland than they were in 1953.</P>
    <P>It has been stated by people qualified to express an opinion that in America the over-all percentage of non-leather material used in the soling of boots and shoes is as high as 50 per cent.  One Irish footwear manufacturer with an intimate knowledge of the American market stated that in his view not more than 37 per cent. of the soling material used in America was of leather.</P>
    <P>That is a situation which has been growing.  Any tanner who could read or see must have been aware of these developments because all the facts and figures are there to prove that the situation was developing for a considerable time.  The difficulties of the tanneries have been caused by an increased use of synthetic soling material, by the use of crepe, particularly for children's footwear and sports footwear and by the increased use of rubber and rubber-soled footwear.</P>
    <P>Let me tell the Deputy that in Ireland alone the production of rubber footwear and rubber-soled footwear is six and a half times greater than it was nine years ago.  The tanners could see these figures every year rising, pointing out at the same time that there was danger and a red light for the leather production industry.  These two factories at New Ross and Portlaw have lost their entire export trade and on top of that they have got competition now from another Irish tannery which is still producing leather, still selling leather and still keeping workers in employment.  It may well be&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In the Irish market. One of these factories which was burned out has come back into the market and is now producing and selling leather.  This type of leather was formerly produced and sold by the Portlaw tannery.  The Deputy ought to inquire into the facts fully so that he will know what they are.</P>
      <P>An examination of the statistics will show that in the period 1950 to 1953 the annual user of synthetic materials for soling was in the neighbourhood of 4,000 cwts.  That had increased to 8,000 cwts. in 1954.  Again, the tanners could easily have seen that development. These are not problems peculiar to Ireland.  Trade publications show that even in Germany sole leather production declined from 34,000 tons in 1950 to 25,000 tons in 1954.  What did the German tanners do when they found themselves in a situation of that kind?  They set out to meet the problem by trying to find other uses for the heavy bend leather which they previously made.  They were able to find these other uses by splitting the hide and making a light flexible leather for which they found a considerable demand in Germany.  I think as good a demand could be found here if our tanners had approached the problem of trying to find alternative uses for the heavy bend leather which they previously produced and sold and for which they now find it difficult to get a market because of the demand for synthetic soling materials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Great Britain, the Leather Institute decided there to combat the fall in the demand for heavy leather by undertaking a propaganda campaign with a view to boosting the uses of leather and promoting its sale.  Two schemes were recently announced by the Leather Institute, Department of Education.  They have indicated that they will make available in Britain to 6,500 schools the services of lecturers, films, film strips, wall charts, teachers' notes, museum exhibits and other teaching aids in order to try to convince the consumer that leather has uses and that it is a commodity which can be bought with advantage.  It has even planned mobile exhibitions to boost the sale of leather for soling and <Col N="820" /> to boost the sale of leather-manufactured goods.</P>
    <P>Have the tanners here attempted to do anything like that?  They have not. Why have they not done so?  If it pays the German to do it and if it pays the British tanner to do it, why would it not pay the Irish tanner to attempt to do something similar?  Even now the tanner ought to endeavour to dispose of the stored-up stock and get down to making leather on the basis of the adjusted demand for heavy sole leather on the Irish market.  Above all, the tanners ought to get down to recognising that there is a change in public taste and to seeing now whether they can use leather for other purposes besides soling boots and shoes or whether they cannot produce a different type of light flexible leather for which, I think, there is as good a market here as can be found in other countries.</P>
    <P>Irish Tanners, Portlaw, appear to have sold about 6,750,000 lb. of sole leather in 1950-51.  That fell to less than 5,000,000 lb. in 1953-54, and sales for the calendar year 1954 were little more than 3,500,000 lb.  Even these falls were masked to some extent by the fact that they were doing a substantial export trade which has now completely disappeared.  That trade has disappeared for two reasons mainly.  There was at one stage a ready market for sole leather in Britain. That has gone and the British themselves are not now putting the quantity of hides which they previously put into the manufacture of leather.  They have deliberately cut down the intake of hides into the tannery industry because they know there is not a market for all the hides which were previously tanned.  Our people now have to compete in Britain against two considerable difficulties: first, the fact that the British do not want heavy sole leather; secondly, the fact that the British themselves are not using all the hides they could use; and, thirdly, the fact that the price of hides in the British market has fallen while the price of hides in the home market has risen.</P>
    <P>These are all difficulties which I do not think any Government could surmount. Is it suggested, for example, that we should stop entirely the use of <Col N="821" /> synthetic soling material here?  Is that what Deputy Ormonde suggests?  Does Deputy Ormonde suggest that if the public want to use synthetic soling material, which is good value to the public&mdash;have no doubt about that&mdash;has a considerable durability and, in the long run, is a much cheaper sole, does Deputy Ormonde suggest the public should be denied access to the substitute soling materials?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister who said the public wants the synthetic soling material?  Is it not the boot manufacturers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me reply to that and, at the same time, correct a misstatement by Deputy Ormonde.  In October, 1952, and it will not be denied that the Fianna Fáil Government was in office in that month&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us forget that now. We are dealing with the Portlaw tannery and its future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite.  In October, 1952, Dunlop's factory here was supplied with a list of imported materials, synthetic materials, and told by the Fianna Fáil Government that they should try to manufacture those commodities here. For what?  I suggest only for use. Deputy Ormonde says that I sanctioned the establishment of an industry in another town to do harm to Portlaw. What I am going to say now will be embarrassing to Deputy Ormonde but let the Deputy not forget to tell the truth when he is next in Portlaw and when he is there let him not forget to tell the people, especially those who voted for him, that on the 16th January, 1953, a manufacturing licence was issued to Dunlops authorising that firm to manufacture rubber sheeting, including rubber soling, and that new manufacture licence to make rubber soling was issued to Dunlops in 1953 by the Fianna Fáil Government.  Now does Deputy Ormonde know who helped to establish this new competitive industry against Portlaw?  Whatever else the Deputy may forget of this speech of mine let him not forget when he is next in Portlaw to tell the people there that Fianna Fáil gave another firm in this country a new manufacture licence to <Col N="822" /> produce synthetic soling material which the public are now using since they are buying it.  It is in the shops with leather goods.  The public can buy what it likes.  The public likes to buy this.  Does anyone imagine we can prevent the public following the same line as the public has always followed elsewhere?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely it is not the public who are selecting the material. It is the boot manufacturers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish Deputy Aiken was here on the Front Bench to-night and not Deputy Derrig because I would want Deputy Aiken to tell us what is the view of the boot factories in Dundalk and Drogheda in relation to this proposition.  Suppose I was to say tomorrow to the boot manufacturers: &ldquo;You will get no duty free licence&rdquo; and suppose the boot manufacturers then decided they would pay the duty on the imported synthetic rubber material, what would happen?  They would pay the duty.  They would put the imported synthetic material on the boots and shoes.  That would be no good to Portlaw because Portlaw has got 12 months' supply in stock.  In any case the demand for these synthetic soled boots and shoes is here and in my view will stay and tanners ought to take their heads out of the sand if they imagine it is going to vanish overnight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOrmonde" hpid="Mr. Ormonde Mr. Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Why not prohibit the importation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy ought to look up the Trade Agreement of 1938 which his Government negotiated with Britain and see what prohibition can be done under that and then come back here and tell us what his view is of that agreement after he has read it.  If these people are required to pay the duty on the imported synthetic material they will pay it.  They will put the material on the boots and shoes.  The Exchequer, and only the Exchequer, will get the revenue; but the boot manufacturers will charge more for the boots and shoes soled with this synthetic material and the retailers who buy the boots and shoes soled with imported synthetic material, on which <Col N="823" /> duty has been paid, will then charge a higher price to the consumers; and then Deputy Ormonde would come in here and say that since this Government came into office the price of boots and shoes has gone up.  The Deputy must do some thinking about this matter.  Talking about it is no solution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think there are solutions for the tanners' difficulties.  They may be painful solutions from the point of view of the tanners, but nevertheless there <Col N="824" /> are solutions.  The tanners must think about a way of getting out of their difficulties.  I do not think they are insurmountable and so far as I am concerned, in a specially difficult set of circumstances, I am willing to do anything I can to help the tanners and help retain in employment every employee it is possible to retain in Portlaw in the altered circumstances.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Tuesday, 29th March, 1955.</P>
