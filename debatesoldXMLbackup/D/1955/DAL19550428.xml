      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware that the Government of Ceylon has decided to reduce the export duty on tea to 1/6 per lb., and, if so, what effect such reduction will have on tea prices in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed that the reduction in the export duty on Ceylon tea recently announced by the Government of Ceylon is approximately 5½d. per lb.  The reduction will have no immediate effect on tea prices in this country, since, as the Deputy is aware, tea is being sold at substantially less than the economic price. I should, perhaps, mention that the great bulk of the demand in this country is for Indian tea.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>As I explained on 24th November, 1954, in reply to a previous question from the Deputy, further consideration of the application of the Galway Harbour Commissioners for a Harbour Works Order was deferred pending receipt of the tenders for the deepening of the commercial dock on two alternative bases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="493" /> Amended contract documents to form the basis of the alternative tenders were received from the harbour commissioners on the 19th March, 1955.  The examination of these documents will be completed as expeditiously as possible and the harbour commissioners will then be in a position to go out to tender.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The examination is a complicated technical process which will be carried out for the Department by the Office of Public Works.  I have asked the Office of Public Works to expedite the examination of the documents as much as possible with a view to permitting the necessary action to be taken whereby the Galway Harbour Commissioners can go to tender.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that a considerable amount of examination has taken place over the period which he has indicated, would the Minister not agree that the period now required to complete the examination should be short?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think Galway will lose by an examination of the alternative bases of tender so as to ensure that whatever is done is the best that can be done, having regard to the technical difficulties to be encountered. I will take every possible step to expedite the examination of the documents with a view to facilitating the invitation of tenders.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">

Such trains are now made up entirely from modern stock mostly of new construction. The new coaches will provide substantially improved facilities for passengers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands why the application of Mr. Thomas Hanahoe, Rathcash, Killala, County Mayo, for an addition to his small holding from the adjacent Campbell lands was not granted by the Land Commission; and if, in view of the fact that some years ago the Land Commission promised Mr. Hanahoe, who is an old I.R.A. man with a military service medal, an enlargement on the Campbell estate, he will request the commission to reconsider its decision in the matter.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands why the applications of two tenants of county council houses at Rathreagh, Kincon, Killala, for accommodation plots on the Boland estate, Courthill, were not granted, in view of the fact that accommodation plots have previously been given to other tenants of county council cottages in the district, and that there is very little employment available there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the Boland holding has not yet been entirely allotted but if, when allotment is completed, it is found that these cottiers have been unsuccessful, it must be assumed that the Land Commission had not sufficient land available to meet their requirements after the needs of more deserving applicants had been met.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's facetious reply, does he not realise that it is a great hardship on a woman to have to carry a ten months old baby around the Botanic Gardens? In that particular area there is no public park.  It means that women have to forego fresh air for themselves and their children because they will not admit a go-car or a perambulator.</P>

It was not practicable to extend that concession to stockists, who, in any event, should not find it over difficult to dispose of their stocks in ways not open to erectors of haybarns under the scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Norton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The purpose of the Bill, as set out in the Explanatory Memorandum which I have circulated to Deputies, is to confirm ten Orders made by the Government under the Emergency Imposition of Duties Act, 1932.  The commodities covered by the Orders are as follows:&mdash; (1) welts and welting for footwear; (2) malt extract preparations; (3) quilts and quilt covers; (4) vulcanised rubber for footwear; (5) iron and steel files; (6) artificial silk and union piece goods; (7) rubber solution; (8) buttons and button blanks; (9) woven labels; (10) electrical accessories.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The customs duties imposed on welts and welting, vulcanised rubber for footwear and electrical accessories are new protective duties.  The firm engaged in the production of welts and welting was unable to develop fully owing to heavy imports.  Welts and welting are used by the footwear industry as strengthening agents in the manufacture of boots and shoes.  In the case of vulcanised rubber for footwear, there is a general world tendency to use substitutes for sole leather in the manufacture of footwear. One group of these substitutes consists of vulcanised rubber, including synthetic rubber and imitations thereof and a limited range of these materials is at present being produced here, and it is expected that the production of a wide range will be undertaken at Cork.  With regard to electrical accessories, the production of these goods <Col N="504" /> was commenced some months ago at Carrick-on-Shannon, County Leitrim. The particular goods being produced consist of certain types of non-metal tumbler switches, switch-plates, fixing rings, outlet-sockets, outlet-plugs, ceiling roses and bayonet lampholders.</P>
    <P>The Order dealing with malt extract preparations extended the scope of the existing customs duty on malt extract and preparations of malt extract and fish liver oil so as to include other preparations or mixtures which contain malt extract, but excluding any such preparations or mixtures imported in containers containing not more than 16 ounces.  The position in regard to the existing duty was that it did not apply to malt extract or preparations of malt extract and fish liver oil to which any other substance or substances had been added.  The result was that the duty was being evaded by the addition to the imported products of small quantities of other substances such as calcium, iron, etc., and it became necessary to extend the scope of the duty in order to give effective protection to the home industry.  Preparations or mixtures containing malt extract imported in containers containing not more than 16 ounces were excluded from the scope of the extended duty in order to permit the free entry of genuine preparations of malt and other medicinal or vitamin substances which are made up in containers of 16 ounces or less.</P>
    <P>A customs duty of 75 per cent. full rate, 50 per cent. preferential rate <i>ad valorem</i> which was imposed in 1933 on filled quilts and unfilled quilt covers was suspended in 1943 owing to the general scarcity of supplies.  It was decided in October last to restore protection to the home industry, but at a reduced rate of 50 per cent.  full rate, 33? per cent. preferential rate <i>ad valorem</i> which, it was considered, should afford adequate protection for the industry.</P>
    <P>The manufacture of iron and steel hand files was commenced some years ago at Droichead Nua, County Kildare, and the industry was protected by an <i>ad valorem</i> customs duty on competing imported products.  Last year, however, the continued existence of the industry was seriously threatened by <Col N="505" /> intensive competition from strong external interests and it was necessary to increase the degree of protection afforded to the industry.  This was done by the imposition of an additional specific duty on files.</P>
    <P>The Order dealing with artificial silk woven piece goods and union piece goods amalgamated into one duty two separate duties on artificial silk and union piece goods and at the same time remedied certain defects in the duties which had worked to the detriment of the home manufacturers of damask ticken, interlinings and moquette.  The Order also revoked the suspended customs duties on certain cotton piece goods which have been subject to import quota control for some years past.</P>
    <P>A customs duty which was imposed on rubber solution in 1937 was suspended in 1942 owing to the general scarcity of supplies.  It was decided in November last to restore protection to the home industry, but it was necessary to extend the scope of the duty because, in addition to making adhesive solutions from natural rubber, it is now the practice to use also synthetic rubber and latex and the restored duty covers solutions made from these substances as well as from natural rubber.</P>
    <P>When the customs duty on buttons and button blanks was originally imposed in 1936 imitation mother-of-pearl buttons were excluded from the scope of the duty to permit free importation of shell buttons used mainly by the shirt manufacturers.  These buttons were not then, and are not now, made here.  In recent years, however, there have been considerable developments in the manufacture of buttons from plastic materials with the result that plastic buttons made to resemble mother-of-pearl were escaping payment of customs duty by qualifying for the description of &ldquo;imitation mother-of-pearl&rdquo;. These buttons were being imported in substantial quantities to the serious detriment of the Irish button manufacturers who are in a position to produce all types of plastic buttons. Consequently it became necessary to recast the exclusion from the duty to <Col N="506" /> ensure that only the shell buttons would be admitted free of duty.</P>
    <P>The Order dealing with woven labels increased the customs duty on these goods from 33? per cent. <i>ad valorem,</i> flat rate, to 60 per cent., full rate, 40 per cent. preferential rate applicable to United Kingdom and Canada <i>ad valorem.</i>  Woven garment labels are being manufactured at Miltown-Malbay, County Clare.  The industry is a new one and the promoters found that no progress could be made towards developing the industry on a sound basis in the face of severe competition from large-scale continental manufacturers. It was, accordingly, necessary to afford the industry a measure of increased protection.  This Bill is to give effect to the various Orders which have been made.  I ask the House to give these Orders the necessary legislative sanction by approving the Bill.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>Agreed to take the remaining stages to-day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Corish) Brendan Corish">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Corish)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  Some Deputies may be wondering why this Bill comes so closely on the heels of the Workmen's Compensation (Amendment) Act, 1953.  The explanation is simple. That Act introduced for the first time, in the workmen's compensation code, allowances payable only to married men with wives and children.  It did not alter the compensation rates for single men or women, a position which was regarded as unsatisfactory by the Parties in opposition at the time.  In view of this limitation of the benefits under the 1953 Act and having regard to the general inadequacy of workmen's compensation payments all round, the present Government decided as part of its 12-point policy programme to improve the position of beneficiaries under the Workmen's Compensation Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The two most important sections in <Col N="507" /> the Act of 1953 dealt with increases in weekly payments for married men and increases in the maximum amounts payable in fatal cases.  Under that Act supplemental allowances were granted in respect of a wife who was married to the injured workman at the time of his accident and in respect of a child under 15 years or each of two children under that age, born not later than ten months after the accident giving rise to the compensation.  As I have said, the Act gave no increase to single men or women many of whom have to support aged parents or younger brothers and sisters.  Moreover, an injured workman who married after his accident gets no allowance for his wife.  For those injured workmen the maximum weekly payment remained at the 1948 limit of 50/-.</P>
    <P>One further point: the maximum weekly allowances payable under the 1953 Act are 12/- for a wife and 7/- in respect of a child or each of two children, making the total maximum supplemental allowances payable 26/-. But not all married men eligible for those allowances received the maximum payment.  The Act provides that the supplemental allowances be deemed to be part of the weekly payment for all purposes and, accordingly, the aggregate of the personal weekly payment and supplemental allowances cannot exceed 75 per cent. of the workman's pre-accident average weekly earnings.  Where a workman earning less than £5 1s. 4d. a week&mdash;75 per cent. of which is 76/- &mdash;sustains injury at his work he cannot draw the maximum compensation of 76/- a week.</P>
    <P>I would like to emphasise the fact that workmen whose maximum weekly compensation for total incapacity is pegged at 50/- are suffering grave hardship.  It is beyond question that with present wage levels, the sum of 50/- a week is too far removed from what a workman should get on the basis of 75 per cent. of his pre-accident average weekly earnings.  Because of the 50/- limit, the amount by which wages exceed £3 6s. 8d.&mdash;75 per cent. of which is 50/- &mdash;is not taken into account in the calculation of the weekly <Col N="508" /> payment of compensation.  Take, for example, the case of a man employed as an agricultural worker in the County of Dublin.  According to the Agricultural Wages (Minimum Rates) Order, 1954, which came into operation on the 1st March, 1954, he must get at least £4 14s. for a normal week's work.</P>
    <P>As the law stands at present, if this worker is a single man and meets with an accident he cannot get more than 50/- a week although 75 per cent.  of his average weekly earnings would work out at 70/6.  Where a man's employment is with an industrial concern in which, generally, wages are higher, or as a skilled worker in the building trades, the disparity between 50/- and 75 per cent. of the workman's wages is more marked.</P>
    <P>Further, I should like to mention that during the course of the debate on the 1953 Bill a number of Deputies made the point that the payment of allowances to married men would be an inducement to employers to give preference in employment to single men because of the higher rates of compensation to which married men might become entitled.  Despite the assurance given by the former Minister for Social Welfare when the 1953 Bill was before this House that this would not happen it is obvious that the temptation is always there.  Needless to say, the temptation is all the greater where the employer does not insure against his liability to pay compensation.</P>
    <P>The fundamental principle underlying workmen's compensation in this country is to compensate an injured workman for loss of earnings.  That principle was embodied in the first Workmen's Compensation Act of 1897, which provided that the workman should receive half his earnings subject to a maximum of £1.  The principle remained a feature of workmen's compensation here until the Act of 1953, which provided increases in weekly payments in respect of the wife and children of an injured workman.  In so providing, the 1953 Act tried to bring the workmen's compensation code into line with current social welfare legislation and at the same time leave it on its present basis.  I think <Col N="509" /> that this position should not be continued. The introduction of supplemental allowances under the Act of 1953 deviated from the compensation principle I have mentioned and in my opinion it is most important that the principle should be restored.</P>
    <P>This Bill proposes to increase the maximum of the personal weekly payment for all injured workmen from 50/-to 90/- and to abolish the supplemental allowances payable under the Act of 1953.  The new maximum will permit wages up to £6 a week&mdash;75 per cent. of which is 90/&mdash;to be reflected in the weekly payment of compensation. It will apply to cases where the workman's accident happened before as well as to those arising after the passing of this Bill.  The increases will not, however, be payable in respect of any day prior to the day to be appointed for the coming into operation of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Special provision is contained in the Bill for the small number of workmen in receipt of compensation under the Acts which were in operation before the Workmen's Compensation Act of 1934.  The Act of 1948 abolished temporary allowances payable to these workmen&mdash;estimated to number less than 100&mdash;under an emergency powers Order of 1944, and in substitution provided an increase of two-thirds of the weekly payments as they stood on the 1st August, 1934, subject to a maximum of 50/-.  The Act of 1953 gave an increase by way of supplemental allowance of 12/- to any of these men who were married at the time of the accident giving rise to their compensation and whose wives are still living.  As the supplemental allowances payable under the Act of 1953 are being abolished by the present Bill provision is made in the Bill for raising the maximum of the weekly payment for these cases to 90/- with a corresponding increase of 80 per cent.  in all payments below that figure.  The Bill provides that no workman will suffer a reduction in compensation by reason of losing a supplemental allowance.</P>
    <P>The second important feature in the Act of 1953 was the increases it brought about in the lump sums <Col N="510" /> payable in fatal cases.  Under the Act of 1934, adults who were totally dependent on the deceased workman got three years' earnings with a minimum of £200 and a maximum of £300. Where there were juvenile dependents only or juvenile and adult dependents, the minimum was £200 and the maximum £600.  The Act of 1953 doubled the minimum and maximum of those lump sums, but in view of the depreciation in money values since 1934 those increases did not go far enough.  It is now proposed to provide for a further increase of 50 per cent. on the present figures for lump sums, in the case of accidents happening after the appointed day.</P>
    <P>The effect of the Bill on the present position will, therefore, be as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  Where the workman leaves an adult dependent who was wholly dependent on him, the maximum lump sum at present is the equivalent of three years' wages or £600, whichever-is the less, and the minimum is £400. The Bill raises the £600 to £900 and the £400 to £600.</P>
    <P>(2)  Where the workman leaves juvenile dependents wholly dependent on his earnings, the maximum of the children's lump sum is £1,200 and the minimum is £400.  The Bill raises the £1,200 to £1,800 and the £400 to £600.</P>
    <P>(3)  Where the workman leaves both-adult and juvenile dependents who were wholly dependent on him, the-maximum amount, at present, of the aggregate lump sum is £1,200 and the minimum is £400.  The Bill increases-these sums to £1,800 and £600 respectively.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>In short, the Act of 1953 doubled the amounts appearing in the Second Schedule of the Act of 1934, which are used in the calculation of the children's lump sum.  This Bill trebles the-amounts shown in that Schedule.</P>
    <P>We now come to Section 8 of the Bill.  As Deputies are aware, the Workmen's Compensation Acts provide-for a weekly payment to a workman while he is unable to earn as much as he did before his accident.  The weekly payment can never exceed three <Col N="511" /> quarters of his wages and, because of the fixed maximum, it is generally very much less.  This reduction in income would be a great hardship at any time, and it is especially so while a man is sick.  In the great majority of cases, incapacity lasts only a few weeks, and the workman and his dependents simply have to tighten their belts and endure the hardship until he returns to work.</P>
    <P>There is another type of case, however, which involves hardship of a more serious and lasting kind&mdash;the type of case in which, say, a man who has been a carpenter all his life meets with an accident at the age of 45 and loses a few fingers.  He cannot return to his old occupation and, at his age and with his limited qualifications, he cannot get employment in any other.  Men in this type of case face the prospect of going through the rest of their lives with nothing to depend on but the meagre weekly payment of compensation. If they could lay hands on a little capital, many of them would set themselves up in a little shop or other business or undergo a course of training or treatment which would enable them to become again independent and self-supporting members of society.</P>
    <P>As things stand, they have no right to seek redemption of their weekly payment.  Employers have such a right under Section 27 of the Workmen's Compensation Act, 1934, but, if they do not choose to exercise it, there is no way open to the workman of securing a lump sum settlement except by agreement with the employer or, generally, with the employer's insurance company.  There are about 800 cases settled by agreement for lump sums every year.  Nearly half of these agreements are not registered under the Acts, and the average lump sum is about £360.</P>
    <P>There is a widely held belief that these voluntary settlements are rarely to the workman's advantage.  It is generally his first experience of such negotiations, and on the other side you have representatives of insurance companies who have long experience of this kind of business and are skilful at driving a hard bargain.  There is a great temptation to the average workman <Col N="512" /> who finds himself in debt after an accident to make a settlement for a few hundred pounds in the hope that his injuries are not as bad as they are represented to be and that he will be able to return to work in a reasonable time.</P>
    <P>The purpose of Section 8 was to protect the interests of these men by bringing the courts into the picture. The section gives the court power to make a redemption order at the workman's request whenever the court thinks fit to do so, having regard to the workman's reason for seeking redemption, the nature of his injury and&mdash;where the employer so requests&mdash; the employer's circumstances.  Where the injury is permanent, the redemption price is the same as that fixed for employers in the Schedule to the Act; where it is not, the redemption price is fixed by the court.  By leaving it to the discretion of the court whether or not redemption should be granted in each particular case, the section was designed to hold the balance equitably between employer and workman and to protect the workman's interests without doing any injustice to the employer.</P>
    <P>Since the Bill was circulated, however, organisations of employers have represented to me that the section as it now stands is unlikely to be confined in its operation to cases where redemption would be of benefit to the workman without doing any injustice to his employer.  One of the great difficulties in doing this is, of course, the nature of the incapacity for which compensation is provided under the Workman's Compensation Acts.  This incapacity is incapacity to earn and is a separate and distinct thing from physical disability.  While there may be no doubt about the duration of physical disability, as, for example, in the case of the loss of a limb, there can rarely be the same certainty about the duration of incapacity to earn.  We have only to think of the many thousands of disabled servicemen and others who have been returned to full earning capacity in Great Britain since the last war.  As things stand, employers have the safeguard that compensation is a weekly payment which diminishes as the amount of the workman's <Col N="513" /> post-accident earnings increases and ends when it reaches the preaccident level.</P>
    <P>While I do not accept all the objections urged by the employers, I realise that much depends on the interpretation placed on the section by the courts, which might well have the effect of making the section do more than it was intended to do.  I will, accordingly, await with interest the views which Deputies may have to offer on the section.</P>
    <P>Another important provision is contained in Section 11 of the Bill which amends Section 60 of the Act of 1934. Section 60 was amended by Section 6 of the Act of 1953 which provides that acceptance by the workman of compensation under the Act or of any payment purporting to be by way of compensation thereunder shall not prevent the workman from maintaining proceedings independently of the Act. A recent judicial decision suggests that Section 6 of the Act of 1953 did not fully achieve what was intended and the purpose of Section 11 of the Bill is to place beyond doubt the right of the workman to claim compensation under the Act and also to take proceedings independently of the Act as long as the employer will not have to pay twice over.</P>
    <P>The judicial decision mentioned is the subject of an appeal to the Supreme Court and it is expressly provided that Section 11 shall not apply to that particular case nor to cases which stand adjourned at the passing of the Bill pending the determination of that appeal by the Supreme Court, nor to cases which may have been decided in conformity with the decision from which the appeal was taken.</P>
    <P>A further section in the Bill substitutes the date of death of the workman for the date of allocation of the children's lump sum.  The Act of 1934 defines a juvenile dependent as one who is under the age of 15 at the date of death of the workman.  At present the children's lump sum is divided among the children in the ratio of the number of months between the date of its allocation by the court and the <Col N="514" /> date on which each child will attain the age limit for juvenile dependency. A child attaining that limit between the date of death of the workman and the date of allocation cannot share in the children's lump sum.  As he was not an adult dependent at the date of the workman's death he cannot get a share of the adult's lump sum and consequently gets no compensation at all. Cases of serious hardship have arisen as a result of this position which is remedied by Section 9 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Under the current legislation a workman does not receive payment in respect of the first three days of incapacity where his incapacity lasts less than four weeks.  The 1906 Act fixed the period at two weeks, but this was extended to four weeks in Great Britain in 1923 and under our own legislation in 1934.  The Bill restores the period to two weeks, which is considered more reasonable and corresponds with the position under the British Industrial Injuries Scheme.</P>
    <P>The remaining section of the Bill raises the age limit for juvenile dependency from 15 years to 16 years, which is the age limit for qualified children under the Social Welfare Act, 1952, and for children's allowances.</P>
    <P>The increases which it is now proposed to give in payments of compensation are long overdue.  The inadequacy of these payments was apparent for a long time and, as I have already said, the Government decided, as part of its 12-point policy programme to bring about a betterment of the position.  One of the first things I did when I took up office was to set about implementing that decision and this Bill is the result. Its aim is the restricted one of removing some of the most pressing difficulties, and it is not intended as a comprehensive measure to remedy all the defects of the existing system of workmen's compensation.  The first step in this direction would be a full inquiry to ascertain and set out the defects in the present code and to recommend how best they might be remedied so that injured workmen would be assured of proper and adequate compensation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="515" /> I was first inclined to the view that such an inquiry should be entrusted to a parliamentary committee of the kind which this House set up in March last year, but later I found myself turning towards the idea of an outside commission or committee which would be representative of the various interests involved&mdash;the workers, the employers, the legal and medical professions and the insurance companies.  I have finally come to the conclusion that the inquiry could best be carried out by a commission and I am having the necessary steps taken to set up such a body. I hope it will be possible for them to complete their examination of this vexed question within a reasonable time and that their recommendations will enable us to go as far as is possible in our circumstances towards providing the best possible system of compensation for injured workmen.</P>

      <P>I move my amendment:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete &ldquo;now&rdquo; and to add at the end of the motion &ldquo;this day three months, and that in the meantime a Committee of 11 Deputies be appointed with power to send for persons, papers and records, to receive evidence and to report back to the Dáil on the probable consequences of the proposals in the Bill on employment and prices.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In considering the question of equitable benefits, in our social welfare system the criterion we must take is the need of the workman concerned.  We do not appear to be in a position to afford any more than the workman might need but we are, of course, bound to go as far as practicable in that direction to meet his need.  Whether the man is rendered incapable of work by an accident arising out of his employment or whether he should be out of work through sickness or through lack of employment, it appears to me that his need is the same.  I cannot see any good reason why a person should get less when he is sick or unemployed than he would get if he were injured in his employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Social Welfare naturally knows the needs of those men who are injured in their employment <Col N="516" /> or who fall sick.  We all know them and we are in a very good position to give an opinion as to what the needs of a man may be in order to maintain himself at the present time.  Since, perhaps, we cannot afford luxuries, our aim should be to give the man sufficient to provide himself at least with food and lodging.  In our social welfare system at the moment, before this measure should become law, if a man who is single meets with an accident arising out of his employment he is entitled to £2 10s. per week but if he meets with a similar accident, say, in the evening, in his own time, or if he meets with unemployment, he gets only 24/- a week.</P>
    <P>I imagine that the Minister for Social Welfare, having that picture before him and, as he told us here to-day, being very anxious to fulfil one of the points in the Coalition programme of increasing social services, would have set himself the task, first of all, of improving the lot of those who suffer illness outside their employment or who suffer unemployment, and would see that the sum of 24/- per week would be increased to at least 50/- before he would ask the House to consider this measure dealing with workmen's compensation.</P>
    <P>In the case of a married man we have a similar position.  As matters stand at the moment, if a married man, with a wife and two children, meets with an accident arising out of his employment he is entitled to 76/- per week.  If the same man were to meet with an accident in the evening, in his own time, he would come under the Social Welfare Act and would receive 50/- a week.  Therefore, he is very much worse off than a man who would meet with an accident arising out of his employment.</P>
    <P>The Minister, I am quite sure, is not unaware of this fact because I remember distinctly&mdash;and I think I mentioned this before&mdash;a speech he made in the Bull Ring in Wexford during the last election campaign when he put the rhetorical question: &ldquo;How can a sick man be expected to live on 24/- a week?&rdquo;  That shows the Minister had thought about the subject <Col N="517" /> before he became Minister at all.  He is in a position now to answer that rhetorical question: &ldquo;How can a man who is sick or unemployed live on 24/-per week?&rdquo;.  I also feel sure that when the Minister was putting that question in Wexford the answer he expected to receive was: &ldquo;He cannot live on it&rdquo;. If he believes that, we are entitled to inquire why a measure dealing with these particular categories was not brought before the Dáil because, in my opinion, their lot is much worse than the lot of men who suffer accidents in the course of their employment.</P>
    <P>It may be a simple matter, as I am putting it here to the Dáil, to ask the question: &ldquo;How can a sick man or an unemployed man live on 24/- a week?&rdquo;; and it may be a simple matter to say to any member of the Dáil that he is much worse off than the man at the present time who meets with an accident arising out of his employment. That is a simple question to put and the answer is simple, that the person who is sick or unemployed is certainly very much worse off and that it is hard to see how he can live on the sum of 24/- a week.</P>
    <P>However, I know the difficulty that a Minister would have in dealing with the question because in the case of sickness or unemployment the person comes under the Social Welfare Act and the increased benefits would have to be provided by increasing contributions. Contributions to the insurance fund come from three sources: so much from the employer, so much from the employee, and so much from the State. If the Minister were to introduce a proposal to bring these rates for a single man up to 50/- per week&mdash;I am not saying 90/&mdash;and if he were to leave the dependents' allowances as they are, that is 12/- for a wife and 7/- each for the first two children, it does not require very much calculation to discover that the contributions would have to be almost doubled.  That creates an awkward situation for a Minister or for a Government because you have to increase the contributions from the employers, from the employees, or from the State, or if you follow the present pattern of raising <Col N="518" /> money, it would come from all three sources.  If it were to come in much the same proportion from all these three sources as it comes at the moment, the contribution from the employer would be doubled, the contribution from the employee would be doubled, and the contribution from the State would be increased by somewhere about £3,000,000 or £4,000,000.</P>
    <P>Maybe we have sufficient knowledge and common sense to see why the Minister did not make this proposal to the Government and why the Government did not put these proposals before the Dáil.  At any rate, we have now a Bill before us dealing with workmen's compensation.  It is easier for a Minister or a Government to bring in a Bill on workmen's compensation because the complete cost will fall on the employer.  That does not create any great problem for a Government; it does not create any great problem for members of the Dáil who have to pass the Bill; but we must recognise the fact that, whatever the increased cost there is, it must be considered by somebody and must come from somewhere. In fact, as we know, the increased cost comes from the employer, because in the Workmen's Compensation Acts the whole cost is paid by the employer and we are following that naturally in discussing this Bill here.</P>
    <P>We should try to visualise what is going to happen, because in a Bill of this kind where there will be increased costs the money must come from somewhere and we should try to visualise what effect that will have on the country in general.  Admittedly, the workmen will get more&mdash;we all admit that and I suppose most of us would agree with the Minister that we can make a case that the workman needs it.  We need not labour that point or have any disagreement on it, but even so we must have some regard to the question of where the money is to come from.</P>
    <P>The best way I can put it is in this way.  There are employers who carry their own risks in regard to workmen's compensation.  Some of them are fairly big employers.  They have found from <Col N="519" /> experience over the years, I suppose, that if they were to pay for this particular type of risk to an insurance company, the insurance company would get more out of it than they had paid in.  Some of these employers have come to the conclusion that they had better carry the risk themselves and form a fund of their own and carry on on that basis.  Let us take the example of a fairly big employer employing 500 men.  I think, from any statistics that I have read on this subject, that if he has the same experience as other employers, a fairly average experience over the last three or four years, it would be that he would have had to put aside to meet claims under the Workmen's Compensation Acts about £5 per man per year.  That is to say, for his 500 men he would be paying in £2,500 a year.  Now, in saying that I want to make it clear that that is in a type of employment where there was no special risk.</P>
    <P>There are some employments where the amount would be very much more. Where there is no special risk, however, I think that claims would be covered by £5 per year per person employed.  That man has been putting £2,500 per year aside.  He looks at this Bill, gets a bit of advice from those who are accustomed to giving advice on matters of this kind and he sees that in future if a man is injured in the course of his employment he will be paying him 90/-, not 50/-.  He sees also two sections in particular in this Bill which I mean to come back to again&mdash;Sections 8 and 11&mdash;which are rather uncertain, in regard to what may be the liability under them.  If the benefit is going to be raised from 50/- to 90/-, and allowing something for increased costs under these two sections, 8 and 11, he says to himself &ldquo;I suppose I will have to provide at least double what I had to provide before.&rdquo;  That means he must take £2,500 out of his revenue and put it aside to cover costs under this Bill.</P>
    <P>What is going to happen as regards that £2,500?  If he is an employer who is in a position to price his own goods, whatever goods he may be producing, he will add this £2,500 to his costs.  The <Col N="520" /> result will be that whatever goods he may be producing will be increased in price to some extent&mdash;I do not know how much, as that all depends on what he is producing, his total output and so on.  There will be some increase in the cost of the goods produced by him and there will be an increase, therefore, to the purchaser when they reach the purchaser at the other end of the market.  That applies to many employers. There are other employers of course who are not in a position to pass the cost on.  There is the very big example of the farmers.  The farmers are not in a position to name their own price.  They must take what they can get on the market, according to whatever the market price may be. Under this Bill it appears to me that if the farmer has to provide more for workmen's compensation, whether he is going to carry that risk himself or pass the risk on to an insurance company, that increased amount, whatever it may be, will have to come out of the farmer's profits&mdash;it cannot come from anywhere else&mdash;or if the farmer is making a loss I suppose it can be added to his loss.</P>
    <P>When the Fianna Fáil Government were bringing in their Bill for social welfare in 1952 they recognised the fact that the increase in contributions to most employers could be passed on in the price of their goods, but they recognised the fact that in the case of farmers it could not be passed on, that the farmer is not in a position to pass on increased costs of that kind.  For that reason in the Social Welfare Act, 1952, the contribution from both the employer and employee in agriculture was a little over half what it was on other employers and other employees. In fact, the amounts were 2/4 per week for employer and employee in industry in general and in the case of farmers it was 1/3 per week on both the employer and the employee.  We had that in mind and we tried to lighten the burden as far as we possibly could on the farmer and also on the farm worker for that reason.  It appears to me that as a result of this Bill the increased costs will have to be found by the employer, whether he is a manufacturer or a distributor who is in a position to pass the cost on to his <Col N="521" /> customer, or whether he is a farmer who cannot pass it on and who must bear that increased cost himself.</P>
    <P>There is a departure in this Bill from what might be regarded as established principle in our social welfare legislation generally.  That departure has been defended by the Minister in removing the dependent's allowances which were first introduced, as far as workmen's compensation is concerned, in the 1953 Act.  The principle of giving more to the man with a wife and children than to a single man has been followed over the years and in many Acts of this Oireachtas in the past 20 years that principle has been extended. I think I have never yet come across any objection to the principle in any measure that was introduced.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Government brought in children's allowances which, I suppose, is the most obvious example of that principle of helping the man with dependents.  There was no objection whatever to it.  I do not remember any objection in this House. I think everybody agreed with the children's allowances measure when it was introduced.  These allowances were increased by a Fianna Fáil Government in 1952&mdash;and, again, there was no objection.  When we brought in the Social Welfare Act in 1952 it was the first time dependents' allowances were given to those drawing the sickness allowance.  As I am sure Deputies are aware, the position at the moment is that if a man is sick he gets 24/-.  If he has a wife he gets 12/- for her and if he has one or two children he gets 7/- for each of them.  Therefore, a man with dependents gets a considerable addition to his sickness allowance compared with the single man.</P>
    <P>When he was speaking, the Minister mentioned that a single man may have dependents too.  That is true and it is a thing that could be remedied, perhaps.  However, I do not think that the fact that a single man can have dependents is sufficient justification for removing the benefit to the married man with a wife and children. We could get around that matter in another way and try, as has been done in some cases, to cover dependents <Col N="522" /> where it can be established that these dependents are depending upon the beneficiary.</P>
    <P>As the Minister says, in 1953 we brought in dependents' allowances for the first time under the workmen's compensation code.  A Bill was passed by the Oireachtas giving the same dependents' allowances to a man injured in the course of his employment as a sick man or an unemployed man was getting under the Social Welfare Act.  I do not remember if there was any very serious objection to that particular provision at that time.  I do remember, indeed, a point raised by the Minister who is here to-day.  It was contended that employers would be more inclined to employ single men because if a single man were to be injured the amount payable to him would be lower than what would be paid to a married man.  I argued strongly against it at the time.  I said it was not likely that an employer would pay very much attention to that particular aspect of the matter when he was employing a man.  I must say I have never heard of a single case where it happened, and I am quite sure that when I was Minister for Social Welfare and when that Act was passed I would have heard if any employer had adopted an attitude of that kind. Ministers are always sure to hear of things of that kind because the people concerned are sure to let them know. No such thing ever happened and I do not think it is ever likely to happen. Where they are insured, it cannot happen because, in insurance, whether the man be married or single, the premium rate is the same.  The only place where it could possibly happen, therefore, would be in the case of an employer who is not insured and who is carrying the risk himself under the Workmen's Compensation Acts.  It has not happened so far and I do not think it is likely to happen.</P>
    <P>To come back again to the principle which I laid down at the beginning&mdash; and which I think is a proper principle which nobody can deny&mdash;the consideration which we should have before us in this matter is need.  So far as we possibly can, we should meet the needs <Col N="523" /> of the injured man.  If we are meeting the needs of the injured single man by giving him 90/- per week, it is obvious we are not meeting the needs of the married man with a wife and children. Therefore, in departing from the principle of giving a certain allowance to dependents, we are doing an injustice to the man who has a wife and maybe children also.  We should not depart from that principle.</P>
    <P>When this Bill comes to be considered on the Committee Stage, I shall oppose that particular section very vigorously and try to get the Dáil to agree that, whatever the rate may be for the single man, the married man with a wife and children should get an additional amount to cover his dependents. I do not agree at all with some of the reasons given by the Minister. I am quite sure this section will be debated in detail on the Committee Stage and we can keep the detailed arguments until that stage arrives.  I should just like to say now that it is a section which I would oppose very strongly on the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I mentioned, in particular, Section 8 and Section 11.  I think there is great uncertainty about what may happen under these two sections.  Nobody could give any idea of what the cost to an employer would be because there are new provisions there which may or may not be tried out in a big way.  We do not know what will happen.  It is very difficult to give a forecast of what the cost will be under these two sections. I object in particular to some of the provisions of these two sections because I believe these sections will lead to endless litigation without resulting in any corresponding benefit to the workman.</P>
    <P>Take Section 8, first of all.  One cannot have any great objection in principle to sub-section (1) because, really, it gives the same right to the workman that the employer has had up to this.  The object, I take it, is to give the same right to the workman as the employer had up to this.  Hitherto, the employer could go to court after six months in the case of a man who was permanently injured and who was drawing his weekly allowance.  The <Col N="524" /> employer could go to court and ask the judge to fix a lump sum and the judge could do it.  The workman had not the same right.  In all fairness, he should have it and, to that extent, I am not objecting to sub-section (1).  However, certain small matters arise on the section.  In my opinion there should be some age limit but that is not a very important item and we can discuss it on the Committee Stage.  I do not mind very much whether or not the Minister agrees, but I should like to put that consideration to him when we come to the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (2) is really only a schedule of the amounts and it is not very different from the Act of 1934, except that it extends the age beyond 49.  Up to this, the employer could only apply for the lump sum where the man was under 50.  Under this sub-section, the man himself, whether he is under or over 50, can apply for it and therefore the schedule is extended beyond the age of 49 and up to the age of 80.  It is senseless to have it going as far as 80 because I cannot imagine any man applying to the court to give him 75 per cent. of what he was getting at the age of 80.  He might as well stick it out for the rest of his life.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (3) is a sub-section which brings in this uncertainty I speak of. It constitutes the introduction of a new principle because, so far, in this matter of lump sums, we have always dealt with men who are permanently disabled. Now we have here men who are temporarily disabled.  I do not know how that is going to work because the man who is temporarily disabled, who is pronounced by his medical advisers and so on to be disabled for the time being, will recover and will be able to go back to work, but we do not know when.  It may take a year or two years.</P>
    <P>The Minister made a good case&mdash;I think the case that anybody would make in considering this aspect&mdash;for the man permanently disabled.  He took the case of a carpenter who becomes temporarily disabled through losing some of his fingers.  He cannot do carpentry work any more.  That man may have been earning a good <Col N="525" /> wage, but now he is on 90/- a week, and it is a poor prospect for such a man to have to live on 90/- a week for the rest of his life.  That man will say to himself: &ldquo;If I could get a lump sum, I could rehabilitate myself and go into another business and make perhaps as much or nearly as much as I made before.&rdquo;  To that extent, we can make a very good case for giving that man the option of applying to the court and making his case, on which the court may fix a lump sum and say to him: &ldquo;Go ahead; rehabilitate yourself and do the best you can.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That does not apply to temporary disablement at all and there is no case made by the Minister for that.  I think it is going to put an unfair temptation in the way of a man who is six months disabled and who may be all right in a month or two to go to the court to get a lump sum.  It is going to lead to a great deal of litigation. Many of the cases, I suppose, will fail and many may succeed, but the costs of that litigation, taking them all round, will probably outweigh what the workman gets, because obviously, if there are 100 cases over a period which go to court for a lump sum, and some are fixed in a lump sum of a month, some three months, some 12 months, and some none at all, the cost of the litigation will be higher than what the man will get.  Therefore, you are putting a high cost on the employer and the workman is not going to get very much out of it.  The Minister would be well advised to revise that section and, in fact, to leave it out altogether.</P>
    <P>We have in this country a number of judges, but they do not all think and see alike.  I am not sure whether this would be a matter for a jury or not, but, if it does go to a jury, juries also do not think alike, and there is, therefore, an element of a gamble in it, an element of risk.  One man may be luckier than another and get away with his application, while another may be unlucky and fail.  That should be eliminated as far as possible.  It is a very bad principle to bring into a Bill.</P>
    <P>When I brought a motion before the <Col N="526" /> last Dáil for the setting up of a parliamentary committee to consider the future of workmen's compensation&mdash;in passing, I might say that I found it hard to make up my mind whether it should be a Dáil committee or an outside committee, but if the Minister thinks it should be an outside committee, I see no objection&mdash;I had in mind putting to them one point, that is, to have all these cases tried by a special court or tribunal, so that there would be uniform decisions for workmen in all cases and so that a man coming before the tribunal could judge from similar cases in the past whether he was going to succeed or not and would not have to depend on the particular view of a particular judge or on the constitution of a particular jury. If the Minister would try to introduce that principle of a special court or tribunal to deal with all these workmen's compensation cases, he would do a great deal to give fair play all round and would probably reduce existing costs to a great extent.</P>
    <P>With regard to the man who is temporarily injured, I do not think it is a good thing that he should be able, after six months, to go to court and try to get a lump sum.  We all agree that the sooner a man in that position recovers, the better for himself and everybody else, because if he recovers, he goes back to his full wage which is much better for him than any compensation he may get.  We should not do anything to interfere in any way with the progress such a man is making towards recovery.</P>
    <P>The Minister has told the House that, in the 1953 Act which I brought before the Dáil, I tried to remedy what appeared to be an unfair provision in the workmen's compensation code up to that period.  Up to then, if a workman accepted workmen's compensation &mdash;I think it was 50/- a week&mdash;he was precluded from proceeding under the common law.  That was unfair because it was alleged, and there was no reason why the allegation should not be true, that many workmen drew the 50/- per week because they needed it and then found after a few weeks that they were precluded from proceeding under the common law when they would have an <Col N="527" /> opportunity of proving negligence against an employer and getting a bigger amount in compensation than they would otherwise get.</P>
    <P>In the 1953 Act, I tried to remedy that and the Dáil agreed.  What we aimed at was to ensure that a man who was not aware of his rights should not be debarred from proceeding under the common law by reason of the fact that he had accepted workmen's compensation. That is what we intended to have enacted when it was going through the Dáil and Seanad.  That has been challenged in the courts and, as the Minister pointed out, a decision is being awaited from the Supreme Court, and that will take care of this. But the Minister is right, of course, in making the thing perfectly clear, so that there should be no doubt at all left in anybody's mind, in the mind of the court or anywhere else, that what we want to see is that a workman, if he accepts workmen's compensation, and does not know what his rights are, should not be precluded for that reason from going to common law; but Section 11 goes much further than that, in my opinion.</P>
    <P>Now, Section 11 goes this far&mdash;this, I think, is going again to lead to very substantial or very heavy costs&mdash;that a man may go to court, bring his employer to court under the Workmen's Compensation Act, may get an award of an amount of money from the court, and he may then go back, and an ambitious solicitor will hand him over this amount of money and will say to him: &ldquo;If you leave me a couple of hundred pounds I will now try the common law&rdquo; and, as we know, many a workman would be tempted to try common law when he sees that thousands are awarded in cases of this kind, and many a solicitor would be tempted to help him out in fighting that particular case.  There you have that workman, whoever he is, going to the High Court twice, and the High Court is a very dear court to go to.  It costs a lot of money.  I do not think it is necessary.  From the point of view of the workman I do not think it is necessary at all.</P>
    <P>Why could we not arrange&mdash;I am not <Col N="528" /> a lawyer but I know the draftsman could do it if it is put to him&mdash;where a man thinks he has a case under common law, where he certainly has a case under workmen's compensation, that he goes to court and the court decides the issue?  If there is negligence he gets his award under common law and, if there is no negligence, he gets workmen's compensation.  I think you will, at any rate, cut the cost by half, and I think that we should have some regard to the costs arising in these cases because it is coming out of the employer's pocket; it is not going into the workman's pocket; and the thing could be done cheaper in some way or another.  I am putting it to the Minister that he should consider that way of doing it.  I know, from my own experience of things, that sometimes when you put a provision in like that the lawyers say: &ldquo;That is impossible&rdquo; but, very often, when you say to the lawyers: &ldquo;I am going to do it whether it is possible or not&rdquo;, then immediately the lawyers say it is possible; so that if we insist on it, I think it could be done all right.</P>
    <P>There, again, I am coming back to my own pet subject, I would like again to see a special court.  I am not particular whether it is going to be a tribunal or two or three judges, or a mixture of judges and laymen, or whether it is a judge of the High Court specially appointed for these cases, but there should be one judge, anyway, in my opinion, who should try all these cases so that we would have uniform decisions, and every workman would get fair play.</P>
    <P>I think that in time you would see the costs reduced very much under a system of that kind because lawyers generally and employers generally, and of course insurance companies, would get to know what case is likely to succeed, or what case is not likely to succeed, and the number that would go before the tribunal would probably become less and the costs, therefore, would be cut a great deal.</P>
    <P>I do not want to speak on some of the other sections here which deal with other matters.  They can be dealt with better on the Committee Stage.  I think that it would be extremely hard to <Col N="529" /> amend some of the provisions in this Bill on the points I mentioned, but I would like to amend it, and that is why I put down the amendment on the Second Reading to refer it back to a Committee of the Dáil to consider these points, and see if they could not produce a better Bill for consideration.</P>

      <P>I was very interested in Deputy Dr. Ryan's speech, and I followed him as closely as I could.  I think that his survey of the position showed that he has taken an interest in this question, and has delved fairly deeply into it.</P>
      <P>I think Deputy Dr. Ryan is somewhat confused with regard to the legislation which was enacted by himself as Minister for Social Welfare, and by his predecessor when the Workmen's Compensation Act of 1934 was enacted.  So far as I can see&mdash;I would be glad if the Minister would correct me if I am wrong&mdash;Section 11 of the present Bill is merely intended to operate in the way in which Section 6 of the 1953 Act, passed under the guidance of Deputy Dr. Ryan, as Minister for Social Welfare, was intended to operate.  Deputy Dr. Ryan seemed to think that there was something very much more in Section 11 of the present Bill, that it had gone a lot further than Section 6 of his own Act.</P>

      <P>I would like to be clear on this point.  If a man went to court under the Workmen's Compensation Act, obviously he should know of his rights, because his lawyers would advise him, and that would make it impossible to go a second time.  That is the point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that is what was done under the 1953 Act.  The reason I raise this is because Deputy Dr. Ryan, in the course of his remarks, said that what was intended by the 1953 Act was to ensure that a workman, who was ignorant of his rights, would not be penalised as would a workman who has accepted compensation for two or three weeks, and who then finds that he is precluded from taking common law action for damages.  I merely want to make this point for what it is worth: there <Col N="530" /> is nothing at all in the 1953 Act which makes a workman's rights dependent on whether or not he was ignorant of the position.  I do not think there is any very great extension in Section 11 of the present Bill; I think the Minister has set out to cure a defect which appeared, or which, by judicial decision, was made to appear, in the 1953 Act.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dr. Ryan made another suggestion with regard to a workman having the right to have his claim for damages at common law determined by a court in the event of failure on that score&mdash;that he should have his right to compensation.  That was enacted about 20 years ago in the 1934 Act.  In Section 60 of the Act I think the precise provision which Deputy Dr. Ryan has in mind will be found.</P>
      <P>I do not think it is entirely correct to look on workmen's compensation legislation as forming part of our social code.  It is social legislation, and I think it is social legislation of the better type.  It is incorrect&mdash;it is not fully correct in any event&mdash;to consider it as forming part of our social welfare legislation for the reason Deputy Dr. Ryan pointed out.  Under the workmen's compensation code, the State plays no part at all other than the enactment of the legislation.</P>
      <P>The State does not contribute one penny piece towards the benefits which it requires the employer by the legislation to give to the injured workman. The State plays no part in this workmen's compensation code at all other than the passing of legislation through this House.  To that extent I say it is wrong to consider workmen's compensation legislation as part of social welfare legislation.  The workmen's compensation code was established away back in 1897 or so, before quite a lot of our present-day social welfare legislation was even thought of and before most of the benefits which are now expected, and rightly expected, were incorporated in legislation in this or any other country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The State does not contribute anything towards the cost of this legislation. Neither does it play any part &mdash;other than through the ordinary <Col N="531" /> courts of the land&mdash;in the administration of the workmen's compensation code.  I think it is essential for Deputies in considering the workmen's compensation code and workmen's compensation legislation to keep before them the fact that there is a very real distinction in the work they do in legislating under the workmen's compensation code and the work they do in legislating under the social welfare code proper.  In the latter case the State is called upon to make some direct contribution to the benefits, possibly to pay 100 per cent.  of the contribution and the money required for the particular benefits has to be paid by taxation levied by the State or else by the contribution partly of the State, partly of the employer and partly of the workman.  That does not operate here at all.</P>
    <P>There are three parties to be considered. The State does, of course, come into it and comes into it in a very material way in so far as the State has the responsibility for passing the legislation in order to protect, as best it can, the interests of the weaker section of the community and those who require the protection of the State.  The State comes into it in that way but, apart from that, the principal parties to be considered are the employer on the one hand and the employee on the other.</P>
    <P>The employer is the person who must foot the bill.  He is the person who must pay for the legislation we are enacting and which we have enacted in the past under the workmen's compensation code.  Thirdly, you have the injured workman and his dependents. The injured workman is the person who has not got any wealth or any hidden resources to fall back on when he is injured or contracts some illness arising out of his employment.  Such a person, I think, is entitled to the very special consideration of the State.</P>
    <P>For my part I am glad of the fact that the Minister for Social Welfare dealt with this Bill in the particular manner in which he did.  I do not agree 100 per cent. with the case he has made for the Bill.  I think the Bill is open <Col N="532" /> to criticism.  I hope that the manner in which the Minister introduced it was intended to indicate, as it seemed to me to indicate, he was going to be serious about listening to the views of Deputies on the Bill and considering any reasonable suggestions made by Deputies by way of amendment.  I thought it was a very reasonable frame of mind in which to introduce legislation of this sort.</P>
    <P>I have no objection at all to the proposal to increase the workmen's compensation benefit.  I understand a number of people feel that the Minister is going too far and that the increase of the compensation from 50/- to 90/-may result in very heavy increases in insurance premiums, etc.  Deputy Dr. Ryan indicated that that was his view.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed in Deputy Dr. Ryan's speech to this extent.  Although he spoke for 50 minutes, I think, he did not indicate either his own attitude or the attitude of the Party he leads on questions such as this.  He did not indicate their views firmly as to whether they supported or opposed the Bill.  He indicated that a particular section of it was going to meet with his strong opposition but, by and large, he did not indicate whether he was for or against it.</P>
    <P>I want to define my attitude by saying that, as an individual Deputy, I am in favour of this legislation but I believe that there are some dangers in the Bill presented to us by the Minister. With a careful examination and more detailed study of the position, the Minister may agree that these dangers are there and that adequate safeguards can be put into the Bill.</P>
    <P>I believe that the principal dangers lie in Section 8 of the Bill which introduces an entirely new principle.  I do not think that Deputy Dr. Ryan was correct in saying that Section 8, subsection (3) was a new principle to the extent that it did not operate before even in the case of employers.  If he consults the 1934 Act he will find the employer had the rights of redemption after a six-months' period even in the case of non-permanent incapacity but the whole of Section 8 is a new principle in that it gives the workman for the first time an absolute right of <Col N="533" /> redemption subject only to control of the court, and certainly an absolute right to seek for redemption of weekly compensation.  That right under the present proposal is to exist not only in cases of total incapacity or of permanent incapacity but even in cases of non-permanent incapacity.</P>
    <P>My fear in relation to this section does not arise out of any concern for insurance companies.  My fear is in relation to the person who is not insured against workmen's compensation risk.  I do not believe&mdash;I may be wrong in this&mdash;that the protection of the section for such persons is adequate to ensure that very great hardship may not result to an uninsured employer.</P>
    <P>I think the House must have regard to the fact that very often, if not invariably, the employer who is required to pay workmen's compensation is entirely blameless.  His only crime is that he gives employment.  He has not been negligent.  He may in many cases have actually forbidden the workman to do the particular thing which gives rise to the accident.  Even under the 1934 Act, a workman was entitled to be compensated if the injury was serious, or his dependents if the injury was fatal, even in cases where the injury resulted because of his own wilful default or negligence, even in cases where the injury resulted from his disobedience of orders of the employer or because he acted in contravention of statutory enactments or regulations.  In such cases he is entitled, under the workmen's compensation code, to get his compensation.</P>
    <P>I am not saying that that should not be so.  I merely want to emphasise the fact that there are cases where the employer actually forbids his workman to do a particular thing and if the workman, in disobedience of the employer's orders, does what he is told not to do and an accident results, the employer is, nevertheless, called upon to pay compensation.  So that in most cases you will find that the employer is quite blameless.  If he was not blameless, if there was any possibility of sustaining an action for <Col N="534" /> negligence against him, I think I am correct in saying that, up to this, most employees who had sustained injury by accident, if there was any degree of negligence on the part of the employer, would have preferred to go ahead with a common law action for negligence and had, of course, a perfect right to do so.</P>
    <P>The reason the employee accepted workmen's compensation in most cases, to my mind, was that there was no possibility of sustaining an action for negligence and that there was no culpability, no blame whatever, attaching to the employer.</P>
    <P>I am not entirely satisfied that Section 8 holds the scale evenly between the blameless employer on the one hand and the blameworthy employee on the other.  I think there should be some distinction between the employee who meets with an accident in a perfectly innocent way, through sheer bad luck or misfortune, and the employee who meets with an accident through his own wilful default, through his own disobedience of orders given by the employer.  When a workman is being given what is a very valuable right and is a completely new principle being introduced into the legislation, the time has come for the Minister to consider whether or not the same rights and privileges should attach to a workman who has been injured through acting in disobedience of the instructions of the employer or through breaking statutory or other regulations which were made possibly for his own protection.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that in such cases the workman's right to redemption should not be allowed except with the concurrence of the employer.  You will, in many cases, find employers who are perfectly willing, irrespective of how the accident originated, that the weekly compensation should be redeemed either on their own application or on the application of the employee.</P>
    <P>I would like also to suggest to the Minister in relation to Section 8 that, as a completely new principle is being introduced into the workmen's compensation code, it would be only proper that an appeal should lie from the <Col N="535" /> Circuit Court to the High Court in relation to decisions under Section 8 of the Bill and that he should consider amending Section 36, I think it is, of the 1934 Act in order to provide for that.</P>
    <P>I said earlier that I was concerned as to the position of the uninsured employer under Section 8 of the Bill. Section 8 provides that, where the employer so requests, the court may take the employer's circumstances into account.  It is proposed to enact that the court shall have a discretion to grant or refuse an application under this section, that is, an application by the employee for redemption of his weekly payments, and that in exercising that discretion the court shall have regard to the nature of the workman's injury, his reasons for making the application and, where the employer so requests, the employer's circumstances.</P>
    <P>I do not think that goes far enough in the case of an employer who is not insured.  We have to recognise that there is a difference, and maybe a very important difference, between the employer, particularly the small employer, who is not insured, and the employer who is covered against workmen's compensation risk.  I would suggest to the Minister that he might consider even going as far as enacting in this legislation that, except, again, with the concurrence of the employer, no order shall be made under that particular section where it is proved to the satisfaction of the court that the employer is not indemnified against workmen's compensation risk in respect of the particular employee who is injured.</P>
    <P>It may be that the Minister intends that this Bill should be a step towards making workmen's compensation insurance compulsory.  Taken by an large, without having considered the matter very deeply, I would not be against compulsory workmen's compensation. Nowadays, any employer who refrains from covering himself against workmen's compensation risk is exceedingly foolish but it is not enough to hold that view and, by legislation, endeavour to influence matters so that <Col N="536" /> most employers will take out work men's compensation insurance unless something is done also to ensure that insurance companies will carry workmen's compensation risk and will carry that risk at some kind of reasonable premium.</P>
    <P>I understand the position to be that, in relation to certain occupations in any event, a number of companies will not accept workmen's compensation cover.  You cannot, on the one hand, endeavour to force compulsory insurance on employers unless, on the other hand, you are prepared to take some action to ensure that that cover will be readily available to employers.</P>
    <P>I have no objection to having that cover made compulsory provided the facilities are there for the employers. I think the time has probably come, and it will have to be faced up to sooner or later by this House, when a decision has to be made as to whether or not workmen's compensation benefits should not come in whole hog into the social welfare legislation and be carried, so to speak, on the stamps in the same way as sickness benefits, unemployment benefits and so on are operated, and I think&mdash;possibly the Minister has gone into this matter already&mdash;that it would be desirable and worth while having a very thorough examination of the position to see whether or not that should be done.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that he was thinking of setting up a committee.  I take it that will be one of the questions which would go for exploration to that committee.  The Minister made clear the principle on which he operated when deleting the provisions for dependents' allowances and as he said, there is no distinction in the present Bill between the amounts of compensation which will be paid to the single man on the one hand, and to the married man on the other hand.</P>
    <P>At first sight that does not seem to be desirable; at first sight it would seem that Deputy Dr. Ryan's point of view that some special consideration should be given to the married man is the correct one, but I certainly am very much influenced by the argument <Col N="537" /> made by the Minister, which I think is a reasonable argument, namely, that if there is too great a distinction between the benefits paid to the married man and the unmarried man the result may be to drive employers, particularly those who carry their own insurance, to seeking single men for whatever vacancies they have rather than to encourage them to employ the married man with a family.</P>
    <P>That is a danger which obviously must be present and the Minister apparently has decided that it can best be offset by abolishing distinction between married and unmarried men. As I say, I accept that although it does not at first sight seem reasonable to abolish the distinction.  I hope the Minister will give very full consideration, particularly to Section 8 of the Bill, between this and Committee Stage.  I hope he will find himself in a position to do something to offset the danger of increases in insurance premiums.  I quite frankly admit that I do not know what the position is as to whether or not there would be justification for insurance companies raising their premiums if this legislation is passed.  I hope the Minister&mdash;and I am sure he has&mdash;has given careful consideration to that aspect because many people would have difficulty in paying increased premiums if the increases were in any way large.</P>
    <P>I do not think any Deputy in the House will grudge the Minister's effort to give further assistance to those people who are in good jobs and who, unfortunately, through injury find themselves and their dependents, possibly for long periods, without the usual income to which they have become accustomed.  I think most Deputies will agree with me when I wish the Minister well in the effort he is making on behalf of those people. For my part, as I say, I am glad the Minister has approached this Bill in the way he has and I hope he will give serious consideration to the suggestions of Deputies in relation to the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. J. Larkin Mr. J. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Normally there would not be very much to say on this Bill <Col N="538" /> from the point of view of the Labour Party and of the trade unions except, perhaps, that we welcome the Bill and that we feel it is overdue and that it could have been before the House last year.  While there are certain aspects with regard to workmen's compensation which do come to mind, I think we can agree with Deputy Dr. Ryan that it is the human needs involved that we are mostly concerned with and I should like to point out that such delay as has arisen in bringing this measure before the House has meant that many injured workmen have had to continue on the old rates of benefits when the matter could quite readily have been remedied had the measure been brought before the House earlier.</P>
      <P>I should like to say that the main objectives of the Bill do not require much discussion.  Similarly, much of what we would have been inclined to say on a Workmen's Compensation Bill has been rendered largely unnecessary because of the Minister's indicated proposal to submit the whole workmen's compensation code to a Special Committee, and, therefore, the opportunity of submitting the code as a whole to a more minute examination in the House will be available later.  I want to make only some general remarks in regard to the Bill itself and to comment on some of Deputy Dr. Ryan's remarks where they concern the main provisions of the Bill.  As to the amounts of weekly payments there is very little we can say from these benches because the amounts embodied in the Bill are what we originally sought in a private Bill in 1953 and I think it is not unfair to say that because we did present that private Bill at that time we were the means of inducing some activity on the part of Deputy Dr. Ryan who was then Minister for Social Welfare.  However, our view as to the figure of weekly payments to be aimed at was not accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision in the Bill with regard to the lack of distinction between single and married workmen I should like to leave until later.  In so far as the other main sections of the Bill are concerned, I should like to point out that in Section 8 the principle the Minister <Col N="539" /> seeks to adopt, namely to provide equality as between the injured workman and the employer in respect of opportunities to seek to have weekly payments remitted by lump sum agreements, is on the face of it one that could be argued against, and while there may be, on Committee Stage, various points of view expressed on amendments which may be submitted it must be borne in mind that in seeking to deal with the present situation, which has been the subject of continuous complaints by working people over the years, the Minister, in framing this section, has met with certain difficulties and members of the House may seek to amend that section to conform with certain conditions which they might think desirable.  It should be borne in mind that the need for certain provisions to deal with the present situation is one that has been brought about by the insurance companies themselves.</P>
    <P>The problem that those of us in the trade union movement always had to face was that when a workman met with an injury and received his normal weekly payments, if he was a married man with a family, we very quickly discovered after a short lapse of time that it was not the merits of his case that were going to determine whether or not he should settle for a lump sum; it was the economic pressure exerted on himself and his family, through actual distress from being compelled to try to exist on a weekly income far below what he normally received in respect of wages.  That, in itself, would be a bad enough problem but when, as we frequently had, undue, unfair and deliberate advantage being taken by insurance companies in an effort to use economic pressure to compel a workman to seek or accept settlement of a lump sum far below what he would rightfully be entitled to, then we reach the position when some step must be taken to remedy that situation.</P>
    <P>I recollect one case of a man meeting with an injury which incapacitated him for life when he was in a large public undertaking.  I recall that man being kept for nine years living on a sum of <Col N="540" /> 35/- per week and, during those nine years, trying to rear a family of six children and maintain his wife and himself on that miserable pittance.  At the end of nine years the case was settled for a lump sum.  By that time the man, through some peculiar miracle or other, had succeeded in rearing his children; in some cases he had succeeded in finding employment for them; in most cases, he had succeeded in completing their somewhat limited education; and the heavy burden that he had had to bear for those nine years had been alleviated somewhat. At that point an opportunity of settling for a lump sum was given to him.  When he received his lump sum and paid his debts he was left with exactly 60 to maintain him for the rest of his life.  He was at that time 45 years of age.</P>
    <P>That is the outrageous kind of case which has called for the Minister's attention in framing this particular section.  Whatever may be the faults of the section, the arguments that may be made against it on the Committee Stage or represented in amendments, it should be borne in mind that this section has been occasioned by the treatment accorded to injured workmen over many years, and the Minister is, I think, trying to remedy that situation now.  It may well be that it will require the common wisdom of both sides of the House to try to do that in such a way as to do justice to the injured workman and, at the same time, not give rise to fresh and difficult problems.</P>
    <P>So far as Section 11 is concerned, I think the best thing the Minister can do is withdraw that section altogether. I think it is an outrage and a disgrace. First of all, Deputy Dr. Ryan, when he was Minister, sought with the best of intentions to remedy this problem of the right of election.  No doubt he had the advice of his legal advisers in the Department and of the draftsman; and, in all good faith and with the support of the House, the original Act was amended and a section was put into the 1953 Act.  Advantage was then taken of that section by those concerned.  Subsequently the courts <Col N="541" /> took a different view and we now have this further attempt to correct the position.</P>
    <P>There is nothing wrong in that.  We recognise quite well that the view taken by the court may be somewhat different from what this House anticipated. But it does seem somewhat remarkable that, having had the advice of the legal experts and the draftsman and having found that the drafting in the 1953 Act was weak and open to different interpretations which are now creating difficulty in regard to this right of election, we should now get this rather peculiar formula in sub-section (4) of Section 11 which, in effect, says that if the legal advisers and the draftsman did make a mistake, this House is now going to go on record as saying that they did not make any mistake and what was originally intended by this House in 1953 was, in fact, carried out by the draftsman in the 1953 Act.</P>
    <P>I think that is going too far.  I understand from members of the legal profession that if this section is left as it is&mdash;it is a most complicated form of draftsmanship&mdash;it will give rise possibly to further difficulties and I gather there is a general preference, in order to simplify the position, for the repealing of the entire section in the 1953 Act and the substitution of a new, simple and straightforward section rather than try now, by this retrospective legislation, to correct a position we thought we had corrected in 1953 or to cover up mistakes on the part of those who are supposed to guide us in these technically legal matters.</P>
    <P>There are naturally a number of matters we will require to raise on the Committee Stage, but they can well be left until then since they are more appropriate to that stage.  The bigger issues of principle that would normally arise in a discussion here on workmen's compensation can well be left over until a Special Committee has had an opportunity of considering the whole code.  I would, however, like to touch on one or two points raised by Deputy Dr. Dyan.  First of all, I would like to deal with his suggestion that the Second Reading of the Bill might <Col N="542" /> be deferred for a period of three months to allow a Committee of the House to consider the matter in relation to its effect on employment and prices.</P>
    <P>Might I say, with all due respect to Deputy Dr. Ryan, that if that is his motion it certainly was not the argument he made here to-day?  In fact one might be well inclined to take the view from his argument here to-day anyway that the sole purpose of his motion is merely to secure delay for the sake of delay.  He ended by urging the House to consider his motion because, he said, in the light of certain factors he advanced, it might well be found possible for the Committee to bring in a better Bill.  There are no such terms of reference in his motion so far as the Committee is concerned.  The duty he proposes to impose on that Committee is not to draft a new Bill but merely to consider the existing Bill in the light of its possible effect upon employment and prices.</P>
    <P>While Deputy Dr. Ryan in his contribution did touch, somewhat briefly, upon the question of employment and prices&mdash;and, no doubt, the Special Committee could give further thought to that&mdash;when the report of the Special Committee ultimately comes before the House, it will be on the basis of the present Bill and we will be faced with exactly the same task, as we now have, of dealing with this Bill on its merits and in the light of such knowledge as the Committee might place before us with regard to its effect on employment and prices.</P>
    <P>Now, I have no doubt that members on both sides of this House can readily acquire information just as factual as that which a Special Committee could acquire; or they can exercise their imaginations, if they wish, as to what would be the effect on employment and prices of the Bill now proposed by the Minister.  I think we might well look at the Bill from the point of view of the injured workman for a change.</P>
    <P>First of all, Deputy Dr. Ryan raises the question as to what should be the basis of approach in reckoning the reasonable amount of weekly payment to a workman who meets with an <Col N="543" /> accident in the course of his employment; and he stresses that, in his opinion, the qualifying factor should be &ldquo;need&rdquo;.  Of course Deputy Dr. Ryan never followed that principle when he was Minister for Social Welfare, but it suits him now to change the argument because it provides a convenient peg on which to hang an argument against the flat-rate payment of 90/- per week to a workman irrespective of his connubial state in favour of what he would get under the 1953 Act.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Ryan is quite well aware that since the Workmen's Compensation Act was passed nearly 60 years ago, at no time and under no circumstances was the need of the injured workman taken into consideration. The basis of the entire code is compensation for loss of earning capacity, a very cold-blooded, cash transaction.  If it was need, will Deputy Dr. Ryan now suggest that on the basis of measuring need, the need of a workman was adequately met when in the 1934 Act the weekly payment was fixed at a maximum of 35/- per week for both single and married men, and for a married man with a wife and possibly ten or 12 children, by his own Government and by the Minister in his own Government who piloted that piece of legislation through this House?</P>
    <P>It is all very well to suit the argument to the particular purpose, but all of us can do that, and we are quite well aware that when in 1953 the Labour Party introduced a Private Bill embodying the present figure of 90/-, and the then Minister, Deputy Dr. Ryan, decided suddenly to introduce the new principle of allowances for dependents, the wives and the children, it was not merely from the point of view of meeting a particular need of the married man, but it was a very convenient argument against giving any increase to the single man.  That was one of the main factors that induced the Labour Party of that time to take exception to his approach.  If Deputy Dr. Ryan and the Fianna Fáil Party want to deal with this matter on the basis of need and apart entirely from the basis of compensation for loss of earning capacity, I have no great <Col N="544" /> difference of opinion with them on that.  I think we should also have regard to human need.  It is very simple to meet it.  Let the Fianna Fáil Party agree to accept the present figure of 90/- suggested by the Minister and put forward on the Committee Stage an amendment to pay in addition to the 90/-, dependents' allowances to the wives and to the children.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Fair enough.  So far as the Labour Party are concerned we have no objection at all to getting as much as we can for the injured workman within reason.  I recognise there may be difficulties from the point of view of the Minister for Social Welfare, whether Deputy Dr. Ryan or Deputy Corish, in trying to hold the balance between the principle applicable in respect to the code of social welfare and the code of workmen's compensation and it may vary from one side to the other.  Possibly if there is a Special Committee and when there is an opportunity to go into the whole matter we may get a different approach, but up to the moment, the whole basis of the code and the whole basis of compensation for employees under the code is this principle of loss of earning capacity and that is why there is considerable argument in favour of maintaining the principle in relation to injured workmen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is the other factor that if we are dealing with the compensation code and not a social welfare code in which compensation is to be provided for loss of earning capacity, it should be borne in mind that the wage structure in this country and in other countries is not based on need.  There is no distinction made in the main systems of wage structures in this country as between the single man, the married man and married man with dependents.  It is purely a question of relating the rate of wages to the particular job of work, the capacity of the worker or responsibility or skill, or to put it probably more brutally, to the amount for which the workman can be got to go to work depending on whether he is in a position <Col N="545" /> to protect himself by a trade union organisation or otherwise.</P>
    <P>If, therefore, the basis of the system of wages has no regard to human needs or the conjugal state or the dependents of workmen and the code that has been administered and which up to the moment at least was very admirably supported by Deputy Dr. Ryan when he was Minister is to be continued on that basis, there is every argument for suggesting that whatever the rate of weekly payment is to be, even if it is to be sufficient to meet the need of the married man with dependents, the amount payable to the single man should be equally high because it is compensation for loss of earning capacity.</P>
    <P>On the actual figure of 90/- itself, I do not think there is much argument to be made against it at the moment. In the light of the changes that have taken place in the cost of living since pre-war it is well justified by direct mathematical calculation that the old figure of 35/- would require to be raised beyond 80/- at the moment but to the extent that for many years it was felt that the level of weekly payments in regard to average wages was low, I think the time has certainly come when that might be corrected, and that further justifies fixing the maximum now at a figure of 90/-.</P>
    <P>Both Deputy Dr. Ryan and Deputy O'Higgins are somewhat fearful as to the effect of the amendments proposed in the Bill on the employers in regard to their costs and the possible effects on employment, and particularly on this whole problem so beloved especially by members of the legal profession&mdash;the employer who is not insured.  With all due respect to Deputy O'Higgins, it may be quite easy to make a case as between, as he says, the blameless and the blameworthy worker, but it is not as simple as that because the employer who does not go to the trouble, either through cupidity or stupidity, in securing for himself insurance cover in respect of employer's liability, does not employ merely the blameworthy worker&mdash;he also employs the blameless worker. We know from experience the blameless worker can, entirely through no <Col N="546" /> fault of his own, while observing all due caution and paying proper respect to statutory regulations in regard to safety and so on, meet with an accident and he is in exactly the same difficult position if it then turns out that his employer has neglected to take the elementary precaution of ensuring insurance cover against such a risk.</P>
    <P>We are too much inclined to be concerned with the apparently simpleminded employer who fails to take out that insurance and then is unfortunate enough to employ some stupid oaf of a worker who deliberately puts his hand in a machine or steps into something or finds some other foolish way of laying himself up and reducing his earning capacity.  Naturally all our hearts bleed for the poor simple employer who finds himself in that position. I suggest that we should look at the other side of the picture and take the poor simple worker who goes to work for an employer believing he is reasonably covered under the compensation code against the effects of an accident which he may sustain at work, meets with that accident and maybe is crippled for life and then discovers that there is no remedy available for him because his employer is not covered by insurance and no recovery can be made against him.</P>
    <P>We have had too many of those cases to allow that type of argument to influence to any degree our opinion as to the merits or otherwise of such proposals as are embodied in the present Bill.  In that connection it might well be pointed out that while it can be argued that the insurance companies do exercise discrimination in regard to those whom they will accept as policyholders under employers' liability insurance, that could be remedied much more simply than by trying to adjust the legislation to deal with cases of employers who will not take out insurance. We employ the compulsory requirement that drivers of motor-cars on the highway should carry insurance, and in the trade unions on many occasions we have found it necessary to make it a condition prior to the acceptance of employment by our members in certain trades that a policy of insurance will be produced by the employer <Col N="547" /> before we would allow our member to go to work because of the painful experience both the trade unions and their members have had as a result of this failure on the part of individual employers.</P>
    <P>There has also been some fear expressed in regard to the consequences of the cost of operating this measure. I think there is one aspect of this to which we should have regard and which makes it somewhat different from, say, damages under common law.  It is quite clear that accidents to people engaged in industry are a characteristic of industry itself and that men meet with accidents in the course of their employment not solely because of their own negligence or the negligence of a fellow workman or some other purely accidental cause, but because they are working in industry.  That is proven by the fact that the incidence of accidents changes with the character of the particular industry and that is also reflected in the rates charged by the insurance companies for insurance cover for workmen in various occupations.</P>
    <P>To that extent we should look upon workmen's compensation as being part of the normal charges that not the individual employer has to meet, but that industry has to meet in order that it would be carried on and in the same way as industry has to meet other charges that arise because of the fact that any industrial activity is being discharged.  It cannot be avoided unless we take the other view of regarding protection for the injured workman as being placed on a broader social base than hitherto we have done when we have dealt with it purely on the narrow basis of occupation.</P>
    <P>Again, changes of that sort may give rise to certain difficulties because if we are going to deal with the claims of injured workmen purely on the basis suggested by Deputy Dr. Ryan, that sickness or illness, whether it is occasioned by an injury in employment or by ordinary natural sickness or by an accident outside of employment, creates the same need and should be measured in respect of sustenance by the same measuring rod, we do come <Col N="548" /> up against this other factor.  I doubt if anybody in this House believes that the need of a sick workman is measured at the moment by the sum of 24/-per week.  I doubt if Deputy Dr. Ryan believed it when he was introducing his Social Welfare Bill and establishing those rates.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Ryan, in the same way as a Minister of any Government or any Party, had, when he was Minister, to adjust his possibilities of meeting that need by the over-all position in regard to the national economy, the available financial resources and other calls upon the Exchequer.  Therefore, under the social welfare code, the payment to be made is not regulated by the need, but merely by the possibility of meeting that need to some limited extent.  The very fact that the average workman requires his full wages to maintain himself and his family shows that that is generally the measure of his need.  Usually when he is sick his needs increase because of additional expenses.  Therefore, there should be very little cause to support the idea that something less than full wages will meet his needs from the point of view of sickness or illness whether they arise as a result of an injury at work or through ordinary physical causes.</P>
    <P>In so far as injuries sustained in the course of employment are concerned, I think it could be well argued&mdash;whether it will be accepted is another matter&mdash; they they should be treated as part of the general overhead costs of industry. To the extent that industries in general cannot hope to be carried on with the complete elimination of all risk and all possibilities of injuries to workmen, adjusted as they are to the nature of the particular industry, those injuries should be regarded as a charge on that industry.  Whether we do as we do at the moment, place that charge against the individual employer or the individual employing company or whether we spread it in some other form, it should be regarded as related to industry rather than related to the general question of social need and the social and communal commitments we all bear in regard to relieving members <Col N="549" /> of the community as a whole who find themselves facing natural or social or economic difficulties from time to time.</P>
    <P>On the question of the possibility of increased costs, I have no particular information, but it does seem to me from what has happened previously and from general knowledge I have that a considerable part of the increased costs that may arise through the passing of this present Bill could very considerably be borne by the insurance companies themselves.  It is well known that out of the total premiums they collect in providing this form of insurance cover a very large percentage is absorbed in management costs and that the actual amount returned in the form of payment of claims bears a very small ratio to the total amount collected. It may well be that a review of the question of costs from that aspect may make it possible to limit the increase.  Also we can have recourse to the steps that were taken in the case of private motor insurance of requesting the Prices Advisory Body to have a look at this particular problem of the cost imposed upon industry and upon employers by their having to insure with private insurance companies.</P>
    <P>As Deputy O'Higgins says, if we pass legislation requiring employers to carry certain obligations in regard to their workmen who meet with injuries then we should also, as far as reasonably possible, protect those employers against undue exploitation by commercial interests who would take advantage of a situation we have built up by the passing of such legislation. Nobody wants to be unfair to employers either individually or collectively in this regard.  It is merely suggested that those who are carrying on industry and who have to apportion their charges to meet the costs of production would be required to take into consideration the fact that one of the costs they must meet is the risk of injury to their workmen.  Having passed this legislation, we would not wish to cause them to be exploited by commercial interests.  From that point of view the Minister might consider <Col N="550" /> the possibility of keeping a close eye on any suggestions of very considerably increased premiums following the passing of the present Bill and if he is dissatisfied with what he finds he might well have recourse to the Prices Advisory Body which dealt in a very salutary manner with the question of motor insurance premiums previously.</P>
    <P>On the whole, I think the Minister is to be congratulated on what he has done in regard to this Bill.  It may require more careful consideration on the Committee Stage.  I think it will also prove helpful and enlightening to us all, to both employers and workmen and others in public life and those of us engaged in trade unions, if through the medium of the Special Committee he has in mind we now have an opportunity of examining not merely the merits or demerits of the workmen's compensation code but its working for the period of some 60 years since it was originally inaugurated.  As it is now, we cannot through our own legislation substitute a more acceptable approach to this problem than we have inherited from the British Parliament and which over the years imposed on so many Irish workmen an experience of privation and suffering and very often early death, because the code was not satisfactory or suited to meet their particular needs.</P>
    <P>I feel the House will not accept Deputy Dr. Ryan's motion.  The argument he put forward was not a strong one and the urgent needs of injured workers for an increase in their present amounts weekly would outweigh any argument he has made for a delay of three months.  Whatever could be done by a Special Committee can be done in the course of the debate; and the major problem of the code as a whole can go before the Special Committee envisaged by the Minister.  I see no cause for a further delay of three months, which would put this off until well into the Autumn Session of the Dáil, thereby requiring injured workmen to wait another six or nine months before they get the aid and relief they are entitled to expect from a Parliament which on a previous occasion, in regard to injured men, expressed the point of view that the <Col N="551" /> injured workman should take his full wages when he went out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised at the approach of Deputy Larkin&mdash;I assume, on behalf of his Party.  I expected his approach would be that workmen's compensation should be abolished altogether and included in some scheme of social welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. J. Larkin Mr. J. Larkin">

      <P>I am looking for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>That is done elsewhere and I am surprised he did not advocate it.  I recollect that the present Tánaiste, Deputy Norton, told the House some years ago that a scheme would be brought in to embody workmen's compensation as part of a comprehensive social welfare scheme. If that is the ultimate intention, it is a matter of some importance, as to the principles on which we are to approach this whole question.</P>
      <P>Anyone who is used to dealing with migratory workers is used to the position in England, where there is no workmen's compensation but a system of paying an injured workman a certain amount for six months and after that assessing his disability as partial or limited and paying him a type of pension.  They assess whether his disability is 5, 10, 12 or 25 per cent. and allocate him a social welfare pension in accordance with that disability.  In contemplating their comprehensive scheme, undoubtedly they had to take into consideration certain fundamental principles.  We, here, are heading in that way.  There are certain fundamental principles that we have to consider and some of them we have to consider in connection with some of the sections of the measure before us now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For instance, under Section 8 there is a completely new principle coming into play here&mdash;as I hope to convince both the Minister and House in a few moments.  Even on the question of social principle, I want to point out that we are departing from a principle that has been in practice in State Departments here since the foundation of the State, that is, that they resist <Col N="552" /> paying their own workmen injured in State service a lump sum in redemption of the weekly payment.  I can give several instances&mdash;including that of one particular man whose case fits into the analogy the Minister himself purported to give in his opening speech.  This man is a carpenter named Sumerville from the village of Cong, whose finger was taken off in a sawmill accident there many, many years ago.</P>
    <P>Time and again I approached the Department of Lands about that man's weekly payment, but they always refused to pay him a lump sum, over the last 12 or 15 years, on the social principle, they say, that there was a danger he might dissipate the lump sum, whereas if he were kept on a weekly sum it would be there for all time as a pension and his dependents would be provided for as he would have this weekly payment all his life.  I was informed that that was the principle with all State employees&mdash;and I have no reason to question the civil servants who so informed me&mdash;that the State would not pay a lump sum for this reason, it being argued with me and alleged by them to me as the social aspect of the matter, that it was better and safer to let the weekly payment continue than to take the risk of paying a man a lump sum in redemption, which he might dissipate or squander to the detriment of his dependents.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy mind my asking this, for the purpose of getting some information&mdash;did the Deputy himself believe in that particular case that the weekly payment ought to be redeemed?  Maybe it is not a fair question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I will answer that.  I argued with the Department&mdash;and, as far as my recollection goes, I raised the matter here&mdash;that when insurance companies would redeem in cases of this kind they should in fact, but I was met with the answer of the Department which I am now giving to the Minister.  I was also informed that that was the practice in regard to all State employees in this country.  I have given the reference and the Minister can get that man's file from his <Col N="553" /> colleague the Minister for Lands and he will see that that has been the attitude taken not only over a year or two but over a long number of years. I am giving just one instance, but I am sure there are many other cases on the State books of injured workmen with the very same story.</P>
      <P>Under Section 8 we are proposing to depart from that principle.  Before I finish with the question of principles, there is another point.  Perhaps I am misreading it.  Sub-section (1) of Section 8 says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where any weekly payment... to a workman, whose incapacity is permanent, has been continued for not less than six months...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It says &ldquo;whose incapacity is permanent&rdquo;; it does not state whether the incapacity is total or partial permanent incapacity.  Besides total permanent incapacity you may have partial permanent incapacity just as in the instance I gave of the workman in England who qualifies for a permanent disability pension, under their social system, of 10/- or 15/- a week, according to his partial permanent incapacity.  If you take a man who loses two or three fingers, he will have permanent incapacity but it will be partial and not total.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To judge by sub-section (1) of the section, I do not know whether it is contemplated that what we would be dealing with there is total permanent incapacity or permanent partial incapacity.  Assuming, as I gathered from his speech, that the Minister means total permanent incapacity, then we come to the question of giving him the right to redeem. My colleague, Deputy Dr. Ryan, said he thought it was fair enough that when the employer had the right to redeem, in a case of total permanent incapacity, the workman should equally have that right.  I think there are certain aspects that may have escaped the notice of Deputy Dr. Ryan. In the first place, we have to realise that we are dealing with retrospective legislation under this section and, in dealing with retrospective legislation instead of prospective legislation, we must be quite clear what the impact of <Col N="554" /> the law will be.  There are certain classes of industries that this may affect in a very serious way.</P>
    <P>Deputies have been talking here about the type of people who insure and the type of people who do not insure.  So far as I am aware, the vast majority of employers, as a matter of common good sense, insure.  In my experience, the only classes who do not insure are (1) small farmers who can only afford possibly a casual workman for three or four months of the year or during a busy season.  The small farmer does not insure because he can badly afford the workman, not to talk of insurance.  The second class of persons who do not insure are connected with the type of industry where it does not pay to insure.  I am talking now of the type of industry where, by virtue of the work carried out, the insurance rates are so prohibitive that it would pay them to carry their own risk.  However, the vast majority of employers in between insure as a matter of good business.  When this Bill becomes law, every employer will insure if he can get insurance.  There is no use in discussing compulsory insurance&mdash;we have not got it and it is not proposed under this Bill&mdash;if the position will be that insurance companies will not cover the risk.</P>
    <P>There is one particular branch of industry that I will deal with in a few moments in respect of which insurance companies will not cover the risk: I refer to the mining industry.  I know that in one particular instance, at all events, for the risks under this Bill, a quotation of 21 per cent. of the wage bill has been given.  That position would be impossible.  It would mean the closing-down of the industry.  It would mean an increase in the price of coal such as to put that particular class of coal out of competition on the markets where it now sells.  I want the Minister to appreciate, with regard to this right of redemption by the workman, that, even in permanent cases, there are a considerable number of permanent cases and I refer particularly to the mining industry.  If these men can come in under this Bill and have compulsory redemption at figures such as they will work out under <Col N="555" /> this Bill, it will run into a tremendous amount of money.  It will run into such a sum of money that the industrial concerns which will be affected by this particular section will be unable to meet it.</P>
    <P>If this Bill goes to a Committee, I think the Minister should keep an open mind as to whether a case can be made for a particular type of industry being excluded from the compulsory redemption provisions of this Bill.  I am not so much concerned with the rate of the weekly compensation proposed under this Bill: it is a matter that can be examined.  Its different implications can be examined.  What I do think and what I do see is that the effects of this section allowing compulsory redemption can prove more far-reaching&mdash;and I am sincere about this&mdash;than I think the Minister or his advisers have possibly contemplated.</P>
    <P>I come now to the rest of Section 8. Sub-section (3) is a new departure.  It reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Where any weekly payment (including a weekly payment which commenced before the appointed day) to a workman, whose incapacity is not permanent, has been continued for not less than six months, the court may, on the application of the workman made at any time after he has attained the age of 21 years, by order provide for the payment by the employer, by way of redemption as from the date of the application of his liability to make the weekly payment, of a lump sum of such amount as may be determined by the court.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not know how it is proposed to work that sub-section because there is no guidance for any court in it, as it is drafted.  How is a court to determine a lump sum for a temporary incapacity? On what basis is a court to assess such disability?  Sub-section (4) of Section 8 provides:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The court shall have a discretion to grant or refuse an application under this section and, in exercising that discretion, shall have regard to the nature of the workman's injury, his reason for making the application <Col N="556" /> and, where the employer so requests, the employer's circumstances.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister, when he is replying, to pose to me what might be the reasons for a workman's application under this section that a court might consider just or reasonable. Does the section mean that any workman who is temporarily incapacitated for a period exceeding, say, six months, has the automatic right to go to a judge of the Circuit Court and ask him to fix his lump sum?</P>
    <P>The judge has certain matters to guide him as far as a total permanent incapacity case is concerned: 75 per cent. of the annuity figure is provided under the workmen's compensation code.  In this he has nothing to guide him.  Will he proceed on the basis that, in all probability, in accordance with the medical evidence, this particular workman whose incapacity is admittedly of a temporary nature will be, say, 12, 18 or 24 months incapacitated and, if so, is he to assess the figure on 75 per cent.  of that or will he go on the basis that he will give him full weekly compensation for a period of two years?  From what point of view is the judge to get assistance on this matter?  From what point of view can a judge know what we in this House mean by this particular section?</P>
    <P>The sub-section suggests that, before a workman can apply under this section, he must have some reason. What is the reason that the Minister or his advisers have in mind?  Is it a free for every workman who is temporarily incapacitated or must a workman have some particular family circumstances upon which he can base his application to the court to put this machinery in order?  These are matters that certainly I do not comprehend.  I can assure the Minister that I can see tremendous difficulty in endeavouring to ascertain the meaning of this section, if it is left as it stands.</P>
    <P>I want to bring the Minister now to one of the most abused sections in the 1934 Act, Section 24, which enables a judge to treat a case of partial incapacity as total incapacity.  That section is worked day in and day out in our <Col N="557" /> courts in dealing with the type of cases we have particularly in the country. I should like the Minister to appreciate that the vast majority of workmen in the country are not simply left starving if they happen to meet with an accident, because invariably they have small farms or they live on small farms and so are entirely different from their opposite numbers in the heart of Dublin City or across the water.  For that reason, if one of them meets with an accident, he has something else to do&mdash;he can walk around the farm and draw his weekly compensation.</P>
    <P>If he suffers a finger injury or develops a septic left hand, in view of the type of employment he has been in, he can go to the court and say: &ldquo;There is no work for me, although I agree that I am able to do light work. Though I am only partially incapacitated, I still cannot get a job,&rdquo; and ask the court to treat his partial incapacity as permanent.  In 95 per cent. of cases he must succeed, because, under the machinery as we work it, he will be sent by his advisers to the labour exchange to ask: &ldquo;Have you any job for a man with one hand or one foot?&rdquo;, and you can be quite sure that there is no employer who is going to take on somebody like that. The decks are then cleared for an application to the court and he goes in and is dealt with under Section 24 as a partial case to be treated as a total incapacity case.</P>
    <P>That is going to arise under Section 8 and I should like to know if such a man, who, admittedly, is only partially incapacitated, is treated at totally incapacitated by the court, can use sub-section (3) and claim a lump sum based on permanent temporary incapacity?  I do not know what the answer to that one is and I am quite sure that there is no insurance company will know what the answer to it is.  I do not know how a judge could interpret that situation.  Judges, like everybody else, are not infallible.  They have to try to administer the law according to the way we write it into the Statute Book and these are some of the matters that occur to me as arising under Section 8.  From that point of view alone, for the achieving of whatever object he wants to achieve <Col N="558" /> by the section, the Minister would be well advised to accept Deputy Dr. Ryan's amendment and to have a Committee of the House to examine how we can deal with the problems that it appears to me are going to arise under the section.</P>
    <P>I am not very much concerned with the other sections.  When this Bill has passed, I do not think there will be any such thing as common law actions. With the compensation being increased to £4 10s. per week and the lump sum going up to £1,800, I can see common law actions being very few and far between, because while formerly a workman naturally went for a common law action whenever the circumstances justified it, after this Bill has passed, in nine cases out of ten, even though the workman has a common law action, he will fare so much better under this, with his right to redeem his lump sum, with no risk whatsoever being taken by him in the law courts, that common law actions will simply disappear, except in very exceptional circumstances.</P>
    <P>I am not greatly concerned with the figures, but I believe that the weekly figure should be increased.  Again, it seems to be a matter of a difference between some of the people who have spoken on the Minister's side and Deputy Dr. Ryan as to whether there should be special provision for the married man with dependents.  I think there should be, because his need &mdash; and we must get down to the question of needs in this matter &mdash; is much greater.  Whatever may be said about how far we should go, there should be special provision for the married man with dependents.</P>
    <P>There is another point to which I should like to draw the Minister's attention.  He will find that people dealing with these cases have come across the very same instances in this regard as I have.  Take the case of a single man.  He is being provided for with £4 10s. per week and if he is the type of workman I have in mind, the man with a small farm or living on a small farm, the difference between £4 10s. a week and his ordinary wages is negligible.  The present wage of workers under the Mayo County <Col N="559" /> Council is £5 per week.  That figure has not been sanctioned yet, but it is the sum which has been passed by the Mayo County Council for their workers.  Under this section, the injured workman during the period of his incapacity will draw £4 10s. per week.</P>
    <P>Time and again, I have come across cases of workmen who, their own medical advisers say, are not going to get right until their cases are settled. I do not mean that in any cynical or jocose way, so far as the workmen are concerned.  In the case of workmen who have been used to regular employment and who have been knocked out of employment for two or three months, many of them develop neurasthenia and get a fixation that they are never going to recover.  I have come across cases and have been in cases where a workman's medical advisers assured me that the one thing to be done in the workman's interest was to settle the case, when he would get well.  The phobia was brought on by the worry of having the thing hanging over him, and they told me he would tend to get worse the longer it went on.</P>
    <P>There is a small margin between the weekly payment he gets in compensation and his wages and what the temptation will be to a workman&mdash;it may start as a temptation and then develop in these neurasthenic cases&mdash; when the difference between sitting at home without making any attempt to work and going to work is 10/- per week, I do not like to speculate.  I do not know what the effect of it may be, but undoubtedly it will have some effect and not, I am afraid, a very good effect.  However, there is a reasonable line in everything, and, in particular, I should be more inclined to make it £4 10s. per week, or even more, for the married man with a family, the man whose very family circumstances will encourage him to go back to his work immediately he is able to do so and who, while he is out of work, when he very genuinely needs it, will have sufficient to keep his home and his family going.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="560" /> There are some matters in this Bill &mdash;and there are certain matters not in it&mdash;which should be considered from the point of view of the ordinary workman. One of these which might be considered by a committee set up to examine such matters is the case of injured workmen.  I have come across such cases very often.  For instance, the cases where workmen develop what we call industrial diseases.  I know of at least two cases of dermatitis where, before the men could bring proceedings, a doctor&mdash;I forget what he is called under the Act&mdash;had to certify that those diseases arose in the course of their employment.  His own doctor might be attending him for, possibly, two, three or four months and suddenly, for some reason, his compensation is stopped.  He then discovers that his own doctor's certificate is no good to him.  It is only when he consults his legal advisers that he finds, before he can launch proceedings, that a doctor who never saw the patient before must certify that his condition was due to this industrial disease and that the disease arose in the course of his employment.  I have come across one case in which a certain doctor could not certify that this was so.  In order to do so, he would have to have seen the patient when this industrial disease began, three, four or five months before.  You will find workmen deprived of their rights because they did not know, as far as industrial diseases were concerned, that this peculiar provision was there.</P>
    <P>There are some other matters which I think we might possibly deal with from the workman's point of view in this Bill, but, if the Minister will eventually have this matter considered by a committee, I suppose we will have to wait until we hear what this committee is able to do.</P>
    <P>As far as Section 11 is concerned, I think the period of 12 months should be sufficient.  I do not accept, whatever the Minister may think, that, in these days, if any workman has been injured, a period of six months elapses without his knowing his rights.  I think, taking the matter by and large, as a nation we are probably the most legal minded in the world.  At all events, <Col N="561" /> from my experience, I have come across very few workmen who, having met with accidents, were not aware of their rights within a matter of days, not to talk of letting the matter drift for six months or 12 months.</P>
    <P>There is also the employer's side of that, and there is the insurance company's side.  While I hold no brief for insurance companies at all, what I want to say is that these premiums, which the employer will have to pay, will largely be determined by their experience under this Bill, when it becomes law.  From my knowledge of that, there are very few insurance companies that want to touch workmen's compensation insurance.  My experience has been that, where insurance companies were taking workmen's compensation insurance, they wanted to take over every insurance of the firm they were covering.  As far as I know, insurance companies do not seem to be anxious to get hold of workmen's compensation insurance.</P>
    <P>It is only fair to the employer, if a workman of his has an accident, that he should know at least within 12 months whether he is going to deal with him, or will have to deal with him under the workmen's compensation code, or whether he has to go to common law.  I think, from the workmen's point of view, they should have their minds made up for them.  They should make up their minds whether they are going to launch common law actions within 12 months.  I think that period is long enough, and should not be extended to 24 months.</P>
    <P>I should like to say to the Minister that, as far as the mining industry of this country is concerned, and the extraordinarily high premiums that must be paid to cover their employees, he should consider dealing with this industry separately, in relation to these compulsory provisions.  I think the answer to the argument that it is not fair for the workmen not to have the right compulsorily to redeem when the employer has it, is to take away the right from both sides.  In my experience, over a long number of years, in dealing with workmen's compensation, I have only come across two <Col N="562" /> cases where the employers, who in both cases followed the insurance company, exercised their right to compulsory redemption.  In 99 per cent. of cases it is a question of mutual agreement, and making a bargain between the parties.</P>
    <P>I can, on the other hand, visualise this: take the case of a small farmer, who is not in good circumstances, and who has a workman, maybe a neighbour, employed possibly for a week, a fortnight, or a month, during the busy season, or during the spring.  I can see that man becoming a farmer, and the small farmer will be sold out straight away, if these provisions go through in this Bill.  These are matters which I think the Minister should fully consider.</P>
    <P>I think the sensible way to do it, the sensible approach is to have an all-Party committee of this House to deal with the matter, as suggested by Deputy Dr. Ryan.  It is incorrect, it is simply not true, for Deputy Larkin to say that the only thing to be conaidered under Deputy Dr. Ryan's amendment is the impact of this Bill on industrial costings.  The whole idea of this amendment of Deputy Dr. Ryan's is to consider how we can improve this Bill, how we can make a workable Bill.  I think we would do this better if we referred it to a committee of this House rather than if we dealt with the matter in the cut and thrust of debate in the ordinary Committee Stage.  I think the Minister would be well advised to accept the proposition put up by Deputy Dr. Ryan.  I can assure the Minister that we are all anxious to make this a workable measure when it goes on the Statute Book.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAFinlay1954" hpid="Mr. Finlay Mr. Finlay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finlay</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dr. Ryan and Deputy Moran have just assured the House that the proposal before the House in the name of Deputy Dr. Ryan is a suggestion, and only a suggestion, that the workability and practicability of the Workmen's Compensation Act should be examined and that the desirability of the various sections, particularly Section 8, and Section 7 with which Deputy Dr. Ryan is also concerned, should also be examined. <Col N="563" /> The proposal which the House is discussing is a proposal that a committee of the House be appointed for that purpose.  The Fianna Fáil Party would appear, therefore, to be adopting the attitude that all they are concerned with in putting down a motion on the Second Reading of this Bill is that the Bill should get careful consideration as to some particular sections and as to the operation of certain sections and sub-sections.</P>
      <P>That may be the present intention of the Deputies opposite, but it may be no harm to remind the House that the proposal which is before the House in the name of Deputy Dr. Ryan is that a committee should be appointed to consider the Bill &ldquo;on the probable consequences of the proposals in the Bill on employment and prices.&rdquo;  It is nothing more and nothing less.</P>
      <P>So far we have not yet heard any speech from the other side of the House which would deal in any way with the &ldquo;probable consequences of the Bill on employment and prices.&rdquo;  If the Deputies opposite have any views on the probable consequences of this Bill on employment and prices it would be of great assistance to the House to have them.  It would be of particular assistance to the House to have them when the Deputies opposite have proposed a motion that a committee of the House should inquire into that problem.</P>
      <P>I cannot agree with Deputy Dr. Ryan's contention that this Bill can or should be approached on the general basis that it is merely another branch of social insurance.  In approaching the Bill generally and its provisions in particular, Deputies should remember that the type of legislation with which we are dealing, the whole workman's compensation code, has, as Deputy O'Higgins mentioned, an older origin than nearly all social welfare provisions which we now find normal and acceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that the workmen's compensation code and even present-day workmen's compensation legislation should be viewed in the light of the fact that all modern industrial progress, <Col N="564" /> the mechanisation of agriculture, and all forms of more efficient and more productive work carry in their wake a necessarily added risk to persons who are engaged in that work.  I am not concerned with inefficiently run factories.  I am not concerned with over-stupid employees doing risky things which they know they should not do.  I am not concerned with employers who are stupid about ordinary precautions and ordinary safeguards, but in considering any workmen's compensation Bill it is fair to say that modern progress in all forms of production, whether it is agricultural or industrial, necessarily means that manual workers working efficiently in properly run premises under proper supervision and in accordance with any factory Acts we can make or put into operation will necessarily incur an added risk in their employment every year as we progress.</P>
    <P>I think it is one of the costs of increases in industrial and agricultural efficiency.  If it is, it is a cost that we must bear in the form of making a special provision for workmen who are injured in this particular way.  I think that the workmen's compensation code should be approached not merely on the basis that it is one of the branches of social welfare with which all Deputies are concerned but on the basis that it is a special code the need for which was seen long before much of our modern social welfare and the need for which to-day is even greater than it probably was 30 or 40 years ago.</P>
    <P>In that light it seems to me that the general provisions of this Bill are desirable.  In particular, I believe that an increase of the maximum compensation awardable to a workman is desirable and justifiable in the Bill. Again, we have yet to hear what the Deputies opposite think about that increase.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moran suggested that it was a dangerous increase.  The only reason he advanced against it was that a workman earning £5 who might get compensation at £4 10s.  might be tempted to malinger.  I think we can allay the fears of Deputy Moran on that question.  A workman earning £5 a week under this Bill can only get <Col N="565" /> £3 15s. a week.  In order to get £4 10s., as I understand it, a workman must earn something in the nature of £7 so that a workman earning £5 a week will still get considerably less.  He will get 75 per cent.  whatever way it works out.  The objection to the raising of the maximum compensation to £4 10s. need not be one to disturb the House.</P>
    <P>With regard to the other provisions of the Bill, there is one matter I would like to mention to the Minister which is not provided for and which should be considered between this and the Committee Stage of the Bill.  In Section 5 the Bill provides an increase for juvenile dependency.  That is a necessary and desirable increase but there is still no cure for the hard case which arises where a juvenile dependent is the only juvenile dependent of a deceased worker killed in a fatal accident.  If a child being the only child of such workman is within a month of 16 years and if the workman dies, then the child will get a figure of less than £10 even as the Bill is drafted.  I would like the Minister to consider introducing into Section 5 of the present Bill some additional provision which would ensure that under no circumstances, as can arise at present under the Schedules to the 1924 Act and the 1953 Act, can a sole juvenile dependent who is just short of 16 be in a position that he gets £10 as a juvenile and fails to get anything as an adult.  I would like the Minister to consider that before the Committee Stage of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 8 of the Bill is the next section which has had much discussion in the House.  I do not think Deputies need be so afraid of Section 8 as some of them are.  It introduces a new provision in so far as that workmen previously could not apply to the court for redemption.  We would be closing our eyes to the working of previous workmen's compensation legislation if we ignored the fact that in the great majority of cases both permanent and temporary incapacity were concluded by the payment of a lump sum.  I suppose 90 per cent. of workmen's compensation cases whether they were permanent or temporary ended with <Col N="566" /> the payment of a lump sum, whether big or small.  That is the way they were concluded.</P>
    <P>It was usually done by agreement.  I can find nothing alarming, basically speaking, in the idea that it should now be capable of being done either by agreement or by the court at the instigation of the worker.</P>

      <P>When I was speaking on the Estimate last evening I had no intention of resuming this evening and, consequently, I may not have gone into the detailed examination of the Estimate as closely as I would wish. I dealt only superficially with many of the points raised by the Minister in his introductory speech.  There were some points that I did not touch on at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In concluding his speech the Minister referred to my action in permitting the Friesian bull to be introduced to the insemination stations.  It was as a result of a decision arrived at by the Livestock Consultative Council that a Friesian bull would be admitted to one of the stations on the condition that the semen would only issue to farmers for Friesian cows.  I think that was the provision made at the time.  If I was to blame on that occasion for permitting a Friesian into the insemination stations, from what I have heard during the past few weeks the Minister is not completely blameless because I understand that permission has now been given or is about to be given to include the Ayrshire and the Jersey in the insemination stations, again, I understand, on the same conditions.  If I did damage to the Shorthorn breed, the Minister is following the example that I set.  What was good sauce for the <Col N="567" /> goose is still good sauce for the gander, and the Minister is not completely blameless.</P>
    <P>The Minister, I am sure, believes that his decision will not damage the Shorthorn breed or the foundation stock of the country.  I have and had the same belief that the introduction of the Friesian, provided, of course, that the semen would be used for Friesian cows and Friesian cows only, would not damage the foundation stock.  Like the Minister and like our predecessors in the Department of Agriculture, I believe that the Shorthorn cow should be maintained as the foundation stock in this country.  I believe that there is no other cow yet on hand or in sight to take her place.</P>
    <P>When I referred to the Friesian cow yesterday evening I stated that we have no proof as regards her ability to produce milk under the same conditions as the Shorthorn has been producing milk in this country; we have no proof as regards her production of beef or its quality.  I would like to see an experiment carried out to prove to the people who advocate the introduction of the Friesian cow that she is not comparable with our Shorthorn.</P>
    <P>We have as good Shorthorns in this country as you will find in any part of the world.  There are cows&mdash;there are some of them in Glasnevin&mdash;producing up to 1,500 gallons of milk.  I know we have Friesians in this country that produce possibly about the same.  We know that we have a good strain of Shorthorns.  We may have a good strain of Friesians.  But there should be an experiment carried out in order to prove conclusively that one is outstanding, more suitable to the country, because our economy is based on mixed farming.  Mixed farming should be the basis of our agriculture and in the Shorthorn breed we have as good a strain in this country as there is in any other country.</P>
    <P>Possibly the same thing applies to our Friesians.  I am not too sure about it.  It may and we may have people who may claim that that is the case but I, for one, would like to see that experiment carried out whereby we can prove conclusively to the people of the <Col N="568" /> country: &ldquo;Here is an experiment carried out under the auspices of the Department of Agriculture.  We know what this animal can produce in the way of milk, how much it has cost to produce a gallon of milk, the value of her calf at a month old, a week old, a year old, when it came into the store age and when it was finished for beef.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We want to clear our minds on that question because there are people in this country who do not believe yet that we can produce cattle, horses, or anything else as good as can be produced across the water.  That mentality is here.  We must get rid of it.</P>
    <P>I have heard people talk about the Friesian cow.  I have heard them talk about the Ayrshire.  I have heard them talk about the Landrace pig and many other things.  According to them, anything produced here could not be as good as what is produced elsewhere. It is in the Minister's power to do it. As far as our foundation stock is concerned it is in his hands to prove, once and for all, that the dairy Shorthorn should be maintained as the foundation stock of our cattle, and to tell the people, as he has done and as his predecessors in office have done, that, as far as the Department and the Ministers were concerned, they believed that the dairy Shorthorn should be maintained as the foundation stock of our cattle.  There is no equivocation about it nor there should not be.  It is a question of proving it and of convincing the people in the country that it is so.</P>
    <P>I often think over this matter.  I have been through the country.  I have seen our cows in many counties.  I believe that they are not kept as they should be kept, that if they were kept and fed better there would not be any question about their yield of milk.  I do know that the people who are engaged in dairying and who have gone to the trouble and expense of bringing in Friesian cattle are in a different category from the general body of farmers, that these people probably feed their cattle better than the general body and that it is for that reason that the claims they put forward have some substance.  If the <Col N="569" /> Shorthorn cow was as well fed as many of the Friesians are fed she would milk equally as much as the Friesians. There has been no change, mind, and it is wrong to think that the introduction of the Friesian has in any way damaged the reputation of the Shorthorn.</P>
    <P>It has not.  But our policy as regards our exports of cattle must be based on a firm foundation.  I believe that our exports of cattle should be brought up not by 100,000, 200,000 or 300,000 but by 1,000,000 cattle.  We have 9,000,000 of our 12,000,000 acres of land under grass.  We are feeding at the present time 4,000,000 cattle on that 9,000,000 acres.  We could carry more but it is wrong to think that we can produce another 1,000,000 cattle from grass and grass alone and even if we could it would be bad policy to do so.  We are in a bad position even at the present time in that our exports of cattle are confined to eight or nine months of the year because we are exporting our cattle to the British market at a time when that market is flooded with cattle by the English and Scottish producers.  There are three or four months of the year during which we could export an equal number of cattle as we do, say, in July.</P>

      <P>There are some late growing years when you can do it but generally speaking over the last 20 or <Col N="570" /> 30 years there is a period when we are keeping our cattle through the winter and feeding them on beef steak.  You need only go through the country and see on a cold wet morning cattle bunched around the hedges.  We can see them in the morning after a wet night when a late frost has come on in the morning.  We can see the cattle with the water freezing on them.  They are losing pounds of beef every night that that happens.  We need a proper system of feeding in order to produce more cattle.</P>

It is no use telling a farmer in the traditional tillage areas to produce additional corn to feed to the cattle and walk them out if it is not the traditional system of farming there.  What would the West Cork people do?  How would they grow the amount of corn necessary?</P>

We must think in these terms.  I do know this, and I have often said it, that the price of our barley is dependent on what we get for our beef and bacon and poultry and eggs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>And in trying to find that basis provision must be made by whoever is charged with the responsibility for agriculture to see that the persons who produce that foodstuff is paid a price that will cover their cost of production and leave a margin of profit.  He is charged with that responsibility and the only way in which he can ensure that the farmer gets that is by seeing that the produce that is <Col N="572" /> turned out goes into a market where he gets a remunerative price.  What does a Minister do in order to ensure that?  Let us take pigs for instance. How does he approach it?  His approach should be to produce bacon that will qualify for top price&mdash;the highest possible price that will ensure a margin of profit for the feeder.  That is the Minister's responsibility if he has the responsibility of going out into a foreign market.  Here in this country at the present time we produce about 26,000 or 27,000 pigs per week.  That is the number going into the factories.</P>
      <P>Of these we consume between 18,000 and 19,000 and our export figures represent about one-third of the whole. Surely it should be possible for the Minister to insist on sending out a quality bacon that will get top price in a foreign country.  We are not doing that at the moment.  The home consumers will not permit us to do it.  The home consumer in Holland and Denmark will permit its being done in these countries.  Otherwise, the bacon that is now produced in Denmark and Holland would not have the same uniform quality any more than our own bacon has.  The bacon going into the British market from Denmark and Holland is top quality.  It is uniform. The two sides of bacon are as alike as two peas in a pod.  There is no difference between them.  There is not the difference of one lb. as between one side of bacon and another.  That is not the case here because our consumers are not prepared to make the same sacrifices as the Danish people are prepared to make in order to help the Danish farmers build up an agricultural export market.</P>
      <P>Our people are helped in their attitude by our politicians who have gone out of their way to condemn the farmers' attitude in looking for higher prices.  Our farmers have not been looking for excessive prices.  They are looking for prices which will enable them to produce and have a margin of profit for themselves.  We have our politicians shouting from the housetops, particularly in the towns and cities, advising the people that the farmers are millionaires and that they are getting too much for their produce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="573" /> If we could restrain ourselves from doing that, we might move along much more smoothly.  But our politicians, for their own selfish ends, are using the situation in order to benefit themselves. While that continues we will not make any progress.  Our farmers could do equally well as farmers in any country in the world if their costs of production were not so high.  The people living in the towns and cities do not seem to appreciate the handicap under which our farmers have to work.</P>
    <P>That is the answer to many of the statements that have been made from the Minister's benches.  The Minister stated in his opening speech that we were being priced out of the market. I doubt if we are.  I believe we can produce bacon if we set about doing it in the right way.  I believe we can produce it at a price which will enable us to sell it in the British market at a profit.  I know the Danish price has fallen.  The quality of our bacon for export may not be as good as the Danish bacon.  There may be a preference for Danish bacon in Britain.  If there is a preference and if our bacon is not as good, then it is our own fault.</P>
    <P>Here I charge the Minister with doing damage by putting maize on the market again.  The Minister, in an advertisement issued some time ago, stated that it is now permissible to purchase straight maize.  It was not permissible when I was in office, and I had a perfectly good reason for withholding permission. If we are to compete with the Danes we must have quality bacon. Why have the Danes gone over to feeding with barley?  The Danish ration is 40 per cent. maize, 40 per cent. barley, 10 per cent. fish meal and 10 per cent. wheat offals.  Why can we not adopt the same ration?  We have equally as good a strain in our large white.  We have just as suitable a pig as the Landrace but we are not taking advantage of it.  If straight maize is put on the market, the Minister's statement about being priced out is wrong; we will be driven out because of the inferior quality of our bacon, and for no other reason.  That is the sum total of it.</P>
    <P>What applies in the case of bacon <Col N="574" /> applies equally in the case of butter. Here again we are up against a problem.  We have here a cow which, some will tell us, is capable of producing 450 gallons, or possibly more, as she is fed at the moment.  If she were fed a little better we could increase the yield from that cow by at least another 100 gallons.  We should be able to get our farmers to realise that.  That brings me back now to a scheme&mdash;I do not know what has become of it&mdash;in relation to demonstration plots and pilot farms.  The people have to be educated.  Our farmers have the old traditional system of feeding the cow on grass in the summer and on poor hay in the winter.  That cow cannot give a high milk yield the following year.  She cannot give an economic supply of milk, and something must be done about it.  How can we bring that home to our farmers?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The best the Minister can do is not enough.  It has become urgently necessary to make a move now.  If we lose the market it will be gone for good.  It is urgently necessary to put some plan into operation and there is a plan which could be put into operation.  We have to educate the farmers who hitherto have produced their pigs with potatoes and maize. Now, because of the high cost of fuel, and for other reasons, the potatoes are gone.  The farmers will not use them.  Why not substitute fodder beet?  Professor Calder gave a lecture here at Ballsbridge in 1952.  He said then that barley is the cornerstone of pig rations in most bacon-producing areas and before long that will perforce of circumstances become the position in Ireland also.  If we are to retain our export we must have barley included in our pig ration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We have 100,000 acres more barley this year than last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="576" />
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear the Minister say so.  I believe there is room for a couple of hundred thousand acres more.  When I was sitting on that side of the House I asked the farmers on every possible occasion to produce more barley and to import less maize.  That was the cornerstone of all my policy.  We should produce these commodities at home and use our own land for their production.  Not merely is that good economic policy so far as the farmer is concerned but it will produce a product of which we need not be ashamed.  Furthermore, even when there were fluctuations in the price of foreign feeding stuffs last year, we were able to send our pigs into the British market all last year, pay a reasonably good price to the farmer who produced the barley that fed them and a profitable price to the farmer who reared the pig.</P>
      <P>The Minister or the Government has changed that.  This is a case of robbing Peter to pay Paul.  The Minister for Finance was not satisfied or the Minister for Industry and Commerce was not satisfied that the bread subsidy should be so high and in seeking a victim they selected the farmers. The farmers have lost over £2,000,000 on the price of wheat.  That will, in some way, reduce the bread subsidy but the Minister for Industry and Commerce went further than that when he permitted the millers to increase the price of pollard by £5 per ton in order that he could again reduce the bread subsidy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Sure, it has gone down again, now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>It has not gone down to anything like what it was.  I think the price at the present time&mdash;I am not too sure, possibly I have the prices here&mdash;the price of pollard is £24 10s. per ton.  When we left office it was £20.  That £4 10s. per ton will give some help to the Minister for Finance, but the increase of £4 10s. is going to take away the profits that the farmer is making out of his pigs.  Is it any wonder that we are again travelling on the road that we travelled from 1949 to <Col N="577" /> 1951 and that we are going downhill? The people who are sitting over on the opposite side of the House may laugh and scoff at this but let me give them the figures because they are very illuminating.  It would be well that more stock would be taken of these figures by the people who sit behind the Minister and cheer him when he makes a speech on agriculture in this House.  The January estimates of this year&mdash;the latest figures we have available&mdash;reveal that sows for breeding in January, 1955, numbered 85,000, but in January, 1954, 12 months ago, there were 100,000, a reduction of 15 per cent.</P>

Is that an indication that we are on the upward trend, that stagnation has not hit agriculture, that worse than stagnation has not hit it at the present time and that we are not going downhill?  Speaking here yesterday I pointed out to the people in this House that it took us two years to recover from 1950-1951.  That is quite true.</P>

      <P>I have given you the figures prepared under the Coalition Government in a Government office and, I am sure, approved by that Government. These are the figures that have been issued to the people, the latest figures available.  In the case of other pigs&mdash;three months old and upwards&mdash;we had in 1955, 351,100; and in the previous year we had 354,000. That shows that the older pigs are there and that we are starting on the downward trend and that it is time it was arrested because the next figure is very illuminating.  It is this: in 1955, we had 370,500 pigs of under three months, but last year in the month of January we had 432,900, a drop of 14.4 per cent.  Does that indicate the upward trend that we have been told about?  Does that indicate that we are going to hold our place in the foreign markets?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Lands will be very pleased, I am sure, when he sees the exports dropping because last year, when I made a speech similar to the one that was made by the Minister exalting ourselves on the increase in our exports, Deputy Blowick, as he then was, came along and said: &ldquo;Is it any wonder that exports have gone <Col N="579" /> up when you have been starving the people at home?

The milch cow, of course, cannot be too easily got rid of in 12 months; the heifers are coming in and it takes a little while as it took, say, in 1951 to restore them.  It also takes a short while for the numbers to decline, with the result that we have in January, 1955, 1,179,300, an increase of 15,000 over last year, 1.3 per cent. <Col N="581" /> increase.  Heifers in-calf in 1955 are 125,300 but in 1954 we had 145,100. That shows a decrease of 13.7 per cent. in in-calf heifers.  The figure for bulls is 16,800; last year it was 17,900.  Now we are coming to the very significant one: young cattle, 2,661,600 in 1955 and in January, 1954, 2,678,600, a decrease of 6 per cent., that is after 12 months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>We have people who grew that acreage of wheat in the past. However, that is getting away from the point.  The Government, by its action in reducing the price of wheat by 12/6 a barrel, has taken the heart out of the individual farmer.  The request to the industrious, energetic young farmer, as seen by the attitude of the Government, is: &ldquo;Produce a surplus&rdquo; and then the Government's remedy for the surplus is to reduce his price.  The incentive to produce more is gone, no matter what may be said from the platforms or in the House. The incentive is gone, the inducement is gone.  If it goes in one crop, it will go in others.</P>
      <P>We have the sons and second sons of farmers, anxious to work, who set out to get machinery and took conacre to make a livelihood out of it.  We know very well we will have to continue conacre. We know of the widow with a family, unable to manage the farm; we know of the unfortunate old people who may be unable to manage it themselves&mdash;the alternative these people have is to let it in conacre.  We know that system must be maintained. These young farmers invested their capital in machinery&mdash;or they borrowed money and invested it&mdash;and after one or two years, what happened?  The profit they were making was taken from them&mdash;12/6 per barrel or £2,000,000, taken out of the pockets of the wheat producers.  The incentive is being taken away.  If the incentive goes in tillage, it will disappear also in other phases of agriculture.</P>
      <P>The Minister has been shouting about increased production, that unless we have increased production industrialisation cannot succeed and may come to a stop.  Is this helping to build up the enthusiasm our farmers should have at present and that I must say we had established before Fianna Fáil went out of office?  It was taken away with a wave of the hand in one effort.  I could criticise the Minister, for instance, because last July he succumbed to the demands that were made to reduce the price of butter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">

    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I do and if I were over there I would disagree with it, because I had in the stores here in Dublin, at the time the outcry took place, the finest butter in the world, offered to the people of the City of Dublin at 3/10 a lb. and they refused to buy it.</P>
      <P>It was equally as good as any that could be produced in the world.  What was the reason?  It was unspreadable. Do they forget that our own May and June production is put into cold storage and when handed out to the people of Dublin after four or five months it is as unspreadable as New Zealand butter?</P>
      <P>If I were forced in the past at any time to reduce the price of butter, I certainly would not operate it as a consumer subsidy or handle it as such. The Minister is handling this subsidy as a consumer subsidy and there is nothing to prevent a Minister in the future who is supporting the consumers, saying that he has given this subsidy in order to enable the farmer to get this price for his milk.  That would be the attitude taken up by some Minister who would be opposed to this subsidy, to wipe it out&mdash;say the Minister for Finance&mdash;if he did not want to give it any longer.  The Minister for Agriculture would be hard pressed to establish the fact that it was a consumer subsidy, that it was not a producer subsidy.</P>
      <P>In the end, if at any time that subsidy has to go, the consuming public, because of the greater number of votes they have, will succeed in establishing that as a producer subsidy &mdash;which it is not.  For that reason, I certainly would not handle it as Minister for Agriculture.  If the administration was to be carried out by the Department of Agriculture, there was a way in which it could be done.  It could be done through the Stabilisation Fund.  They could recoup themselves through that.  It certainly would not appear in my Estimates if I were Minister for Agriculture.  I blame the Minister for accepting it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the subsidisation of milk, I referred yesterday to the costings. There is no one at present&mdash;I do not mind who it is&mdash;but could tell us how much it costs to produce a gallon of <Col N="585" /> milk.  Let us have these costings produced and let the people in the towns and cities see for themselves what it is costing farmers to produce that milk.  The farmers are entitled to a livelihood as well as anyone else.</P>

      <P>It did not get proper examination and that is the reason for it.  The figures were available there for anybody.  It was a new industry we were building up.  We could have waited with our butter and built up this industry.  We exported about £9,000,000 worth in 1953.  We could have maintained that.  The figures reveal that this year it is down considerably. It is down because of the delivery charges.</P>

It gives a higher price and that is the line that the Minister should have followed, the line that will bring the most money in to the farmers.  It is his duty to examine these questions.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I have dealt with these matters.  I should like to know what the future policy in relation to agriculture will be.  There is no use in saying to us: &ldquo;We must concentrate on the export of beef to the exclusion of everything else.&rdquo;  Our policy has not been that.  We did everything we possibly could to build up a beef export market.  However, we need to base it on tillage.  I believe that if it is based on tillage we shall provide more work for our people, more money for our farmers, more stock for export and an increase not merely in our exports but in agricultural production generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only way in which we can carry more cattle in this country is by producing better grasses.  Provision has been made in the Department for that. A new section was set up to deal exclusively with seeds.  We want better grasses.  We can get better grasses by using more of the plough, more lime, more fertilisers.  That is the line we should be following.  Here is where we are up against the snag; there is a snag some place.  We want more cattle because there is a market for our beef and for our stores.  Britain needs about 200,000 to 250,000 tons of meat.  We supply about 20 per cent.  of her fresh meat trade.  If the prices we are getting now are good, we can attribute <Col N="587" /> that to our proximity to Britain because we, and no other people, can get into her fresh meat market.  The British have a surplus of chilled and frozen meat at the present time, but the housewife and the consumer in Britain prefer fresh meat.  Because of our proximity to Britain, our cattle, sent in by a Scotch or English farmer, are entitled to go into the fresh meat market.  We shall always have that advantage.</P>
    <P>What provision are we going to make in the country to get in with our 200,000 tons of meat?  I said there was a snag.  There is.  We cannot have cattle without cows.  If we increase our stock of cows from the 1,250,000 that we have, what will we do with the milk?  I have heard wiseacres talk about putting a calf on a cow and say that it is good farming economy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Or four or five.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>If we were able to get them.  Unfortunately, a cow will have only one calf at a time.  If it is the economical way of doing things, every farmer in the country will be putting his calf on his cow and there will be no calves left for Deputy Hughes or myself. They will not be coming from County Limerick or West Cork.  What can we do?  Even with a bad cow, milking 450 gallons at the 1/6 a gallon that the well-managed creamery can pay at the present time, it would be rather expensive to have that amount of milk going to one calf instead of to four.  That is the snag we have to face. We have to examine the question of getting into the milk and butter markets of Britain, whether it be through chocolate crumb or through butter.  We must ask ourselves whether we are going to follow that policy or whether we will produce our requirements of milk here and introduce beef cattle as well.  That is the alternative, if we want to build up our cattle population. However, we must know the road we are going to travel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been preaching the gospel of more and more production from the land.  If farmers who have taken our advice to use as much lime and as much fertiliser as they can, continue <Col N="588" /> to do so, the position in a few years' time will be that we shall not have sufficient live stock to eat the grass. Therefore, we must improve and continue to increase our live-stock population. That is a matter that the Government, and the Minister for Agriculture in particular, must consider. They must know what line we are going to follow.</P>
    <P>It is very easy to say that we must increase our cattle population but increasing our cattle population also means increasing our cow population or our heifer population.  If we are going to have a proper economy, then it is a matter of working out a plan that will be economical and profitable to the people of the country.  With regard to the day when we can capture that market for 200,000 tons of meat that is there at our doorstep, now is the time to act if we want it, because other countries are looking for it.  A question that must be considered is how long will the British continue to pay high prices for fresh beef.  Maybe, in time, they will acquire a taste for chilled beef.  If that day ever arrives, then we are sunk.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <P>The trend was upwards. While Fianna Fáil were in office, there was an upward trend in agricultural production and in agricultural prices, but we have now come back to the policy which the 1948 Coalition followed and which gave us a reduction of 500,000 acres of land under the plough in three years.  It is amazing that there should be such a collapse in three years that even our cattle population was beginning to do down.  I have quoted the figures already.  They were on the downward trend in 1951.  Pigs had almost disappeared and now, unfortunately for the country, we are to have a repetition of the policy of 1948 to 1951.  Where is this going to end for our cities, our towns and our villages?  What is to become of our industry, if we are going to impoverish the farming community?</P>

We will not have them. Who is going to keep pigs?  Our price in 1954 was 252/- a cwt., with maize, barley at £27 a ton.

      <P>&ldquo;You will be very welcome. Fianna Fáil fixed 82/6 a barrel for wheat bushelling 63 lb.  and over. What is the result of that?  Do not let us forget that at the same time that Fianna Fáil fixed that price for Irish wheat they signed the International Wheat Agreement which binds this Government now throughout this year and next year to accept delivery of 270,000 tons of wheat whenever anyone wants to tender that quantity of wheat to us at the minimum price of one dollar 55 f.o.b. Port Arthur for No. 1 Manitoba wheat.  That liability attaches to me now.  Between now and the 31st July any person in the International Wheat Agreement who desires can compel this country to accept this wheat and pay for it by virtue of the International Wheat Agreement.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The Minister could not afford to give the Irish farmer the same price as he paid for Australian wheat that was equally as good, and used, possibly, for the same purpose as the Australian wheat.  Wheat was delivered to the mills last year which was rejected as being non-millable.  In <Col N="595" /> some of the things I have looked through somebody questioned that wheat which contained 30 per cent. moisture was unmillable.  It was no such thing.  But it was these unfortunate farmers who had to take it home and sell it at prices from 35/-a barrel to £2.  I know where a farmer was offered £100 for 100 barrels, and yet the Government had to go to Australia to buy wheat from the Australians which could have been provided by the Irish farmer.  Was that good policy?</P>
      <P>The Minister, I understand, issued licences for the export of wheat last year at less than £2 per barrel.  It went across the Border, and we are going to the furthest ends of the earth to bring in animal feeding stuffs from £27 to over £30 per ton.  Is it any wonder our farmers have become disheartened? Is it any wonder that their incentive to produce is gone?  Is it any wonder that we are going to run into a slump, that we are going to run into a period where production in agriculture is going to go down?  We had built it up.  The efforts of three years have now been brought to naught.  It may be of interest to some of the people in the House, and to the people of the country, to know what the exact position was as far as agriculture was concerned on the 2nd June, 1954, as compared with the 1st June, 1951.  Our cattle numbers in 1954 were 20,351 higher in June, 1953, than in June, 1951.</P>

      <P>Pigs were up by 223,000 and poultry by 274,000.  That was the period when Fianna Fáil were in office. We have been accused, possibly, by some people of stagnation in agriculture. That is the record.  Let us hope that when the Coalition Government is finished by the people, and when the clamouring from outside will be sufficiently strong to put them off the benches, they will be able to come <Col N="596" /> back to this House and repeat what I am going to repeat: as far as Fianna Fáil were concerned that they could do it in keeping with the progress made under their own Administration. Our wheat area was 72,000 acres higher in 1953 than in 1951, barley by 21,000 acres, sugar beet by 5,429 acres, the total tillage being up by over 35,000 acres.  Our agricultural exports were £20,000,000 higher in June, 1953, than in June, 1951, an increase of 34 per cent.  Yesterday, we heard the Minister talking about the increase since 1948 but I have shown the increase from 1951 to 1953.</P>
      <P>The number of instructors in agriculture increased by 45 per cent.  Land reclamation was accelerated during that period.  In 1951-54, we created a record, one which will not be surpassed or equalled this year.  We had 100,000 acres of land under the land reclamation scheme.  That will not be done this year.  The sum of £122,000 was transferred to another section of the Department.  More than seven times as much lime was applied to the land last year than in 1951.  More money was provided for farm buildings and for running water to the homes of farmers. We spent £100,000 in 12 months as compared with the £4,500 spent during the last year of the Coalition Administration.  We gave better credit facilities to the farmer.  We initiated schemes in the Department because, as I said last night, we wanted to make credit available to our people.  That has been taken away from them again. That was the record of the Fianna Fáil Government while they were in office.</P>
      <P>We have now started on the downward trend in agriculture.  It is all right for the Minister to talk about being priced out of the markets, but there is a remedy for these things.  It should be within the scope of the Government to find these remedies. They are there.  They were there in 1951, 1952, 1953 and 1954.  They are still there if only the Government would look for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When speaking yesterday the Minister said he was going to have much destructive criticism from this side of the House.  Let us then for a few <Col N="597" /> moments give him something that is constructive.  Agriculture needs many things at the present time and it will take more than five years to carry the work out.  It will take the lifetime of any Government and even a longer period to do these things.  I hope that when the Minister relinquishes office some progress can be shown for the term he spent as Minister for Agriculture. I have here&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Some time before I left office, I was preparing schemes to benefit agriculture under the National Development Fund.  It is well worth while recording the schemes we had in mind at that time and which we consider <Col N="598" /> would be of immense value to agriculture.  I admit they would cost a considerable sum of money but each one of the schemes is well worth following up.</P>
      <P>We wanted advisory and demonstration work carried out.  We wanted more buildings and equipment for Department schools and private agricultural schools.  There is no necessity for me to dwell on the necessity for these things.  If we are going to educate the youth of our country we must make preparations in our schools for the pupils.  Consequently, it is necessary that greater provision be made in regard to the Department's schools and the private agricultural schools. Then there was the live-stock progeny testing station.  We had already made provision in that case.  I think it was approved.  As a matter of fact, approval had been given on the 2nd June to some of the schemes I am going to mention but for some reason or another&mdash;I do not know why&mdash;they were rejected.</P>
      <P>The progeny testing station for cattle has been placed in abeyance notwithstanding its importance to the country at the present time.  There were grants for university research, control stations for poultry and eggs, establishment of a fish farm, credit at reduced rates of interest mainly for fertilisers.  The schemes included also expansion of veterinary services, reclamation of marginal land and improvement of hill grazing, improved services under the farm buildings scheme and farm water supplies, disposal of sewage at creameries, heating of the Gaeltacht glasshouses, grants for factories for fancy cheeses, provision of facilities for growing onions, grants and loans to machinery contractors for lime and manure distributors, storage facilities for seed and ware potatoes, poultry development in Connemara and the provision of facilities for the production of foundation stocks of seed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had these schemes.  There is plenty of work for the Minister for Agriculture.  If he wants to increase agricultural production in the country it is by these methods it will be done. These are fundamental to increased <Col N="599" /> production.  It is up to the Minister to use the men in his Department, who are the finest body of men in any Department in this State, to put the flesh on the bones that are there.  If these schemes are gone ahead with and utilised in the proper way they will yield good dividends.</P>
    <P>Many of them are of the utmost importance and urgency at the present time.  I would advise the Minister to get cracking on some of these schemes and not allow himself to be bulldozed by his colleagues on the ministerial benches.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no bulldozing as far as we are concerned.  When a Fianna Fáil Government comes into this House there is unanimity on ministerial benches.  There is no bulldozing. We believe in the well-being of the nation.  We are of one mind on it and we know that it is only by having unanimity of outlook among Ministers that the country can succeed. It was because of that that we succeeded from 1951 to 1954 in repairing the damage that was created from 1948 to 1951.  It was only in that way it was done.  I regret to say that the same pattern is being followed in agriculture now as was followed then. I hope some speaker on the opposite benches has the courage&mdash;he will not be a farmer&mdash;to repudiate the statements I have made regarding agriculture at the present time.  If any farmer does repudiate the statement, he is no credit to the agricultural community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Before tendering my own contribution to this debate I would like to deal with a few remarks of the ex-Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Walsh.  In the course of an interjection by me which, I suppose, like all interjections, was disorderly, I stated that Deputy Walsh, when he guaranteed a price of 48/- a barrel for feeding barley, succeeded in losing somewhere between £220,000 and £225,000 on a quantity of barley <Col N="600" /> approximating to 36,000 tons and which, when examined, was found to have cost the Minister many more pounds per ton than the price which he paid for it because of excess moisture content.  At that stage Deputy Aiken intervened to say: &ldquo;I suppose Deputy Donegan objected to the farmers of County Louth getting 48/-a barrel for their feeding barley.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am proud to say that, this year, as my contribution to the Minister's effort in introducing a contract system, I have succeeded in getting one firm at least to sign contracts for a figure exactly 1/6 less&mdash;46/6 of a minimum for 8,000 barrels of feeding barley in County Louth, and I am also quite proud to say that I think I have done more for the farmers of Louth in the very short time I have been here than Deputy Aiken has done during his whole period of office.</P>

      <P>I go so far as to say that the only occasion on which I heard Deputy Aiken discuss agriculture I heard him mention wheat in hand stacks in County Louth.  I have been looking at it for 25 years, and I never saw it in a hand stack and neither did anybody else.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Not in hand stacks. In approaching this Estimate it is wise to consider the amount of money that is being voted&mdash;nearly £5,000,000. If we consider the number of males employed on the land we find that, if we dispensed with the Minister and the whole Department, and had a skeleton staff to distribute this money through the offices of the Department of Social Welfare, who would know these people who are employed on the land, all we could afford by direct subsidy would be about £10 per head. We have heard many suggestions from the opposite benches with regard to direct subsidy.  All that the direct subsidy can give the farming population of this country is £10 per head per year.  That is all it can provide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="601" /> If we are to stimulate and encourage agricultural production, one means by which we can do it is by the stimulation of reproduction, by the introduction of ground limestone to the land which, for an expenditure of £1, will give the farmer £3, by the introduction of all the other schemes which the present Minister for Agriculture initiated and which the Opposition now decry or, if they do not decry it, they try to jump on the bandwagon and take credit for it.  There is one other way, that is by the education of men's minds.  There we have the parish plan.</P>
    <P>Before I discuss either the parish plan or ground limestone I would like to discuss corn, because in County Louth we have an economy in which the production of corn is uppermost. We have this year a decline in the wheat acreage of approximately 70,000 acres and we have an increase in the barley and oats acreage, which leaves us with a greater tillage acreage than we have had before.</P>
    <P>I want to praise the Minister for Agriculture and to point out that there are six, or seven or eight counties in Ireland which, in my view, definitely subscribe to his view that the only policy for agriculture in this country is one more cow, one more sow and one more acre under the plough, but that these counties subscribe to it in a different way from that which is generally understood.  The counties to which I refer are those which invariably produce more corn and more grain than they could use&mdash;Louth, Wexford, Carlow, parts of Tipperary, parts of Cork and you know the rest.</P>
    <P>We now have a decrease in the acreage under wheat.  I am pleased to observe from the figures supplied by the Department of Agriculture for deliveries to and mill intake in respect of the 1953 harvest&mdash;which I presume is the only one we should take, last year's season being so wet&mdash;that 7.34 barrels per statute acre were delivered to the mills.  If we have to-day 400,000 acres of wheat&mdash;the Estimate of the Department of Agriculture is that we have from 370,000 to 400,000&mdash; we will have 354,000 tons of wheat to mill next harvest from Irish farms.  If <Col N="602" /> the figure is 370,000 we will still have more wheat next harvest than Fianna Fáil wanted when they issued their instructions through their various Ministries on January 17th of last year. Their figure was 300,000 tons and we have still got more.  In addition, we have more oats and more barley and it is inevitable that a great quantity of barley and oats must be marketed.</P>
    <P>The Minister has introduced the contract system.  The contract system, if it can be implemented in full in the years to come, is the ideal answer for the internal usage of our grain.  Over the last ten years we have imported maize and milo-maize to the value of approximately £5,000,000 per year. There is not the slightest reason why that £5,000,000 cannot be put into the pockets of the Irish farmers who increase tillage and subscribe to the policy of one more cow, one more sow, one more acre under the plough.</P>
    <P>The greatest contribution towards the advancement of this idea of internal usage was made by the present Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Dillon, when he introduced, in 1951, his Grain Storage Loans Bill.  As a result, we have to-day, for an expenditure, including the amount in this year's Estimate, of £1,100,000, grain storage for 100,000 tons more than we had at the end of the war.  Many thousands of tons of that grain storage can be put to the very excellent use of storing barley which can supplant our imports of maize.</P>
    <P>Our barley trade can be improved but there is only one way in which the Minister can do it.  He has subscribed towards it very fully by the introduction of the contract system.  At the moment the system does not embrace all our barley, but we hope that will be possible in the years to come.  A contract system in malt and barley is possible because one firm buys three-quarters of our entire output.  Many firms buy maize.  What is wrong with a firm in Monaghan about which I can speak using up to 20 tons of maize per day, which is approximately 6,000 tons per year, making an arrangement, if overdrafts could be guaranteed, with a firm in Ardee which can store 60,000 <Col N="603" /> barrels of grain, to supply 6,000 tons of feeding barley during the year?  The difficulties in the way of such an arrangement are that the overdraft must inevitably be guaranteed.</P>
    <P>Otherwise we hand over to men who are at the top of their business and these men will be left with the monopoly and with the right to say what we want.  If the Minister can guarantee the overdraft and suggest a means as to how such an arrangement can be implemented, there is no reason why that maize should come from Dublin port but from Louth, having been produced in Monaghan which at the moment uses much more than it produces.  I know that there are difficulties, but no man can tell what the price of maize will be in the months to come.  This 60,000 tons of maize is but one little economy; there could be hundreds of these economies, certainly tens of them.  There would be a certain gamble because of the uncertainty as to whether maize in the world market would drop or rise in the following month.  That is a problem which must be met either by arrangement with the trade or by the trade taking up a contract system.  If the Minister induces the trade to take up a contract system he will have made a contribution to agriculture which will live long after him.</P>
    <P>The Minister is to introduce a Bill in the very near future called the Seed Production Bill.  I think it is long overdue and, while speaking on the Estimate for Agriculture, I think it is not out of order to suggest that when introducing the Bill he should refer to the delay and say that he will get for the farmer the extra profit which is his due.  All over the world a system has been introduced in places where the geographical position of areas means that they are suitable for the production of seed&mdash;where, in a peninsula, pollination cannot take place. The same applies to where mountain ranges occur.  I can think of one such area which would suit the production of corn seeds&mdash;the Coolea Peninsula&mdash; where we have 470 farmers with average holdings of ten statute acres. <Col N="604" /> These farmers do not use the combine harvesters because their fields are too small.  They have not got economic holdings.  They are excellent men who farm in the traditional manner and produce grain of high quality which they market for seed.  From this area could come all the seed that this country needs.  From it could come pedigree seed of a very high quality.</P>
    <P>Speaking very seriously, I believe that this Seed Production Bill may mean one of the biggest things in agriculture we have had so far.  The present Minister is the first Minister for Agriculture who did make the farmers realise by his publicity campaign the value of the use of fertilisers and of ground limestone.  Before he became Minister there was no ground limestone and a week ago the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Flanagan, was able to make a statement that 810,000 tons of ground limestone were used last year.  That is a very happy position.  It is a still happier position to realise that we have 49 plants this year capable of producing 1,500,000 tons of ground limestone and that our output per acre should improve proportionately. We are not a rich nation.  We have to spend here at the moment £10 per male employed on the land per year.  Can you get any male employee who is satisfied with a potential increase in his income of £10?  The only way we can better that is by the use of ground limestone, by the eradication of bovine tuberculosis and by participation in all the other such schemes introduced by the Minister. A nitrogen factory is to be built. This factory should not be centralised in Dublin but should be established in some central position within easy reach of the grain growing counties.</P>
    <P>We have an awful lot to do yet.  I notice in the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i> of January 14th, 1955, an article stating that the Dutch Government has built a pilot plant to make potash from seawater. That may seem far-flung to attempt but it gives us an idea of the potential that is there and suggests that we must follow up these potentials in all parts of the world.  But the first and last law the Minister for Agriculture <Col N="605" /> must follow is that we have not got the money to give a direct subsidy for every person engaged in agriculture. And when we do subsidise such products as ground limestone and fertilisers we must ensure that when we spend a pound we may get £3 back. Our wealth is in the land and in the land alone.</P>
    <P>With regard to pigs and pig progeny testing, on Wednesday, 20th April, 1955, I addressed a question to the Minister for Agriculture asking him to state the comparative consumption of meals per lb. of live weight gain of the Large White and Landrace breed of pigs.  I could not get a list of the type of pigs generally used in this country but I am concerned that the type used should compare favourably with any pig in any part of the world, and I want the Minister to say that we are on our way to getting it as quickly as possible.  I have been very interested in this matter and in the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i> of Saturday, 19th February, 1955, there is a report of a letter addressed by Professor Helmar Clausen, director of pig progeny testing in Denmark, to a British farming paper.  Dr. Clausen stated that there are only two pedigree Large White herds left in Denmark and said that the Large White pig in Britain could be brought up to the level of the Danish Landrace by seven years' progeny testing.  We are now to have a progeny testing station and we hope that the results from it and the stock which will eventually emerge from it will improve two things&mdash;our rate of conversion and the consumption per lb. of meal.</P>
    <P>Doctor Clausen is recognised as the expert on the continent on pig progeny testing and we shall see what he had to say, as reported in the paper mentioned.  Under the heading of Landrace conversion Doctor Clausen states:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There are only two pedigree Large White herds left in Denmark. Although the Large White has had the same progeny testing facilities as the Landrace for the past 50 years, the carcase quality from the pedigree Large White herds has been lower than the carcase quality of all <Col N="606" /> commercial pigs in Denmark for the past ten years.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Doctor Clausen emphasises that there is very little relationship between show ring judging and commercial qualities in pigs.  Examination of live pigs has, however, some part to play in such matters as determining the number of teats on an animal, determining the soundness of the visual parts of the reproductory organs and in getting an idea of the constitution of the pig. He goes on to say that in Copenhagen Zoo they found a wild pig and in seven years they succeeded in bringing that pig up to standard by crossing him with a Landrace to the point where the pig had the same conversion rate as the Landrace which had been bred over 50 years before.</P>
    <P>His opinion is that the Large White will not give the same quick results. In an issue of the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i> of Saturday November 21st, 1953, there is a table of consumption of food per lb. of live-weight gain in pigs in Denmark through the years.  In 1909-1910 a lb. of pig meat was produced for every 3.77 lb. of meals consumed; in 1919-1921 that figure was down to 3.59; in 1929-1930 it was down to 3.39; in 1939-40 it was down to 3.22; and in 1951-1952 it was down to 3.05. Approximately four years ago&mdash;I cannot say the exact year, but it was either 1950 or 1951&mdash;I heard Professor Senior read a paper to the Statistical Society in which he stated that in the Albert College the rate of conversion was 1 lb.  of pig meat to every 3.8 lb. of meal fed.  Now the comparison there with 1951-1952 is 3.05.  That may seem small, but it really means that to get the same amount of pig meat the Irish farmer has to feed one ton of meal for every 16¼ cwt. that the Danish farmer has to feed.</P>
    <P>I understand that pig production has reached a stage where, if one goes in for pig production, one does not think of 20 or 40 pigs but one thinks in terms of 100, 200 or 1,000 pigs and one computes one's profit at the rate of £1 or 10/- per pig.  If the Danish and the Dutch farmer are in the happy position that they have only got to feed 16 cwt. of meal for every ton we feed, is it not <Col N="607" /> true they can cut our price on the British market?</P>
    <P>It is true that the very serious veterinary objections which the Minister mentioned in his reply to my question are there.  The British Ministry excluded the Landrace.  As I said, I hold no brief for the Landrace. The British excluded the Landrace for a period because one pig in a particular shipment was found to be suffering from rhinitis.  After a period they allowed them in and there has been no trouble since.  I think with very, very careful supervision foundation stocks from any part of the world could be brought in here.</P>
    <P>A very natural sequence of events followed on the prohibition of the Landrace from England.  There was no prohibition in the Channel Islands and astute farmers in the Channel Islands built up herds of Landrace waiting for the time when the restriction on their import to Britain would cease and they could cash in.  If it is the case that veterinary objections preclude us from taking in any pig from any part of the world, be it Large White, Landrace or anything else, which could be tested here and might possibly prove to be of better value than the pig we have, could we not bring a foundation stock to some island off the coast in order to carry out testing; that stock could be kept there in quarantine for any period of time, years if necessary?  I make that suggestion to the Minister.  I think possibly the Department of Agriculture, particularly the veterinary section of it, is a little bit stultified. Possibly the veterinary officers of the Department like to play safe; but if the farmers are going to be forced out of pig production, they cannot afford to play safe.  I think extreme measures are possibly necessary and the Minister should turn the problem over in his mind and examine it very, very carefully.</P>
    <P>Yesterday the Minister referred to a letter of Deputy de Valera's on the parish plan in which Deputy de Valera said that he had nothing against the parish plan.  Why, then, did he not implement that plan from 1951 to 1954? <Col N="608" /> Why was it jettisoned?  The cheapest commodity in the world to-day is knowledge and education.  The cheapest commodity that can be bought is knowledge.  If we have to acquire knowledge in the hard field of experience we dissipate our lives and finances in doing so.  If we can get it by contact with those who are experts, then we are fortunate indeed.</P>
    <P>The unit in this country will always be the parish.  If for every three parishes there is one expert available to the farming community, surely we will have made a step forward.  I could not care less whether these experts are attached to the Department of Agriculture or to the county committees. Whatever they are attached to, their knowledge will be passed on without bias.  Anybody who tries to come between the parish plan and the Irish farmer will be crushed inevitably.  I believe the plan will be successful.  I appeal to everyone not to detract in any way from what is at the present moment only a blueprint.  Mistakes will be made.  It will be the duty of the Deputies here to tell the Minister of those mistakes in order to have them rectified.  We cannot tell the Minister in advance what mistakes will be made since he has more knowledge at his disposal than we have.</P>
    <P>I said at the outset that the only way in which we can stimulate agriculture is by subsidy and encouragement in connection with those things which reproduce themselves.  I note in the Estimates a figure of £2,900,000 for land reclamation.  There never would have been land reclamation, notwithstanding Marshall Aid, had Deputy James Dillon not been Minister for Agriculture in the years 1948-1951 because there is not the slightest shadow of a doubt that, had the Fianna Fáil Government been in office, Deputy Lemass would have collared all that for industry and commerce. Fortunately Marshall Aid was injected into agriculture and, as a result, we are more prosperous to-day than we would otherwise have been.</P>
    <P>Any sane, thinking man knows that what I say is true.  The lime subsidy <Col N="609" /> this year will cost £600,000.  According to the Parliamentary Secretary's figure, it will probably cost more.  I hope it will cost twice as much.  No one is responsible for that lime subsidy but Deputy James Dillon, Minister for Agriculture.  As far back as the 1930's the Fianna Fáil Party had the advantage of experiments in the use of ground limestone.  For 17 years they sat, stagnant, in their benches and refused to give the Irish farmers anything except the price of a calf skin.</P>
    <P>The present Minister has been maligned in the last hour by the Opposition.  He has been described as the Minister for Grass.  An attempt was made by his predecessor to show that we are more interested in the production of cattle through grass rather than from corn.  Why then did the present Opposition when they were in Government not put through this House the Grain Storage (Loans) Act, which was passed by the inter-Party Government in 1951, and which gave the Irish farmer an opportunity of marketing his grain.  You did not do it because you had no interest in anything but votes and subsidies.  Since that Grain Storage Loans Act was introduced, a figure of £1,100,000 has been injected into it and that means that there is 100,000 tons more storage for Irish grain than there was at the end of the war and at the end of 17 years of your administration.  If that is the Minister for Grass I would like to hear the reason why he is Minister for Grass.  If he wants 100,000 tons more of Irish grain, then surely he is Minister for Corn and Minister for the Irish farmer.</P>
    <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on his very opportune and&mdash; shall we say?&mdash;certainly delayed beginning of the eradication of bovine tuberculosis scheme.  We are behind in this matter.  The countries of Canada, America, Holland and of England are far ahead.  This is a country which is producing quality beef.  We must, therefore, work for the English market and if we do not we must go to the wall.  The bovine tuberculosis scheme will certainly prove again that the Minister for Agriculture is the only man who can put Ireland on its feet.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="610" /> With regard to cattle, I heard the previous Minister for Agriculture state that Britain needed from 200,000 to 250,000 tons of beef per year.  The figure Mr. W.A. Smith, a famous agriculturist, gives is 275,000 tons of beef as the requirement of the British market.  Irish-bred beef is getting a premium for quality and Irish beef must, therefore, rely on quality.  We are getting a quality price for a quality product, and if we are, we must put it up.  Therefore, the prudent choice of the Minister for Agriculture, as mentioned in his statement yesterday, that we must all place our confidence in the Shorthorn cow is indeed most certainly a wise one.  I, like the Minister, have a couple of Friesians and I, like the Minister, would like Deputy Moher to come along and buy the bull calves.</P>
    <P>If we are to export quality beef&mdash; and here again I may get derisive howls from the Fianna Fáil Benches&mdash; I would like to ask the Minister for Agriculture to impress on the Minister for Lands that the fattening lands of County Meath are one of the most valuable assets that we have.  Every factory in this country has a finishing shop.  It would be as silly for a boot factory to close its finishing shop and sell all its production as seconds as it would be for us to divide or dissipate or in any other way touch the fattening lands of Meath and Kildare.  They must be there to fatten cattle that cannot be fattened on the land.  I can tell of a farmer in County Louth who has one field of 11 acres and it is worth more to that farmer than half his farm &mdash;and he has a very extensive farm&mdash; because every beast that passes through his hands goes through that field at some time.  In that field the grass grows for a month longer in the autumn and comes a month earlier in the spring.  That is an asset, and there are many of those assets.  I would appeal to the Minister to make representations in any way he likes to the Minister for Lands to make sure that these are not touched.</P>
    <P>With the end of the bulk-buying period, the British housewife, as I <Col N="611" /> said, has her choice.  I believe, in the trade, that if it were possible for the prices to be available to be announced in November for the following year instead of March it would give the farmer&mdash;who is really buying ahead when he buys his stores&mdash;a very great guarantee of profit.  Our production of beef is something I cannot compare with the production in England and Scotland, but I would imagine we are quite a sizable producer for the British market and perhaps it would be possible for the Minister to make representations also to the British Minister of Food that the prices should be announced months earlier if that is possible.</P>
    <P>I am proud to stand behind the Minister for Agriculture, and that is because I know why he places his faith in the land of Ireland&mdash;because his family has suffered for the land of Ireland.  I know that not two miles from where I live the present Minister for Agriculture's father was arrested and apprehended for telling the farmers that they were paying too high a rent and that they could not leave their land in the autumn better than they found it in the spring if they continued to do so.  The best way out was not to pay their rents and see what would happen.</P>
    <P>The late John Dillon received six months in Dundalk jail for that speech and I am proud to say in my parish there were 20 men to walk 20 miles behind the jail cart to the town of Dundalk and 20 men to meet him outside the jail when he came out after six months.  I know then why the Minister for Agriculture places all his faith in the land, because it is only from the land of this country we get reproduction and multiplication of our assets and finances.  I would like to ask him to redouble his efforts for the land of Ireland and if he does, then, surely he will redouble his efforts for all the people of this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to preface my remarks by saying that unlike Deputy Donegan, I do not want to be a cheer-boy of the Minister for Agriculture or any ex-Minister and any views which I put to the House are views which I <Col N="612" /> have studied and am convinced are correct.  I want to say at the outset and I want to remind every farmer Deputy on the opposite benches that, fundamentally, everything we have got here in the form of live stock has been imported from Great Britain and we have adopted the extraordinary notion that the best stud farm in the world is across the Channel.  That is to my mind a dominating fallacy in everything that has been put forward not alone from the benches opposite but from some of my colleagues on the benches here.  There is no unanimity. We should once and for all remove from our minds the fallacy that the best stud farm is the one in Great Britain.  It has been proven to us within the past ten or 15 years that is not the case, but we still refuse to accept the evidence which has been so plentifully offered to us.</P>
      <P>We have a habit here of importing an alien and wrapping the green flag round it, putting it into a shrine and then going down on our knees and worshipping it as the best in the world.  That is the mistake I think that is being made.  We in this country if we did not suffer from that inherent inferiority complex would or should examine everything objectively and see where we should go to find what by facts and figures is.  or has been proven to be, the best in anything in the form of live stock that we would import to improve our foundation stock in this country.</P>
      <P>Before I go into anything in detail I would like generally to refer to the statements made by the Minister in his opening speech.  In regard to the particular note on which he opened, he did not give me the impression that 42 inches of rainfall was an advantage to us.  He seemed to think that those people who had half that rainfall were in an advantageous position.  I hope that I did not interpret his statement incorrectly but if I am correct he seemed to imply that there was a definite disadvantage in our having here an average rainfall of 42 inches. The very opposite, of course, is the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Did he not say that <Col N="613" /> other countries would be glad to have the same?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>I may have interpreted him incorrectly.  However, I can discuss the matter from the angle that we agree that 42 inches of rainfall on an average is a decided advantage. Thinking in terms of grass we must think also in terms of grass as a commodity when measured against the uses made of it and the advantages that our competitors have in the same field.  I maintain that with that 42 inches of rainfall we have an advantage over the New Zealander.  The New Zealander may have a milder winter and he may be able to reduce labour costs by avoiding the housing of cattle in winter.  But let us not forget that in a country where such enormous strides have been made in the production of grass, and that in a scientific way, the New Zealander is exposed to one serious impediment that would not naturally affect us.</P>
      <P>The New Zealander is subjected to recurrent droughts, a calamity in many instances because you can well realise that treating grass as they do, as a crop, and not as a gift from God or an accident of nature as we do, to them grass is a highly scientific crop and a comparatively expensive one.  In a drought they are apt to lose very considerably in having their swards turned into a brown turf.  That is one of the technical advantages which we would have, had we given down through the years the attention to grass that the New Zealanders have given.  Then again we have the technical advantage that their main market is something like 14,000 miles away while ours is within 50 or 60 miles.  These are advantages which we could use from the competitive angle and if we adopted the same technique as they have in the matter of grass production we could outbid them at any time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then you have people who say the natural fertility of the soil in New Zealand is greater than the general fertility of the soil of Ireland.  That in itself is an absolute fallacy and anybody who has read Dr. Holmes's report <Col N="614" /> on conditions in New Zealand will readily realise that we have here again a decided advantage over the New Zealander.  In his report here in 1948 he summarised the matter in one sentence when he said: &ldquo;The best land in the country is growing physically as little as it is possible for it to do under an Irish sky.&rdquo;  I believe in that one sentence he summarised the position here.  He summarised basically and fundamentally the snag from which we suffer, the big impediment which has kept us out of the competitive world in so many fields.</P>
    <P>Before I leave making the comparison between this country and New Zealand let me quote what he said in his book on New Zealand soils.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">

    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quoting an extract from a report in 1948 on New Zealand soils by Dr. Holmes.  It is an excerpt which I used at column 998, Volume 146, of the Official Debates of 1st July, 1954:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The soils for the most part are poor, light sands or gravels or stiff clay, deficient in lime and phosphate. Their fertile seeming surface is due to hard toil and scientific treatment by which the farmers have sought to improve them.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Therefore, we can see that not all the advantages are on the side of the New Zealander.  We can see we have climatic and physical advantages and proximity to the main market which are major factors from the competitive angle as between ourselves and the New Zealanders but we suffer from having failed to develop their techniques in the production of grass and in the testing of soil developed a good many years ago.</P>

    <P>We have not yet scratched the surface.  Actually in this State facilities for the development of the technique of grass production are very limited.  Somebody from the opposite side may say to me: &ldquo;Did you ever hear of Johnstown Castle?&rdquo;  Of course, I did, but that is only scratching the surface of the problem.  It is a very <Col N="615" /> wide problem, one which requires regional examination and what might be suitable at Johnstown may not be suitable generally in the country.  The problem requires a very exhaustive study which has not been made so far, with the result that we are in this disadvantageous position in the matter of competing with any grass product on the English market.</P>
    <P>Besides the enormous exports of dairy products, the New Zealanders have developed the technique of allowing sheep as followers on their cattle and cow grazing lands and it might surprise Deputies opposite to know that last year they exported to Great Britain some 12,000,000 sheep carcases in addition to the enormous amount of dairy products exported from that country.</P>
    <P>Our Department of Agriculture might examine the potentialities for the increased export of mutton to Great Britain.  Our seasons are opposite to those of New Zealand&mdash;their summer season, in which they might export the bulk of their mutton, is opposite to ours, so we might come in to fill a substantial gap which remains in the imports of mutton from New Zealand to the British market.</P>
    <P>On their sheep farms they carry something like eight ewes and their lambs to the acre.  In an experiment recently in three mixed farms, the following interesting figures were produced. The three mixed farms in that recent experiment produced as follows per acre per year.  No. 1, a mixed farm, produced 142 lb.  of lamb and 110 lb.  of beef, giving a total meat output per acre of 259 lb.  On the second farm, they produced 215 lb.  of lamb and 44 lb.  of beef, giving a total output of 259 lb.  of meat per acre.  On the third farm, which was exclusively a sheep farm, they produced 254 lb.  of mutton.  One of the striking features of that table is the resemblance between the gross output in each of the three tests&mdash;you have 259 lb.  each on the farms where beef and mutton were carried as mixed live stock, and where sheep were carried exclusively you have 254 lb., just a variation of 5 lb. <Col N="616" /> In addition to that, on the first two farms there were 43 lb.  and 61 lb.  of wool, respectively, and 80 lb.  on the farm that was exclusively a sheep farm.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>We have the advantage in climate.  When I started off I prefaced my remarks, before making comparisons, by giving to the House the advantages which we have over the New Zealander.  I will summarise them again.  First of all, there are the repeated droughts which have, in a number of seasons, created devastation amongst their scientifically produced grasses.  We are not subject to that.  Another disadvantage is the distance they are from their main market &mdash;14,000 miles.  We have this market here on our doorstep.  All the advantages are on our side, if we were to adopt methods as scientific and as progressive as they have.  Again, the inherent fertility of Irish soil is far superior to that of New Zealand.  Most of the New Zealand wool and mutton is produced on the farms on the foothills. We have done nothing whatever to develop our marginal land from a scientific angle to produce mutton and wool.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>I mentioned that point. That is one of their advantages.  All they do in the winter is strap a rope on each of their animals and allow them to roam around.  That is the only disadvantage we have, if we were to develop a technique that would put us on a competitive comparison with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister when speaking yesterday gave what I consider a rather belated warning on the position that we face in regard to the competitive market in England.  We need not have waited <Col N="617" /> until yesterday to realise that ultimately we would have to face competition and that the easy going of the post-war period was bound to end.  It ended long ago in the matter of dairy products.  Every Deputy is aware that there was a time when we could sell all the cheese we could produce here, when we could sell all the milk powder we could produce; but for quite a long time we are out, out because we failed to compete, when normal conditions began to return and normal channels of supply were resumed in England. We were there merely to supply a <i>pro tem</i> need and when normal conditions returned we had to gather up our impedimenta and clear out.  I have said here before that if you fail to compete in one dairy product you fail to compete in every one, you are out for all the others.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>I would love to sit down outside this House and have an historical review with Deputy Madden, but I am afraid the Ceann Comhairle would not permit me to develop that particular thesis now.  We are out for cheese and for powdered milk and we are threatened in the chocolate crumb market.  The British at the moment are producing something like 400,000,000 gallons of milk surplus to their normal liquid requirements. Within the past year and a half they have erected five large chocolate crumb factories.  They have purchased on the island of Anglesey a particular creamery with an annual intake of 6,000,000 gallons.  They are compelled to sell any milk in excess of their liquid requirements at 1/8 a gallon and you can be certain they will produce from that milk the product which is the most profitable&mdash;and that product we know to be chocolate crumb.  They will not produce butter, because generally&mdash;there may be times when it is not&mdash;butter is one of the most depressed products into which you can manufacture milk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was an appeal by the Minister to farmers to reduce the cost of production. <Col N="618" /> That was the appeal, but there is a question which we all can answer.  I believe the Irish farmer is as ingenious and as hard-working as any farmer in the world, but he is entitled to ask one thing: &ldquo;Give us the competitive tools and we will do it.&rdquo;  He is entitled to ask that.  That is the only way he can do it.  If he has not got a conversion unit comparable with out competitors, then do not blame him if he is not able to compete.</P>
    <P>In my speech on this Estimate last year I was subjected to what one might call an inquisition by the Minister for Agriculture.  I am glad to say that, in his reply, he was gracious enough to pay me a tribute, for if I had expounded a certain thesis I was prepared to defend it.  So far as agriculture is concerned, I have not the slightest intention of being a cheer boy to any particular individual in this House.  When I come here I propose to say what I believe to be true.</P>
    <P>I think that if we had from all sides of the House the same approach we might, together, do something that would fundamentally change the structure of Irish agriculture.  We might do something that would return us to that competitive place in the dairying world which we held many years ago and from which we are now hurled.  I would never be the one to come here and preach defeatism and say that there is no road back.  I will have the honour to disagree with some of the statements made by the Minister for Agriculture before I sit down&mdash;not because I am speaking from this side of the House but because I believe that some of the statements he made are a fallacy and a heresy.</P>
    <P>When we speak of grass one of the points one must put to oneself is, of course, that if we produce more grass we must have something to eat it.  If we adopt the grass technique it should be co-ordinated with the development of and the increase in our live stock. There would be no use in our introducing an improved grass technique without, at the same time, increasing the number of animals we could set out on it.</P>
    <P>The Minister and other Deputies <Col N="619" /> have spoken about extending the beef industry, about going in and taking that red meat deficit which is there for the taking in Great Britain.  Do we not know that we cannot have an extended beef industry without, at the same time, having an extended dairying industry? Does the one thing not hinge on the other?  If we have, roughly, 1,250,000 cows, and if we can produce the maximum number of calves from this 1,250,000 cows do we not know that is the limit and that we cannot have an increased beef industry without an extended dairying industry?  If we follow the general pattern which is being set in this country of the grazier in the flatlands and the midlands waiting for the calf as the by-product of the dairying industry then we cannot have an extended beef industry with-cut having an extended dairying industry.  The one thing hinges on the other and if you argue anything else then you are arguing in terms that are contradictory.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister repeated it in this House but recently he made a speech in which he suggested that it would be wise for us to suckle some of our calves to dairy cows.  With that, again, I thoroughly disagree.  Remember, if the small farmer in the South took the Minister's advice and decided to suckle some of his calves under his dairy cows it would automatically reduce the number of calves going into the grazing areas. Do Deputies not see what would happen?  There is no use in our talking about introducing a better grass technique if, for instance, the farmers in my area of east Cork decided to put four or five cows on their holdings to be suckled by calves.  It would automatically reduce the number of calves going out of the dairying areas and that would be reflected in the number of stores available to the grazing areas.</P>
    <P>If the Minister said: &ldquo;If you want to increase the number of live stock, if you want to increase our gross output in beef, then my advice to the people on the grazing lands is to suckle the pure beef calf under the pure beef cow,&rdquo; they would not do it.  A farmer <Col N="620" /> in the North Dublin area once said to me: &ldquo;You could not do that on my land.  My land is too good.  I would not waste my land doing a thing like that.  Anyway, I cannot.  Young cattle under a year old do not thrive there.&rdquo; A question which posed itself to me immediately in regard to that particular farmer's statement was whether, despite all his praise of his land, the land was suffering from mineral deficiency.  We know that animals under a certain age will not survive on lands that are deficient in minerals.</P>
    <P>We also know that animals beyond a certain age will thrive on lands where there are certain mineral deficiencies. I submit that the Minister's suggestion was prompted by the statement I made from these benches last year that any Minister for Agriculture would regard an excess of dairy products as something radioactive in his Department.  The Minister did not want any fissionable material in his Department.  I submit he made the suggestion in the hope that a certain amount of milk would be consumed in the dairying areas in producing that type of calf.</P>
    <P>There is another reason why I should nail such a suggestion on the spot.  You cannot have a beef economy based on small farmers.  You can only have a mixed farming and dairying economy on the small farm and the reasonably comparative figures between the income per acre from milk and beef&mdash;these are approximations which could be worked out much more closely, but it will be found that I am not far wrong&mdash;are that milk will give roughly £33 per acre and beef, even at to-day's high prices, an average of something like £18 per acre.  That is why the small man cannot survive as a beef rancher.  You cannot survive as a beef rancher unless you have the broad acres.</P>
    <P>Yesterday the only intervention I made was when the Minister was enunciating some of his live-stock theories.  He did ask me whether I do this and whether I do that, and I made a promise then that, when I came to speak, I would deal with the interjection I made in a detailed and exhaustive way and in a far more <Col N="621" /> satisfactory way than I could deal with it by way of interjection or interruption during the Minister's speech.  I want to say that the Minister is one of the greatest live-stock heretics in the country, and he is a wilful heretic, in that he enunciates a belief without producing any concrete evidence to prove it.  If I were to get up on this side, I could &ldquo;blah&rdquo; back in the very same way and we would still get nowhere.  I do not know who would be impressed in the end, but the Minister's rhetorical ability might come out on top.  Stripped of his rhetorical gymnastics, however, the only way I can endeavour to compete with him&mdash;&mdash;</P>

To the person who thinks in terms not of rhetoric but of mathematics, it was red murder, and 500 or 600 students at the back cheered him to the echo.  He made one glowing statement after another about dairy Shorthorns and about the brown boots, navy blue suits and fedora hats of the farmers' sons. He was cheered to the echo.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Stripped of all the rhetoric and all the rhetorical gymnastics, his speech yesterday might be summarised as saying to poor old Cait Ni Houlihan: &ldquo;Keep on the black.&rdquo;  That is the substance of what he said.  Gone are the days of that second flood.  We will <Col N="622" /> drown them in eggs, he said; we will smother them with bacon; and we will choke them with butter.</P>

      <P>The worst of it is that the thing has recoiled like a boomerang on us and to-day the farmers are in the unfortunate position that they find themselves plastered with eggs, scalded in bacon fat and floating in butter fat.  That is the position we find ourselves in to-day.  The Minister was entitled to his little political frolic, but one of the things with which I disagree is that, on such an important Estimate &mdash; the foremost Minister in this country, no matter what place convention gives him in the Cabinet, is the Minister for Agriculture, because he is the Minister who directs the country's basic industry and the Minister on whose success or failure the whole economic structure of the country survives or crumbles&mdash;the Minister should come in here and use the occasion of the making of his statement on such an important matter as the Estimate for his Department as a political score-off on his opponents.  It is bad form.  For that reason, I do not want to do or say anything which I have already condemned, but I do want to say that, in making his comparison, the Minister cited the worst weather year in a half century.  He quoted the year 1948, but he forgot one thing, that Irish agriculture had gone through a telling time&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;between 1939 and 1945.  He forgot to mention that the farmers had dissipated the only real wealth they owned, the accumulated fertility of their soil.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>They dissipated that fertility in feeding the non-agricultural sections of our community.  Everyone <Col N="623" /> will agree that, in the main, they unselfishly and magnanimously dissipated that reserve to provide food for the non-agricultural sections and to make us the best-fed people in Europe.  If, in 1948, we did not have the production figures which we could have this year or last year, the main and fundamental reason was that we had dissipated the accumulated reserves in our soil for the common good.</P>
      <P>When the Minister referred to breeds I was confused by his statement and I will possibly clear my rather impregnable cranium when I have an opportunity of reading his speech in the Official Report.  But one of the things that we need never be afraid of, no matter what our foundation stock is, is the Hereford or Aberdeen Angus, because these are two breeds that continually colour mark, and you cannot mongrelise those two breeds.  We have to accept the idea that our farmers are mature and intelligent, and we cannot make statements implying that the use of the Aberdeen Angus and Hereford bulls would ruin our foundation stock.  Any farmer has the means available to him of preserving the foundation stock, no matter what that stock is, because if there are Friesians in some of our artificial insemination stations, there are always Shorthorn bulls there.</P>
      <P>I do not claim that I am an authority, but I do claim that I have normal powers of observation.  My association with farmers and farming is such as to make me believe that the farmers are intelligent enough not to be treated by people who look down their noses and speak about them as if they were subnormal or imbeciles.  Any dairy farmer in this country will do one thing if he is wise, he will produce his own replacements, because it is the only guarantee he has against his stock being completely wiped out by the scourge of abortion.  You show me any farmer who has made a habit of going to the fairs and purchasing his replacements. One of the things you can be certain of is that he will do it until he has been taught his lesson, and he will be scourged off the face of the earth by that awful disease, contagious abortion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="624" /> Let us assume that our dairy farmers are intelligent enough to produce, no matter what their foundation stock is, their own replacements.  The facilities are available now at the artificial insemination stations.  There is no use in trying to confuse the issue, and talking about mongrelising a breed by the use of Aberdeen Angus and Hereford bulls, because we have the advantage that they are breeds that colour mark.</P>
    <P>Let me issue one warning to the Minister: the greatest crime ever committed against the foundation stock of this country, and which is still being perpetuated, was the introduction of the Scotch beef bull.  That wretched animal ruined our dairy herds because that was one breed which did not colour mark.  We had unscrupulous individuals in this country who brought these Scotch beef bulls into the dairying areas, mated them with Shorthorns and went to the fairs and sold their progeny in-calf to honest-to-god dairymen. That is a breed of cattle that the Minister should outlaw.  That is one breed which has done most damage to the foundation stock, to the Irish dairy Shorthorn.  I say these things from my own experience.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Smith was Minister for Agriculture, I wrote a letter to him pointing out the danger and the devastation created by this Scotch beef bull in the dairying areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>I did.  I can at least claim that I was partly responsible for the withdrawal of the Scotch beef bulls from the dairying areas, but one of the first actions of the present Minister for Agriculture, when he went into office, was to sign a document on the dotted line for the return of the Scotch beef bull.  He now talks about mongrelising breeds.  Let us be clear on that, let us agree on that, let us not listen to the vested interests.  If we have an interest in preserving the dairy Shorthorn stock, let us get rid of the Scotch beef bull.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I spoke on the Minister's Estimate last year I spoke at considerable length.  I produced a considerable <Col N="625" /> amount of data, and made available, and placed on the record, the comparative yields and the comparative features of certain breeds of cattle.  I am not going to be tempted to repeat the same thing in my contribution this year.  I emphasise that I made available to the record and to this House a wealth of data discrediting in the main, the shorthorn cow as a dairy animal.  To-night, in this House, I am going to produce conclusive evidence, apart from the very loose statements and blah which will discredit the dairy shorthorn even as a beef animal.  When I have done that, we will have got rid of this phantom, once and for all.  I have discredited it in last year's report.  I would like anyone who should examine what I am going to say now, to examine it against the background of what I said last year, otherwise I might be tempted to repeat what I said last year, and subject the House to what might be an endurance test.  I have not the slightest intention of doing that.  I thoroughly disagree with all this howling and shouting and clamour about the dual purpose Shorthorn.  The Minister there is a heretic amongst heathens, and a proselytiser amongst believers.</P>
    <P>I give my views without reference to anybody, but I must, in speaking in this debate, address myself to the opening speech of the Minister.  I propose to give my views, and to produce facts and figures to substantiate them.  I will not try to get away with it, because I am not such a good performer as to get away with oratorical blah.  Where I fail in my rhetorical set up I have to fall back, to supplement it, by my knowledge of mathematics.</P>

      <P>When I was speaking last year, I set out to prove that we had not or could not get in England a Shorthorn blood that we could ever hope would put us in the position of producing a competitive dairy cow.  I can only repeat a table which I gave on that particular occasion.  It was a report of the progeny tested by the British Milk Marketing Board.  The <Col N="626" /> number of pedigree bulls surveyed in the case of the Friesian breed was 3,281; bulls whose daughters averaged over 350 lb.  of butter fat, 621, or 19 per cent. ; bulls whose daughters averaged over 400 lb.  of butter fat, 141, or 4.9 per cent.  Dairy Shorthorns: numbers of bulls surveyed, 2,140; number of bulls whose daughters averaged over 350 lb.  of butter fat, 23, or 1 per cent.: number of daughters with average of 400 lb.  butter fat, 2, or .01 per cent.  Jersey: 962 bulls producing 159 daughters with an average of over 350 lb. butter fat, or 16.5 per cent. ; and with daughters over 400 lb.  of butter fat, 65 or 6.7 per cent.</P>
      <P>These figures would seem to prove that even in England, the fount of our supply of dairy Shorthorn bulls, there is not available a bull which would put us on a competitive basis or give us a cow that would be competitive from the dairy angle.  Last year, I argued and produced data to show the superiority of the Dutch Friesian.  I specifically and intentionally mentioned the words &ldquo;Dutch Friesian&rdquo; because we know that the British Friesian was developed without any reference to contour.  We know that they thought only in terms of producing the maximum amount of milk.  We know that they ended up with an animal that carried a very high maintenance which was a loose, badly shaped, ramshackle cow.</P>
      <P>We know that to improve that breed they started some years ago by importing into Great Britain a number of Dutch Friesian bulls with certain genetical features that might in the main be used to repair the defects that are general in the Friesian breed in England.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yesterday, the Minister spoke about the Friesians in England and used a phrase which I cannot recollect.  I do not know the phrase but if the Minister gives it to me I will repeat it.  I do not know what the Minister called them.  In any event it was not very complimentary.  Deputy Donegan, being the cheer boy of the Minister, said he had a few more Friesian bullocks which he staggered and straddled around the place.  All those statements are loose <Col N="627" /> statements.  The Minister referred me to the cattle people.  Why should I go to the vested interests to look for confirmation or denial of anything when you have facts produced without prejudice to any breed, facts which are produced and correlated on the performance and merit of the respective breeds tried out.</P>
    <P>In my contribution to this debate last year I produced ample evidence to prove the superiority of the Friesian as a milker.  I will now produce some evidence to prove the superiority of the Friesian as a store animal.  The Minister is aware and any person who has made a study of the subject or who has gone after the facts will be aware that there are two outstanding surveys. There is nothing in this country that the Irish Department of Agriculture can produce by way of substantiation or refutation of any statement which is being made by any particular individual in regard to the beef qualities of any particular breed. Nothing has been done.</P>
    <P>Yet we have responsible people going about the country&mdash;I am sure there are people who have done so on this side of the House as well&mdash;heretics amongst the heathens and proselytisers amongst the believers.  That is the position.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="628" /> I know there are people in my own Party whose outlook is purely parochial. It is no use for me to try to get the man in Kildare, Meath or Westmeath to accept my view but there are none so blind as those who will not see.  There is no cure for invincible blindness.  Those people will refuse to accepts facts and figures.  They will accept the blah of the Minister for Agriculture.  If he goes into any of those places and puts up another one of his performances it will be accepted in the main but where has it got us? As a performer, the Minister will be given the laurels but where has it got us?  It has got us nowhere.</P>
    <P>The Minister came in yesterday and quoted facts and figures.  He quoted one figure after another.  Plus, plus, plus.  That is what we got.  Remember that there is an O.E.E.C.  report published recently.  The accepted figure for the physical volume of our increase is something around 8 per cent.  There is an O.E.E.C.  report published recently which puts the average increase, even amongst the devastated countries in Europe, at 30 per cent. So I ask, have we any reason, have we any right, to be complacent?  We have not.  There is no use in any of us putting up stage shows or counter-shows. We will have to face the facts and we will have to do something fundamental to alter it.</P>

      <P>The Minister stated that he had invited in here Dr. John Hammond.  I am terribly sorry that 25 years ago, poor and all as we were, we did not buy him in here.  If we had we would be in a very different position from what we are to-day.  When he does come, he will produce facts and figures and he will not accept blah. You will get facts and figures.  I had the most extraordinary privilege of listening to Dr. Hammond on one particular occasion when he was invited by the dairy Shorthorn breeders.  I do not know who invited him but, whoever did, committed a shocking <i>faux pas,</i> because for two hours he produced one chart after another, one set of figures after another, at the Dairy Shorthorn Breeders' Congress, and everything he produced was most devastating as far as the dairy Shorthorn was concerned.</P>
      <P>On the same day I had two contrary experiences.  I will never forget it.  I listened to an economist talking on costings as a price-fixing medium and, having spoken for two hours and having subjected us all to the most shocking endurance test, he concluded by saying that if costings are to be used as a price-fixing medium then the price must be fixed at the lowest price on the costings index; otherwise you will put 50 per cent.  of the people concerned in producing the particular commodity out of business.  When he said that I turned to a newspaper reporter who was sitting beside me and said to him: &ldquo;Will you head that &lsquo;Premium on Inefficiency&rsquo;?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Dr. Hammond, as far back as 1946, made a statement which has echoed and re-echoed.  I think I quoted it in this House last year.  He said: &ldquo;A cow, to be dual purpose to-day&rdquo;&mdash; remember, that was in 1946&mdash;&ldquo;must produce 1,000 gallons and at the same time a reasonably good steer.&rdquo;  I doubt if he has altered his views since. I do not anticipate what his report to the Minister will be but I would like to know what the Minister's reaction will be when he will say to him, &ldquo;A cow, to be a dual purpose to-day, must produce 1,000 gallons of milk and at the same time a reasonably good steer.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="630" /> One of the things we do know is that there is not Shorthorn blood available which will give us that 1,000 gallons and at the same time a good steer.  That is one of the things we know.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>Wait now one minute.  I am not going to use, by way of reply, some statement that I cannot substantiate. There are available, we know, two surveys which long ago discredited the dairy Shorthorn as a superior store.  I spoke on this subject last year.  I am not concerned about the milk yield any more because on that occasion I produced facts and figures to substantiate my arguments.  The figures are available for anybody who wants to make a serious study of tests carried out over an extended period on various breeds of cattle.  One of those tests has been going on for six years and is now almost completed and when the Minister meets Dr. Hammond let him ask him about the Brookes and Vincent survey which has been conducted on quite a number of cattle of different breeds under the supervision of somebody who is above question and above approach, namely, Dr. Hammond himself.  Those figures are devastating as far as the dairy Shorthorn is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would bring the survey into the House and I would attempt to analyse it if it were not for the difficulty of handling figures in a debate.  One would need a blackboard and to produce charts and classifications.  For that reason I avoided using the Brookes and Vincent Survey.  The tests are carried out on varying planes <Col N="631" /> of nutrition, a factor which would make it too complicated to use it for the purpose for which I would love to use it.  There is also available something that is slightly easier to handle, that is, the results of a survey made on an experimental farm at Malton in Yorkshire.</P>
    <P>That survey will stultify the Minister and will explode his cock-sureness about the dual-purpose Shorthorn as a milk animal and, in the main, as a beef animal.  And that is all I am concerned with when speaking on this Estimate because I do not want to repeat or reiterate arguments I put forward in regard to comparative yields of different breeds of cattle from the dairying angle.  Let me give the reference.  The experiments were conducted in the experimental station in Malton in Yorkshire and a summary of the report is available to anybody who would go to the trouble of looking it up in the Survey of the British Association of Animal Production, 1954.  You will get the survey in that.  In the main, here are the comparative figures and I shall try, for the purpose of the record, to give them under different headings.</P>
    <P>First of all, there is the breed or cross of cow.  Then, No. 1 on the survey is the calf.  No. 2 is the cost of feeding.  No. 3, the cost of finishing on grass.  No. 4 is the average income produced, and No. 5 gives the profit. I think myself that for the purpose of this debate this is a very comprehensive survey.  In the case of the dairy Shorthorn calf we have first of all the price at £6 7s.  6d.</P>

      <P>The survey was published in the Survey of the British Society of Animal Production of 1954 so that you can assume that this survey goes on year after year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>So that these figures would probably relate to 1953 or early 1954?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>Probably, or even before then.  For the purpose of the survey, 12 of each of the breeds or crosses which I shall name were picked at random and were costed.  I shall quote only the figures given and these, in the main, are relative.  It does not matter what the cost is for the purpose of the survey, provided the costs of the calves are relative.  Will the Minister agree there?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should prefer to listen with attention to what the Deputy has to say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>For the purpose of the survey, if the price of the different breeds or crosses are relative it will not fundamentally alter the findings of the survey.  The cost of the dairy Shorthorn calf was £6 7s.  6d.  The cost of its feeding was £63 16s.  4d.  The cost of finishing on grass was £2 15s.  4d. The average income produced was £76 15s.  10½d., and the profit was £4 0s.  11½d.  That is item No 1.</P>
      <P>The next taken was the Friesian. The cost of the calf was £4 10s.  10d, so you see the relative cost remains the same.  The cost of feeding was the same at £63 16s.  4d.  The cost of finishing on grass was also the same at £2 15s.  4d.  The average income produced was £89 10s.  0½d.  The profit was £18 7s.  6½d.  Does that shake the Minister?  In the case of the pure Hereford the cost of the calf was £6 13s.  10d.  The cost of feeding was the same but there was a slight variation in the cost of finishing on grass which in this case was £2 13s.  10d The average income produced was £86 13s.  11½d.  and the profit was £13 9s.  11½d.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of the Hereford Shorthorn cross, and this is coming very near home, the cost of the calf was £6 8s.  8d.  Feeding cost £63 16s.  4d. the same as in the other cases, finishing <Col N="633" /> on grass was £2 15s.  4d., the average income produced was £88 6s.  8d.  and the profit was reckoned at £15 6s.  4d.  The Hereford Friesian cross calf cost £5 7s.  4d.  The feeding cost £63 16s.  4d., the cost of finishing on grass was £2 13s.  8d., the average income produced was £88 6s.  4d.  and the profit was £16 9s.  0d.</P>
    <P>Twelve animals in each breed were taken and the conclusive result was that the Friesian brought a profit of £14 6s.  7d.  more than the dairy Shorthorn. Make it up.  Now here is a further table which should be of interest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I interrupt the Deputy to ask if his thesis is that the Friesian is the ideal dual-purpose cow?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>The Dutch Friesian.  I argued last year that the Dutch Friesian cow was a superior animal to the Shorthorn as a milk animal.  Now I am pursuing the other prong of the fork in quality and I am pursuing it by way of figures and saying that the Friesian&mdash;and this is not the Dutch Friesian&mdash;is a superior animal as a dual-purpose animal&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>And a number of people much more competent than you or I and better informed on genetics have been in violent collision on the question of whether a cow should be a pure dairy animal or&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is now proceeding to prove that the Friesian is a dual-purpose cow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not.  Dr. Hammond in 1946, put forward a theory about the dual-purpose animal.  The dairy cow, I would argue, is the 1,600 or 1,800 gallon cow, and I would be very slow to say that that rim-racker <Col N="634" /> would produce good stores.  If you study even the first-class dairy Shorthorn, one of the things you suspect immediately and one of the things of which you are afraid is whether or not that animal will produce a good store. Here you have not alone my word for it, but you have the facts and figures produced by an impartial examining body.</P>
      <P>There is one factor into which the survey is only examining at the moment, and that is grading.  Grading is an important factor but, remember, we have the figures of profit, and those are much more conclusive than any new statements made as against one breed or another.  I have here a table showing average weights and ages at maturity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will, I hope, excuse me if I interrupt.  What is the Deputy trying to prove?  I want to understand his argument.  Is he arguing in favour of the Friesian?  Is his argument that, by and large, the Friesian is the nearest approach there is to a dual-purpose cow?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>The Friesian is one breed, and I will produce evidence to prove this, which is superior to the dairy Shorthorn as a dual-purpose cow, as distinct from a purely dairy animal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is possible, then, to get a dual-purpose cow, and the Friesian is the best?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and the figures I am producing are good enough, I think, to clinch the argument.  Next year, if the Minister and I are still above the ground, I will not have the slightest hesitation in coming in here and producing all the available data I can get to show the merits of the Red Dane as a dual-purpose cow.  One of the things I have noticed when examining the available statistics is that the Red Dane has a lower food consumption than the Friesian; that is a factor which will have to be considered in arguing the respective merits of any of the big breeds as dual purpose animals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will give the table now.  The average age and weights at time of <Col N="635" /> maturity were: dairy Shorthorn, 2 years 235 days, 10½ cwt.; Friesian, 2 years 317 days, 12½ cwt.; Hereford&mdash; that is pure Hereford&mdash;2 years 273 days, 11¼ cwt.  One will notice that in the actual maturing time there is only a variation of weeks.  Observe the variation in weight.  The Hereford Shorthorn, at 2 years 280 days, weighs 11½ cwt.; the Hereford Friesian cross, 2 years 273 days, 11¾ cwt.  I would not be so rash in the light of statistics of that kind, resulting from an experiment carried out over a considerable period, and with 12 animals out of each category at a time, as to shout too loudly about breeds.  If one wants to boost the dual-purpose Shorthorn, why is a set of figures not produced to confirm or repudiate the statistics I have given?  Surely we are as competent to carry out a test here as the people across the water.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What do those figures prove?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not anticipate the question, but I have compiled some data.  I listened to the Minister here last evening.  One of the disadvantages of coming into the debate too soon after the Minister has spoken is that one does not have time to analyse the Minister's speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>This is merely an extension of the speech I made last year on the Minister's Estimate.  On that occasion I dealt exclusively with the comparative merits of different breeds from the purely dairying angle.  To complete the other prong in connection with duality, I come in now to substantiate my thesis and I argue that the Friesian, particularly the Dutch Friesian, is a superior milk animal as compared with the dairy Shorthorn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="636" /> I want to explode the fallacy in relation to the superiority of the Shorthorn and to put forward facts and figures which show that the Friesian store is superior to the dual purpose Shorthorn store.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I challenge the Minister in his reply to produce evidence on behalf of the Shorthorn. Let him try to get it in this country; he will not get it, because it is not there.  The Minister cannot wave a wand and find the evidence.  There is no data available.  There is a figure down in the Albert College of something over 700 gallons for 63 cows. One of the features of the Albert College is that the culling rate has been very high.  It has never been known for a Shorthorn heifer to be sold out of the place because the culling rate is so high.  The butter fat is something like 3.6 per cent.  If one goes back on the figures one will find that the average yields are on the decline.  I never consider places like the Albert College for comparison purposes because from a commercial angle they are absolutely useless.  I quoted Goldsmith on a previous occasion here; he said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The robes which wrapped their limbs in silken sloth,</P>
      <P>Have robbed the neighbouring fields of half their growth.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That paints the picture so far as places like the Albert College, and some other places in the country, are concerned.  I do not believe you can get the same efficiency in a State-controlled institution that you get in a unit run for a different purpose and on different lines, and the figures obtainable from such places are, therefore, <Col N="637" /> quite useless.  I got a hold of this survey and I was not satisfied, for I knew that in coming to this House I would probably be under fire from every experienced parliamentarian.</P>
    <P>I went to the trouble, not alone of examining the survey but of working out all possible deductions from the survey.  I went as far as to analyse the live weight gain per day in that survey and here are the figures, which are irrefutable.  First is the Friesian on top with a live weight gain per day of 1.34 lb.  Now talk of rim-rackers or whatever you choose to call them with a live weight gain of 1.34 lb.  a day! No. 2&mdash;you had a Hereford Friesian cross second on the list at 1.3 lb.  per day.  No.  3&mdash;you had a Hereford-Shorthorn cross&mdash;and that should be of particular interest to us&mdash;third on the list at 1.27 lb.  live weight gain per day.  These are all average weights obtained from each of the crosses of the breeds picked at random; they were randomised for the purposes of the survey and the average figure for 12 of each of the classes or breeds or crosses surveyed was taken.</P>
    <P>You had as No. 3 the Hereford-Shorthorn cross at 1.27 lb.  per day, and No. 4, a pure Hereford, at 1.25 lb. per day.  Last on the list&mdash;No. 5&mdash;you have the dairy Shorthorn at 1.1 lb. per day.  These figures are not mine; they are figures of the survey and are absolutely irrefutable, and in two or three years' time we will have from that very same station not alone this data, but we will have also the gradings of the animals, because that, at the moment, is a further addition to this survey.</P>
    <P>I have produced this survey as an answer to all the loose talk and blah which we have been hearing down through the years.  In this country we make statements and we have not a fact or a figure to support these statements which are repeated and parroted everywhere.  I think Grange is in operation as an A.I.  centre for five years&mdash;and I am not at all happy about our A.I.  centres.  Grange has been in operation for a considerable length of time and, by now, if the business was organised as it should be <Col N="638" /> organised, we should have available a considerable amount of data on bulls, but we have not a figure from them. We are no better than we were with the Shorthorn bulls which were licensed at beauty contests at the cross-roads. As far as I can see, the amount of data available is so small that the most we can say of A.I.  stations is that we have changed the tactics and have been using them for the purpose of mechanised mating.  That is what has been going on.  We have so little data available from them.</P>
    <P>We are aware that something has been done down at Grange by way of trying to prove some bulls and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am as much concerned about Mitchelstown as anyone, because I was one of the pioneers in bringing an A.I.  station to Mitchelstown and when the first one was opened, remember A.I.  had not the benediction of the Irish Department of Agriculture at the time, and when the Minister for Agriculture came into office in 1948, it did not have his benediction.</P>

      <P>Was not Ballyclough the first one?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>Ballyclough was not opened by the Department of Agriculture at all.  The spade work of A.I. was done in this country by the Irish Agricultural Society.  I do not want to misquote facts, but the Minister will admit that he was not in favour of A.I.  when he came into office.</P>

      <P>What progeny-testing had you done in Mitchelstown?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall come to that, too, and I can produce here figures from my own herd, which show that they have done something in Mitchelstown that they have not done at Grange.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Minister came into office in 1948 remember A.I.  had not the benediction of the Irish Department of Agriculture.  They would not touch the thing.  It was dynamite and when the station was opened at Ballyclough there was a hush-hush about it and <Col N="639" /> such talk about the business that was going on behind the high walls that the farmers passing by blessed themselves with their left hands.  That was the kind of prejudice we had to face.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy tell me what is the significance of blessing yourself with your left hand?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>I remember on one occasion speaking to an audience of farmers on what I had learned by studying A.I. in countries where it had been long since developed, and when the meeting was over a school-teacher came over to me and said: &ldquo;Look here, we want no bolshevism in this country&rdquo;.  He also said: &ldquo;I shall have you reported to the Professor of Moral Theology at Maynooth&rdquo;.  I went home with the fear that I was going to be put on the pyre and burned at the stake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="640" /> When the Minister came into office in 1948, he was not then a believer in A.I.  and only became a convert when he went to America and saw A.I. demonstrated everywhere he went.  It was only then he started things moving in Merrion Street.  Then what happened?  I shall tell the whole story.  One thing happened that I had always hoped for&mdash;that the big societies in this country would do something to help the small societies. That was something I had always hoped for.  At Mitchelstown we did develop our A.I. station and I am glad, despite all the abuse that was hurled at me at the time, that I was one of the people who was associated with the station at the outset.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; the Committee to sit again.</P>
