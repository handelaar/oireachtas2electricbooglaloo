      <P>Omnibus fares between the corporation housing areas and the city are, however, lower than the fares charged for corresponding distances on other routes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The present shortage of trained national teachers is not due to any shortage of suitable candidates for admission to training but to the fact that the existing accommodation in the training colleges proved insufficient for requirements. Already, arrangements have been made to increase considerably the number of places in the colleges and the question of making good the shortage of qualified teachers is receiving the urgent attention of my Department.</P>
      <P>As regards the question of parity of salary between, on the one hand, national teachers and, on the other, secondary and vocational teachers, a claim in relation to this matter has been submitted by the Irish National Teachers' Organisation to the recently established Conciliation Council for National Teachers and will be the subject of discussion by the council at an early date in accordance with the terms of the approved scheme.  It would not be proper for me to comment further on the matter at this stage.</P>

      <P>Boyle Post Office is a departmentally staffed office.  The grading of the postmaster in charge of the office was changed, on the occurrence of a vacancy in January, 1954, from Class V to Class VI (a).  This change was part of a general reclassification of postmasterships made in agreement with staff representatives under the Civil Service Scheme of Conciliation and Arbitration.  An internal reorganisation of the office consequent upon it enabled one supervisory post to be suppressed and one post office clerk post to be transferred to another office.  There has been no alteration in the services given to the public or in the remuneration of the staff other than the postmaster.</P>

A standard was agreed by an international organisation at which Ireland was represented &mdash;it is not an official organisation&mdash;and the minimum definition of blindness which was urged for acceptance by the Governments of the different countries represented was as follows: (a) total absence of sight; or (b) visual acuity not exceeding three-sixtieths or ten two-hundredths (Snellan) of normal vision in the better eye with correcting lenses; or (c) serious limitation in the field of vision generally not greater than 20 degrees.

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that there is inevitable delay in giving effect to a new scheme of this kind.  Applicants found eligible for allowances will be paid retrospectively to the date of application.</P>

    <Title>Customs (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1954 (Continuance) Bill, 1955&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Sweetman) Gerard Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Sweetman)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The Customs (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1945 was due to expire on the 31st March, 1950, and was continued in force by the Customs (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1945 (Continuance) Act 1950, for five years, that is to say, until the 31st of the present month.  The purpose of the Bill which I now ask this House to pass is to continue the life of that Act for a further 12 months.  The Act of 1945 contains the main body of statutory provisions which are required for the enforcement of prohibition on the export of goods, together with a number of amendments to the law dealing with other customs matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Act had its origin in the need for a code of export law which became apparent during the emergency years. There were already in force sufficient provisions dealing with offences, penalties <Col N="20" /> and seizures in relation to import smuggling, but it was only as a result of the emergency conditions arising during the war that it became necessary to have some analogous provisions in respect of export smuggling. The 1945 Act was originally intended as a permanent Act, but in the course of discussion in this House at that time it was agreed to restrict it for a period.  The period, as I said, was later extended from 1950 to the end of the present financial year.</P>
    <P>I hope to be in a position before this time next year to bring to the House proposals for more permanent legislation and it is pending those proposals that I am asking the House now to extend the existing provisions for a further 12 months.  The position in regard to export smuggling has eased somewhat since the 1945 Act, but all the same there is a necessity to have provisions of some nature to deal with export smuggling.  The old provisions that were there prior to 1945 were repealed when that Act went through the Oireachtas and the position that exists at present is one that must be covered either by a permanent Act or by the extension of the present Act for a further period of 12 months.  In the present circumstances, I think it would be better to prolong the existing Act for a period of 12 months and then this time next year we can consider what would be the best basis upon which to frame our permanent legislation to deal with this problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say the Minister gave us very meagre information about the necessity of extending this Act for another 12 months.  He says the situation has eased somewhat.  To what extent has it eased and to what extent does he calculate that there is export smuggling going on?  For instance, a number of people would be interested to know what is his estimate in regard to tea export smuggling and how many sums of three shillings are the people of the Twenty-Six Counties paying by way of taxation in order to subsidise the drinking of tea in the Six Counties? I think those figures would be interesting and the Minister should have the figures which would form the <Col N="21" /> basis of a reasonable calculation as to how much of this smuggling is going on, how much, in fact, the smuggling of tea is costing the taxpayers here. There are a number of other commodities that to our general knowledge are being exported and it would be helpful to the consideration of this problem if the Minister would give us his best calculations on these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid the gentlemen who indulge in smuggling hardly fill up statistical returns showing the amount that they have brought out of the country in a manner that would enable me to give any satisfactory estimate.  Candidly, from the best information we are able to obtain, I do not think that there is very much smuggling of tea, but I feel there very easily might be if the restrictions existent in the 1945 Act and continued in the 1950 Act were relaxed.  That is one of the reasons why I think it is better that we should rely for the moment on the tried provisions rather than that at this stage we should introduce new provisions in a more permanent form.</P>
      <P>I feel also that the House would probably wish that when the permanent legislation is introduced the minimum of inconvenience should be involved, the minimum that will be compatible with the necessity to stop smuggling. It is, of course, very difficult at any time to form any estimate of the amount that is involved, but the best advice I can get in respect of tea is that there has not been much smuggling but, equally, that there would be some considerable danger if conditions were relaxed.</P>
      <P>So far as export smuggling in general is concerned, as the Deputy is aware, the position in regard to supplies has eased somewhat and obviously the position in that respect is one that is most likely to obviate the incentive, and once the incentive is removed that, indeed, is better than legislation designed to suppress it.</P>

    <P>This Vote on Account begins the financial business of 1955-56.  It is for a sum which is just under one-third of the total of the Estimates and will cover expenditure on the Supply Services until roughly the end of July next.  During the next few months the Dáil will be dealing not only with the individual Estimates but also with the Budget and the Finance Bill.  It is only when these last two measures are disposed of that a full picture will have been presented of the financial arrangements for the new year.  Any assessments of the financial position made at this early stage&mdash;when only the Volume of Estimates for the Supply Services is available&mdash;are founded necessarily on incomplete information and are, therefore, liable to be mistaken.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="24" /> While, as I have said, the Estimates Volume is merely part of the financial picture, it is nevertheless an important part.  The Supply Services, capital and non-capital, have in recent years accounted for about three-fourths of the total State expenditure.  The remaining fourth is made up by Central Fund Services and direct issues from the Exchequer for capital purposes.  In framing the Budget the revenue side is of at least equal importance to the expenditure side but, for the present, this part of the picture is missing and we are at the moment concerned only with the provision to be made for Supply Services.</P>
    <P>Deputies will have observed that the total of the Estimates for 1955-56 is £105,488,093, a decrease of £2,774,380 on last year's figure of £108,262,473.  If account is taken of Supplementary Estimates in 1954-55, other than that for the National Development Fund, the decrease is £4.83 million.</P>
    <P>Deputies will remember that in 1950-51, when the present Attorney-General was Minister for Finance in the first inter-Party Government, the Estimates were segregated between capital and other services.  The last Government, for budgetary purposes, made exactly the same deductions from current expenditure but they gave no indication of this intention in the Estimate volumes they presented.  Their action was of no advantage to the national finances and only served to befog the issue in the relevant discussions in this House.  I have, therefore, taken the same capital items&mdash; now traditional&mdash;and have openly segregated them from the other Supply Services both on the title-page and in a preface to the volume.  This division reveals that of the decrease of £2.77 million as compared with the original provision for the current year, £1.63 million relates to capital services and £1.14 million to non-capital services. It is the reduction in non-capital services which is significant in relation to the current Budget and it is on that account particularly gratifying. The reduced provision for capital services is due mainly to a fall of £1,250,000 in the amount required to supplement the Hospitals' Trust Fund <Col N="25" /> grants for the building of hospitals. This arises partly because of increased Hospital Sweep income and partly because physical progress with the building programme has not been as rapid as was first thought possible.  In the last year, for example, for which completed figures are available, 1953-54, expenditure was £1.6 million less than estimated.  In the current year, expenditure will probably work out at £1.5 million less than estimated.</P>
    <P>In giving a brief account, as is customary on this occasion, of the principal variations in the Estimates as compared with 1954-55, I shall distinguish as I go along between capital and non-capital services.  I would remind the Dáil that, as I announced in November last, the Government have arranged for a detailed review of the State capital programme as a whole.  When this review is completed and considered by the Government, and Deputies will realise that the review to be exhaustive will take some considerable time, it is possible that some changes may be made in the capital Budget necessitating adjustments in voted capital services or other forms of State capital outlay. Though not directly relevant to the consideration of the capital services detailed in the Volume of Estimates, I might perhaps add that the Government also arranged for an examination of the facilities available to Irish industry for obtaining capital.  These two reviews when completed should be of real advantage in planning and promoting capital development for the future.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware the Book of Estimates itself shows Vote by Vote and item by item where variations occur as between 1955-56 and the current year.  I shall only refer, therefore, to the more important changes and for convenience I have attempted to group similar services together.</P>
    <P>Turning then first of all to the non-capital services, Deputies will find that there is a net increase of approximately £359,000 in the provision for the remuneration of State employees including the Army, Garda Síochána and teachers, but excluding staff directly <Col N="26" /> engaged on works of a capital nature. The post office accounts for approximately £199,000 of the total increase, chiefly because of pay increases awarded to postmen and other employees under conciliation and arbitration machinery.  A further £100,000 or so represents additional provision in respect of labour for forestry work of a non-capital nature such as maintenance and timber conversion. Obviously as our forests increase with the years the numbers employed in their maintenance also grow.  The provision for superannuation payments to State employees shows an increase of about £260,000, or £210,000 if account is taken of a Supplementary Estimate for £50,000 which was found necessary in the current year.</P>
    <P>The provision for social services under the Social Insurance and Social Assistance Votes shows a net decrease of £247,900.  I am happy to say that this decrease is due almost entirely to the better employment situation, in consequence of which there is a reduction in the provisions for unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance.  I saw some comment over the week-end suggesting that the decrease in these two Estimates represents a reduction in benefit.  This is, of course, untrue.  The fact is that it is unnecessary to provide as great a total amount to give the same individual benefits next year because of two factors we are all pleased to note, namely, the improvement in employment and the decrease in unemployment. Owing to an increase in the number of beneficiaries an extra £120,000 is being provided for children's allowances.</P>
    <P>The provision for flour and bread subsidy in the Estimate for Industry and Commerce shows a decrease of £681,000 as compared with the original provision for the current year which, however, will have to be augmented by Supplementary Estimate.  Taking account of the prospective supplementary, which has yet to be introduced, the decrease is of the £1,000,000 order. The two items principally responsible for the decrease are, first, the new prices fixed by the Government for native wheat and, secondly, an increase <Col N="27" /> in the world price of wheat offals which will be reflected in the price obtainable by native millers for this by-product.  Nevertheless, I should make it clear that the provision now included ensures that the Irish farmer will be paid for his wheat of the 1955 crop a price much above that at which foreign wheat could be landed here at present.  The differential would be further increased if world prices were to fall towards the minimum provided by the International Wheat Agreement.</P>
    <P>A further reduction of £84,650 in the Estimate for Industry and Commerce arises from the deletion of the provision for the repayment of advances for rural electrification.  The E.S.B., which showed a profit of almost £250,000 on its operations in 1953-54 and is doing well again this year, has reached a position in which it can assume responsibility for rural electrification and thus relieve the taxpayer of the subsidy which was originally provided when rural electrification had hardly advanced beyond the planning stage and actual experience of the effect on the board's finances had yet to be gained.</P>
    <P>In the case of Defence, the provision for defensive equipment, while being still substantial, shows a reduction of £1,000,000.  In deciding upon the provision to be made for defensive equipment the Government had given anxious consideration to reported developments in the discovery and manufacture of new and more terrible weapons of war and feel that in this age of transition to nuclear warfare it would be imprudent for them to spend more than a moderate amount of public money on the purchase of such conventional&mdash;and possibly obsolete&mdash; weapons as this country is in a position to obtain.</P>
    <P>In the case of Agriculture, the principal variation in non-capital services relates to the provision for butter subsidy, which shows an increase of £2,015,000 over the original provision for the current year or an increase of £915,000 when account is taken of the Supplementary Estimate for £1,100,000 which was passed last July.  This subsidy is the means by which butter is <Col N="28" /> made available to consumers at 5d. per lb. less than is actually paid to the producers.  The return which the creameries, and through them, the farmers secure is 4/2 a lb.  This means that the price of milk is kept substantially higher than it would be in a free market, as any butter surplus to home requirements can be disposed of only at a loss.</P>
    <P>Other important variations in the Estimate for Agriculture are the appearance of new provisions of £262,000 and £100,000 for the eradication of bovine tuberculosis and the pasteurisation of separated milk.  It will be noted, however, that the bulk of the proposed expenditure on these schemes and all the expenditure on ground limestone subsidy is expected to be recouped from American grant counterpart moneys.  The Estimate is relieved this year to the extent of almost £250,000 by the disappearance of the provision for recouping losses incurred by Eggsports, Limited.</P>
    <P>Additional provision is made for the national farm survey which is being carried out by the Central Statistics Office and provision is made for the first time for the parish plan launched by the Minister for Agriculture.  We are without certain basic information in regard to our agriculture and we hope that the farm survey will fill, at any rate, part of this void.  It cannot be too often stressed that it is not intended that the survey should confine itself either to the very good farmer or to the bad farmer but rather that it should provide us with an analysis indicative of general conditions and standards.</P>
    <P>The parish plan is part of the effort being made to provide better advisory services for agriculture.  Having its roots in the parish, it will grow in the more natural way&mdash;from the bottom rather than from the top.  It must be clearly understood that the rôle of the parish agent is not to control or to dictate to farmers but to act as their friendly adviser.</P>
    <P>The decrease of £398,000 under the heading of C.I.E. arises from the ability of the company, in its improved financial circumstances, to operate without an Exchequer subsidy.  In fact, <Col N="29" /> the 1954-55 provision for a grant towards operating expenses will not be issued and a comparison of actual payments rather than of provisions made for this purpose would show no change as between the two years.  The amount included in the Vote covers only the repayment to the Central Fund of advances made to C.I.E. to meet interest on transport stock.</P>
    <P>In the Estimate for Primary Education the provision for ex-gratia payments to certain retired teachers shows a reduction of £144,000.  The reason for the decrease is that the instalments have now been paid to all living pensioners and to the estates of many deceased pensioners.  The sum of £5,000 proposed for 1955-56 is to meet outstanding cases where there are probate or intestacy difficulties.</P>
    <P>The only other variation in the case of non-capital services to which I think it necessary to refer is the increase of £160,000 in the amount required for grants to health authorities.  The latest estimate of expenditure in the current year is £6,130,000 so that we are actually providing for an increase next year of £760,000.  As Deputies are aware, certain provisions of the Health Acts, 1953 and 1954, were brought into operation last autumn.  Further sections, providing for new health schemes, will become effective during the coming year.</P>
    <P>Coming now to capital services, it will be observed, from the summary inserted as a preface to the Book of Estimates, that, in the case of public works and buildings, the provision for the purchase of sites and buildings shows a reduction of £410,000.  This is largely due to the fact that in the current year provision was made for the purchase of Arus Brugha and the Paris embassy.</P>
    <P>In the Estimate for Agriculture an additional sum of £218,000 is being provided for the farm building scheme and water supplies while an extra £208,850 is required for the land project. In the case of advances under the Grain Storage (Loans) Act, 1951, applications are tapering off and it is expected that issues next year will be down by £375,000.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="30" /> It is expected that allocations of grants for houses, both for new building and reconstruction, will rise, and, accordingly, an extra £250,000 is being provided for this service in the Local Government Vote.  The provision of £100,000 for grants to local authorities towards the cost of housing schemes represents a reduction of £120,000 as compared with the provision in the current financial year. This provision is merely of historical significance; it is made to honour the outstanding liability of the Transition Development Fund in respect of housing schemes carried out by local authorities and it is estimated that, with the payment of £100,000 in 1955-56, the balance still to be made good at the end of that year will have been reduced to £50,000.</P>
    <P>An extra £235,500 will be spent on forest development and Deputies will see that of this extra sum £151,500 will be spent in the form of wages. Those figures are, of course, in respect of capital expenditure and are in addition to the increased maintenance expenditure to which I referred earlier. The extension of our forests not merely utilises, in the creation of a valuable future asset, land which might otherwise be of little value, but at the same time gives substantial employment.</P>
    <P>The new provision of £150,000 for the G.N.R. is a provisional estimate of the contribution which it may fall to us to make towards approved capital outlay by the board in 1955-56.  It will cover such things as new diesel rail cars, cement wagons and lorries.</P>
    <P>So much for the details.  I think I have mentioned the main items in which there are differences of a substantial order between this year's provision and that for next year, and I have given the reason for such differences. As I said, the total shows a decrease of £2.8 million including £1.14 million in non-capital services.  This reduction is all the more notable when Deputies remember that it has been achieved after this Government, by a deliberate policy decision, added a sum for next year of £2,000,000 in respect of the butter subsidy.  If it were not for this additional provision there would have <Col N="31" /> been a reduction of over £3,000,000 in the amount required for current services next year as compared with the proposals of our predecessors.  My colleagues and I can claim, with justification, that this is a satisfactory achievement.  When the previous inter-Party Government left office in 1951, the Book of Estimates was at the figure of £83,000,000.  The last Government in their three years of office increased that sum by £25,000,000 or something over 25 per cent.  Once a trend has been started it is very hard to arrest, but we have succeeded in arresting that upward trend in expenditure.</P>
    <P>We are, of necessity, committed to much of the increased expenditure that was made by the previous Government, when, by their deliberate policy, prices were increased in 1952.  That policy brought with it direct increases in the cost of government through the necessity to increase the salaries of public employees, through increased costs in commercial and business activities and higher prices, even outside the range of commodities directly affected.  All had their impact on Government expenditure.  That influence still remains but we have reversed the rising trend this year and have reduced the proposed expenditure on Supply Services below the Estimates for the preceding year.  This is something our opponents were never able to do since the war but which we have achieved in a short period and to an extent never equalled by them at any time in their years of office.</P>
    <P>The time has not yet arrived for a complete review of the financial or economic picture of the country as a whole.  That must await the Budget.</P>
    <P>While that is so, I would like to indicate, just briefly, the framework of these Estimates which is also the framework of Government policy since we took office.  As I said a moment ago, the last Government, by deliberate policy, in 1952 increased the prices of essential commodities.  That increase was followed by a rise in costs in industry and in the costs of Government.  Our approach has been exactly the reverse.  We cannot <Col N="32" /> expect to keep our people absolutely immune from world economic forces, but we in this Government do strive to ensure that the harmful effect of outside economic influences will be reduced to the minimum, particularly if we feel they are only temporary.  We believe, as I have said on many occasions since we came into office, that our future economic prospects depend, in the first place, on confidence and stability.  We can justly claim that not for many years has there been such confidence amongst our people in the future of their Government and in their institutions, national and economic, as there is to-day.  The Deputies opposite who are laughing at that can go down the country and if they do they will find that it is true, even amongst their own supporters.</P>
    <P>We want to ensure that, in addition to that confidence, there will also be stability.  It was to that end that last summer we provided that the Exchequer would take on the additional liability for butter subsidy.  The reduction of 5d. per lb. in the price of butter, now some eight months effective, was one of the things upon which we determined for the purpose of improving the prospects of stability.  Not merely did it ease the cost of living but it also had the advantage of helping the consumer at a time when consumption was lagging behind production and our surplus butter could be sold abroad only at a price much below the equivalent of the return received by our creamery farmers for their milk.</P>
    <P>It was that same concern for stability that motivated us, as a Government, in making arrangements to cushion our people against what we believe is going to be a passing rise in the price of tea.  We were criticised at the time we took that decision by people who said that we were wrong, that we did not understand the signs or symptoms of the tea market.  On the contrary, everything that has occurred since has shown that our appraisal of the market was better than theirs. Deputies will have seen that large tea interests in Britain, in the last few days even, are bringing down their prices.  Various well-known tea companies <Col N="33" /> are all now advertising lower prices.  I admit, at once, that prices still have to drop substantially to reach a satisfactory level but with larger coffee supplies available at lower prices in America the world demand for tea should fall and, with the prospects for next year's crop, world pressure on supplies and, therefore, on prices should not be so acute. Would we not have been precipitate and unwise, if what we have had is a temporary famine in tea, had we let our prices rise and in so doing had, in that phase, jeopardised the stability of our economic and industrial machine?</P>
    <P>It was also in pursuance of that aim of stability that I made representations on behalf of the Government last week to the banks so that if at all possible interest charges here would not increase, though, as I said last week, any such question of our economic position is one that must be watched almost from day to day and, certainly, from week to week.  The general national welfare must be our primary objective rather than the immediate interest of any one section of our economy.</P>
    <P>All these actions of ours are evidence of our efforts to avoid any spark that might set off another spiral, bringing with it damage to the productive machine, difficulties in respect of our balance of payments by our being priced out of export markets, and higher costs of Government; and that would, in the end, bring no easement but in fact place additional burdens in terms of real expenditure on the wage earner.  It is to avoid that that we have directed our policy since last June.</P>
    <P>I mention these things to-day so that the public as a whole may understand and appreciate the pattern which shapes our policy and because I hope the public and the leaders of opinion, outside this House as well as inside it, will assist in ensuring that this economic plan is not jeopardised and that we are enabled, in consequence, to go forward with steady progress.</P>
    <P>As I have said, a more complete review, financial and economic, must <Col N="34" /> await the Budget but, meanwhile, I must repeat the warning I gave earlier about attempts to appraise budgetary prospects on the basis of the incomplete indications now available.  The Estimates for the Central Fund Services have yet to appear and the Estimates of Revenue are still only in preparation. I have not yet, therefore, been able to assemble all the information which I shall need in framing the Budget.  When I remember that I will not be able this year, as my predecessor was last year, to call upon C.I.E., for instance, to provide £1,000,000, I do not approach the task with optimism.</P>
    <P>An increase in the Central Fund Services is, of course, inevitable.  We are providing, and properly providing, every year from the Central Fund amounts to amortise our capital expenditure as well as to meet the interest on the national debt.  This must cause year by year an increase in Central Fund Services but it is for capital development which is accepted by every Party in this House as being essential to national progress.  As I said in an earlier speech this year, an interval elapses before an improvement in our economic circumstances is reflected in the revenue returns.  There I must leave the matter for the moment.  These Estimates represent a cut in expenditure, and yet we do not believe in cutting expenditure merely for the sake of cutting it.  We work to ensure that we will get good value for the money that is spent and, at the same time, we are cutting out expenditure that does not bring an adequate return.</P>
    <P>The effect of these Estimates can easily be read also when one goes back only a few weeks to a speech that was made in this House on 10th February, 1955.  It will be found at column 197, Dáil Debates, Volume 148.  In that column a Deputy states:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I say on the contrary that the costs of administration in almost every Department have gone up.  I say that, in a few weeks' time, each one of these Departments will come with a bill for administration for 1955 higher than that which they <Col N="35" /> presented for 1954.  The Book of Estimates is almost due to appear. That prophecy of mine will soon be tested as to its accuracy.  We shall have that book in our hands presumably before the end of this month.  Unless something has happened, of which no indication has been given to the Dáil or to the public, every Department will be showing higher administrative charges.  In many places that may be due solely to the increased remuneration paid to Civil Service staffs; it may be due to larger staffs in some cases.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Estimates that are before the House are normally grouped for the purposes of accounting into 12 different groups.  We were told there, a few weeks ago, that almost every Department, if not every Department, would show an increase.  Out of the 12 groups, seven show a decrease.  The Book of Estimates that is before you contains the total of 66 different Votes. More than half of those Votes&mdash;34&mdash;in respect of non-capital and exactly half in respect of capital show a decrease in the costs on which the administration of this country will depend next year.  That shows the value of the prophecy that was made by Deputy Lemass.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one thing, whatever they may lack, that members of the Government do not lack, and that is audacity.  Perhaps the word &ldquo;cheek&rdquo; would be better.  We have here a Minister for Finance boasting that he has been able to reduce the Estimates for the coming year as compared with the current Estimates to the extent of £1.14 million.  If we were to consider the Estimates in detail we would see that the whole of it was almost covered by a windfall, by the Appropriation-in-Aid that comes from the American Grant Counterpart Fund or, if we do not take the whole of that, that the amount for ground limestone which last year was some £600,000 has not to be met because it will be offset by this windfall and, again, we have the reduction that is caused by the reduction in the wheat <Col N="36" /> prices and the diminished necessity, therefore, for the wheat subsidy.</P>
      <P>Now, compare this £1.14 million with the promises that were made when the Parties now in the Government were out campaigning last year.  They did not say that they would reduce current expenditure or the current Estimates of expenditure by a mere £1,000,000. We had the predecessor of the present Minister in the Coalition Government telling the people that some £20,000,000 and upwards economies were needed and were expected if we were to put the national finances on a proper level.  Not merely that, but that there were millions of pounds of savings ready to hand to be found by anybody who was serious in the quest.  Is his colleague the Minister for Finance now serious in the quest?  Has he been serious in the quest when these &ldquo;millions that were ready to hand&rdquo; have diminished to the negligible amount of £1.14 million, negligible because, as I have pointed out, in fact they have been covered by a windfall.</P>
      <P>Twenty million pounds were to be the target.  Now we have the Minister having the audacity to tell the House that they have done wonderfully well because they have got £1.14 million and this same predecessor of his, when the Book of Estimates was less than £95,000,000, was telling the public, as an expert, of course, that if the Government was changed and they could get into office a Minister for Finance would reduce it by £10,000,000 in ten minutes.  A million a minute&mdash;that was the boast at that time, that that could be done.</P>
      <P>We have to take this Book of Estimates in the background of the promises and the pledges which were made by the members of the Government when they were seeking office. They sought office on the pledge to a large body of their supporters that the expenditure of the Government, which was too high, would be reduced by millions of pounds.  That was not a casual matter; it was something that was deliberately done, deliberately done, as we now see, to deceive the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been in public life for a fair <Col N="37" /> length of time.  I have been through some 15 general elections and some 50 or so by-elections and in all that time I have never seen anything like the deliberate campaign of deception which was used by those who are now in the Government or supporting it, used in order to get the support of the people at the last election. The people are beginning to wake up, however, and if the members of the Government imagine that they can continue that deception and that that deception will enable them to continue to keep office as it enabled them to get into office, they have a very small opinion of the intelligence of our people.  You can play that trick once or twice but, thanks be to God, the people are wise enough to see through it ultimately.</P>
    <P>I have been talking about the reduction in current expenditure. There is a reduction of £1.63 million in capital expenditure.  That reduction in capital expenditure is effected by people who were saying that we were sacrificing worthwhile national productive projects to the sacred cow of sterling.  To-day I heard a cry of &ldquo;hear, hear!&rdquo; when the question of afforestation was mentioned.  The same thing is happening now as happened before when the Coalition Government were in office.  You have a reduction of some £60,000 in the amount provided for the purchase of land.  In the case of afforestation you know perfectly well that you cannot have a continuous programme if you do not get the land.  Here we have a Government that pretends to be anxious to develop afforestation in this country, and they diminish by £60,000 the amount that is made available for the purchase of the land.  Is the land there to be got or is it not? If it is not there to be got then where are all the millions of acres which we were told should be afforested?  If it is available why are we diminishing the amount that has been provided for its purchase?</P>
    <P>I am not going into details, however. There will be opportunities here for those who want to follow the Minister in his detailed remarks.  Were the remarks made by the Minister because <Col N="38" /> he wanted to continue the deception of the public?  The fact is that we have, in so far as these indicate Government policy or Government expenditure, no diminution worth talking about in the provision for current expenses.  Current expenses, as far as this goes, are practically at the same level as they were at the time of the promises of reductions.  It is true, of course, that we at this time cannot take a comprehensive view of all the national finances.  It is true, just as it was true last year when there were considerable reductions made, that the Estimates can be altered at Budget time.</P>
    <P>Reduction in Defence has been mentioned; there was a reduction in the Defence Estimate last year, though I for one&mdash;I may be alone in the matter &mdash;think that it is a very foolish thing to diminish your expenditure by omitting to pay your fire insurance.  There is a need for a certain minimum Army in this country both from the point of view of protecting the democratic rights of the people on the one hand, and also as a basis, in order that, if a crisis comes, you will have a foundation for the necessary expansion of man power.  I also believe that a considerable amount should be done in regard to making provision for civil defence.</P>
    <P>I do not think, therefore, that either we or the present Government can boast too much of the reduction in the Defence Estimate.  That reduction did take place last year at the time of the Budget, and there were other reductions which were also made.  The fact is, of course, that ultimately there was a balance effected by the Minister for Finance of about £101,000,000 for current expenditure last year.  When you took on the one hand non-tax and tax revenue, and took account of the reliefs, the Revenue Estimate was about £101,000,000.  I am omitting vehicle duties and Road Fund from both sides.  We do not know whether that Estimate will actually be reached in the revenue returns, but that is the figure.  That was practically the figure of expenditure also when you took the Central Fund services and the current Supply Services after adjustment. We are not in a position at this stage to know whether the <Col N="39" /> Estimate will be reached, and we have not a completed amount in regard to expenditure.</P>
    <P>The attitude of the members who are on the Government Benches now is very, very different from their attitude when the Vote on Account was being taken last year.  When we then pointed out that you could not at this stage give a true picture we were shouted at: &ldquo;Of course you can&rdquo;.  We were told that we were just holding on to power, and that there was no necessity whatever to wait until the accounts for the year could be closed, and when we would be in a position to present a proper Budget.  Now, however, the members of the Government want to forget all that.  They want also to forget what they said about C.I.E.  We were supposed to be playing all sorts of tricks last year when the Minister said that it was not necessary to make any provision for any current deficits during the year.</P>
    <P>As I have said, I am dealing only with the block of Estimates in the main.  The details will be dealt with by other members from our side.  I hope that when the public in general who listened to the broadcasts of the former Minister for Finance, Deputy McGilligan, read the excuses&mdash;because that is what they are&mdash;in the statement read by the Minister for Finance to-day, they will think of how they have been deceived.  When it was pointed out by some of our speakers that you cannot effect big reductions in expenditure unless you cut out various items such as some of the social services or the like, and that if the Government intended the economies they suggested they must be considering reductions in subsidies, such as by reducing the price of wheat, the indignation of the Taoiseach foamed over.  He said that those who were suggesting anything of the kind were dishonouring themselves and insulting those to whom the statements were addressed, that they were besmirching&mdash;I think that was the word he used&mdash;the dignity that ought to attach to public life; and that they offended the obligations of Christian charity.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="40" /> I wonder if the Taoiseach were over on these benches and if we were to present, after statements such as were made during that election, a Book of Estimates and a set of excuses such as those we have listened to from the Minister for Finance, would there be any limit to his indignation?  I wonder what rhetorical or oratorical heights he would have gone to in order to denounce us as being unworthy of the confidence that had been placed in us? He would have said that it was by a confidence trick or confidence tricks that we had come into office.</P>
    <P>I am not gifted with powers of oratorical expression as the Taoiseach is, but I do think that the people will require no rhetorical efforts on the part of anybody to convince them that they have been misled.  They have been misled not merely on this question of reduction of expenditure, but on the question of prices.  The Minister has again the audacity to refer to the increase in prices.  There were some 24 points increase in the price level index and, of these, no less than nine occurred during the time the previous Government were in office. Before they left office, so rapid was the increase that six of the points increases occurred within the last two or three months of their period of office.  Eight points increase occurred similarly later by reason of world conditions and the only number that could be in any way attributed to Government policy was seven out of the 24.</P>
    <P>The Government are now saying that they cannot shelter the community from the effects of outside economic disturbances, of outside economic movements.  They did not say that when we were in office.  They wanted to pretend that every single increase in price was the result of deliberate Government policy.  That is what was said.  Now, however, it is quite different.  The Government cannot control prices.  These are due, in the main, to outside influence which they cannot affect.  They misled the people with regard to prices; they misled the people with regard to expenditure; and others who are in the Government misled the people by <Col N="41" /> suggesting that there were going to be huge increases in social services, as if you could, on the one hand, increase expenditure by millions and, on the other, diminish it by millions.</P>
    <P>The pretence was that there was waste, wilful waste, and that anybody anxious to find the items of waste could do so, if he were serious in the quest.  Has the Minister for Finance found this waste?  If he has, why has he not shown it here?  It is possible, no doubt, to improve the machinery of Government&mdash;nobody denies that&mdash;but the £20,000,000 reduction, the £10,000,000, the £1,000,000 a minute, and all the rest are not to be found in that way.  If we want to diminish expenditure, taking it absolutely, we must not incur extra expenditure anyhow. If we want to diminish it, we must make up our minds that certain things we are doing we cannot continue to do because we cannot afford them. We shall be very anxious to see the time when the Government comes forward to tell us that we cannot afford some of these things here.  If they do not come to say that, the pretence that they are going to effect a big reduction in expenditure is all pretence.</P>
    <P>The tendency is for expenditure to grow and every year there are additions.  We have in this case increases in Central Fund services to which the Minister has referred and there will be additions for a variety of reasons every year.  If you are going to offset these and try to keep expenses within the nation's capacity to pay, then it is necessary, when new proposals come up here, to say &ldquo;no&rdquo; to them.  Are the Government, before they bring these proposals up, going to say &ldquo;no&rdquo;?  Are we going to have new proposals which will mean new expenditure? We are told that if we have increased production, we will get from it, on the basis of the old rates, a greater yield.  That is true, but we have to see the increased production, and we have to see that the expenditure does make for that increased production. Have we put many of our proposals to the test in the past in that way?</P>
    <P>We are being urged on the one hand constantly to increase and increase, <Col N="42" /> and, while we are being urged to do that, the very same people who do it are the people who tell you that expenditure can be decreased by tens of millions.  It just cannot be done and we know it cannot be done in that way.  We know, too, that the present Government were very loud in their denunciation of us about the flight from the land, about unemployment and emigration, and we know that these things are happening to-day just as they were happening before.  We were told, without any proofs, that emigration was at the highest point ever.  If we were on the benches opposite and the members of the Government were over here, there is no doubt that they would be crying out still that the flight from the land is taking place more rapidly than ever before, that emigration has reached a higher level than ever before and that, if we spoke of the reduction of a couple of thousand, or whatever it may be, in the unemployment figure&mdash;I think there are still 72,000 unemployed on the register&mdash;we would be told that there was a slight reduction in unemployment but that it has been cancelled out by increased emigration. Those who are listening to me on the opposite benches know that I am telling the truth, that these are the charges that would be made.</P>
    <P>What has the present Government to say to them?  Is it or is it not true that there is flight from the land?  Is it or is it not true that there is heavy emigration?  Is it or is it not true that there are some 72,000 registered as unemployed?  When they were contesting the election, it was in minutes they could bring about remedies, and, in the case of the money, it was £10,000,000 reduction in ten minutes. When Deputy Morrissey was over here and talking about unemployment, he said that, if the Government only acted properly, every unemployed person in the country could be employed within 24 hours.  He said there was productive work to be done, that it was crying out to be done, but that the Government either did not know how or did not have the desire to bring about that state of affairs.  He was afterwards in Government and I remember seeing a report of a speech of his in which he <Col N="43" /> turned quite round and said that if the people who emigrated would only work as hard at home as they did when they emigrated there would be no unemployment.  I can only point simply to facts.  I will not attempt to add any rhetorical flourishes to them. In my view, only a Government with infinite audacity, or a Minister with such audacity, could present a Book of Estimates such as this and try to excuse it by the speech the Minister for Finance made here to-day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The general reaction to these Estimates has been one of very considerable relief both inside and outside this House.  For the first time in many years the upward trend has been held.  As the Minister has said, the trend is the important thing.  The general confidence which the people expressed in this Government when they gave them their votes&mdash;and which they endorsed when the Government floated a loan at reduced interest rates&mdash;is justified in these Estimates and the people can face the future more cheerfully. They know they have at least four years of steady Government ahead of them and that that should bring a better and more attractive picture of our national affairs into view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Leader of the Opposition says that the Government are audacious, I prefer to use the word &ldquo;courageous&rdquo;. They are courageous in dealing with this task which they have inherited.  They have done well in a very short time.  We can all remember when the present Opposition, the Fianna Fáil Party, took office in 1951. We all remember the question of the Marshall Aid moneys and of what it has meant to our economy.  We all remember the lowering and the weakening effect of the 1952 Budget and what that has meant to our economy.  The injury has been such that no succeeding Government could undo the harm overnight.  These are factors which have faced the present Minister for Finance with very considerable economic problems.  The manner in which he is dealing with the legacies of ill-Government which he inherited will commend itself to the people of the <Col N="44" /> country generally; of that I am confident.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Government have given us a sane and a crisp reaction to any new problems that have arisen since they took office.  The matter of the price of tea has been dealt with in an intelligent and sane manner and in a manner which will justify itself before the year is out. World opinion seems to confirm that view.</P>
    <P>While the manner in which the Minister dealt with the bank rate may not commend itself to Deputy Briscoe, it will, I think, commend itself to the majority of the members of this House and to the majority of the people of the country.  I am very glad to note that there has been a change in direction. We have now reached the apex of expenditure and, henceforward, the trend will be downwards and in a healthy and satisfactory direction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt about it that Deputy A. Barry is correct when he says that this Book of Estimates indicates a change in direction&mdash;but it is not the direction they told the voters of the country they were going to take. During the last general election they were out for full employment, for an increase in the farmer's income and for a great reduction in the expense of Government.  We remember the speech made by Deputy McGilligan&mdash; which was alluded to by the Leader of the Opposition&mdash;in relation to the Book of Estimates for the financial year 1952-53, while we were in office.  The amount was for £94,871,000.  Deputy McGilligan took to the platform and said, as reported in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of the 10th May, 1952: &ldquo;If they could get the present Government out before July 1st, a new Minister for Finance could, in ten minutes, save £1,000,000 a minute and thus wipe out the £10,000,000 that was being asked for.  He did not even despair of being able to save the other £5,000,000 as well&rdquo;.  Those remarks were made in relation to a Book of Estimates which we, as a Government, presented to this House for a sum of less than £95,000,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If what Deputy McGilligan said to the public at that time was right, then, <Col N="45" /> instead of having a Book of Estimates for supplies with a total expenditure of £105,000,000, the Government should have one for £80,000,000.  The fact, however, is that the amount is not £80,000,000, as Deputy McGilligan forecast and promised, but £105,000,000. We shall examine in more detail what that Book shows inside the cover, as well as the figure on the outside.  There has been an increase of £25,000,000 on what Deputy McGilligan promised in July, 1952.  On the eve of the last general election he went even further than that.  He broadcast on the 7th May, 1954, and said that &ldquo;a distinct change of policy was required, however, and a new outlook on the part of the Ministers was demanded if the reduction of £20,000,000, and upwards, desirable in everybody's interest, was to be achieved.&rdquo;  He said, of course, that this could be done&mdash;you remember, it has been so often quoted&mdash;&ldquo;if there was a Minister for Finance who knew what he wanted, how to effect this £20,000,000 in savings and was prepared to go after them&rdquo;.  Did Deputy Sweetman, the present Minister for Finance, know what he wanted and did he go after it?</P>
    <P>We know that there was a lot of colloguing in Government circles for this last three or four months.  We know that, when the Estimates were presented from the Departments and it was quite obvious there were going to be several millions up on the total, they got together and said they would have to put a better face than that on them&mdash;and the face they put on it, we will see what it discloses.  But there is no sign of the £20,000,000.  Instead of being down to £80,000,000, as Deputy McGilligan promised in 1952, it is up to £105,000,000, a plus of £25,000,000.</P>
    <P>There was a lot of discussion on Opposition platforms about the need for capital development.  The Labour Party have been prating about it all the time.  What do the latest figures show in relation to capital development and the men employed on ordinary production in the country? They show there were more men drawing unemployment benefit&mdash;and these are people who have been recently employed&mdash;than there were last year.  In <Col N="46" /> fact, on the 26th February, the latest date circulated by the Government, there were 33,563 men drawing unemployment benefit as against 30,585 a year ago, an increase of 3,000 in the number drawing unemployment benefit compared with last year.  During February, 1954, the total number of people on the live register went down by 1,850.  This year during February it went up by 1,500.  That is the trend that is satisfactory according to Deputy Barry and according to the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The trend is upwards and as regards the people that we can really get a grip of, that we know, the people who were recently employed and who are entitled to unemployment benefit, that number is up in every week of this year as against last year. There were 33,563 on the 26th February last, as against 30,585 a year ago.  On the 19th February there were 32,232 as against 31,185 a year ago.  There is an increase of 3,000 in the latest week for which we have the figures.  We do not know what the trend was last week, as we have not got the figures yet.  We will see how the trend is going, but the trend is upwards in regard to unemployment amongst the people who are normally employed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Barry is quite cheerful.  He wants us all to be cheerful about this situation.  The Minister for Finance himself adjured us to look to the future with the greatest of hopeful anticipation.  He claimed that this Book of Estimates is a satisfactory achievement.  The most he has claimed is that he has saved £1,100,000 odd on non-capital items.  I will show that that is completely wrong.  The saving is nothing of the kind.  The total saving, between capital and administration expenses, in the two groups, is £2.77 millions.  The total of the present Book of Estimates is £105,488,000 as <Col N="47" /> against £108,263,000, a total saving, or total decrease, of £2,775,000.</P>
    <P>Let us have a look at that for an instant.  The Minister gave a lot of details as to how this was achieved.  I want to give some figures I got from a quick glance through the Book of Estimates. There has been a decrease in one sub-head, in the Oireachtas, for salaries of officers and allowances of T.D.s, of £1,872.  Divide that by three and you get the allowance of a T.D., so the saving in that sub-head of T.D.s salaries has been by the increase of one Minister and one Parliamentary Secretary, and the reason it is now £1,800 less is that it is anticipated there will be another one added.  We could save a lot on that sub-head if we made everyone in the Parliament a Minister or a Parliamentary Secretary. That is one saving.  If you go on through this Book of Estimates, you will see that there has been expenditure either avoided or postponed on items of repairs and upkeep and the replenishment of stores all through it.</P>
    <P>It is most wasteful not to paint prisons or, as is being done for the saving of a few thousand pounds, not to prepare for the repair of roofs.  Lest the Government should fall, they are quite prepared to take the risk of the roofs of a lot of State property all over the country falling in.  In the Revenue Commissioners there is a saving on one sub-head, sub-head G, of £5,920, but what is it on?  It is on machinery and repairs to machinery.  In Public Works and Buildings here is a saving of £410,000 in sub-head A, and £270,000 in sub-head B.  All these are for buildings or sites.  In sub-head K, there is a saving of £90,000, and that is on the purchase and maintenance of engineering plant and stores.</P>
    <P>Any Government that wanted merely to effect an apparent saving could let the machinery go to bits and fail to acquire the sites and buildings necessary to keep the Government going, but a Government that has a conscience should behave as if it had a conscience.  One of the savings shown &mdash;the Minister adverted to it&mdash;is £239,700 in G (3) in the Department <Col N="48" /> of Agriculture.  That is on the improvement of poultry and egg production. Is the Minister going to claim that that is a magnificent saving simply because the Eggsports Company had no losses last year and they had not to be provided for?  In the Department of Agriculture we come to a most peculiar item.  It is in the Appropriations-in-Aid, under 19 (a) £933,000 of a saving because there is a recoupment from the United States Grant Counterpart Fund directly into the Department of Agriculture.  Is there any precedent for putting a sum of £933,000, which is an inter-Government transaction, into the coffers of one Department?  I never heard of it.  If the Minister is going to show a reduction in one Book of Estimates as against another by treating this vast sum of money, £933,000, as an Appropriation-in-Aid, it would be very easy for him to show a £50,000,000 reduction by meeting all the expenses of all the Departments in that way.</P>
    <P>It shows the reason why you had all these meetings of the various members of the Government going on for so long.  What tricks could they evolve out of their heads that would show an apparent reduction in the face of the Book of Estimates?  This was one of the tricks.  They decided they would have a reduction by hook or by crook and they did it largely by crook.</P>
    <P>Another item is an Appropriation-in-Aid for £8,000 out of the National Development Fund.  It is in respect of staff employed on bovine tuberculosis eradication.  There is no provision at all in the Book of Estimates for the National Development Fund.  Yet the Book of Estimates has been reduced by £8,000 out of the National Development Fund.  It is a very easy way of accounting.  It is very easy to show a reduction if you are prepared to do that sort of trick.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that all these reductions were satisfactory.  I take it that it was satisfactory, therefore, to advert to what I have already spoken about, that the machinery should not be replaced and that you should have all these indirect methods of accountancy to show an apparent reduction. Another item that was reduced in the <Col N="49" /> Department of Agriculture was the grain storage loans.  That was reduced by £375,000.  Of course, we know that if the Minister for Agriculture had his way there would be no grain stores being built throughout the country. We would get it all in from abroad. He succeeded last time in reducing the necessity for grain storage by 500,000 acres.  If he gets his way and has the clique behind him&mdash;the quiet as mice Labour Party as he referred to them&mdash; it is not grain stores we will want.</P>
    <P>Another item of reduction is under the Garda, sub-head A, Pay and Salaries. There is £65,815 of a reduction there. They even went to the extent of saving £100 in the replacement of tools&mdash;subhead H (50).  The purchase of transport is down to £28,800.  There was a fleet of cars bought the other week I believe.  With regard to the prisons&mdash; I mentioned this before&mdash;the maintenance of buildings and equipment in prisons has been cut by £4,630.</P>
    <P>Another of these reductions of the sums of money in respect of which they want to show a reduction in expenditure in this Book of Estimates as against the last one we presented is £400,000 saving on Gaeltacht roads. Last year in our Book of Estimates there was a sum of £400,000 for Gaeltacht roads.  It was decided to take it out of the National Development Fund. It is not in this particular Book of Estimates and the Minister claims as a great cut the disappearance of this £400,000 on Gaeltacht roads.  It is part of this £2,750,000 that he has saved.</P>
    <P>Another item is that in respect of primary education.  Part of his savings is the fact that sub-head DD&mdash;ex gratia payments to certain retired teachers&mdash;have been reduced by £144,000 because all the lump sums were money provided by the Fianna Fáil Administration for the teachers who were entitled to them on the 1st January, 1950.  The Minister made another saving in the Institute of Advanced Studies under sub-head B&mdash; provision for the acquisition or adaptation of buildings, £9,700.</P>

      <P>This is getting a little bit too hot for some of the people over there.  Let us come to the question of forestry.  Another of the savings the Minister made is £60,000 on the acquisition of land.  The money provided for the acquisition of land has been reduced from £135,000 to £75,000. I want to point out that the Coalition did that trick the last time they were in.  They opened their mouths and talked about the millions of acres of land they were going to plant but they made no provision for the purchase of the land.  We had accumulated about 70,000 acres.  They did not add to it. We had 70,000 acres in hands.  Now they are at the same game again.  They are talking about forestry and talking about 25,000 acres a year but all they are providing for land this year is £75,000.</P>

      <P>There is an increase in regard to forestry of £280,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Simply because there was an increase in wages of over £100,000 and that the more land we planted the more had to be thinned.  You have got to thin the forests we planted.  It is no thanks to you to thin them because there would be a public outcry if the people saw the forests being allowed to go to rack and ruin.  But do not talk around the country about what you are going to do for forestry when you are reducing the amount of money that is being afforded for the purchase of land.  There is a claim that there is an extra £10,000 being spent on Gaeltacht Services in this Book of Estimates.  On the face of it the normal person would think there was an increase of £10,000, but in fact, there has been an increase in the Appropriation-in-Aid of the Gaeltacht Services of £51,480.  This arises from the fact that the material that we provided has been made into goods that are to be sold and there will be to that extent an increase in the Appropriation-in-Aid. In fact, the Minister for Finance is providing not £10,000 more for the Gaeltacht services but £40,000 less in this year.  There was a lot of chat about what they were going to do for the Gaeltacht all round the country&mdash;there was to be a new Minister for Gaeltacht Services&mdash;and yet we are providing £40,000 less for Gaeltacht Services, while we are making provision, as I pointed out regarding the Oireachtas, for the appointment of another Minister&mdash; perhaps a Minister for the Gaeltacht.</P>
      <P>It has already been pointed out that food subsidies have been reduced by £681,000 and that is claimed as a very satisfactory reduction, but at whose expense?  At the expense of the farmers.  If the farmers were being paid a reasonable price for their wheat there could not be this saving of £681,000, so that it is like the Appropriation-in-Aid from the American Grant Counterpart Fund.  This, in fact, is an Appropriation-in-Aid out of the pockets of the farmers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is a bit steep that the only saving that can be pointed to in this Book of Estimates as compared with last year is at the expense of the farmers&mdash;£681,000.  After all, all the other Estimates have gone up, payments of this salary and that salary, but the farmer's salary is the only one that has been cut, and cut to the tune of £681,000.  It might be more.  If the policy of the Minister for Agriculture is effective it is not £681,000 by which the farmer's salary will be cut.  He hopes that by cutting prices there will be no wheat grown and then there would be £18,000,000 reduction in the farmers' income.</P>
      <P>We come to an item in the Department of Industry and Commerce, a saving of £34,000 which the Minister regards as satisfactory and which I am sure the Labour Party and all the rest of them were brought in on.  I suppose the Tánaiste was sitting in and I suppose he agreed to this reduction of £34,000 in L (1) of Industry and Commerce for mineral prospecting.  Do not let anybody think that this was but a mistake, that somebody had a few winks of sleep and that this cut slipped by.  Exactly the same cut was made by the first Coalition within a couple of months of their coming into office. We had a sum of money of about £84,000 in the 1948 Estimate as far as I remember for mineral prospecting for Mianraí Teoranta but the Minister announced in the Budget that he was going to save it.  As things turned out he was not allowed to save it all.  However, the present Minister is following his footsteps and though he could not go to the full extent he has cut it down by £34,000.  These are the people who are out for capital development, if you please, and they will not even take the trouble to find out whether or not we have the resources that we hope we have in minerals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="53" /> There is a decrease in Industry and Commerce under M (1) of the matter of £10,000 on the Bord na Móna research and experiments.  We are hoping to have a £9,000,000 or £10,000,000 turf industry.  We already have an industry worth several million pounds here and we have to cut by £10,000 the experiments that are now being carried out for the purpose of reducing the cost!  We have to cut expenditure in half.  And that is a satisfactory achievement and one that the Minister for Finance is very proud of and one for which Deputy Barry and others of the clique pat him on the back.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste was going about talking to everybody and telling them that they should be all out to produce more and export more but when it comes to the private conferences with the Minister for Finance as to how they can put a better face on the Book of Estimates he agrees to a reduction of £25,000 for An Foras Tionscal.</P>
    <P>Another thing he agreed to was a £41,568 reduction for technical assistance, and then we have the agreement to reduce the provision for rural electrification&mdash;to wipe it out and to improve the look of the Book of Estimates by £84,650.  We know that we have had an Appropriation-in-Aid of £933,000 from the Americans into the Department of Agriculture; we have had an Appropriation-in-Aid out of the pockets of the farmers of £681,000 into the Department of Agriculture for flour subsidies, and here is another Appropriation-in-Aid&mdash;that is what you can call it&mdash;from the electricity consumers of £84,000 odd.  The E.S.B. were told during the war that if they prepared plans for rural electrification the State would stand a subsidy to give electricity to rural communities at reasonable prices, but now we are saving that £84,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Is not that good development?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether the Deputy has the same experience as I have, but I am always getting letters from farmers who say: &ldquo;The E.S.B. will not give me electricity unless I am prepared to pay £200 or £300.&rdquo;  I <Col N="54" /> think it is unreasonable that the people who are in the most backward places should give this Appropriation-in-Aid when it was announced as public policy passed by this Parliament that it would be the general taxpayers who would help the rural communities.</P>
      <P>Another saving, as the Minister explained, is the £398,000 to C.I.E.  There is a saving also on the Sligo-Leitrim railway of £40,870.  That was the sum of money that was put in for this railroad last year to keep it going, and that has been wiped out.  There is no provision at all being made for it by the Minister.  Is it going to close down?  What is the story about it?  Or is this only cut out in order to make the cover of the Book of Estimates look better?  The Minister explained a lot of other figures; he did not explain that one.  Another little cut that these developers of the nation have made is £116,000 on harbours. Does anybody think we should pat the Minister on the back for a satisfactory achievement in reducing the amount for harbours from £506,000 to £390,000? Have we no unemployed that we could put to improving all the harbours around the country for which there is a general call for attention?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>What do we want harbours for?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>That must be the mentality at the back of the Minister's cut&mdash;what do we want harbours for&mdash; because the Minister was very proud of all those cuts which he made and one of them was this £116,000 for harbours.  We have heard the Tánaiste all around the country prating about the great interest he is taking in aviation development.  The Minister for Agriculture used to hope the time would come when the Shannon would be a playground for rabbits and that we would turn the masts into knitting needles to knit their wool.  However, recently the Tánaiste has been going down the country and he has seen, or at least the people have told him of, the enormous advantages to this country of the development of civil aviation.  He has promised that he is going to do a great deal for the <Col N="55" /> development of aviation, particularly at Shannon.</P>
      <P>What does he do when it comes to the Book of Estimates?  When he returns to Dublin after this great speech he reduces the amount for the acquisition of land and buildings by £10,000.  This is all in connection with aviation and meteorological services; in sub-head G, constructional works at Shannon airport, there is a decrease of £15,000; in sub-head H, constructional works at Dublin airport, there is a decrease of £25,000.  He does that in spite of the fact that the Appropriations-in-Aid, receipts from landing fees, from the catering services, from the rent of stores in the customs free port, have gone up by £55,400.  Shannon is earning more money and the Tánaiste says down the country that he is going to give it all the help he can.  He comes back to Dublin and he cuts the sums of money involved for development.</P>
      <P>I said there was a lot in these alleged savings connected with stores, replacements and repairs.  The last time the Coalition left there was hardly a boot or a shirt left in the Army stores.  It looks now as if it is not only the Army that is going to suffer in this way in order to get the sum on the face of the Book of Estimates down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Post Office stores are also being cleaned out.  There is a reduction of £44,000 in G (1) for stores.  In G (2), uniforms, there is a reduction of £8,000.  That is, for Posts and Telegraphs.  They are going to reduce the manufacture of stamps by £21,500; salaries and wages in the engineering department by £22,000.  That is an interesting item.  We all know that there are people all over the country flaming mad because they cannot get telephones installed, that they have to wait six months or a year before they get them installed.  Now, there is a decrease in the number of installers, the technicians who instal the telephones. Why on earth are the number of installers being reduced from 588 to 402 when the cry is for more telephones more quickly?  There is a saving of <Col N="56" /> £60,000 on the wages&mdash;if that is not the reason what else is it?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy should have looked at the two items above that.  Look at the number of electricians.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to point out that one of the savings that the Minister is claiming credit for is £60,000 in the item in sub-head L (1) for salaries and wages in the engineering department of the Post Office.</P>
      <P>We come to Defence.  We have advertisements in the paper for recruits.  We all know that the numbers in the Army have been decreased and that it is having a very bad effect.  The Army is just fading off the face of the earth, but there is provision being made in sub-head A for a further £99,436 in the pay of officers and privates.  For provisions and allowances in lieu, there is a reduction of £111,808. Then we come to the process of emptying the stores and leaving as many bills as we can to another Fianna Fáil Government.  The item for clothing and equipment is down by £44,294.  The civil defence is being cut in spite of the fact that every country in the world is worried about civil defence and that something should be done about it, at least as much as we can. It is being cut down by £21,000. Another thing that the Minister is proud of is that he has not to buy naval vessels this year as they were bought last year and there is a saving of £28,000 in sub-head P (2) accordingly.</P>
      <P>Then we come to Social Services. There is a decrease in the sum required for old age pensions of £10,000 but if there was any real intention behind all the prating of the Labour Party instead of cutting it by £10,000 it should be up by £10,000,000.  For unemployment assistance it is £339,000 less although, as we know, the trend in unemployment is upwards.  It may be that the intention of the Government is to arrange that more will leave the unemployment exchange if not for jobs in this country then in some other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to Health, if there was one thing more than another the Labour Party was prating about all over the country it was the necessity, not only <Col N="57" /> for health services but health education. But what do you think they did in order to save £5,000 to make the face of the Book of Estimates look better?  In F (3)&mdash;the item in regard to the dissemination of information and advice on health&mdash;they cut it by £5,000.  That was done as a result of the colloguing that went on between the Tánaiste and the other Ministers in preparing the Estimates.</P>
    <P>One of the excuses of the Labour Party was&mdash;what was the use of talking about bringing in health services when we had no hospitals?  We had no hospitals until we built them and we could not have the other services either unless we had hospitals.  Now they are taking care that they will not have more hospitals by cutting down the Grant-in-Aid for hospitals by £1,250,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">

      <P>The Minister for Finance seems to have gone back to the system of thinking about tourism like a lot of his colleagues did immediately following the war.  They condemned us for entertaining these spivs and for allowing them to eat our beef.  They wanted us to clear them out altogether.  We seem to have the same thing back again.  In order to discourage these people from coming in here the Minister has cut £78,000 from tourism.  I am giving only a few rough figures.  I am not giving all the figures of these savings.  Remember the savings, as shown on the cover of the Book of Estimates, amount to £2,775,000.  Actually those I have alluded to amount to about £7,000,000.  Just like that.  So that the £2,775,000 should actually be £7,000,000, only it is counterbalanced by £5,000,000 extra expenditure on other items.</P>

I think that a number of these other things on which savings have been <Col N="58" /> made are disastrous.  I feel it is a terrible thing to fail to keep our buildings in repair, to fail to repair them and to keep their roofs in order.  This Book of Estimates which may look better on its face is deliberately bad economy and amounts to disastrous policy.</P>

Their attitude is that we can talk till the cows come home, because it is as the result of all the promises they made that they would save £20,000,000 that they got where they are.  But at any rate there is one good result, and it is that there is no doubt about it that the public are being educated and that the same sort of a trick will not be played upon them quite so easily again.</P>

      <P>I think it is time that we came to grips with some of the twaddle that has so fulsomely come from the former Minister for Finance. I think that what is wrong with Deputy Aiken in the main is a sense of frustration that he feels in the false procrastinations of his Deputies here that everything was going to sky-rocket upwards. He comes here and he does a bit of schoolboy play-acting in relation to saving, as he puts it, on tools or on roofs or on various maintenances, apparently not giving us credit for either intelligence or a capacity to appreciate the fact that many of these things that appear year after year in the Book of Estimates have for far too long gone unchallenged.  One would think from the gyrations of Deputy Aiken that all this painting and all these roof repairs and all the other types of maintenance operations had become a recurring account in relation to all Government buildings.  Let us test some of these supreme weapons of Deputy Aiken's taunting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Aiken has taunted the Labour Party for failing to provide the hospitals that are necessary, and speaks airily of a reduction of somewhat <Col N="59" /> over £1,000,000 in the moneys provided for hospitals, completely ignoring the fact that some of the largest hospitals in this country are completed or on the verge of completion and that some of them are just ready to be opened.</P>

Is not the former Minister for Finance&mdash;yes, and the former Minister for Defence&mdash;being completely dishonest in terming as a saving something which arises by virtue of the fact that such substantial advances have been made in the progress of building hospitals that it is unnecessary to provide in the coming year&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>What is wrong with the Opposition is that even as a Government they never had the capacity of a reasonable or practical survey of the Estimates.  They never appreciated the fact that without detriment to the Vote it was possible to find in these Estimates substantial grounds for savings.  I am going to come back to another bit of tomfoolery indulged in by Deputy Aiken. We had in this House for a number of years considerable difficulty, year after year, in relation to the Defence Estimate, because year after year we were appropriating fixed sums of money for technical stores and equipment which we could not get and, year after year, we saw in the Estimates, coming back as an Appropriation-in-Aid, money which, with the best intentions in the world, the Minister was not able to use because he could not get the stuff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation changed some few years ago and we were able to get immense quantities of a certain type of material from Sweden, and we were able to fill our stores in the way we were not able before.  Most of this stuff has not been used yet.  It is there as a reserve until the necessity arises, to be used for the protection of our people.  All that is used in an average year is that which is necessary for training and practice, and is the former Minister for Defence now suggesting that we would throw out all those stores and leave this money in to replenish them?  It is wrong to suggest we are doing something queer because the cupboard is full.  It is not because we have four bare walls in the store that the Appropriation-in-Aid in relation to technical equipment and <Col N="61" /> warlike stores is down: it is because the stores are full.</P>
    <P>Within the last two years the Minister for Defence in the Fianna Fáil Government, Deputy Traynor, boasted about all the warlike stores he could get.  Presumably he got them and, if the stores are now full, why should the people be asked this year to provide large sums for technical equipment and stores that are neither necessary nor required?</P>
    <P>Let us come to grips now with this subject of forestry and the taunts thrown across the floor of the House in relation to afforestation.  My complaint has always been that the money provided for forestry and for the purpose of buying land has never in the past been expended in the year in which it was provided.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Hear, hear!  And well the ex-Minister knows that!</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Just a moment.  I will develop my own argument.  The burden of my complaint is that the rate of progress in relation to the activity of Fianna Fáil in the past has been too slow.  That applies both to reafforestation and the acquisition of land for distribution.  No matter what money was provided by the Oireachtas, at the end of the year an unexpended sum was brought back by way of Appropriation-in-Aid.  I hope that the Minister for Lands this year will spend his £75,000.  If he wants four times that amount next year, and if he can convince the Minister for Finance that he can use that sum in the year he asks for it, I am quite sure the money will be forthcoming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This petty play-acting serves no useful purpose.  A quite extraordinary sorrow seems to issue from the breast of Deputy Aiken because there is a reduction in the grant for mineral exploration.  Sometimes I am tempted to think we have done a lot of probing in that regard with very, very little result.  In the main, where there is a potentiality of economic mineral return private concerns are seeking permission from the Minister for Industry and Commerce to carry out the necessary exploration.  I have a different <Col N="62" /> complaint from Deputy Aiken in relation to that situation.  I think the Minister has only gone part of the way. Year after year we examine the Book of Estimates.  Year after year large sums of money are voted for specific purposes and, year after year, one finds in the Expenditure and Revenue Account Appropriations-in-Aid brought back because the moneys voted have not been expended.  I commend the energy of the Minister in so far as he has gone out after that type of estimation, a type of estimation which gives rise to unnecessary inflation in the Book of Estimates.</P>
    <P>There has been for too long a tendency on the part of Departments to think of a number, and ask for that figure.  It is time we got down in a practical way to correlating the figure asked for with the sum that is likely to be expended during the particular financial year.</P>
    <P>We have come to a time when people expect some limit to public expenditure. During all the years I have been in this House the tune played by Deputies, even though it may vary slightly when they change their position here, has always been that there is a staggering rise in expenditure and dead administrative costs which must be got after; but Fianna Fáil to-day are acting like chastened children because this Government, after a short period in office, has been able to apply the brake.  That is the whole burden of the case against us.  Deputy Aiken taunts us with the reduction of £10,000 in the appropriation for old age pensions.  Deputy Aiken is trying to fool the people.  He is not adverting to the fact that that reduction may be caused by a higher death-rate in recipients as compared with the number coming in.  The Deputy will have an even worse heartache than that.  His tomfoolery here in relation to this particular facet of the Vote will have a horrible boomerang effect when he finds that the promised alleviation and amelioration of conditions adumbrated by the Minister for Social Welfare is not just so much empty talk.</P>
    <P>Will we again have the stupid situation that arose on the Social Welfare Bill on the occasion when the inter-Party <Col N="63" /> Government introduced an increase for old age pensioners?  Fianna Fáil at that time tried by every method at their disposal to distort the facts and to abuse the measure, but that did not change the fact that the old age pensioners enjoyed at the end of every week the increase that Fianna Fáil would feign deny them but dare not. I advise Fianna Fáil speakers who follow to steer clear of the old age pensioners.  They left them in the lurch long enough.  We were able to give them some effective amelioration of their conditions in the first inter-Party Government.  Let the Fianna Fáil Deputies sit back now and see the further amelioration they will get after we have been a few months in office.</P>
    <P>We must face reality.  I do not think the Minister is boasting.  The Minister has been able to put an effective brake on the rising spiral of expenditure and that rising spiral at one time seemed to be almost without limit in its future potential.  When the Minister has had an opportunity and has had more experience of the workings of his own Department I am sure he will be able to cull still further types of productive expenditure while giving the necessary impetus to capital development and worthwhile projects as distinct from deadweight rising administrative costs. The present Book of Estimates is a sad blow to Fianna Fáil.  We all know that.  Deputy Aiken would not have been in the petulant, waspish mood he was in this afternoon were it not for the fact that he is feeling the strain of trying to make a case on pseudo-facts that are hurled back in his face.  Let him go back over the list that he has been quoting and distorting and apply common sense to it.  If he does, he will find that the savings effected are not savings that are going in any way to stop the impetus to production and national development which this Government has succeeded in reasserting within the people.  It is time we realised that we have been suffering from the heritage of an extraordinarily bad economic approach to our problems by a stop-gap government.</P>
    <P>There has already been advertence to the catastrophic Budget of 1952.  We <Col N="64" /> had to face, after that, a situation where even the money market was shaken to its foundations by the then Minister for Finance, Deputy MacEntee, seeking and boasting about getting a fully subscribed loan at terms which were disastrous to the general economy of the country.  We had that heritage behind us, and now Fianna Fáil are sore because the present Minister for Finance, in the new surge of confidence that is within the people of this State, was able to readjust the money market and get his full national loan oversubscribed at a rate far below that of his philanthropic predecessor, Deputy MacEntee, who gave to the big investors a rate of interest and security which this State could not afford.  They were annoyed at the remarkable success of that, and now, to add to their aching pains at the prospect of a protracted opposition, is the fact that without in any way affecting the prospect of further development and of employment where State moneys are concerned, the Minister has been able to effect a substantial reduction in the dead weight of administrative costs.</P>
    <P>Grow!  That is what Fianna Fáil wants to do.  It had the power punch so long in this country that it does not realise two things: that it is a spent force and that it cannot cod the people any more.  With all the ranting and prating of Deputy Aiken and the distortion, the attempted distortion, by him of the real situation, it all only goes to intensify the lack of reality in the case which that Party is trying to make.</P>
    <P>The facts speak for themselves.  The figures in the Book of Estimates are down, but there is no saving where development is concerned, whether it be on the bogs of Ireland or on the roads of Ireland or in our rural improvement schemes.  There is no saving on any of these schemes so that poor Deputy Aiken has walked himself up to the neck into another serious blunder. He is bemoaning and begroaning the fact that the £400,000 for the Gaeltacht roads is gone.  The poor man is codding himself, or else he does not appreciate the fact that it is there, to the same amount as before, the only difference <Col N="65" /> being that it is not to be found from the same source.</P>
    <P>Another thing that is giving Fianna Fáil county councillors considerable worry is the fact that we are going to get a very substantial increase in the Appropriations-in-Aid for our county roads while still maintaining the position that exists is relation to major road maintenance.  What is really wrong is that the Fianna Fáil Opposition is so bewildered at the situation that they cannot sit down and assess it, and so they come in here like petulant, annoyed schoolboys to get something off their chest that has no basis in reality.  I want to say to them that they are going to have to watch, for a number of years, the formation and development of a completely different economic pattern in this country.</P>
    <P>I see where one of our national newspapers has taken the Minister to task because he has not been able to do better.  I think it is time that all of us began to realise that this is only the commencement of a different type of era in which expenditure for the sake of expenditure is going to recede, and where expenditure for the worthwhile development of this State is going to increase and keep increasing.  It is time we realised that in the short period of eight months the Minister has been able to give an earnest which provides a very favourable portent for the future, and that it is not going to serve any national purpose, even for the Opposition Party, to bicker about reductions in administrative costs because on the other side of the scale the people of Ireland are going to see more and more worthwhile schemes of national development from the capital side of expenditure being put into effect.</P>
    <P>There is no good in talking about the flight from the land, about emigration or anything else or the checking of them until we get our national economy in order, so that with a complete and ruthless culling of administrative expenditure there will be a courageous and forthright approach to the problem of putting Irish money into the development of Ireland at home for the Irish.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="66" /> I think it can at least be said in fairness to the Minister that the time has arrived when he and his colleagues in the Cabinet are not prepared to take as gospel what figure is presented to them by the Departments.  The complaint which, apparently, Deputy Aiken has is that this Government asks Departments to justify and, in fact, convince them of the necessity for certain moneys.  I think that in so acting they are discharging a duty which for too long has been undischarged by public men in this country.  I think that particular type of interest is a safeguard for the people in the future.  I think it is a healthy sign that is going to be reflected in the situation which will gradually develop, so that whatever increases we may see in the future will not be on the deadweight administrative end but rather on the capital side of our Budget.  We all hope to see these emanating either directly from Government sources or from sources supported or helped by the Government thereby providing the potential for additional employment, whether it be on the land or in the factories of Ireland.  I move to report progress.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 12:&mdash;</P>
    <P>In page 16, lines 24 and 25, to delete &ldquo;River Shannon&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;Rivers Shannon and Blackwater.&rdquo;&mdash;(Deputy Corry.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>When discussing this amendment last Thursday, I pointed out that, as far as we are concerned, it is a matter of grave import and not a matter that we could gloss over lightly.  While Deputy Corry expressed the view held by him in connection with this particular matter, it is not for us simply to come in and agree because it would be of advantage to navigation in the waterways of the country.  Where the Blackwater is concerned, we take it for granted that the amendment <Col N="67" /> would mean the erection of an opening-span bridge at one point only, that is, at the entrance to the Blackwater near Youghal.  It is well to draw attention to the difficulties.  It is not correct to say that for centuries there was a bridge with an opening span at Youghal.  We would like to see opportunities given to the various centres and towns situated near harbours.  In the case of the Blackwater, it was not until the present bridge, which is now obsolete, was erected that there was a bridge with an opening span there. My information is that, prior to the erection of that bridge, the bridge near Youghal was always a fixed bridge. Therefore, we cannot point to past glories and the wonderful traffic that there was on that particular river.</P>
      <P>In a very eloquent way, Deputy MacBride indicated the advantages of an opening span, but that involves greater difficulty than mentioned by him.  The Deputy said that there is no expense whatsoever involved in the upkeep of a river.  I am not alluding to the Blackwater when I say that there are many rivers in the South of Ireland which are not navigable and it would cost the State a huge fortune to make them suitable for shipping.  They may have been suitable for that purpose long ago, but due to silting no boats of any size can use them.  It is not a proper approach to the matter to say that the rivers are there and there will be no expense in upkeep.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We cannot avoid the particular issue involved in this amendment.  It is directly related to the problem of a certain bridge at a certain point on the Blackwater.  While Deputy Corry mentioned here and outside and in the public Press his own viewpoint, and went so far as to try to convince the general public that the Cork County Council are prepared to spend a lot more money than they need, it is only fair to every member of the Cork County Council&mdash;and I presume it applies equally to the members of the Waterford County Council&mdash;that the House should know that it was only after the gravest deliberation, only after considering every aspect of the problem and only after carefully <Col N="68" /> examining the reports that were submitted to them by highly qualified people, including the most highly qualified officials of the Department of Local Government, that they decided on the course of action which it is now known they are in favour of.  That being the case and it being true to say that Deputy Corry was in a minority at all times, there is no use in his pointing the finger of derision at all members who do not agree with him.</P>
    <P>Let it be known that the interests of the town of Youghal were foremost in the minds of every member when this particular problem was discussed locally.  They wanted to facilitate the business people and the people in general in the town of Youghal.  That is quite clear.  The question that had to be decided finally was, not whether we would erect a particular type of bridge but whether we were ever going to erect a bridge on the River Blackwater. Therefore, in my opinion, without further evidence being adduced in favour of the amendment, it is not one that we would favour.</P>
    <P>It is clear from Deputy Corry's remarks in moving his amendment that a certain number of ships have used this river for the last four years.  We take Deputy Corry's figures as being correct but he has omitted to tell us the draught of the ships that have been using that river for the last four years.  I believe I am entitled to say that they are somewhat of the same type as the ships that are coming in, not to Cork Harbour alone but into the pier and the village of Crosshaven. The main traffic for which the ships have been used on the Blackwater for the last four years has been the transport of pit props from up river.  If it is more than that, I am surprised that Deputy Corry did not let us know.</P>
    <P>Where we are concerned, it is not simply a matter of supporting a particular Minister just because we may be supporting the Government.  It is simply and solely that we want a bridge on the Blackwater to suit the requirements of the town and the people of Youghal and the neighbouring County of Waterford.  It is because we are convinced that too much time has been given to talking of erecting <Col N="69" /> bridges that we say it is about time to erect the bridge and forget the time that has been wasted.  Unfortunately, not only time but money has been wasted because of the various reports that had to be submitted to the local authorities of the two counties concerned.  It is because I am satisfied that every member on these two councils is a man of common sense whose approach to this matter has been guided by the fact that they needed something which would be of direct advantage to Youghal and to the two counties that I cannot see any point in supporting the amendment except, as I say, if we had at the start the information which Deputy Corry did not give.  According to his own statement, he is prepared to give it in a further letter to the Press but we wanted it here and not in the Press; we wanted it in the Cork County Council and we did not get it.</P>
    <P>I believe that, not by supporting the amendment, but by agreeing to support the line of action that has been suggested by the Minister, we will, please God, be in a position to say that we are coming nearer to the day when we will have a bridge at Youghal suitable for the traffic using it and which, by its height of over 20 feet above the highest point of high water mark on the river, as stated by the Minister, will enable traffic to use the river, as has been the case in the last number of years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. O'Sullivan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Corry's amendment ostensibly seeks to ensure that the Minister in making a bridge Order would not be empowered to restrict in any way the facilities for navigation on the River Blackwater. His real object is, of course, to get an entrance through which would preclude the erection of a fixed bridge at Ardsallagh above the town of Youghal.  It is understood that it has been represented to the Minister that if, as he states, a fixed bridge at Ardsallagh will not interfere with navigation, nothing will be lost by accepting the amendment.  The correct position is, however, that a fixed bridge at Ardsallagh would at least theoretically interfere with navigation.  At present <Col N="70" /> there is no clearance limit on ships using the Blackwater up as far as Cappoquin.  Any fixed bridge on this stretch would, therefore, give rise to a theoretical obstruction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Chair will be able to look after procedure without Deputy Briscoe's assistance. In fact, only small ships can use the river because of the limited depths of the channels, and a bridge at Ardsallagh giving 21 feet of clearance at high water mark would afford a passage to all ships at present using the river, provided they have steppable masts. Most vessels are equipped in that way. At least all the modern ships have this amenity now.  The inclusion of an opening span in the bridge at Ardsallagh would add considerably to the cost and reduce the advantage of the site.  The Department of Finance have intimated that such a proposal would have to be considered by the Minister for Finance <i>de novo</i> as it would involve considerable increase in the grant, the present amount of which was approved very unwillingly by the Department of Finance.  The only river trade as Deputy Desmond has already stated, to be affected, is the export of pit props. The transport is presumably provided by English and Welsh companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is submitted that it would be very wrong for the Dáil to pre-judge the issue of the Youghal bridge site by this indirect kind of action that would deprive the local road authorities of any discretion in the matter.  I am sure Deputy Corry would be the last Deputy to suggest that.  The Waterford and Cork County Councils have acted on their existing discretion and have <Col N="71" /> adopted the Ardsallagh site, and have employed a consulting engineer to prepare the plans for the bridge.  If the Dáil took action now precluding the local authorities from proceeding with that work they would already be liable for considerable fees and damages on foot of the contracts which they have made with Mr. O'Connell, consulting engineer.</P>
    <P>The acceptance of the amendment would also be tantamount to using indirectly a new legislative provision to fetter the discretion of the Minister in respect of the code of law relating to bridge Orders in which the existing Local Government Acts give the Minister a final statutory and quasi-judicial function.</P>
    <P>That function has been exercised by the previous Minister, Deputy Smith, when he decided on the basis of the evidence and report of the proceedings at the public inquiry to recommend the local authorities to adopt the Ardsallagh site.  The present Minister in his turn has sanctioned the employment of Mr. O'Connell for the preparation of the plans for a bridge at that site.</P>
    <P>The proposed amendment is, therefore, an effort to cut across all the decisions that have already been taken, and to stop the local authority proceeding in accordance with these decisions as they are, in fact, already proceeding.  It is, in fact, tantamount to using the Legislature for a purpose similar to one which would propose taking an action before the High Court out of the hands of the High Court, and bringing it before the Dáil to be decided.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a dangerous thing in this House for a Deputy to come in between some members of the Cork County Council.  Goodness knows what could happen.  However, on this occasion I would like to say, in a general way, that I am in complete sympathy with the amendment put down by Deputy Corry.  The Minister was good enough to ensure that, as far as the Shannon was concerned, swivel bridges would be the order of the day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If decisions on these matters were left entirely to the local authorities I <Col N="72" /> am not too sure that we would have the best results in the long run.  This is not meant as a criticism of the Cork County Council in particular, because I have seen on the Corrib where a local authority insisted on erecting fixed structures across the river, thereby cutting off the Corrib basin from the sea for all time.  The extraordinary situation there at the moment is that you have, on the passageway up to the Corrib, a number of swivel bridges, and recently a number of fixed structures were erected by the local authority.  I am sorry that a measure of this nature was not before the House in time to enable me to table an amendment to have the river on the same basis as the Shannon.</P>
    <P>In my opinion, the feelings of the people should be taken into consideration in these matters.  Now that we have the local elections coming along soon, naturally individual local representatives are not anxious to have an extra burden placed on the ratepayers and possibly, if the swivel or open bridge was decided upon, it would, normally, at any rate, be a dearer proposition, and the councillors concerned might feel that they would be blamed for the extra burden placed on the ratepayers.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to enter into the advantages that would accrue, perhaps in years to come, from navigable waters being kept clear and perhaps at present there is not a great deal of traffic on the Blackwater&mdash;I am not familiar with it&mdash;but from the remarks passed here by Deputy Corry last week, I am inclined to believe that there is and has been more traffic there than even on the Shannon.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>At Athlone, anyway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the Athlone area, I should say.  Deputy MacBride and others dealt with the comparative cost of transport by water and otherwise, and it is quite obvious that if we take an intelligent view of this matter of the use of our rivers for transport purposes, there would be a change of opinion in higher circles with regard to the question of swivel bridges and so forth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know how true it is, but it has been suggested to me that there <Col N="73" /> is a conflict of opinion between the engineers as to the erection of a swivel bridge near Youghal.  It was suggested to me that one set of engineers have stated that it is possible to reconstruct the present bridge at a cost £135,000 less than it would take to erect a new fixed bridge.  Let me make that a little clearer.  The reconstruction work would involve a swivel bridge or an open bridge and that reconstruction work could be carried out much cheaper than the construction of a new bridge which would be a permanent structure.  I understand that a very competent group of engineers has made that claim and that another group of engineers has disputed it.</P>
    <P>In a matter like that, laymen cannot judge, and I would suggest that, before making a final decision, the Minister should bring in some neutral expert engineering opinion to decide on the claims or suggestions of these engineers, because, if it is feasible to reconstruct the present bridge at a lower cost than that involved in the erection of a new bridge and yet leave it movable, it would be a very attractive proposition from the point of view of the local authority from the financial aspect and from the point of view of the State generally in so far as it would safeguard future navigation rights on the Blackwater itself.  We do not know what view may be taken by the next generation or the following generation of a decision on our part to erect fixed bridges over important rivers like this; but I would not like to think that people coming into this House in time to come would take a very poor view of the present Dáil as being short-sighted and lacking in vision with regard to possible developments. I am in full sympathy with the amendment moved by Deputy Corry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I had the utmost sympathy for the Minister while the Parliamentary Secretary was speaking. It is a pity that child did not wake up on 1st December last when an amendment relating to Athlone Bridge was being put through the House.  The speeches made by the Parliamentary Secretary and by Deputy Desmond would have been made very well on that occasion, because the Westmeath County Council applied for a bridge <Col N="74" /> Order which was granted and they employed a consultant to prepare the plans and specifications of the bridge sanctioned by the Department.  Then the Minister, very wisely, in my opinion, brought in an amendment to the Local Government Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="75" /> Then, having done that, he comes in here&mdash;I am only following in the very worthy footsteps of the Minister in this matter&mdash;and puts before this House an amendment of the Local Government Bill we are now discussing on Report Stage, annulling the decision of the Westmeath County Council, and compelling them to put a swing bridge 80 miles from the mouth of the Shannon at Athlone, where the previous swing bridge had not been opened, in the words of Deputy Kennedy, for 25 years.  Now, that is one side of the picture.</P>
    <P>Now let us take the other side of the picture&mdash;and this is a long and rather sad story.  On seven occasions&mdash; and this is an answer to Deputy Desmond&mdash;the Cork County Council refused to apply for an unconditional bridge Order for Youghal.  Bear in mind that on seven occasions they refused to apply and, in the end, they applied only on the personal guarantee of a predecessor of the Minister in that office to the effect that that bridge would not go one foot above the present site.  The Minister is aware of that because the statement I am making here was borne out by my colleague, Senator O'Gorman, last week in his presence, namely, that that personal guarantee was given by the late T.J. Murphy who was Minister for Local Government at the time.  Those are the conditions under which this came into the hands of the Department of Local Government.</P>
    <P>I want to put this to Deputy D.J. O'Sullivan, who is Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach, and to Deputy Desmond in view of what they have had to say about the Cork County Council.  After inquiry, and after the decision of the inquiry was published, the Cork County Council unanimously sent up an application to the Minister for the reconstruction of Youghal Bridge.  We hear a lot of talk here about the will of the people and about the wishes of the people.  Well, why was that done?  It was done because not one of the three political Parties in the Cork County Council dared, on the eve of a by-election, to oppose the wishes of the people of Youghal and of <Col N="76" /> the Youghal area.  We had Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Labour tumbling over one another and solemnly declaring: &ldquo;We are going to put the new bridge down below the old bridge below the town.&rdquo;</P>

The first announcement we ever got that a sum was being granted by the Department of Local Government towards that bridge was contained in a letter from Deputy Smith, the then Minister for Local Government, in which it was stated that a sum of £187,500 odd would be given.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  At column 1317 of the Official Report of the 3rd March, 1955, the Minister is reported as saying:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If a fixed bridge is built there it will not affect navigation in the way that has been suggested here. We already have a fixed bridge over the Boyne and there never has been the suggestion that it has been an obstruction to navigation.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>&ldquo;In the fjords of Norway and Sweden all the bridges are fixed bridges but there is never any obstruction of navigation.  We know also of the famous Golden Gate on the West Coast of America.  That has never obstructed navigation.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I want an opening span <Col N="78" /> in that bridge.  The Minister continued with a few more of them.  Can the Minister name any bridge in Sweden or Norway with a clearance of only 21 feet, which he is proposing here?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>At high water.  The Traneberg Bridge at Stockholm has a clearance of 86 feet.  The Sando Bridge over the River Angerman has a clearance of 114 feet.  These are the bridges that the Minister is talking about.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend now to fight another Battle of the Boyne.  The Forth Bridge, mentioned by the Minister, has a clearance of 150 feet. The designer of the proposed tunnel alongside the Forth Bridge has inspected Youghal Bridge and has given it as his opinion that it can be reconstructed, with an opening span, for £250,000.  That is the difference. The Minister went further and talked about the old schooners.  The information at my disposal in connection with that matter is that the masts of the ordinary trawlers are from 30 feet to, in some cases, 60 feet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Nothing has any business there, according to the Minister.  He will not let anything go there except a duck boat, if he gets his way.  I am informed that 16 schooners of 350 tons have gone up that river in the past four years&mdash;16 out of the 27 for which the bridge had to be opened.  The schooner's seaboard is ten feet and the height of the mast 60 feet.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>And they are going to put steppable masts in for them to go up&mdash;with three or four loads in the year, or whatever they want, up the Blackwater.  The whole matter was very carefully discussed here on the Minister's amendment about the Shannon.  Deputy O'Sullivan, the <Col N="79" /> Parliamentary Secretary, had a very free leg then to come in and protect the Westmeath County Council from being compelled to put an opening span in a bridge that had not been opened before for 25 years, but he did not do it.  I do not know where this amendment and section are going to take us at all.  In paragraph 5 of Section 40 (1) we have: &ldquo;Where the execution of the work has the effect of curtailing or terminating a private right of any person&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Suggestions have been made that I have been responsible for holding up this bridge.

Will he submit them to his Department and get their approval and if they are approved by his Department is he prepared then to invite tenders and let us see then who is right and who is wrong in all this?  Goodness knows, the ratepayers are paying enough and the Minister is a member of a Government that said they were <Col N="80" /> out for economy.  I am trying to save him £150,000.  That is a lot of money. I am trying to protect the interests of the people of Youghal.  By the way, in answer to Deputy Desmond's statement about the bridge before the last one, I would like to say the bridge before the last one was a timber bridge with an opening span.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister stated here that he was not going to obstruct any river.  That is his statement here last week.  On the foot of this, he is going to obstruct the river and obstruct it very seriously.  I hold that no Government and no local authority has a right to come along and say to any town: &ldquo;We are going to ruin your industrial prospects by sealing up your waterway.  That is being done in the <Col N="81" /> case of Tallow and Cappoquin&mdash;the Minister is sealing up the waterway there and preventing industrial expansion in those towns.</P>
      <P>As I said here the last night, I am in Tallow fairly frequently and anyone visiting either Tallow or Cappoquin and seeing the conditions there could see that both those towns&mdash;despite the bacon factory in Cappoquin&mdash;are crying out for industries.  The Minister knows also that industries follow a river.  Where there is a waterway, as Deputy MacBride said, you have a cheaper method of transport.  That cheaper method of transport is to be done away with in this case.  We know &mdash;and I presume the Minister knows, too; he ought to, he has experience enough of it&mdash;the cost of the upkeep of the roads.  Here is a road that costs nothing, a free road, you need not come out with tar macadam or anything else on it; and the Minister is going to deprive the people of Cappoquin and Tallow and the people of Youghal of that road which God gave them and which the Minister is now going to block.</P>

Did anyone ever hear of one of those ships the Minister is thinking of&mdash;which are employed perhaps ten times in 12 months to come up any river&mdash;coming along and putting in steppable masts to come up that river for the sake of a couple of trips in a year?  He knows very well they will not do it.  To be quite honest about it, I am absolutely amazed at the Minister's attitude.  I thought he would be delighted and that he would nearly get up there and thank me for preventing him from doing that injustice.  I was sure he would.  The Minister sits there and is not prepared to budge one way or the other.  The Minister says: &ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; but I would like to ask him what all this expenditure is about.  The Minister told me he sent down instructions to the county council to pay £10,000 or £12,000 for a consultant to prepare plans and specifications for a fixed bridge at Ardsallagh.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to keep flowing on forever.  There is one other little item which concerns what happened in other countries.  I should like to inform the Minister that in Sweden sanction was given for 150 open-span bridges in March, 1933.  Those are in respect of the rivers over which the Minister took me for a sail last week. The lowest clearance I can find in the list here is 87 feet.  Why should the Minister spoil the loveliest river in this country?  It is navigable up to and beyond Cappoquin.  Let us keep it clear where it is.  That is not asking too much.  The matter is in the Minister's hands.  I would like if the Minister took his courage into his hands and forgot all the manoeuvres which put him into this very false position.  He is in a false and wrong position.</P>

      <P>On a point of order. <Col N="86" /> May I respectfully submit to the Chair that it does involve compensation because there is a further section in the Bill providing for the payment of compensation where navigational rights are interfered with?  As I understand the amendment, it is to protect against interference with navigational rights and I think the point that Deputy Corry is making is that any interference with such rights would involve compensation.  His amendment would save the Exchequer and the ratepayers money by preventing any interference with navigational rights.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to mention compensation but I am going to deal with interference with a right. There is a right possessed&mdash;which we all deplore&mdash;by the Duke of Devonshire, a fishing right, and there is also a right possessed by 200 fishermen who are fishing that river and that right is definitely going to be interfered with. The Minister saw those fishermen last week and they told him the exact areas affected and the Minister being a fisherman himself, understood it.  They described the exact areas that they could not fish with drift nets.  They cannot fish for instance between the old bridge and the new bridge with the drift nets.  That is five-eighths of a mile.  They cannot fish for a half-mile <Col N="87" /> above the new bridge with drift nets because the nets would be pulled into the bridge and tangled up.  That is one mile and one-eighth of a mile out of the four miles of river these people have to fish.</P>
      <P>That means these people will have to get rid of 15 of the 50 boats which they are at present fishing in that river.  And it means depriving of their living the 60 fishermen who man these boats and throwing themselves, their wives and children on whatever the social services will give them now. That is the position that arises through this.  That is one of the rights that those men are to be deprived of and it does not matter what clearance there is at the Ardsallagh Bridge, that right goes anyway because the river is absolutely useless to them.  They had an opportunity of explaining that to the Minister, and as far as I could judge at the interview, the Minister was accepting their explanation and was quite satisfied with it.  Is he going to deprive those fishermen of their livelihood, for that is what it will mean? If he is, who is going to pay them?  Is it the State or the local authority? According to what is here it is the executing authority and that puts the whole lot down on Cork County Council.</P>
      <P>The Duke of Devonshire draws something like £700 odd from those 60 fishermen, £13 per man.  I do not know what 20-years' purchase we could make that up on, but it would be £15,000 or £16,000.  I think the fishermen's claim would be, roughly, £75,000 or £80,000 in all.  Who is going to pay it?  Add that to the cost of Ardsallagh.  Those are the facts.  The Minister, in doing this, is going against the wishes of the elected representatives of that area, for every elected representative of that area, every county councillor in that area voted for reconstruction.</P>

We hear many people here declaring their utmost sympathy for the poor, their utmost sympathy for the ordinary working man, their utmost sympathy for the ordinary <Col N="89" /> fisherman&mdash;we hear all this.  There were no fishermen being compensated in the case of the Athlone Bridge, for instance, which was passed unanimously in this House on the 1st December.  No fishermen were involved there.  There was nobody to claim their navigational rights had been stopped or that they were losing anything by not having the right to use the navigable river.  Still, this House on that occasion unanimously <Col N="90" /> gave their decision.  I am condently appealing to this House now, and above all to the Minister, to withdraw his objection to this amendment and let it go through.  I think the wrong attitude has been adopted in this matter.</P>

      <P>Section 49 deals with the situation where a person is retained by a public body in any professional or advisory or consultative capacity.  During the Second Reading of the Bill I said I wanted to make it quite clear that the section would not give power to have a consultant surcharged for any professional advice given. Doubts have arisen since then about this matter and the amendment has been put in to remove such doubts.  In regard to professional men employed as consultants there is no question of their being surcharged for professional advice.  Doubts were expressed on the section as it stood and it is for the purpose of clarification that the amendment is brought in.</P>

      <P>In page 21, to insert before Section 51 the following new Part:</P>
      <P Just="Center">PART V.</P>
      <P Just="Center">Approved Local Councils in County Boroughs.</P>
      <P>51.&mdash;(1)  Where the inhabitants of a locality in a county borough have, either before or after the commencement of this section, established a council, committee or other body, whether corporate or unincorporated, for furthering the general social and economic interests of such inhabitants, the corporation of the county borough may, on the application of such body, by resolution declare that such body shall be an approved local council for the purposes of this Part of this Act.</P>
      <P>(2)  The making of a declaration under this section shall be a reserved function.</P>
      <P>(3)  In this Part of this Act &ldquo;approved local council&rdquo; means a body in respect of which a declaration under this section has been made and every reference to a corporation made in relation to an approved local council shall be construed as a reference to the particular corporation of a county borough which made the declaration under this section relating to that approved local council.</P>
      <P>52.&mdash;(1)  The corporation may provide a building for use by an approved local council for public and other meetings and for lectures, exhibitions, general recreation or other similar social objects and may entrust the care and management of the building to the council either permanently or temporarily.</P>
      <P>(2)  The corporation may acquire by agreement land for or including a building to be provided under this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(3)  The corporation may assist an approved local council by supplying them with furniture, office equipment and stationery and, where a building is provided under this section for <Col N="93" /> use by an approved local council, by paying the whole or part of the wages of a person acting as caretaker of and performing cleansing and similar duties in relation to the building.</P>
    <P>(4)  The corporation may&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  make a grant to an approved local council towards the provision by the council of a building for public or other meetings and for lectures, exhibitions, general recreation or other similar social objects, and</P>
    <P>(b)  as a condition of making the grant, require the council to enter into such agreements with the corporation governing the use and disposal of the building as the corporation consider proper.</P>
    <P>(5)  The corporation may, for the purposes of this section, borrow in the same manner as they may borrow for the purpose of defraying expenses under the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Acts, 1878 to 1953.</P>
    <P>(6)  Money borrowed pursuant to this section may be lent to the corporation by means of an issue from the Local Loans Fund as if such loan constituted a local loan within the meaning of the Local Loans Fund Acts, 1935 to 1953, and was authorised by an Act of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>(7)  Functions of the corporation under sub-section (1), (2), (3) or (4) of this section shall be reserved functions.</P>
    <P>During the debate on the Committee Stage I said I was prepared to consider an amendment put down by Deputies MacBride, Tully and O'Connor. The purpose of the amendment was to enable Dublin and other corporations to extend the same facilities in regard to the building of public halls and community halls which at the moment county councils are able to extend.  County councillors have certain functions and the corporations were purposely omitted from the section as it stood.  I was very impressed by the arguments put forward by the Deputies with regard to Dublin and I think the amendment will achieve what <Col N="94" /> they desired at the time.  The corporations can now assist generally in the provision of parish halls in the same way as county councils have power to do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to express a word of deep gratitude to the Minister for having put in this amendment. He certainly met the suggestions we made very handsomely and constructively. Indeed, I think the amendment he himself has now put into the Bill is much better and much more comprehensive than any we had suggested.  I should like to assure the Minister that this would be a tremendous asset in Dublin, especially in the newly built-up areas where the question of community centres and boys' clubs and of playing fields has become a really acute problem which has to be dealt with.  The Minister has been extremely helpful in this matter and I wish to thank him very sincerely.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the debate was adjourned, I was adverting in detail to the patent dishonesty and distortion that have been a feature of the rather grotesque performance by Deputy Aiken this afternoon.  Among other things he tried to depreciate the development that has been effected by the E.S.B. in rural areas.  Far from the situation being as suggested by Deputy Aiken, I am happy in the knowledge that in my own constituency areas like Inchigeela and Ballingeary, long denied development, are now scheduled for development within the year.  I cannot see on what premises the Deputy bases his argument.  He apparently is not able to appreciate the fact that that development has enabled substantially increased earnings to come back into the E.S.B. through the medium of the power supplied; and it is significant that as the amount of current being used increases not only is the revenue of the E.S.B. likewise increased but the board is in a position to make certain adjustments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="97" /> The picture painted by Deputy Aiken in relation to agriculture was a somewhat amazing one, to put it mildly, coming from the member of a Party which succeeded during its short period in office in causing more confusion and upset to the agricultural economy than can ever be wiped out. When I see crocodile tears being shed over the plight of the farmer to-day my memory instantly goes back to the economic war, to John Brown and all the other people who at one time had the entire farming community completely under their sway in the days when we saw the bailiff put in and all sorts of impositions on the farmer to bring him to heel.  Let us face the fact that the agricultural community is getting a better deal to-day than it has had for many years.</P>
    <P>Consider the over-all picture.  The farmer is now relieved from unwelcome interference.  He is relieved from the dire threat of compulsion, so lucidly and graphically described by Deputy Smith when he threatened to pull down their ditches and recruit not one but ten fields of inspectors.  Fianna Fáil should realise that it is the confidence the agricultural community had in the expansionist ideas and development plans of the previous inter-Party Government and their continued confidence in this inter-Party Government to carry out those plans and implement that development that is the chief reason for Fianna Fáil's early return into opposition.  The agricultural community has confidence that it will be looked after and that adequate provision will be made for the marketing of agricultural produce to the best possible advantage.  It is no use Fianna Fáil crying crocodile tears over the Irish farmer because the Irish farmer knows what kind of treatment he got during the long years in which Fianna Fáil were in office, from 1932 to 1948.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil should realise that this Book of Estimates is but an indication of a new development in the economic sphere.  This Government has been taunted by the Opposition on the question of prices and reductions at the rate of millions per minute.  I would not sing that song too loudly if I were a member of Fianna Fáil because <Col N="98" /> Fianna Fáil is thereby focussing attention on the mess that they left behind and on the harm that was done to the whole economic structure.  Consider the position when they came back into office in 1951: &ldquo;Came back into office&rdquo; may not be the correct description&mdash; they got into office someway.  At that particular time they took control of an economic structure which envisaged an expansionist development by the use of the Counterpart Fund for syphoning in moneys, where moneys were necessary, to make good deficiencies in projects requiring immediate financing.  It was estimated that over a period of years this reserve could be used to augment and support capital development.  With its usual profligate regard for sound economic theory, that complete fund, which should have been held in reserve for a period of years, was dissipated within six months.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier, we also saw the consequences of the 1952 Budget with its disastrous borrowing policy at the interest rate which the last Government had chosen.  We had that picture.  We had confidence within the State shaken by the inept attitude of the Government, with the complete lack of capacity which they were revealing from day to day.  We saw a panic and expansionist type of activity and the efforts made by them to bolster up in an unrelated way, various schemes.  We saw them flummoxed in an effort to try and deal with an alarming rise in unemployment. Now, that is not a very pleasant economic heritage, or a very pleasant premises for the Opposition to argue from, but these are unassailable facts.</P>
    <P>This Government has to face the problem of getting the expenditure side of the nation's business thoroughly examined.  We have seen that it has been enabled to stop the upward trend and to show some reasonable trend towards a reduction.  But the real purpose of this Government, and what the Minister for Finance has to face in his responsibility to this House, is that we expect more and more of these reductions in expenditure.  We expect to <Col N="99" /> see the implementation, month by month and year by year, of a coordinated plan that is going to see more and more people put into gainful employment.  We want to see a proper impetus put into land drainage and land reclamation, and into the development of all schemes that are going to prove, on the capital side of the Budget, to be valuable national assets.</P>
    <P>It is easy for people to talk of reducing the price of this and the price of that.  I myself have often conceded that, in relation to prices, the Government's sphere of influence may not be very considerable, but there is one thing which this Government can and must do, and there is one thing which Fianna Fáil will have to sit for years in opposition watching it do, and that is to bring about an improvement, year after year, in the national income of this State.  Fianna Fáil will have to sit there year after year, watching this Government improve the earning capacity of the people, because once you can give the people the capacity to earn more and maintain prices at their present level, the increase in the people's pay-packet will help to offset the economic stringency which has arisen purely as a consequence of direct Government action which started with the black Budget of 1952.</P>
    <P>This Government must be alive to the fact that the people do not expect miracles overnight, but they do expect as I said previously, a concerted coordinated plan that will ensure the advantageous use of the moneys allotted for capital development.  I want to see, and have always advocated courage and vision in relation to capital expenditure. I do not ever want to see the Government facing, with temerity, the problem of doing a worth while job, just because it is too big to tackle. I think the Opposition can fairly take this Vote on Account as an indication of the fact that the Government's activity is going to be directed towards curbing dead weight administrative costs and of working up in a coordinated way, an expansionist policy for this nation.</P>
    <P>We have seen many improvements over the years.  We have seen in the <Col N="100" /> recent past uncertainty and instability in Government.  That era is gone.  We now have an effective and strong Government in the State.  The Government have the opportunity of sitting down and, in a deliberate fashion, of planning a policy of development over a period of years.  We, on this side of the House, say to the Government, that, while we welcome the practicality of its approach to the administrative costs and supply end of the Book of Estimates, we look forward to ever increasing activity on the investment side of our development.  It would not be any great source of contentment to us if we could curb rising administrative costs if, at the same time, we could not show to the Nation an effective co-ordinated expansionist plan that would bring hope to the people who are flying from this country or who are seeking, for other reasons, employment outside its shores.  We accept the earnest that we have got in the spirit in which is was given, but at the same time we look forward to an era of planned, step by step development in this Nation which will give us the forests we require, the drainage of our rivers that we require and the settlement of the many problems that have aggravated our people over the years.</P>
    <P>As regards forestry, I want to see the Forestry Department getting down to the job of spending the money it is given in the year in which it is voted rather than see the Forestry Vote coming in here with large Appropriations-in-Aid, these being shown as unspent moneys in the following year. We have all complained, not of cuts in the Estimate for Forestry, but of interminable delays in getting on with afforestation.  I take the classic case that I have raised on more than one occasion with the present Minister for Lands, even when he was in the previous inter-Party Government, the question of the Leigh-White estate in Glengarriff.  That is typical of forestry ailments.  The voting of an extra £100,000 in these Estimates makes no difference if the Land Commission or whoever deals specifically with land acquisition does not get after the acquisition and the development of land.  I do not want reserve pools of <Col N="101" /> land built up for afforestation.  I want to see land being acquired, not notionally, but in fact and nurseries being planted, not being put into Books of Estimates in an ephemeral way.</P>
    <P>We face the future with confidence in our support of the Government because we know what it is to have a rising surge of confidence.  Not only in the people in general but in every particular indicator, whether it be commercial or business, we can see the effect of stability and strength in the Government.  There is a will among the people and all sections of the people to get down to the task of geting a job of work done.  You will not get that job of work done on the basis of schoolboy pranks, spurious arguments based on misconception.  You will get it done only by the Opposition realising that for a long period of years the only part it can effectively play in Irish affairs is to be a useful constructive Opposition and to help us to get on with the job.  It is a job that will take a lot of doing.</P>
    <P>I hope, as the years go by, we will not be coming in here to argue on decreases in the administrative costs of running the State.  I hope we will be coming in, as year follows year, to give more and more encouragement to a Minister to go out on the expansionist side in the capital investment of Irish money in the land of Ireland, in the homes of Ireland and in the over-all project of putting more and more Irish people into effective and gainful employment in their own land.</P>
    <P>Let Fianna Fáil realise that they made a most disastrous and most retrograde contribution to our economy from 1951 until they were put out of office last year.  It is not easy to measure how deep that serious blow has gone, any more than it is possible for us even yet to gauge the calamity that this nation suffered from the stupidity of their economic war.  Let them leave their mistakes behind them and be patient and watchful and they may be able to learn, in the course of the next four years, that sane reasoning, effective planning and co-ordinated effort can even undo much <Col N="102" /> of the harm that they have done and may enable this nation to march forward on the road of progress that will give us all the things we require, that will make our economy sound, that will give us increased agricultural production, improved fertility of our soil, the eradication of bovine tuberculosis, improved and better-developed marketing facilities for all our live stock, increased industrial potential and, above all, step by step, the Ireland that it was the ambition of those who paid the supreme penalty that we might have the right to have.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from the Minister, only two members of the Government Parties have so far spoken and listening to them one could only attribute a very low standard of political intelligence to the Irish people.  Deputy Barry referred to the years in which the people suffered maladministration and ill-government under Fianna Fáil. Deputy Collins referred to the oppression that the farming community in particular had to suffer as a result of Fianna Fáil government.  It is well to remember that up to the year 1948 the Fianna Fáil Government was the second longest Administration in Europe at the time and, if the people were so misgoverned and so oppressed, having regard to the system of election that we have in this country, it reflects very badly on the standard of ordinary intelligence, let alone political intelligence, that the Irish people have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Collins or any Fine Gael Deputy who has any ideals that pretend to be national, should not refer so glibly to what happened during the economic war.  I first came to political intelligence during that period and certainly, as an Irishman, I would not have liked to be on the side that opposed the Irish Government in trying to restore national dignity to the Irish farming community.  It is a significant fact that it was amongst that community that the Government got the bulk of its support that maintained it in office to continue the fight against Britain in that economic war.  I think it ill-becomes any Deputy, no matter on what side of the House he stands, to boast of any part taken by any Party or individual or group of individuals <Col N="103" /> against our properly constituted and elected Government of that day.</P>
    <P>The Minister may well feel pleased at the fact that he was able to introduce this Book of Estimates and point to an over-all reduction of £2.77 millions in the house-keeping bill, as he sees it, at the present time but, when that reduction is broken up and examined home, the amount of pride that the Minister has taken in his performance and that of his Government will possibly be somewhat watered down.</P>
    <P>In the first instance, we were led to believe during the first Coalition Government period that they and only they had a full realisation of the value of capital investment.  It is a rather significant fact that now, in their second term of office and at the first opportunity they get, they cut the capital outlay of the State by almost £1,750,000.  I think there are many items that the Minister and the several Ministers responsible for the expenditure of these capital items will be called upon to explain in more detail than the Minister has done here this afternoon.</P>
    <P>The Public Works and Buildings sub-head shows a decrease of £410,000 which is the sum that was provided in last year's Estimate for the purchase of Arus Brugha and the Paris Embassy. Nevertheless, there must be reflected in that some diminution of capital outlay on other necessary public works and public buildings.  When one takes that item into consideration with the one that immediately follows&mdash;new works, that is, new buildings and reconstructed works which shows a decrease of £219,000&mdash;one's opinion is reinforced that there is some intention to diminish to some degree the capital outlay on the erection of necessary public buildings.  As far as my own knowledge of the situation is concerned, I can only point to a possible slowing down on works on school buildings. Certainly, from the results that the Minister for Education has shown since he assumed office, and judging by the replies he has been giving over a period of five or six months to questions <Col N="104" /> on the progress of particular projects for the building of schools, and for the reconstruction of old schools, one can only assume that the push has now gone out of the effort to provide the nation adequately with school buildings.</P>
    <P>In my constituency there are several places where these schools are necessary because of new housing development. I need only mention Ballyphehane, Mayfield, Wilton and Bishops-town areas.  The answer given by the Minister, not three weeks ago in the House, was anything but encouraging from the point of view of the accommodation of school-going children in these new areas.  Several schools in my constituency urgently require reconstruction, and I am sure that, having listened to some of the replies given by the Minister, the same applies to many other areas throughout the country.  I would like to be reassured by the Minister for Finance or by the Minister for Education if he proposes to intervene in this debate or at least in the course of the presentation of his Estimate, that that which is the most fundamental of all capital services, will not suffer by the reduction to which I have referred.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is taking the summary in the front of the book.  If the Deputy looks at page 45 he will find that the figure is broken down there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only looking for a reassurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the Deputy was approaching it honestly and straightforwardly.  If the Deputy looks at page 45, he will see that the difference in Education is only £14,000 out of £1.4 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The reduction is not on schools at any rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>But on the other hand, there is a feeling, as I have said, that the push has gone out of the effort towards adequate provision of schools and their reconstruction.  On the second page of the summary there are two other significant figures.  The grants to local authorities towards the cost of housing schemes show a reduction of £120,000, and grants to local authorities for the provision of sanitary services works show a reduction of £23,500.  These two figures, taken together, suggest to me that there is some falling off in the effort towards rehousing.</P>
      <P>I have always accepted that the housing of our people is a matter above Party.  I will not accuse the Government of trying to diminish it in any way, but if for any reason their administrative policy turns in that direction, I hope it will be corrected. The reduction of £120,000 may well be attributable to the fact, as we have been claiming for the past three or four years, that the housing targets of many local authorities have now been reached, or have almost been reached.  There is a further fact.  The big city areas on which housing development was possible have now been eaten up, and housing authorities are required to go further afield to get suitable land for site development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Naturally, that must tend to increase the provision for sanitary services to these authorities.  This reduction in the capital summary of £23,000 on grants to local authorities for the provision of sanitary services works is at <Col N="106" /> least an indication that there is some diminution of the work envisaged in that field in the coming year.</P>
    <P>Deputy Collins mentioned that the reason for the reduction in the hospital capital outlay Estimate in the current year was that so many hospitals had now been almost completed, and that some were, in fact, completed, and were waiting for formal opening.  But the Minister, even though he intervened when I challenged Deputy Collins, said in his opening statement &mdash;and I think I took it down corectly&mdash; that that meant that expenditure would be £1.5 million less than anticipated, having said, of course, that the expenditure for last year was £1.6 million less than expected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>But next year I am estimating for £250,000 more than was spent this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, that again indicates to me that something is amiss in that particular programme.  Either we have not got the necessary materials, the necessary skilled workmen, or at least the will to get on with the job. I believe there is plenty of material, plenty of skilled workmen, and goodness knows plenty of non-skilled workmen available for any worth-while capital development.  Therefore, one can only assume that the traditional opposition by the Minister's Party to hospitalisation is having some effect on the hospitalisation programme in the coming year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I am aware the reason given by the Minister for <Col N="107" /> Health for his failure to implement the 1953 Health Act was that there was not sufficient hospitalisation available. One would imagine, therefore, that any Minister who was interested in getting on with the job of curing the defects he found in the machinery there when he took up the job would have bent all his efforts towards repairing these defects, the most obvious defect, as he pointed out, being lack of hospital facilities.  Nevertheless, in the original programme, there was a proposal to spend £1.5 million more on hospitalisation in the coming year than is actually being spent.  If that is not a statement of fact, I do not know what is, and, so far as I am concerned, it is an honest approach to the problem as I see it.</P>
      <P>The Minister's action last week in meeting the members of the Banks Standing Committee was commendable and the result was certainly satisfactory. I do not think the Minister would claim all the credit for that, because some of it naturally must be due to the approach by the bank people to the problem as presented by him.  When the British Chancellor of the Exchequer announced his proposals for the increase of the bank rate in England and for his restriction of the hire purchase facilities obtaining there, he said that the reason for his doing so was that there were inflationary trends in the country.  These were largely brought about by the desire of the people to buy goods that were easily available and in many cases imported.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Towards the end of the last inter-Party Government's period of office, there was a similar trend in this country.  Money that was earmarked for capital development was being spent in the purchase of imported consumer goods.  The Fianna Fáil Minister for Industry and Commerce, on assuming office in 1951, had to take very positive and swift action to arrest that trend.  I need only mention the quantitative restriction which he imposed on certain fabrics and wearable goods that were being freely imported up to then.  If that trend had been allowed to continue, inflation <Col N="108" /> must have resulted here and the Banks Standing Committee which met the Minister would not have been so easily able to agree to the Minister's proposals not to follow the lead given by the British Chancellor of the Exchequer and the British banks.</P>
    <P>Fortunately, in this country, the hire purchase system has not got a grip to the same extent as it has in England. However, I am not entirely against hire purchase because it gives the people an opportunity of enjoying now goods which might be described in many respects as luxury goods but which in most respects are essential goods, which they might not otherwise be in a position to buy, but it is a matter the Minister will have to keep his eye on, to make sure that hire purchase does not bog down the average wage earner, the average person relying on a fixed income. Naturally, with the increase in the standard of living in this country, many people, being human, will try to be at least as good as, if not to emulate, their neighbours in the possession of what are now considered the necessaries of life.</P>
    <P>People can buy suites of furniture, wireless sets, carpets and all kinds of electrical labour-saving devices on the hire purchase system and in many cases a particular item might add only an extra half crown or five shillings per week to the deficit side of any family budget; but the taking of a lot of these things together in many cases has ended up in people being sued by these companies and having no answer whatever to their claims not only for the return of the goods but for the payment of any repayments due on the particular goods.  The position in England seems to have got to such an advanced stage that the Chancellor had to step in.  I hope that such a situation will never arise here, but, on the other hand, I am not advocating that any clamp down should be made on that type of industrial enterprise, if one might call it that.</P>
    <P>On the social welfare side, if, as the Minister said, the decrease in unemployment assistance and unemployment benefit is due to the fact that there has been an increase in employment, <Col N="109" /> it is, too, very gratifying, and one can only hope that this decrease has not been contributed to too much by the scourge of emigration.  Unfortunately, I am inclined to believe that it has, to some extent, but the Minister will soon be speaking, and, if we are to take heed of what Deputy Collins has said, he will be able to give us some reassurances in regard to his statements as to the possibility of increasing old age and blind pensions in the near future, but it is nevertheless significant that, in these Estimates, under the old age pensions sub-head, we see a small decrease of £10,000 for the coming year.  The total figure runs at the moment about £9,500,000, and a 10 per cent.  increase in old age pensions would mean an extra £1,000,000 per annum, or something in that neighbourhood, but if it is the intention of the Government to introduce legislation whereby old age and blind pensions will be increased, there will be a very big Supplementary Estimate necessary and I should like to hear at this stage whether or not we can believe that there is going to be an increase in these particular items and, if so, why some indication of it is not given in the Estimates.</P>
    <P>Again I want to refer to part of the Minister's opening statement in which he blamed the 1952-53 increase in the cost of living on deliberate Government policy.  The deliberate Government policy of that time was such that any Government who disagree with it can be just as deliberate in reversing that policy and restoring the <i>status quo.</i>  The efforts so far made by this Government certainly have not gone very far towards that end.  The only earnest we have seen of the oft-repeated protestations about their intentions to restore the 1951 price levels is the reduction of 5d. in the price of butter.</P>
    <P>If deliberate Government policy increased the cost of living to such an extent and so damaged the national economy, surely this Government is long enough in office now to arrest, by their own deliberate policy, that particular trend.  If it was so damaging to the national economy, one would expect that some further effort would be made <Col N="110" /> and that at least an attempt to restore these prices would be apparent from these Estimates.  The remedy is simple. It is a question of subsidising, or not.</P>
    <P>In recent months the leading members of the Government have stated that, generally speaking, the Government themselves cannot control the cost of living as it is largely influenced by world economic events.  To the extent that there was deliberate Government policy in the 1952 Budget, which so increased the cost of living as to damage the national economy, this Government have the necessary power and can avail of the remedy to revert to the position that obtained when they last left office.  I wonder whether or not we will see a restoration of subsidies in the coming year.  As far as I can see from the Estimates, no effort is being made in that direction.  Therefore, so far as this Government are concerned, the effects of the deliberate policy of the Fianna Fáil Government are being allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>I should like to comment on Deputy A. Barry's statement about the profligate spending of Marshall Aid by the Fianna Fáil Government.  Even though Deputy A. Barry was not a member of this House at the time, I would remind him that while the present Minister for Agriculture was in opposition between the years 1951-54 he boasted on three separate occasions of being able to spend £5,000,000, £6,000,000 and £7,000,000&mdash;he mentioned a different figure on each occasion&mdash;of Marshall Aid moneys in one afternoon while he was in America.  The spending of these moneys would have been justified were it not for the fact that they were spent on consumer goods that could well have been produced in this country.  If that is not profligate spending, nothing is, and certainly no member on the Government Benches should be too ready to criticise Fianna Fáil's expenditure of Marshall Aid in the light of what Deputy Dillon then said.</P>
    <P>In the past few years the Exchequer has apparently been able to claim a credit on the Road Fund.  I think I read recently that the credit for the year just finished was something in the neighbourhood of £215,000; if I am <Col N="111" /> wrong the Minister will correct me.  I think, too, that for the year before, or some couple of years previously, there was a similar credit as a result of expenditure from that fund.  I should like to mention one particular aspect of that Road Fund or of its distribution in so far as it affects my constituency. For many years past, Cork City has failed to get any advance out of that particular fund&mdash;largely, I suppose, because we have not sufficient of what are known as &ldquo;main roads&rdquo; within the constituency.  An odd time we have got about £10,000; many years we got nothing.  Certainly, however, there is one approach into Cork City that needs a fairly heavy outlay at the present time to put it into proper condition: I refer to the Tivoli Road, which leads to Dublin and to Waterford. This road is fast getting into a very bad condition&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Unfortunately I was unable to be present last week.  However, I knew that it was one of the matters that the Deputy members of the Cork Corporation intended to raise with the Minister.  I am glad to learn that the Minister has acceded to their request and I shall now pass from that subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Aiken referred to the reduction in the grant to Mianraí Teoranta. Again, reverting to what was stated before this Government took up office, <Col N="112" /> may I point out that the Minister for Justice made a specific statement when speaking in his own constituency, to the effect that more money would be available for mineral exploration as soon as the inter-Party Government was restored to office?</P>
    <P>I have page 271 of the Book of Estimates open before me and, under Minerals Development, I note that there is a reduction of almost 100 per cent. in payments to Mianraí Teoranta for prospecting.  Lest I should be accused of exaggerating, may I say that it is not quite a reduction of 100 per cent.  Last year's figure was £74,000, while this year's figure is £40,000.  I know it is very difficult to continue to make grants available for prospecting for minerals with a view to mineral development in this country but the fact is that mineral prospecting is a very expensive form of activity.  Sometimes we reach a stage when so much has been spent on a particular prospecting project that it is then too late to turn back and we have to go forward.  I assume that whatever prospecting is being done by Mianraí Teoranta at the present time has already cost the State a considerable sum of money.</P>
    <P>I presume that those who are in charge of Mianraí Teoranta, aided and advised by their technicians, would not be seeking money unless they were reasonably sure it would be an economic proposition.  Therefore, I believe that any easing-up on prospecting at this stage&mdash;having regard to the fact that mineral development would be of such outstanding value to us&mdash;would be a mistake.  From the point of view of the Minister for Justice, it would be a huge political mistake.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I want to refer to one of the points&mdash;I forget how many they had&mdash;this Government published when they assumed office, and that is the establishment of a separate Ministry for the Gaeltacht.  These Estimates certainly do not envisage any such establishment.  As far as I can see, very little has been done to advance the economic interests of the Gaeltacht. I know that the matter is fraught with difficulties but one would at least expect, after almost eight <Col N="113" /> months of office, some earnest from the Government in regard to that particular promise.  If some increased Government activity were envisaged in the Gaeltacht in the coming financial year, one would have expected that it would have been portrayed in some manner in these Estimates, but it is not.</P>
    <P>The Minister can claim with some justification that he has effected a decrease, but when one examines it home and realises that the decrease on the capital side of £1.63 millions is largely made up by a decrease in the capital outlay under health of £1,250,000, and that of the £1.1 millions decrease on the Supply Services we have £700,000 odd attributable to the Government's policy on wheat&mdash;we can only say that the decreases are more notional than real.  The Minister told us that it was not with a great deal of confidence or complacency he was facing his Budget.  Certainly, having regard to what we were told to expect before they assumed office, having regard to the charges made against the Fianna Fáil Government &ldquo;which overtaxed the people and which overestimated to the tune of £10,000,000&rdquo;, one cannot understand why the Minister should feel so worried that he will not be able to produce what Deputy Flanagan described as the Budget the people have been waiting for for seven years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that a very great measure of congratulation is due to the Minister and to the Cabinet for the Estimates now before us.  In the Opposition speeches, there lies more proof that this is so than in anything that has been said by us.  The first speaker, the ex-Taoiseach, Deputy de Valera, stressed in his own way the repeated tendency of the figure to grow year by year.  It does not require any figures of mine to give the impression that is created in the minds of the people that every year these Estimates increase.  They do&mdash;and they have done so right from the formation of the State.  What the Minister has done must be considered in this light, because not only has he arrested this <Col N="114" /> trend but he has reduced the figure by £2.7 millions.  Deputy de Valera also told us that if we were to continue like this the Government must learn to say &ldquo;No&rdquo; to new proposals.  Certainly the Government must learn to say &ldquo;No&rdquo; to new proposals.  The Government has said &ldquo;No&rdquo; to many new proposals.  To instance just a few of the old reliables of which we like to remind the Opposition we can trot out the Bray Road and Dublin Castle.</P>
      <P>We heard of building here to-night. Last week we heard even of Dublin Castle from Deputy Briscoe.  We heard to-night from Deputy Lynch and Deputy Aiken.  Which is it better to turn down a proposal like this and turn to something which is productive &mdash;such as the increases in the Estimates now available show&mdash;or to continue on the profligate spending as described by my colleague, Deputy Barry?  My colleague from Louth, Deputy Aiken, confined most of his remarks to wheat.  He said a very great saving had been made by the Government in the new price of wheat. He did not mention the situation which faced the Government and the Minister for Finance as well as the Minister for Agriculture.  It is, therefore, wise for us to consider the whole trend of what has happened since the reduction was announced in the price of wheat. The reduction was announced because, as the Minister for Agriculture told us, many non-farming speculators were gaining money from the land of Ireland and not restoring the fertility that must lie therein if we are to be prosperous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The figures show that in three years the increase was from 252,000 acres to 334,000 acres and, finally, last year to 491,000 acres.  Deputy Aiken never reminded us of this.  It would be a very good thing to grow plenty of wheat if we had the use for it, but Deputy Aiken did not remind us that all we have the use for&mdash;as decided not by our Government but by the Fianna Fáil Government and written in black and white on the memorandum of the 17th January, 1954&mdash;is 450,000 acres as a maximum.  The figure was 491,000.  God did not provide us with a surplus of wheat grown on 41,000 acres.  If God had sent that, the Government would <Col N="115" /> have lost £250,000 or, alternatively, would have had to ask the people of the towns to provide a subsidy of £250,000 or, alternatively, would have had to ask the pig feeders, poultry producers and the cattle feeders to pay £250,000 more for the produce of that 41,000 acres.</P>
    <P>If the Government had allowed the trend to continue and if there had been an extra 100,000 acres next year or an extra 150,000 acres the year after, one of those three groups of people&mdash;those who give us our general funds from taxation, the people of the towns in the non-wheat producing counties or, alternatively, the people who are feeding pigs, poultry and cattle for export and who are giving us such a wonderful return in these last years&mdash;would have had to produce £5,000,000, £6,000,000, £7,000,000 or maybe £10,000,000 to make up the deficit.</P>
    <P>It is very important to register here to-night and place on the records of the House the fact that, a fortnight later, when Fianna Fáil brought their wheat motion to the Seanad, they sent their principal speaker there, Senator Paddy Cogan, and his line was not that we should pay £4 a barrel for all the wheat there was&mdash;because he knew it could not be done when he heard the memorandum of the Fianna Fáil Cabinet of the 17th January, 1954&mdash;but that we should introduce the contract system.  Therefore, Deputy Aiken's approach to wheat is that there should be a reduction, of the contract system, or a group of people had to suffer.  His line was &ldquo;Now that I have not the responsibilities of Government it is my purpose to cash-in on it politically.&rdquo; That has been his attitude in County Louth, even up to three days ago.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to hospital services.  Deputy Lynch said that the reduction is evidence of the Government's hostility to the health programme. If he had been making representations to the Department of Health he would know that the Hospitals' Trust Funds have been allocated up to 1960.  If the building programme is behind, because of bad weather and various other things, and if we have not to provide for parts of it in this year's Estimate, and if there <Col N="116" /> is a reduction as a result, can he blame the Government for it?</P>
    <P>He also spoke of social welfare.  As I see the Minister for Social Welfare here to intervene in the debate, I do not think I should say much about it. Deputy Lynch put the question, no doubt for the Opposition Press tomorrow, as to whether the decrease in unemployment was paralleled by an increase in emigration.  I would like to inform Deputy Lynch that but for the deliberate action of the Fianna Fáil Government we would know.  It is not necessary now for a person emigrating to report to the local Garda station.  There was one law whereby they must report.  It was deliberate action on the part of the Fianna Fáil Government that saw to it we did not know so that they could hide the rising emigration which was a feature of the Government from 1951 to 1954.</P>
    <P>Reference was also made by Deputy Lynch to Deputy Dillon, the present Minister for Agriculture, spending six, seven or eight million pounds in one afternoon.  He bought on that occasion fertilisers in New York with funds from the American Marshall Aid.  He brought them to this country and, as a direct result, the price of fertilisers dropped by as much as 25 or 30 per cent.  The reason was that the only other source we have is the British source and this source is completely controlled by Imperial Chemical Industries.  At that time the present Minister for Agriculture had it in his power to go to another source and put these people into competition. He did so and Deputy Lynch should not now demean him for so doing because as a result of the action of the present Minister for Agriculture the price of fertilisers at that time was reduced by 30 per cent.</P>
    <P>Did he not do a very essential work? It must be put on record that he was prepared to bring in the fertilisers at £9 per ton at the port of entry and make them available to every farmer but Fianna Fáil were not so prepared to do.  They later sold them at £17 per ton.  Deputy Lynch should not refer to the purchases of the present Minister for Agriculture during his previous term of office.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="117" /> There are increases in this Book of Estimates.  We should examine those increases.  Everyone knows that agriculture is the basic industry of this country.  Everybody also knows for a fact&mdash;what the Minister for Agriculture has repeated again and again&mdash;namely that, when agriculture falls, the first man that falls is the townsman, the professional man or somebody who has no direct relation with agriculture. Increases in the Estimates for agriculture are, therefore, very important.  It is interesting to note that there is an increase of £218,000 in the Estimate for farm building schemes.  The land project scheme shows an increase of £208,000 and, when the American Grant Counterpart Fund is taken into consideration, £933,000 will be used of which some £600,000 will be used to produce ground limestone and £100,000 for the milk pasteurisation scheme. That is the type of thing that our Government look to in order to provide a higher standard of living for our people.  We do not look to the Bray Road, Dublin Castle, the building of 700 Garda houses at £3,000 each or any other grandiose scheme.  We look to the fields, the farmers and the workers in order to give everyone a higher standard of living.</P>
    <P>Decreases there are.  I explained the decrease in regard to health.  The decrease in regard to defence is large but it is interesting and very gratifying to note that in the Estimates the decrease in wages and salaries to be paid is as low as 8 per cent. of the total.  I would recommend the Minister for Defence to consider, perhaps next year or the year after, increasing the individual payments to the members of the Forces because if we are to have a small force, in the light of nuclear warfare, that force, I think, should be well paid.  People should be induced to join but the only way you will attract people is by making the life something into which firstclass men will go.</P>
    <P>Some of the results of the efforts of the present Minister for Finance in the last eight months are very gratifying. We all know of his wonderful national loan.  I do not believe that <Col N="118" /> any other person in this country could have had such a success in such a short time.  There is nobody so hard to convince as bankers.  The Minister for Finance was successful in convincing the banks not to increase the rate of interest because there is no inflationary trend in Ireland to-day.  That was something which no Minister for Finance ever succeeded in doing before.  It meant a complete break and has created a precedent.  Its importance cannot, and must not, be overlooked.</P>
    <P>Let me return to social services for a moment.  I am disappointed that the Book of Estimates does not show some increase in the sum allotted for old age pensioners and grants towards the supply of fuel for necessitous families and many other things.  The poor are always with us.  But after all, it is a proud thing to have reduced unemployment by 7,060 in eight months, or more than 1,000 a month.  It is a fact that there are many poor people and many necessitous persons with us and the cost of living is nothing which gives us any right to complacency at the moment.  I would have liked to have seen an increase in the sums allotted for old age pensions and for the supply of fuel to necessitous people, etc.  I hope that later in the year we will hear of that.  I will conclude on that note.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am really not surprised at the figure of the Vote on Account as an approximate estimate of the amount that will be required for payment during the first four months of the next financial year on the basis of a Budget estimated to require these sums of money for payment. When the Minister for Finance spoke to-day, at one stage I really came to the conclusion that we were going to have a postponement of the local elections and, possibly, that we might have an election Budget and a general election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance knows that statements have been made and definite commitments entered into as a result of those statements and that at a later stage&mdash;how late I do not know; but within this financial year, 1955-56&mdash; there will be sums provided to give <Col N="119" /> additional moneys to the old age pensioners, the widows and orphans and necessitous people.  It was definitely stated by the Minister for Social Welfare that the Cabinet had agreed. Why it is not included as an increase in the Book of Estimates is beyond me.  There is no doubt about it that these figures can be just as accurately estimated as the figures for the provision under the present rates.  Obviously this Book of Estimates is not a true Book of Estimates for the coming year because if there is any definite commitment and any truth in the promise to the old age pensioners, widows and orphans and necessitous people of an increase in payment to them, then there would have to be a substantial Supplementary Estimate brought in.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Minister for Finance can quarrel with that appreciation. Now, how many millions that will mean I will leave to Deputy Barry to estimate, if he likes, seeing that he was so kind as to honour me with mention when he made his short speech to-day with which I will deal later. But it is on a par with the letters Deputy Barry wrote to the Press during the election campaign when he said the price of tea should be 2/8 per lb. and were it not for Deputy Lemass it would be 2/8 per lb. and that he was going to see that it would be sold at 2/8 per lb.</P>

      <P>A great number of members that make up the Government Benches owe their seats there to promises made, promises which have not yet been honoured.  One of them was to bring down the price of tea.  Coming to the tea point, the Minister knows in spite of what he said to-day that it is unlikely that tea will ever come down again to be sold <Col N="120" /> at the prices at which we knew it to be sold before the war or during the emergency period, and that this piling up of a deficit arising from the tea not being sold at its commercial price, will have to be met by the State at some time.  Are we to take it that it will not be met in this financial year? This tea for which this debt will pile up will be consumed and out of existence, and we will have an additional million or so for a second Supplementary Estimate within the year, again bringing up the total of these Estimates to a much higher figure than is held out now.</P>
      <P>The Minister spoke about tea coming down, and he is either misinformed or he has misread the statements to which he referred of the big tea sellers in England.  They have brought down tea by 4/- a lb. from the 8/- rate by&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have been taking it for a great number of years.  Here are two points that the Book of Estimates has not included and is concealing from the taxpayer, a liability to be met and not yet estimated but for which commitments have been made.  In the case of the tea, the distributors are selling the tea at a certain price and a loss is being made, and the suggestion has been made by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach &mdash; he was one of those who made it &mdash; that when tea falls below its present level, it will be kept at the same price to the people until the deficit now created is wiped out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I have referred first of all to this commitment of increased payments to the widows, orphans and aged and other such beneficiaries of State assistance.  Perhaps the financial expert in the Government could tell us what that is estimated to cost, when it is going to be introduced and how much it is going to add on to the Book of Estimates.  I have referred to the tea, and I say that is something we should be able to estimate so as to see how much further the Book of Estimates figure must rise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now I come to something else which I consider to be an unfair method of saving Government expenditure, a device whereby certain responsibilities are being transferred from the National Exchequer to the ratepayers and savings are made &mdash; or apparently savings are being made.  Again, the fact is that the money has to be found but it is being lifted off the shoulders of the taxpayers to reduce the figure in the Book of Estimates and being transferred by a device to the shoulders of the local authorities and through those to the ratepayers who again, as taxpayers, pay it without knowing they are paying it that way instead of this way.  I will come again to that later on, but beforehand I want to refer to Vote 9 &mdash; Public Works and Buildings. There is a magnificent saving there, a very substantial decrease.  We have had questions within the last few weeks in this House, the purpose of which was to elicit from the Minister the state of <Col N="123" /> our schools and the need for a rapid approach to the closing down of schools unfit for use under our present appreciation of what is, or what should be, the standard schoolhouse for children, so that such schools would be replaced urgently and immediately. But in this Book of Estimates the amount of money to be spent on the building of schools by the Board of works is down.  Is that denied?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's Party never spent even half of the money they provided for the building of schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary be good enough to get the appropriation accounts for the last year &mdash; we have not got them for this year &mdash; and tell us the figure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">

      <P>When the Parliamentary Secretary, instead of threatening to do so, gets the figures and quotes them I will accept them, but I am not going to accept as a matter of fact a threat to be translated into a fact.  I challenge the Deputy now to procure them.  In the Book of Estimates here if you analyse expenditure under the Office of Public Works it will be found that the provision of money for the building of schools is less than was estimated to be provided for in the last Book of Estimates and is one of the big items in bringing this expenditure down.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I say &ldquo;big&rdquo; in this way.  We all know there was of necessity a hold-up in work during the emergency years and we all know that at the present time Deputies on the Government Benches have been trying to force the Government to make provision for the building of those schools and in the building of them there would be employment given as an alternative to the employment which no longer exists to the same extent in the building of houses particularly in rural <Col N="124" /> areas and areas away from what you might call centres.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>It was big, I say, in relation to the undertakings given. There were going to be hundreds of schools rebuilt, as is on the records of the House from last week's replies to questions.  That is one item.  We heard the Deputy who last spoke say that he was glad to hear the erection of Garda barracks would not be an item on which there would be extravagant expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy said nothing of the kind.  He said houses for Garda not Garda barracks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the expenditure for public works and buildings there was an Estimate and Supplementary Estimates amounting to £4,647,000 whereas this year it is £3,800,000. Where is the difference coming in and what is the saving to be?  Is it a departure from certain types of works or does this total include savings on machinery?  I do not know how many items are involved in this but there is a very substantial decrease between what was estimated last year together with Supplementary Estimates and what is being estimated now.  Or are we to take it that there will be a Supplementary Estimate for that Department as well, again adding on items for this year's expenditure which is either not foreseen or is deliberately withheld in order to make the bill of <Col N="125" /> costs look smaller than it is actually going to be?</P>
      <P>There is another item I would like the Minister to explain to me and possibly to those of us here who are members of local authorities.  Vote 17 is the Vote under which the Government makes its contribution to local authorities in lieu of rates.  Rates are going up everywhere and yet the Government expenditure on this particular item is going down.  Can the Minister tell me how that particular piece is worked?  Is it that the Government is going to give up occupation of certain premises and to cease paying rates on them?  How you can reduce the Government payment in lieu of rates to local authorities when rates are going up is beyond my comprehension because it is not detailed in the sense that we can easily trace it. Perhaps the Minister will be good enough to explain that when he is replying, or maybe at the moment, if he wishes to tell me where I am off the track, but certainly Vote 17 includes a considerable amount of payments, I suppose to a great extent in the City of Dublin.  I do not know whether the President's establishment has got smaller or what has happened but the rates on that are down from £1,565 to £1,500.  The rates in Dublin are definitely going to go up and how the Minister can save £65 from the rates I do not know.  The rates contribution for the Houses of the Oireachtas is £2,555 for the year for which we are now estimating. It is down by £110.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to interrupt the Deputy but I must point out that on the Vote on Account we do not go into the items of an Estimate. It is the general, over-all policy of the Government in respect of the spending of money that must be discussed. It might be just as well to make it clear now that we do not go into the items of a Vote on Account because the Vote on Account is not itemised.  The Deputy must wait until the particular Vote is being taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I am trying to make is that this Book of Estimates appears to me to be one which is not giving a fair picture to the public.  I <Col N="126" /> have pointed out already that certain payments which are bound to come up for payment within the course of the financial year are not in this Book of Estimates and I am asking &mdash; I will not say charging &mdash; how certain of these payments can be fixed in the face of rates going up every year.  I want just to illustrate a couple of cases&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I only want to substantiate the point of view which I am arguing and the reason I am arguing that point of view.  I see the rates in the City of Dublin, to which the Government makes substantial payments, are going up, and unfortunately they will go up again because payments previously made out of the Exchequer will be thrown on the backs of local ratepayers, and on the backs of industrial ratepayers.  I am saying that because I think that only on that basis is it possible to estimate here for less when we know that the payments must go up.  Normally, any private person who occupies a premises or a business house, if he makes any additions to his property, will suffer from higher rates because the Valuation Office people come round and put up his valuation.  We have discussed that matter before and we hope some time to see some more equitable approach to the problem.  But in addition to rates going up in Dublin we are, Sir, with your permission, continually adding to the size of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it you are in charge of this House, and that if there is any building to be done here it must be done with your permission, and I am sure, Sir, that you will admit you have not been responsible for demolishing any parts of Leinster House in order that there could be a reduction in the rates.  That is a simple instance, and I want to know how it is done.  It is a marvellous thing but I think &mdash; and whoever has done the <Col N="127" /> pruning has slipped up there &mdash; that the Minister will have to mend his hand here.</P>
      <P>If there is going to be a cutting down of payments to the local authorities at a time when rates are rising the Government might find the local authority may reduce its services.  We may, in fact, cut off the water here and make the Government pay for the water.  I have said already that there is a new device in operation and, of course, the 1953 Health Act will be brought to the assistance of the Government as the big gun of their defence.  But I should like to say to the House this, and I should like to have my remarks put on record: up to some months ago industrial workers contributed, or the employers contributed for them, under the National Health Scheme, and if such an industrially insured worker required hospital treatment or anything else of that kind, it was the Department of Social Welfare which paid for his hospital upkeep or for whatever other medical treatment he thought he might need. What happens now?  The stamps are still being paid by the worker or by his employer and the money still goes into the Exchequer but now the charge for the health maintenance of these insured workers is paid out of the rates.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to that, too.  I said the big guns would be turned on, but there will be a few little machine guns in reply which might very well put the big guns out of action.  I discovered yesterday at the meeting of the Dublin Corporation that there is an additional £150,000 to be provided for by the Dublin Corporation because of these transfers to us of these charges of which, I admit, we are recouped 50 per cent.  But that leaves us a matter of £75,000 a year for these workers alone.  That is an imposition on the ratepayers, with the consequent saving of £75,000 to the State.  It means 8d. in the £ on the rates and when Deputy Barry gets back to Cork he will find the same situation, but to what extent in money <Col N="128" /> or by way of increasing rates he will have to find out later.  Is not that a nice state of affairs?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Subject to your ruling, a Cheann Comhairle, I want to take that as an argument to show how savings can be made in the Vote for the Department of Health by concealment and by transfers.  The Minister recently ordered the Dublin local authority to increase by 100 per cent. the payment it made to hospitals for the maintenance of Dublin patients.  Previously, the State made up the deficits of the public hospitals.  Now it reduces the payments by saying to the customers: &ldquo;Pay more,&rdquo; the customer in this case being the local authority. That is going to impose another couple of shillings in the £ on the ratepayers in Dublin and it is taken off the Book of Estimates.  I call it just a device.</P>
      <P>Now, there was a time before the first inter-Party Government was formed when their predecessors in office, the Fianna Fáil Party, had built up a substantial fund of Hospital Trust moneys which were invested for the purpose of bringing in a certain amount of money every year to meet deficits.  When the first inter-Party Government came in, in their anxiety to build hospitals at an even greater rate than had been done by their predecessors they wiped out roughly £5,000,000 already saved for the purpose of having an income to meet deficits, and they had then to meet deficits out of taxation.  Now, in order to reduce national expenditure, there is a shift on to some other public authority to collect from the public and the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy O'Donovan, had the audacity to say the other day that if I was making as good a job of the Special Works Committee of the City of Dublin as I was of the rates he would not think much of it.  But these are the gentlemen who are causing all the trouble where the rates are concerned.</P>

      <P>For a person who holds himself out as an expert in finance that is rather an extraordinary question. I have been for the last ten or 15 minutes trying the patience of the Chair in an effort to prove that 2/11 has been imposed on the ratepayers of Dublin because of a shift of the burden from the Exchequer and the Parliamentary Secretary now wants to make out that I am responsible for that; I am his Minister for Finance doing this on the people of Dublin.</P>

      <P>He is not talking over my head.  He may be talking over Deputy Barry's head.  I am not able to deal in magic.  I have proved conclusively, and I defy contradiction on it, that the change of payment for certain health services from the Exchequer to the rates is a device to show a decrease in the Health Estimate and is the cause of the increase in the rates levied by the local authority.  Surely to goodness, that is a form of words which does not put anything over anybody's head. Deputy Barry will have to answer for the increase in Cork City and there will be just as big an outcry there as there is in Dublin; and I certainly will not be held responsible for the increased rates in Cork City, but Deputy Barry will.</P>

Will it be £1,000,000?  Will it be £3,000,000? Will it be £5,000,000?  It will be something. The Minister for Finance and the Government can take it from me that it is no more likely that full <Col N="131" /> employment will eventuate in this year than it is that tea will come back to its pre-war level.</P>

      <P>I will discuss another decrease that has been effected.  I was saying it is not likely that we will have full employment in the coming financial year and, therefore, it will be necessary to make provision in the Estimates so that money will be available to give immediate employment to those who are in need of it.  It is no use our waiting until the situation is such that it has to be met by way of panic or emergency measures.  Does the Minister not realise despite what he says about a reduction in the numbers <Col N="132" /> of people signing on that a tendency towards further disemployment has grown up during the last few months.  Strange to say, there is not a single member of the Labour Party here except, of course, the Minister for Social Welfare.  I must apologise to him, but I am talking really of backbenchers like myself; there is not one here to ask why no provision has been made for what the Minister for Social Welfare promised by way of additional payments to old age pensioners and widows and orphans.</P>

I must protest on behalf of Deputies and the public that we have here a Book of Estimates in relation to which a claim is made that there is now a tendency to bring down national expenditure, and when I challenge the fact that there is no provision for a particular type of expenditure I am told by a Minister: &ldquo;Wait and see.&rdquo;</P>

That is how we did it. But we have been told here that there is a definite commitment that the increase will be given, and there is no provision for it in the Book of Estimates. Either the increase will be given or it will not, but, in any case, it is wrong not to show it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not agreeing with it.  What I am saying is that that is what the Minister for Finance is claiming. I am pointing out that it is a fictitious claim, and that there are millions of pounds yet to be provided for to which the Minister has been committed by his colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare.  If I know the make up of the Cabinet, the fact that the Minister for Social Welfare has publicly said so, means that the money will be provided for that purpose.  If it is not, it might be a good thing to provide in the Estimates a little bit more money for a general election which might come sooner than expected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>This House does not happen to be a body of people assembled around a beautifully festooned platform, with bands playing, listening to promises made &ldquo;If you vote for us&rdquo;.  We are here on serious business.  The 12 points have nothing whatever to do with this Estimate. This Estimate has a certain number of Votes in it &mdash; a 66-point programme. There are 66 Estimates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>And 34 out of the 66 have been reduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>34 out of 66 reduced? I say reduced by pure misleading information or by the concealment or withholding of demands that will be <Col N="134" /> made later by means of Supplementary Estimates or by shifting the burden, as I have proved, from the State National Exchequer to the local authorities and through them to the ratepayers.  That is how it is being done.  Does the Minister not realise that the public will be educated into an understanding of why these things are happening? Does he not know that there is a great demand by public opinion for a shifting of certain responsibilities from the backs of the ratepayers to the National Exchequer, and that there are more than sufficient statutory demands on local authorities over which they have no control and no say but that by administration in Government offices additional payments have to be extracted from the public without the people understanding how or why.</P>
      <P>I am making the case that this Book of Estimates is not going to be the full Book of Estimates.  As I said before, I would be glad to welcome it if it were.  It strikes me as being the kind of Book of Estimates which is an insurance policy against a possible split in the present component parts that make up the Government.  If they do split, it will make an excellent election Budget, not for the Labour people because they have been left out.</P>
      <P>I have seen statements made by prominent Labour members saying that they had forced the Government to keep the price of tea at its present level.  That would indicate that the Minister for Finance may not be too happy about it.  The Minister must have some idea or some information about this, and I should like to ask him, how much money does he think the coming financial year will become liable for as a result of the loss accruing by keeping the price of tea at its present level, and why is provision not being made for it in the Estimates?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Probably it will be a lot cheaper in a couple of months' time, but it will never again be sufficiently cheap to sell it at 2/8 per lb.  Maybe Deputy Barry would put that in his pipe and smoke it.  There should be appreciation of the situation that we have confronting us.  The point that I am coming to is that if the Government wish to subsidise tea they should do so and if necessary in doing so should ration it so that the tea subsidised by the taxpayers' money will not be smuggled out of the country or be taken in excess by those who can better afford to buy it in comparison with those who cannot afford to do so.  Let there be some proper control. The same applies to butter.  The Minister talked about the cost of butter and mentioned, I think, the figure of £2,000,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

I said in a previous debate that such a reduction would have brought far more benefit to the people whom the Minister for Social Welfare wants to help.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very sorry, Sir. It is the confusion between the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy O'Sullivan, and the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy O'Donovan, that constantly upsets me.  The Minister for Finance talked about the bank rate. That was referred to by another speaker, and great credit was being given to the Minister for the wonderful <Col N="138" /> job he had done in getting the banks to agree not to raise the overdraft rate of interest notwithstanding what had happened in England, but I notice this morning that the banks have announced an increased rate for deposits.  It is very interesting.  Why was that done?  It is quite clear to me that if our banks, which have branches in Northern Ireland, in the occupied Six Counties, and have connections across the water, if the difference between the rates of interest chargeable is very significant, obviously the money will be transferred there because, under present conditions, the banks are the trustees for money which is deposited with them by the public or on loan and nothing can stop the persons taking out their money.</P>
      <P>If, on the one hand, you have a lesser rate of overdraft than normal and you have a more attractive deposit rate somewhere else, the individual who has his money in the bank for long periods would be inclined to take it out, say, of our area and put it in the other area where he would get ½ per cent. more interest on his money and that would immediately cause a situation which would be very unsatisfactory. I do not know, I do not suppose the Minister knows &mdash; at the present moment I do not suppose it would be fair to go into it in any great detail&mdash; nobody knows what margins there are for our banks.</P>
      <P>The Minister was responsible for the setting up of a tribunal to examine and to try to bring to an end a dispute where the banks resisted a demand for increased payment to their staffs because, they said, their profit margins would not allow it.  On the other hand there is, and always has been, a volume of opinion that the banks made very substantial profits and could easily afford to be more generous, not only with their staffs but with their customers in the rates they were charging.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance introduced it as part of his contribution to the reduction in the <Col N="139" /> cost of living.  It may be all he says. It may be a good thing but it also has very dangerous consequences.  It might mean that the State, for the first time, would have seriously to interfere in the control and management of money, and it might affect very seriously the whole life and employment of our people and the cost of living.  It is not a thing that one can toy with.  It is a subject that has been discussed and argued for many years.  Deputy MacBride is a student of this matter and has certain definite views.  I have other views.  There are others who have other views again. Friends who are in close association with each other and who discuss this matter day after day cannot find agreement because of the peculiar position that money holds in the scheme of things in the whole free world.  I should like to hear the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy O'Donovan, on this matter.  We have had statements made by the Minister. The Minister was lauded by the Deputy from County Louth.  Reference was made to this matter by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Government the other day.  Perhaps he would elucidate the matter further and tell us how this will in fact help us in our present situation.</P>
      <P>The central services payments, to which Deputy de Valera alluded to-day, include, as the Minister also rightly said, interest charges and sinking fund on borrowed money.  It may be thought that by keeping our bank rate down the Government and local authorities that have to borrow from the public may be able to get money cheaper than has been possible in recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>It is all very well to theorise about it.  The Parliamentary Secretary is now in a position where he is part of the machine that is responsible for providing certain services. The oil for that machinery has to be found, the oil in this case being the money.  If, by wrong management or wrong manipulation, money is not available, certain things cannot be <Col N="140" /> done.  Dublin Corporation has to borrow very heavily.  Our borrowing is going from £5,000,000 to £5,500,000 to £6,000,000, mainly for housing.  Over a period of years we have had to increase the amount of interest paid in order to attract money to corporation securities.  There is no use in saying that the reason why the corporation cannot get money as readily as the State can get it is that there is not the same confidence in the corporation as there is in the State.  Local authoritity bonds or securities are in fact guaranteed in full by the State.  The reason is that the area of sale is much less than the area of sale of a national security or sterling securities of, say, the British Government.</P>
      <P>Money is a commodity and, if you cannot, by an offer of a certain rate of interest get money in sufficient quantities to meet the needs then you must offer a more attractive rate to the people who hold the money.  Whether we like it or not, there will be these ups and downs all the time, depending upon the availability of ready money. There is no use in thinking that by legislation we can regulate the flow of money one way or the other.  It depends entirely on the earning capacity of the public, the method by which they can save the amount left after paying profits tax and income tax and the opportunities for investment.</P>
      <P>There is no use in thinking that under present circumstances we can regulate and regiment the supply and the flow of money just by saying we will keep down the rate of interest charged.  It is a very delicate thing with which to just play around.  It is a very grand thing to see that there may be money made available at a cheaper rate, but one has to see in the long run what the consequences are going to be.  I want to sum up what I started to say.  I do not accept this Book of Estimates for the year ending 31st March, 1956, as a true picture of the amount of money which will be required in that financial year. I have said, because of commitments made and promises given, of necessity Supplementary Estimates will have to be introduced, for how many million pounds I do not know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="141" /> I have said, and I believe that, within the year, some adjustment will have to be made with regard to tea.  This is something which cannot be carried on from year to year, for an unlimited number of years with expectancy that the price of tea will come back again to what it was in prewar years.  I have given the reason for that.  I also say that the cost of living will not come down as was expected &mdash; I will not say promised&mdash; that it will continue to rise, and Government expenditure will continue to rise.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is any use making a comparison between the amount of money which was required in 1927, 1928 or 1932.  We all know that one of the contributing factors in the increased expenditure is that the purchasing power of money has diminished to such an extent that £1 to-day is only really worth 8/-.  Therefore, we should approach this matter from a realistic point of view.  I would far rather hear the Minister for Finance saying: &ldquo;We attacked you.  We thought that you were budgeting for a surplus of £10,000,000.  We have found that that was not so.  We know you will understand the fact that we need so much more than you people now, and this is why we need the money, and we are giving the public benefits as a result of this expenditure.&rdquo; It is not going to do the country or anybody any good, even the inter-Party Government, trying to put in the minds of the people that they are, in fact, carrying out what they undertook to do when they faced them in the general election; because that is not being done.  It cannot be done. My only grievance, if you like, and the only fault I am finding, is that there is an attempt to proceed to blindfold the people, instead of taking the bandages off their eyes, and letting them see what the position really is, and instead of trying to educate the people into understanding why it is costly to govern the State, why it is costly to provide all the social services, and so on.  An attempt is being made to continue the farce of telling the people that you are, in fact, reducing the expenditure.  I say definitely it is not being done.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="142" /> In conclusion, I shall refer to the shifted burden from the Central Fund to the backs of local authorities.  I want to protest as much as I can against this device, which is only for the purpose of helping to reduce the national expenditure.  It is all in the same picture and scheme of things.  It does not mean anything, and I ask the Minister, when he is replying, to tell the House what he estimates will be the total amount of the Supplementary Estimates which will be introduced before the end of the next financial year has been reached.</P>

      <P>I think most of us enjoy Deputy Briscoe's speeches.  In his speech to-night, he appealed to us to be realistic.  I do not think that he himself in his approach, or in his examination of the Book of Estimates, has been very realistic.  I want to take him up on one point before I go any further, and that is, his complaint that there is no provision in the Book of Estimates for an increase in old age pensions.  As a matter of fact, he complains that there is a reduction of £10,000.</P>

      <P>I beg your pardon.  In any case, Deputy Briscoe complains that there is no provision for an increase, and Deputy Jack Lynch complained that there was a reduction of £10,000.  In the first place, I want to assure the House that the reduction of £10,000 in the Book of Estimates does not affect at all the amounts that will be paid to old age pensioners.  As far as that amount is concerned, it is merely explained by the fact that there is a reduction in the number of old age pensions for next year, as there has been a decrease in the number of old age pensioners in the country over the past four years.  But Deputy Briscoe wants the Minister for Finance to include <Col N="143" /> in the Book of Estimates this year an additional sum for old age pensioners.</P>

I think I said to him, by way of interjection, whilst he was talking, that the 1/6 per week increase given to old age pensioners when Fianna Fáil were in power in 1952, was not reflected in the Book of Estimates. Deputy Briscoe's general attitude on this particular Vote seems to be that it should be in the nature of a Budget discussion, and he would merely ask the Minister for Finance to make his Budget speech and his Budget proposals; but we did not see reflected in the Book of Estimates for the year 1952-53 the proposals that were subsequently introduced to slash the food subsidies.</P>

Deputy Briscoe seems to be anxious to see an increase in old age pensions.  I am rather doubtful as to whether the leader of his Party wants to see an increase.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely it does not come well from a member of the Fianna Fáil Party to talk about unemployment in the year 1955, when we remember that, in the spring of 1953, there were practically 90,000 unemployed.  I think it is fair for us to compare the unemployment figures at present with those of last year and of 1953 when the unemployment figures reached the colossal total of 90,000, a total they had not reached for decades and decades.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On that point, Deputy Aiken complained that there was substantially less provided in the Book of Estimates for unemployment assistance.  Of course, there is, because we believe, and we have evidence, that the trend in unemployment is downwards.  There will be substantially less required under that particular heading this year.  Deputy Aiken, on the other hand, says that there are an increased number drawing unemployment benefit. That is admitted, and the reason for it is that, due to the change in the Social Welfare Act, there are more and more persons becoming eligible for unemployment benefit.  That is the simple explanation.  There is no mystery about it, but what the amount provided for in respect of unemployment assistance is based on is the general trend of unemployment, which, as I say, is downward.  Deputy Briscoe might well know that, in respect of a <Col N="147" /> particular type of employment in Dublin City&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as the figures disclose the numbers employed on general building construction and repair, those unemployed under each heading have decreased substantially over the past two years.  At present, the unemployment figure for those normally engaged in general building construction and repairs is 7,481.  At the same time last year, it was 8,906, and, at the same time in 1953, 9,690. Everybody will agree also that so far as house building is concerned, there is once again a spur to local authorities to build more houses, and the reason there is less unemployment in the City of Dublin is that, in one instance, there are more people employed on house construction in the city. Credit for that can be taken by the new look that is on the Department of Agriculture and the new frame of mind, the new attitude of mind, on the part of the Minister, similar to that adopted by the Local Government Ministers in the inter-Party Government from 1948 to 1951.  I alleged while in Opposition that there was a slowing down of house building so far as the Custom House was concerned and I repeat that here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I saw evidence of it in constituencies all over the country and the figures we now have for employment in that industry in the City of Dublin bear out what we alleged when we were in Opposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Deputy complained that there was a decrease in sub-head A of Vote 9 for the Board of Works in relation to the provision of new buildings. There is a decrease, of course; there is a decrease of £410,000 because next year we do not intend to buy an embassy at over £100,000.  That is one of the reasons it is down, but it will have no effect on employment in this country.  Deputy J. Lynch alleged that the Vote indicated that there would be less money spent on the building of <Col N="148" /> schools.  That is not so.  There is a similar amount of money to that provided last year for the building of schools, and it is wrong to say that there is any change of heart on the part of the Minister for Education, or of the Government generally, in relation to school buildings.  Employment and emergency schemes remain the same, but, in view of the fact that the unemployment figures have shown a decrease, it will mean that that money can be expended in another direction.</P>
    <P>So far as Vote 27 &mdash; Department of Agriculture &mdash; is concerned, I think the increases shown in the Book of Estimates indicate the Government's desire to invest money in the land of this country, to invest money in the agricultural industry, and while members of the Opposition on the Front Bench talked about decreases in certain Votes, there was no reference by them to these important increases which, as I say, are an indication of the Government's determination to provide more capital for the building up of the agricultural industry.  There is an increase of £216,000 for farm buildings and water supplies.  I have not heard anybody from the Opposition make any comment about that.  This will be of tremendous help to the agricultural industry and will, in itself, give employment on the land.  The land project shows an increase of £208,000.  Let us not get into any argument now as to who started the land project.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>This Government believe that the investment of money in the land is the best way to encourage agricultural production.  Neither is there any use in getting into an argument as to whether or not it was desirable to sell the land project machinery.  Personally, I think it was a very bad idea. However, the damage has been done. The land project is now being geared up to a fairly rapid speed and this injection of £208,000 should make that scheme go at an even greater rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a provision of £262,000 for the eradication of bovine T.B. and a provision of £100,000 for the pasteurisation <Col N="149" /> of milk.  This is money which is being devoted in the right direction.</P>
    <P>I did not hear many people from the other side of the House speak about the increases provided under the Vote for the Department of Local Government. As a matter of fact, I think some Deputy complained that there was a decrease in the amount to be provided for housing.  If the Vote is examined it will be found that, as far as grants for private house building and reconstruction are concerned, there is an increase of £250,000.  I do not think anybody would say that there has been any change of heart so far as this Government are concerned in the matter of house building.  Over the past two or three years it was alleged that there was not the same demand for houses.  It was alleged by the former Taoiseach that, in certain of the smaller local authority areas, the demand for houses had been filled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that is the case.  I do not say that the former Taoiseach was deliberately telling an untruth, but I do not think he was fully aware of the situation that existed in the country.  He mentioned several of these smaller local authority areas where, he said, the housing demands had been met.  We find, however, that, over the past two years, there has been an actual demand in these local authority areas.  He based his allegations on a survey carried out in 1946.  As Deputies will remember, a housing survey was carried out in 1946. That survey revealed that a certain number of houses &mdash; I think the figure was 100,000 houses &mdash; were needed in the country.  In my opinion, that survey was carried out in a slipshod manner in many counties and did not present the true picture in regard to housing. As a matter of fact, after two or three years, it was absolutely outdated. Therefore, I feel it would be a very good idea to have another survey because, even in the period from 1946 to the present time, many houses have been demolished or have come into disuse and the general situation has changed to a very great extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="150" /> The indications are that house building in the country generally has got more encouragement than it had been getting in the past three years.  I cannot imagine why it was not encouraged to the utmost extent during those three years of Fianna Fáil Government. Many reforms were suggested by the then Minister for Local Government, but I do not think they were for the better.  Whether it was intended or not I do not know but, whatever happened, those suggested or proposed changes went a great deal of the way towards slowing down the whole machine.  In my view, the policy suggested by the late Deputy T.J. Murphy when he was Minister for Local Government from 1948 to 1950 should be pursued at the present time.  He favoured to the utmost extent possible a system of direct labour for house building by local authorities.  He did not want to insist that local authorities should engage in that type of house building but he believed, as I believe and as the present Minister for Local Government believes, that, working the two systems together &mdash; the policy of direct labour by the local authorities and private building where they so decided &mdash; we could fill our housing demands in a reasonable time.</P>
    <P>I am sure it must be very welcome news to Deputies, especially Deputies from rural constituencies, that an extra £500,000 is to be provided for county roads.  Not alone will that fill a long-felt want &mdash; that is, the improvement of many of these second and third class roads &mdash; but, as far as I am concerned, it will provide much-needed employment in rural areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know but it means that there is an increase of 30 per cent. on the amount that was provided last year.  A sum of £1,700,000 was provided for county roads last year and, this year, the sum is £2,200,000.  That will provide more employment. In addition, less of the big and heavy type of machinery will be used.  The result, therefore, in many of our rural areas will be that there will be much-needed employment <Col N="151" /> available and, in turn, that will help to modify in some way, as I think Deputy Briscoe mentioned, the flight from the land.  All of us must admit that, for a long number of years, there has been a tendency on the part of the rural worker, through force of circumstances, to go into the towns or, more unfortunate still, to emigrate.</P>
      <P>Either Deputy de Valera or Deputy Aiken complained that there are certain cuts in the Forestry Vote.  If my reading of that Vote is correct, it means that there is an increase of £289,500 for forestry development and maintenance.  Deputy Briscoe shakes his head.  Possibly he has the book before him.  If he will look at Vote No. 48 sub-head C (2), he will see that there is an increase of £289,500 for forestry development and maintenance. That, in itself, creates more employment. Deputy de Valera complains that less money was provided for the acquisition of land.</P>

      <P>I want to assure the House that at least the same programme of acquisition will be carried on for next year as in the present year. Deputy Briscoe may question that and ask how can it be done on a Vote reduced by £60,000.  The Minister for Lands interjected here to-day to say there is a carry-over which will provide the same amount if not more than was provided in the Estimate for this year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact is that there is a carry-over and has been a carry-over for the last two or three years&mdash; because the former Minister for Lands did not use the amount provided in the Estimates for those particular years. It may seem a fantastic story to Deputy Briscoe, but that is the fact. Because it was not spent in the last two years it will be possible now to carry it over and provide for the Minister for Lands the same amount, in <Col N="152" /> order that he may acquire at least the same as was acquired for the last two or three years.  In the same Vote there is provision also for an increase in timber conversion and that, in itself, provides more employment.</P>
      <P>There has also been some comment regarding health services.  I want to assure the House and those who are interested that what this Government want to see and what I want to see is not a health service scheme on paper but a health service scheme in operation. It is very easy to have on paper a grandiose scheme that is not capable of being put into operation within a certain time.  As far as I am concerned &mdash; and may I presume to talk on behalf of my Party &mdash; as far as my Party is concerned, it is determined to see that the best services that can be made available will be made available. The Minister for Finance announced here to-day that there will be spent next year on health services £760,000&mdash; over three quarters of a million pounds &mdash;more than will be spent in the present year.  He also indicated that certain other important portions of the Health Act will be brought into operation in the present calendar year.  Let nobody believe or be influenced by any speeches or any Press reports when it is alleged that there is a cut of over £1,000,000 in the Health Vote.  The Health Vote for this year provides that there will be increased and better services for the people.  That is in accordance with the pledge given by the Minister for Health speaking a few months ago.  He said then that as soon as ever he could he would put into full operation the other parts of the Health Act of 1953.</P>

      <P>I am sorry.  He was worried about the Army and tried to give the impression that there was not a uniform up in the barracks for any new soldier.  I want to assure Deputy Aiken and the House that there is sufficient of that type of clothing and stores for one and a half or two years so let no one get the impression that this Government is trying to cut down on any of these things for the personnel of the National Army.</P>
      <P>I got the impression in the last few weeks from some members of the Opposition that had they been in power they would have made little effort to do anything about the cost of living or about prices.  I recognise a sense of disappointment at the determination of this Government to do everything in its power to control prices.  There was an obvious disappointment in the ranks of the Fianna Fáil Party when butter was reduced by 5d. a lb.  Deputy Briscoe said his preference would be for bread.  I suppose that is a matter of opinion.  There might be people in his own Party who would differ from him on that.  When I canvassed in the last general election in various constituencies, the strongest complaint I heard from housewives generally was on the price of butter.  Because it was felt that the cost of butter to the ordinary family fell very heavily on them, the Government decided as a first step to decrease that particular commodity by 5d. a lb.  That was done during the year and there is provision for that particular subsidy in the Book of Estimates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not as good a speculator as Deputy Briscoe in prices and certainly not in the price of tea but I would back certain prominent gentlemen in the tea trade as against him in regard to fluctuation in tea prices.  I do not think it would have been fair to the Irish people to slap on the increase that was recommended by the Prices Advisory Body in October last.  The decision of the Government not to <Col N="154" /> increase the price of tea at that particular time and not to increase the price when it was recommended again in January was, in view of all that has happened since, the right decision to take.  I do not think anyone on the Government side has said they expected tea to go down to the price it stood at last June, July or August.  I do not say that is going to happen but I think that the price which obtained in Britain a month or two ago was largely an artificial price and because we are concerned about the cost of living it would not have been right or just for us to impose the increase that was recommended to us by the Prices Advisory Body.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that if the Fianna Fáil Government were in office their attitude would have been to throw up their hands in respect of nearly every single commodity and say: &ldquo;We can do nothing about it&rdquo;.  That seems to be the general attitude.  They are disappointed that prices have not gone up in this or that direction in respect of various commodities.  We are determined to make every effort and to take all necessary steps to see that the cost of living is controlled so as to bring it to a level at which the Irish people can bear it.  I move to report progress.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter concerned in this question is one which originally arose out of an estimates meeting in the Donegal County Council a month or five weeks ago.  I happen to be a member of that estimates committee and during our discussion as to estimates for the coming year in respect of the different services we found that, according to our officers who are in charge of certain things, one in particular had gone up, according to the prices then quoted, by 8d. per lb. and that was tea supplied to institutions <Col N="155" /> to be purchased under the combined purchasing lists.  We accepted the statement then given as being quoted from the combined purchasing lists for the coming year showing this 8d. per lb. increase and budgeted accordingly.</P>
      <P>Subsequently, when this report came before our council dealing with the estimates generally and striking the rate, it was contested by some of the Government supporters that tea had not, in fact, gone up 8d. per lb.; that the actual increase on the ordinary average run of tea was somewhere in the region of 1½d. or 2d. per lb.  However, to try and find out definitely where we stood before making a final allocation for the purchase of tea for the coming year for our institutions in the county, I undertook, on behalf of the county council, to put down a question to the Minister for Industry and Commerce to give us the prices of tea on the 1st February, 1955 and on the 1st February, 1954. We could see from the tabular statement that the price for lowest grade tea in 1954 was 3/4 and ranging from 3/8 to 5/10 as against 3/4 up to 8/6 in 1955.</P>
      <P>The first thing that occurred to us in the county council, when we came to look at these figures at a subsequent meeting, was that the figure for lowest grade tea in 1954 corresponded exactly with the price listed in the combined purchasing list of 3/8, the price we paid and have been paying and which, I presume, we will still pay under contract over the year.  This year we find, according to the lists supplied to us in advance of that meeting, that the price we are being asked to pay has gone up from 3/8 to 4/4.</P>
      <P>The House will recall that I mentioned the price for lowest grade tea last year was similar to the list price in the combined purchasing list.  This year the combined purchasing list says 3/4 for lowest grade tea, whereas the actual price is to be 1/- higher.  As a result of this, we decided at our meeting to reduce the amount of money allocated for tea for the coming year by the sum of 1/- per lb.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following that, I submitted a question to the Minister for Industry and <Col N="156" /> Commerce again and, as it transpired later, I actually put the question to the Minister in error in that he was not responsible for the compilation of this list.  However, during the weekend when I handed in this question until the following Wednesday, when it was being answered, there appeared in the national newspapers an advertisement seeking, under the Combined Purchasing Act, contractors for the supply of tea to local authorities for the coming year, 1955-56.  Whether that was purely coincidental or not I cannot say, but it struck me, on seeing it, that it was other than a coincidence.</P>
    <P>The Minister then asked about this matter was the Minister for Local Government who is at the moment in the House.  On putting down a question to the Minister asking for an explanation of this difference in the prices on the combined purchasing list of this year as against last year, the Minister's reply confused me very much, indeed, in that he stated that no alteration was made in the price of tea for the forthcoming year.</P>
    <P>If no alteration was made in the price for the coming year, what I want to know from the Minister is where does this 4/4 arise as against 3/8 quoted in the lists last year?  How does it come about that while we could buy our tea which was quoted in the combined purchasing list last year at 3/8 per lb. we are now being quoted 4/4?  Is that 4/4, in fact, a contract price, and should it have appeared as a contract listed price in the combined purchasing list for the coming financial year?  If not, why should it have been submitted to the officers of our local authority who deal with this matter?  That is another matter which the Minister for Local Government could possibly answer in his reply.</P>
    <P>The net issue of the matter now is that if tea has gone up, as undoubtedly, I think, it will be agreed it has, then our estimate and the provision of money for the year is short in our county by over 1/- per lb.  That arises, as I say, from the fact that last year the price paid for tea by our local authority corresponded with the lowest <Col N="157" /> priced tea on the market.  That does not follow.  I understand that the tea we got was the lowest grade.  I take it that the grade supplied last year was similar to the grade we are to get this year, but this year's grade of tea is to cost us 4/4 but, due to this list we got from the other Minister who does not control the combined purchasing section, our council now find themselves with less than sufficient tea to keep our institutions going.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned at the start, the whole thing really arose over the fact that it was disputed at our meetings by certain members that an increase of as high as 8d. per lb. had actually taken place in the price of tea in the past 12 months.  In order to satisfy those people that it had not increased, we set about reducing the amount that we are going to pay for the year. Between the Department's combined purchasing list and the members of our local authority who are supporters of the present Government, we find ourselves in the dilemma that we do not know what price we are to pay for tea for the coming year.  The likelihood is that the amount of money we have now provided on their exhortations will be insufficient.</P>
    <P>I will ask the Minister to tell the House whether or not a list was supplied to the officers of the local authority this year giving the price of tea for the coming financial year under contract.  On the other hand, if that is not so, why was the price of tea not fixed as it was fixed in respect of the year 1954-1955?  It was fixed, as the Minister himself stated, as early as December, 1953.  If it was thought fit to fix it so early for last year, why should it be so late in being fixed this year?  If we are to buy this tea for the coming year at whatever the price may be, I am still at a loss to know what it is going to be.  Are we going to get the same grade of tea, the same blend, as last year, and will the Minister in the last analysis tell the House whether or not there is an increase in the price this year and if so approximately the amount of that increase?</P>

      <P>I did not suggest you grew up since.  The position is this&mdash; and the Deputy knows it very well &mdash; in the month of December the Minister fixes the price for tea for the following year commencing on the 1st April.  The Minister judges the blend of tea which he considers is the most appropriate for local authorities.  Having judged it, he fixes a price for a particular blend.  In December of 1953 my predecessor, the present Deputy Smith fixed the price of tea for the year beginning on the 1st April, 1954, and ending on the 31st March, 1955.  He fixed that price at 4/4 per lb. and that is the price.  Having fixed it in December of 1953, he then sought tenders and asked the various brokers to submit to him samples of the tea which they could produce at 4/4 per lb.  Having received those samples the Minister submitted them to a tea-tester in London, a tester employed by the Government of this country for the past 22 years &mdash; the same tea-tester.  This tea-tester selected the blends in order of merit and returned them to the Minister who then appointed a contractor to the local authority.  The tea price for the year beginning the 1st April, 1954, and ending on the 31st of this month was fixed by Deputy Smith at 4/4 per lb.</P>
      <P>In the month of December last, I fixed the price of tea at the very same figure &mdash; 4/4 per lb.  I have sought tenders for the best possible blend that I can procure at 4/4 per lb.  I have not yet received from the tester the order of merit of the various blends submitted to him.  I understand it is not usual to receive them until this month and that the local authority is notified immediately they are received.  The Deputy knows very well that the price of tea from the 1st April, 1954, to the 31st March, 1955, is 4/4 per lb. and it will be the same for the coming year.</P>

Having decided on that he makes up his mind on the particular blend which he requires and fixes the price of that blend.  When he has done that and fixed it at 4/4 per lb. he invites the tenderers to send in samples of blends to him at 4/4 per lb. which is the standard price he has fixed.  He sends the samples off to the tester and the tester then sets them out in order of priority and the Minister accepts this as he has done for the past 22 years.

      <P>They have not sufficient quantity but when they find a line of cheap grade tea they automatically push up the price of that and pull down the price of some grade of which they have a surplus.</P>

      <P>A better grade.</P>

      <P>Yes, for the purpose of blending.  May I tell you what the tester has said about the present blend of tea which is being supplied to local authorities.  It will be of interest to note that in a recent report on the tea situation the Department's London tea tester states that:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="162" />&ldquo;The blend you are now using is not common tea.  Its true economic value as fair medium quality on today's London market is 6/10.  This price is first cost excluding all charges and profits&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>He also suggested that there should be a price of 7/- a lb.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the date?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>4th January of this year.  That tea which is costing the local authorities here 4/4 per lb. is being sold on the London market at 6/10, and this price is first cost excluding all charges and profits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>How much would it have been last year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The same, because even though there has been a difference in the price of the grades the price of the blend has remained the same.  I think that if the Deputy checks what I have said, he will find his informant, not intentionally &mdash; I know the gentleman to whom he refers and I know very well he would not do it intentionally &mdash; has made a mistake, a genuine <i>bona fide</i> mistake.  I accept that and I accept the Deputy was not misled and did not raise this question for the purpose of creating a furore in the matter.  I hope he will accept my explanation.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.53 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Wednesday, 9th March, 1955.</P>
