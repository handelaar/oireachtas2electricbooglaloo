      <P>An increase from 3½ per cent. to 4 per cent. as from the 1st September, 1955, in the rate of interest on the overdraft of Tea Importers, Limited, and other State guaranteed overdrafts was accepted as being technically appropriate in current conditions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy refers to the trading losses incurred by Tea Importers, Limited, because of the decision of the Government not to permit increases in prices with effect from the 1st October, 1954.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether any information in regard to the recent increase in the price of tea was communicated to any person or persons in advance of his public announcement in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the reply, has the Minister any information to indicate that unusual purchases were made by certain firms or individuals prior to the end of September last; if so, whether he regards these purchases as normal, if not, whether he would regard them as speculative buying and whether he would make some statement for the benefit of the public who have been led to believe that certain people are making quite a packet on the increase in tea prices, because it looks as if they were helped by either anticipation or slight information?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no information on the matter.  As soon as the Government decision was taken it was announced officially through Radio Éireann, the newspapers and through Tea Importers, Limited.  There may have been purchases by individual traders from Tea Importers, Limited, or by retailers from wholesalers.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will <Col N="508" /> state, in respect of the period since 2nd June, 1954, particulars of all licences granted by him under the Control of Manufactures Acts, indicating in each case (a) the name of the firm receiving the licence, (b) the classes of goods that the firm is permitted to manufacture, and (c) the main conditions, if any, attached to the licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he has entered into any commitments to grant licences under the Control of Manufactures Acts to firms which have not yet started manufacturing operations; and, if so, if he will state, in respect of each case (1) the name of the firm concerned, (2) the classes of goods to be manufactured, (3) the main conditions to be attached to the licence, and (4) whether any, and if so what, other facilities or privileges are to be given to the firm concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 8 together.</P>
      <P>The provisions in accordance with which I may exercise the power of granting or refusing a new manufacture licence are prescribed in paragraph 6 of the Control of Manufactures Regulations, 1932; and all applications for such licences are examined by me in accordance with those provisions.  For obvious reasons persons who wish to undertake operations under the authority of a new manufacture licence await my decision on their application before entering into commitments for the acquisition or erection of factory premises and the purchase of machinery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 12 of the Control of Manufactures Act, 1934, provides for the keeping of a Register of New Manufacture Licences which is available for inspection on payment of the appropriate fee.  This register gives information as requested by the Deputy at (a) and (b) of Question No. 7.  A statement is being circulated giving this information in respect of licences granted since the 2nd June, 1954.  As regards (c) of the question the provisions in accordance with which I may <Col N="509" /> attach conditions to a new manufacture licence are prescribed in the Control of Manufactures Regulations, 1932 and 1953.  No conditions other than the conditions prescribed in these regulations were attached to licences granted in the period mentioned.</P>
    <P>As regards Question No. 8 there are seven cases in respect of which licences have not yet issued.  When licences have issued the particulars requested at (1) and (2) of the question will be entered in the Register of New Manufacture Licences and they will be available for inspection on payment of the appropriate fee.  It would not be <Col N="510" /> proper for me to give these particulars now as they relate to the intentions of private firms.  No conditions other than the conditions prescribed in the Control of Manufactures Regulations will be attached to these licences.</P>
    <P>As regards (4) of Question No. 8 I have undertaken, where appropriate, to recommend duty-free licences, subject to the requirements of Article 7 of the Anglo-Irish Trade Agreement of 1938, for plant, equipment and raw materials and to issue aliens' permits for key personnel needed for the establishment of the industry.</P>

      <P>While no formal terms of reference have been laid down, it will be the function of the Prices Advisory Body, in investigating the application by the manufacturers for an increase in the price of superphosphates, to consider whether, or to what extent, the application should be granted, having regard to recent increases in production costs.

Accordingly, the various interested bodies and organisations had a period of 18 days to prepare their evidence for presentation at the public sitting. This position was not affected by the request made to certain organisations on 26th October, 1955, to furnish by 4th November, 1955, a summary of <Col N="513" /> the evidence they proposed to give at the inquiry.</P>
      <P>If any interested persons or organisations feel that they have not had sufficient time to prepare for the inquiry, I have no doubt that the Prices Advisory Body will be prepared to consider any submissions made to them after the inquiry and, if necessary, to reopen the inquiry at a later date.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce what was the nature of experts' reports on Ballygarvan and Ahanesk as possible sites for the proposed Cork airport, and why Ballygarvan was selected in preference to Ahanesk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Ballygarvan was selected because it was reported to be superior to any other possible site in the Cork area in respect of proximity to Cork City, suitability of ground for <Col N="518" /> the necessary runways, clearness of approach and feasibility of installing lighting and radio aids.  It was reported that on the Ahanesk site the grades on the runways would be severe as the ground is undulating, and that the approaches from the north and north-east, which pass over a range of hills attaining a height of 600 feet, would frequently be hazardous in the weather conditions prevalent in the area.  Meteorological conditions at Ballygarvan were found to be less favourable than at Ahanesk, but any disparity between the two sites which arises from meteorological conditions can be nullified to a great extent by the use of up-to-date navigation and radio aids.</P>

I am sure the Deputy will understand that neither I nor any other Minister can act on the advice of technicians in transit who take a hurried glance at a prospective airfield and then give an interview to a newspaper and say they are satisfied, after this cursory inspection, that it is the most suitable site.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state (a) the present position in regard to supplies by the British National Coal Board of coal, anthracite and phurnacite to this country, (b) the terms of any trading arrangement between this country and Great Britain to ensure adequate supplies of these fuels, and (c) whether he is aware that certain long established traders have failed to secure an allocation of anthracite in addition to coal from the British National Coal Board, and, if so, what action he proposes to take in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>As a result of special representations which I made to the National Coal Board some months ago I succeeded in obtaining substantial increases in the allocations of general purposes coal and anthracite for the current year ending 31st March, 1956. The allocation of general purposes coal this year is 830,000 tons as compared with 730,000 tons for last year.  The allocation of anthracite is 35,000 tons as compared with 20,000 tons for last year.  I also arranged that a greater proportion of the supplies would be imported before the onset of the winter season and I have pressed the <Col N="521" /> coal merchants to ensure that a part of the supplies which would normally not be imported until the first quarter of 1956 will in fact be imported before the end of the calendar year.</P>
      <P>Present indications are that supplies of general purposes coal will be adequate to meet requirements.  Notwithstanding the increased allocation of imported anthracite and a substantial increase in home production, it will be necessary to supplement supplies by additional imports of phurnacite which, I am informed, is a satisfactory substitute for anthracite.  The National Coal Board has undertaken to make the best possible effort to make the necessary additional supplies of phurnacite available and there has already been an appreciable increase in imports of this fuel.</P>
      <P>Under the Anglo-Irish Trade Agreements of 1938 and 1948 the British Government has undertaken to provide annually a specified minimum supply of coal and to make every effort to meet any demand in excess of that minimum.</P>
      <P>As regards the last part of the Deputy's question, my concern has been to secure that the total supply of anthracite allotted to this country is increased but the question of allocations for any particular trader is a matter for arrangement by the trader concerned through the usual trade channels.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The only thing the Deputy is to take is that the British will supply us with 100,000 tons additional of general purposes coal; 60,000 tons of that are American.  We are getting 30,000 tons at the British price, though the British are paying more for it, and the other 30,000 tons are coming in at the price at which the British are able to buy that coal from America.  If we were to adopt the suggestion made by the Deputy the whole 60,000 tons would be bought in America at a higher price and consumers in Cork would, therefore, have to pay more for their coal.  I am not going to allow that.</P>

      <P>Certificates of qualification are granted by justices of the District Court, who may refuse an application on any of the grounds specified in Section 13 of the Act.  A residence qualification is not one of the grounds specified in Section 13.</P>
      <P>I cannot say whether any of the persons who applied during 1955 was ineligible on any of the grounds specified in Section 13 for the grant of a certificate of qualification or did not fulfil the requirements of Section 8 for the grant of a licence, nor could this information be procured without a great deal of time and labour, if at all.</P>

I was, however, informed by the board that they had unanimously resolved to sell Tulyar, and I informed the board that this was a matter for their own discretion within the powers vested in them by the National Stud Acts.  I am also informed by the board that:&mdash;(a) the sale price of Tulyar is the U.S. dollar equivalent of £240,000; the property in the horse passes to the purchaser on the lodgment of this sum to the credit of the stud company, the horse to continue to stand for service at Tully up to the 30th June, 1956; (b) the purchase price of Vimy is £105,000; the purchase is conditional on the horse's passing a veterinary examination and fertility test, and, provided it does so, the stud company is to complete the purchase and arrange within a reasonable time for the transit of the horse to Ireland.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture whether he is aware that in the opening weeks of the herring fishing at Rosbeg, County Donegal, inshore fishermen had to dump 40 crans of prime herring into the sea; and that neither An Bord Iascaigh Mhara nor the nearby fishmeal factory at Killybegs could relieve the fishermen of their comparatively small catches; and if, in order to ensure that as the winter herring fishing progresses such an incident will not occur again, he will now make arrangements to give prior consideration to the catches of the inshore fishermen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that a quantity of herrings was dumped recently at Rosbeg but my information is that the herrings were mostly spent fish and generally of poor quality.  I understand that Bord Iascaigh Mhara had a considerable quantity of similar herrings on hands which had been purchased from inshore fishermen for fishmeal manufacture when this landing at Rosbeg was made and could not handle any more at the time.  In view of the quality of the herrings the board was not prepared to purchase the landing for disposal on the fresh market or for processing.</P>
      <P>As regards the last part of the question, the position is that all the herring purchased by the board in Donegal recently were landed by inshore fishermen.  It would be impossible for the board to purchase all herrings landed by inshore fishermen even in a restricted area such as County Donegal regardless of quality and quantity.  The Deputy can rest assured, however, that the board will continue to purchase to its full capacity any landings of satisfactory quality made by inshore fishermen.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="Mr. Breslin Mr. Breslin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Breslin</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that the glut of herring <Col N="538" /> on this particular occasion was caused by the landing of a large quantity of fish from the ring net fish trawlers?  As this is likely to continue throughout the season in County Donegal, could the Parliamentary Secretary not do something to ensure that the landings by the inshore fishermen will be dealt with and not thrown back into the sea?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that, of a landing of about 20 cran of herring made at Downings recently, five cran failed to sell on the fresh market and were salted in barrels by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara on behalf of the fishermen for disposal later as opportunity offers.</P>

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The object of the Bill is to provide for the registration of opticians and to restrict practice as opticians to registered persons.</P>
      <P>At present a person worried about his eyes can consult either an ophthalmic surgeon or oculist (that is, a registered medical practitioner specialising in the eyes) or an optician.  The opthalmic surgeon (I will use this longer name to avoid confusion between &ldquo;oculist&rdquo; and &ldquo;optician&rdquo;) is, of course, fully competent to diagnose all optical defects and diseases of the eye, to treat them and to prescribe spectacles.  Normally, an ophthalmic surgeon does not supply spectacles but leaves the dispensing of his prescription to an optician.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Reputable opticians practising in this country possess the diploma of the Association of Ophthalmic Opticians of Ireland or some similar qualification. There is, however, no statutory requirement that opticians of any kind should be qualified and it is open to <Col N="553" /> any person to put up a plate and to begin to practise as an optician.  An optician, I would like to stress, is trained only to prescribe and supply spectacles: he has no professional competence in the treatment of diseases of the eyes.  A reputable optician will refer any case of eye disease coming to his notice to a doctor.</P>
    <P>It is well known that at present there are many unqualified persons engaged in the lucrative trade of supplying spectacles throughout the country. These persons are not at present legally debarred from describing themselves as opticians and they can&mdash;and in many cases do&mdash;prescribe and supply glasses although they have no technical training which would enable them to decide whether or not a person requires spectacles.</P>
    <P>There are on record cases where glasses supplied by itinerant spectacle-sellers were not only unsuited to the vision of the persons for whom they were supplied, but were positively harmful to their eyesight.  I have information also of cases of the supply of spectacles with plain glass, ostensibly to remedy defective vision, at prices out of all proportion to the costs of the articles supplied.</P>
    <P>In addition to the public health aspect of the matter, there is a further one&mdash;namely, that in many cases itinerant spectacle vendors do not subsequently provide the goods for which they have been paid.  Under the legislation it will be an offence to prescribe or to sell spectacles unless a person is registered on a register of opticians, and the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána has stated that this provision will considerably facilitate the Gardaí in dealing with cases such as these, examples of which have in recent years been referred to them.  It might be held that persons sufficiently gullible to purchase spectacles from vendors of this nature do not deserve to be protected by legislation.  While there is some merit in that argument, I prefer, however, to approach the matter on the lines that there is here a fairly big public health problem and that action of the kind I propose in the Bill now before the House is necessary to remedy it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="554" /> It is proposed to set about the eradication of the abuses with which I have dealt by establishing a board to be known as Bord na Radharcmhastóiri which will be responsible for the registration of opticians and the control of their practice.  The board will consist of four medical practitioners, six opticians and a person nominated by the Minister.  In the case of the first board the medical practitioners and the opticians will be nominated by the Minister after consultation with the appropriate professional bodies.  When the board is set up it will make provision for the establishment of a register, and only those persons possessing qualifications approved by the board will be admitted to it.  I should like to make it perfectly clear at this stage that no provision of the Bill will affect medical practitioners, who will continue, of course, to examine and prescribe for all optical diseases and defects.</P>
    <P>We are providing in the Bill that Irish citizens at present carrying on in business here as ophthalmic opticians or dispensing opticians will be able to get on the appropriate register without examination, if their main business is from their practice as an optician, and they have had seven years' experience. Irish citizens who have been practising as opticians as a side line will also be entitled to become registered, but only if they have had certain experience&mdash; which will be specified in rules&mdash;and if they succeed in passing a limited examination, which will be held on a number of occasions during a period of two years after the registers are set up.</P>
    <P>The board will be given power to regulate the prescribing, dispensing and sale of spectacles and to establish satisfactory standards of practice in regard to these matters.  Persons who do not comply with these standards will be liable to be removed from the register and, as the prescription, dispensing and retail sale of spectacles will be confined to those opticians on the register, those who do not conform to the ethical standards laid down by the board will be prevented from making their livelihood from the sale of spectacles. We will in this manner ensure <Col N="555" /> that only competent persons practising in an ethical manner will in future be allowed to prescribe and dispense spectacles; and, apart from the improvement which this will lead to in the type of glasses supplied, it will also eliminate entirely the fraudulent vendor of spectacles.</P>
    <P>The scheme of this Bill has been the subject of detailed and prolonged negotiations between myself and my predecessor on the one hand, and the Association of Ophthalmic Opticians of Ireland on the other.  That association is representative of reputable opticians and I would like to take this opportunity to thank them for their assistance in the preparation of this legislation and, in particular, for the spirit of compromise in which they accepted some provisions not entirely to their liking.</P>
    <P>The scheme of the Bill was also discussed with the Irish Medical Association, as representative of the ophthalmic surgeons.  While this association does not see eye to eye with me on the proposals in this Bill and made a number of suggestions in its preparation which I could not accept, I appreciate that its members have a different view in looking at the proposals and I am glad that they gave me the opportunity to appreciate it, at the cost to themselves of considerable effort and time in preparing memoranda and attending discussions. The major objection of the Irish Medical Association is to the recognition of ophthalmic opticians as persons qualified to prescribe glasses by their inclusion in the classes to which such prescribing will be restricted under the Bill.  The association considers that this means that the Government is encouraging persons who wish to have their eyes examined, to consult an optician instead of a medical practitioner. I can definitely say that this was not the intention of the Government and that we do not feel that the legislation will have the effect of inducing more people to consult opticians than do so at presesnt.  We must accept that a considerable number of people do go to opticians to have their eyes examined and to suggest that the <Col N="556" /> contrary is the case is merely refusing to face the facts.  Once this is recognised, it will, I think, be generally agreed that it is better to ensure that those opticians who are consulted and who purport to be able to supply suitable glasses should in fact be qualified to do so.</P>
    <P>In recognising opticians to this extent we are not setting them up as persons qualified to do anything except what they are doing at present and they are specifically prohibited, by Section 45, from doing anything for the eyes but to prescribe glasses.  The Bill goes no further than to recognise the <i>de facto</i> position and, in so doing, to make it possible to deal with some unsatisfactory aspects of that position.</P>
    <P>Before concluding, I would like to inform the House that we will not be unique in this country in registering opticians.  In several places abroad such registration has been in operation for many years.  In Britain, opticians are not yet registered, but a committee, representative of the medical profession, opticians and other interested parties, reported in 1952 in favour of registration on the lines which we had then been considering here, and which are now embodied in this Bill.</P>
    <P>For the reasons which I mentioned earlier, the Government consider this Bill necessary as a protection for the public against a grave and common abuse, and I recommend it to the House for a Second Reading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the principle of this measure.  As the Minister intimated in his speech, it is true that some negotiations were carried on by me with the interests concerned when I was Minister for Health.  At that time I told the various parties that I would favourably consider the introduction of a Bill as soon as I had got an agreed scheme from those concerned. But that agreed scheme had not come along when I was leaving office; and I take it that the Minister is now going ahead with the Bill, if not on an agreed scheme at least on a scheme largely agreed between the interested parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="557" /> There is one point one must always realise in legislating for professional bodies; that is, that as we go along we may become inclined to go just a little further in each case.  The first profession dealt with by this State was the medical profession.  Then we had the veterinary surgeons, followed by the dentists.  Not so long ago we had the pharmaceutical chemists.  In the case of the medical men, the veterinary surgeons and, I think, the dentists, we only went so far as to render it impossible for an individual to hold himself out as qualified.  We did not, for instance, make it illegal for a man to give medical advice.  We did not make it illegal for the cow doctor to continue operations and advise the farmer in relation to his stock.  What we did do was to make it illegal for any man who was not a medical practitioner or a veterinary surgeon to say that he was a medical practitioner or a veterinary surgeon.  One of the penalties imposed was that these unqualified people could not sue for a fee, but they could take a fee if it were offered to them.  We know, as a matter of fact, that bonesetters are operating here and cow doctors are still carrying on.</P>
    <P>Now, we are going further in this case and this is a point that I think we should consider very seriously. When the Medical Bill was going through we felt we could not make it absolutely illegal for a person to give medical advice because such a provision could not be enforced.  As we all know, every day of the week people are getting advice on their health from unqualified persons.  But it goes even further than that.  You have men, such as bonesetters, who really make a living out of the business of giving advice. You have men who cure rheumatism and other affections.  To be strictly truthful, I should say they hold themselves out as being able to cure rheumatism and so forth.  I think we were wise in that particular instance not to go too far because, had we made it illegal for the bonesetter to operate, we would probably have had people with grievances, people who believe that, the doctor having failed, the bonesetter, if he were allowed to intervene, <Col N="558" /> would succeed where the doctor had proved unsuccessful.</P>
    <P>I admit the case here will not be exactly parallel because it is hardly likely that anybody would say that where the ophthalmic surgeon, the ophthalmic optician or the dispensing optician fails another person might have succeeded in giving him suitable glasses.  I think, however, that there will be the contention that the other, person would give him cheaper glasses than any of the registered classes and that is why I am very much inclined to think that we should not go further than we did in previous legislation; we should only go so far as to say that, having established these registers of ophthalmic opticians and dispensing opticians, we should then make it illegal for any person to hold himself out as an ophthalmic optician or a dispensing optician.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that there is a danger of people accepting glasses from unqualified persons.  I do not know what the percentage might be.  A large proportion of people have normal sight until they grow old and, therefore, the ordinary glasses prescribed for presbyopia will suit one individual as well as another.  But if the patient happened to be like me, with a half diopter error, the situation would be entirely different.  If I were to get ordinary glasses for my presbyopia I would become subject to very bad headaches and I probably would not know why I was suffering from them; and there are some people who would go through life with a squint like mine who would suffer that disability.  That is a serious thing and we should take note of it.  We should try to prevent people suffering like that at the hands of unqualified individuals.</P>
    <P>Practically 30 years ago when the Medical Bill was going through we allowed the quack to carry on even though he might make very, very serious mistakes.  Recently the Minister announced that he intends to implement the Health Act of 1953.  When that Act is implemented every insured person, every person with an income of less than £600 per annum, and every farmer under £20 valuation, and their families, will be entitled to free <Col N="559" /> medical advice in relation to eyesight and will, therefore, have no need of consulting an unqualified person.  They can go to the ophthalmic surgeon and get the appropriate prescription for glasses.  They can get the glasses.  It would be a very foolish person, indeed, who would take the risk in those circumstances of going to an unqualified person and paying for advice when he can have treatment and advice free from qualified experts.</P>
    <P>For all these reasons, and in the interests of liberty, I would urge the Minister to consider seriously leaving that small residue of freedom to the individual to consult an unqualified person in relation to his eyesight if he so wishes.  That is probably the biggest point on which I join issue with the Minister on this measure.  There are a few other points.</P>
    <P>In bringing in a Bill of this kind any Minister has, of course, the interests of the people concerned at heart and the professional classes&mdash;ophthalmic surgeons, ophthalmic opticians or dispensing opticians&mdash;who will be affected in their livelihood by a measure of this kind must receive secondary consideration. We cannot afford in any way to interfere with people's rights, or make it more difficult for people to get good service or interfere with the good service people are getting, for the benefit of classes of that kind.  On the other hand, we must also remember that we are legislating especially for a class of people like opticians who have been making a living of that kind up to this.  We must be careful for an interim period, as it is provided in this Bill, that a man who was making his living and doing good work should be permitted to carry on.  We are all agreed on that.</P>
    <P>The only thing we must consider, therefore, is whether the Bill is fair. In the first place, I think that if a person is depending entirely or almost entirely on work as an optician for seven years he should be brought in.  I agree that that is fair and that seven years is long enough.  It would be very hard for a man to change his way of life after engaging for seven years in making a living of that kind.  But as <Col N="560" /> regards the second provision, where it says that a person who has been engaged in the occupation for five years should then pass a special examination, I do not think it would injure or interfere with the scheme of this Bill to reduce that period of five years to, say, three years.  This is only a small point&mdash;I mean a small point to discuss; it may be an important point as far as individuals are concerned although I do not know of any individuals affected&mdash;and it can be considered on the Committee Stage.  After all, there is a special examination and if a person claims that he was three years there and intended to devote the rest of his life to this particular way of living and that he is quite prepared to undergo this special examination, I do not think we would be doing any injury to anyone by saying that the period should be three years instead of five. As I say, however, it is a matter for consideration.</P>
    <P>There is a provision in both Sections 27 and 35 which enables the board to remove certain people from the register.  There again, I feel sure everybody will agree that it is a very serious matter to remove a man from a register like that because it really means telling him he can no longer practise as an ophthalmic optician or a dispensing optician; he must go and seek some other work and it is very difficult for a man to go looking for other work in a case like that.  It is a thing we should be very careful about, that a person is not deprived of his living unless there is very serious cause.</P>
    <P>What is stated in the Bill here is that the board will make rules.  We should be very jealous in this House of penalties of any kind, and I think the Minister should have tried to put these rules into each clause so that the Dáil would know what they were doing and know exactly what would expose a person to the penalty of being removed from the register.  The board may and probably will be a little overenthusiastic about the prestige, and so on, of this new profession.  They may be inclined to be a little over-zealous and to be too strict and they may remove a man from the register in their new enthusiasm who would not <Col N="561" /> be removed at all for the same cause in ten, 12 or 15 years' time.  I would suggest to the Minister that that is a power he should not give to the board without some kind of supervision.  In fact the amendment I would be inclined to put into this Bill would be that the rules referred to in Sections 27 (3) and 35 (3) should have the approval of the Dáil, because it is a very serious matter indeed to give any board of that kind the right to deprive a man of his livelihood.</P>
    <P>One other point I would like to mention is that if a man is removed he has the right of appeal and, as worded in the Bill, he can appeal either to the Minister or to a judge of the High Court.  I do not like that provision at all.  I would have no strong objection if the Minister put in either a judge of the High Court or the Minister but I think putting both into the Bill and giving the person a choice is a very bad thing indeed.  Having been the Minister for Health myself, I say that probably if I had been in the Minister's place I would have put in the Minister, but that in any Bill I ever brought before this House where there was such a provision there was invariably an amendment from some member of the House to change from the Minister to a judge of the High Court. As I say, I do not mind whether the Minister puts in the High Court judge or the Minister but I would ask him to look into that matter and strike out one or the other.</P>
    <P>Those are only a few points that struck me going through this Bill in connection with which I would be inclined to propose amendments on Committee Stage.  It would be better, of course, in a Bill of this kind, where there is no serious conflict between Parties, if the Minister would consider the matter and put in an amendment himself and failing that I would probably put in an amendment and try to persuade the House to agree with me that these amendments are necessary. Subject to those few remarks and possibly subject to more close reading of the Bill before the Committee Stage comes along&mdash;there may be other amendments as a result of that more close reading&mdash;I would recommend that the Bill should have a Second Reading.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to emphasise one of the points raised by Deputy Dr. Ryan in this debate.  The qualifying period of seven years does appear to be rather long.  A period of five years' experience qualifying somebody who is a dispensing optician to get on to the official register represents fairly long service and a person has got a lot of information in his general practice. Then there are people with a shorter period of service.  They surely must have acquired some knowledge during the shorter period&mdash;let it be one year or four years&mdash;but they are completely kept out.</P>
      <P>This is the first time that optical dispensing and so on, is being put under rigid regulation and those who entered the profession earlier were unaware of the limitations which are now being applied.  The boy or girl who has served two, three or four years is at a slight disadvantage.  I wonder if the Minister could say, if this rigid rule is applied, how many people now practising will be deprived of that practice.  The duties of opticians have considerably increased in recent years by reason of health Acts, and the result is that the number of people practising have considerably increased.  In practically every village now, there are such people as chemists and opticians operating.  If these people now find that they are disqualified by reason of not having a sufficient length of service, not only will they be put at a disadvantage but the localities in which they practise will be put at a disadvantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister should take cognisance of the reactions that are likely to occur and that, instead of making it mandatory for a person to get on the register, that person, if he has practised for a year or more, should have the option of sitting for a qualifying examinations.  In future, once this legislation has passed, any person going into the profession will know what is required of him&mdash;what knowledge he must have and what years of experience he must have&mdash; before he can be qualified; but this is now sprung on the community and there will be many people who entered <Col N="563" /> the profession without the knowledge they now have.  I suggest that the Minister would be acting in a fair way by giving every person who has been operating for at least a year the right to an examination to qualify.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important Bill.  Any Bill dealing with the treatment of refractory troubles and diseases of the eyes must at some time or other affect every citizen of the State.  There is nothing as tragic for people to face as blindness.  That may be an extreme statement to make, but I propose to show how very often the end result of ill-judged treatment is blindness.  It will be generally recognised that there is a need for a restriction of the promiscuous treatment of eyes which is going on at present throughout the country, but I think we should approach this Bill not alone from the angle of what is satisfactory to the ophthalmic surgeons, the ophthalmic opticians, and the opticians as a whole, but from what is for the general benefit of the public.  That seems to me to be our duty in approaching the Bill.</P>
      <P>For the purpose of stating the case I wish to make, I propose to divide my remarks and to relate them to three different sections concerned with the treatment of eyes or the dispensing of spectacles.  The Minister has made it quite clear that the Bill in no way affects or restricts any member of the medical profession.  First, there are the ophthalmic surgeons&mdash;duly qualified medical practitioners who have spent a considerable amount of time, money and study in becoming doctors, and who, subsequent to becoming doctors, specialised in eyes and travelled abroad to study up-to-date conditions in England, in Europe and in many cases in America, in order to perfect themselves in their profession.  I think it is a fair statement to make that the recognised ophthalmic surgeon practising in the City of Dublin, or in any other part of the State, has at least ten years' solid education behind him to bring him to the state of perfection he now holds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second section are the ophthalmic <Col N="564" /> opticians.  These ophthalmic opticians have an examining body under which they pass an examination.  The course is a matter of three years and they do not cover a very wide field.  They cover a certain field in relation to the eyes but their tuition is more or less confined to that level.</P>
    <P>The other section coming under the Bill are the opticians, who are to be restricted to the sale of spectacles alone.  The purpose of the Bill, as I read the Bill and the Minister's statement, is to protect the public from being exploited by people who are not competent to examine eyes and prescribe spectacles.  I want to make this clear, and I think this is where the great weakness of the Bill lies, that shortage of sight and defects of the eyes are not necessarily confined in treatment or in diagnosis to refraction. They are very often associated with some grave and underlying disease which may not be apparent to an ophthalmic optician, no matter how efficient he is or how many years' experience he has at his trade.</P>
    <P>The Bill legalises, or purports to legalise, ophthalmic opticians, so that they will be in a position, on the basis of a certain register, to diagnose defects in sight and to prescribe spectacles for anyone who may go to them.  One of the major causes of blindness is a condition known as glaucoma, which is localised in the eyes and, at the risk of wearying the House for a few minutes, I will give the symptoms.  It is an increasing defect in the sight, with headaches.  A person consults an ophthalmic optician and it is found that he needs a certain degree of corrected refraction.  The optician prescribes glasses and these glasses for a temporary period improve the condition.</P>
    <P>After a certain time, these glasses cease to achieve the object for which they were prescribed and what is more natural than that, in the ordinary course, having received satisfaction from the ophthalmic optician before, the patient should return for further treatment.  Strengthening glasses are prescribed and again there is a measure of improvement which is temporary. This has happened not in one <Col N="565" /> case, but in hundreds of cases, and to my own personal knowledge as a doctor. Ultimately, that patient finds that his sight is decreasing and that his headaches are continuing and he consults an ophthalmic surgeon.  The tragedy of it is that he is then in many cases found to have an advanced state of glaucoma, a condition which destroys the optic nerve which is the hub of sight in the eyes.  The end result is blindness.</P>
    <P>That is an extreme case but other cases may be quoted as well.  There is the condition of the detachment of the retina.  That will result in a serious case of blindness if it is not properly diagnosed or dealt with.  I cite these cases to show that it is not possible for the ophthalmic optician to diagnose such cases properly nor can he be expected, with the training he has received, to do so.  There are also many other conditions that can be dealt with properly only by examination by an ophthalmic surgeon.  In many cases patients are recommended to ophthalmic surgeons by physicians to be examined for the purpose of diagnosis.</P>
    <P>I cite this to show that it is in the interests of the community as a whole, and I take it that this legislation is being brought in for the implementation of the optical section of the Health Act, that each and every person who requires treatment for any type or form of eye defect needs a thorough medical examination of his eyes and the only person competent to give that examination is the ophthalmic surgeon.</P>
    <P>There are 60 ophthalmic surgeons in this country&mdash;specialists who have travelled abroad and studied to perfect themselves for the work in which they are engaged.  If you are going to legalise ophthalmic opticians and enable them to diagnose, treat and prescribe for refraction you are running the risk of the instances I have mentioned.  In other words, you run the risk of these opticians concentrating on what they themselves know in a limited field and that means that many cases which could be cured will be missed and blindness will be the result.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that this question has been fully considered in <Col N="566" /> Britain over a number of years&mdash;I think he mentioned that 1952 was the first year in which they considered it&mdash;and so far they have not produced any Bill such as we are now producing for the purpose of legalising ophthalmic opticians.  Having said so much I now want to approach the other angle. There are in this country a lot of people, chancers and charlatans, who are going down the country and setting up as qualified opticians and selling spectacles made of window glass for as much as four and five guineas and thus exploiting the community.  There are also many honest people engaged in this trade.  On the whole it is a difficult problem to deal with.  The Minister may have accepted the fact that it is better to get this board and to legalise ophthalmic opticians and to legalise dispensing so as to prevent any further increase in the vast number of people going about and purporting to deal with problems that they know nothing at all about.  I feel that there is considerable danger in this.  There have been Bills such as this one passed in other countries and now they are already introducing contrary legislation to try and get back to the position in which they were before so that eyes should be dealt with by qualified people.</P>
    <P>It would be very hard to know what would be the best way to deal with this difficult question but I feel that it is not meeting the case to legalise ophthalmic opticians.  I feel that there should definitely be a restriction on these quacks and I think the best way to do that would be to make it illegal for anyone to sell spectacles unless he had some knowledge of refraction. That would mean a restriction of the number of people going into this trade. If a board was set up for that purpose and the sale of spectacles was thus restricted it would mean that that board would have control over such people who are at present completely untutored and doing injury to the eyes of the people throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The Minister is setting up a board for this purpose which will consist of four members of the medical profession to be nominated by the Minister; six members to be nominated by the opticians' <Col N="567" /> association and another member, at present unstated, but later to be nominated by the Minister, who will be neither an optician nor a medical practitioner.  I feel myself, that, if you are going to have a board in which so many interests are concerned, it would be far better to have parity.  I do not see why the ophthalmic surgeons should not have parity with the opticians. They cover a much wider field than the opticians do and are in a much better position to know what is best for the people's eyes.  If the Minister wants control of this board, I have no doubt that the unstated member of the board will be a civil servant, and he will see that the interests of the Department of Health are looked after.  Nobody can quibble with the method of election of the board for the first three years because if you are setting up a board you must begin somehow.  It seems to me that in introducing a Bill like this, the intentions are rather nullified, to put it mildly, by excessive State control.  It may be necessary, in setting up a new board, for the Minister in the first instance to have some control over the board.</P>
    <P>When you consider that the Minister is nominating all the members of the board, it seems to me that Section 15 is quite unnecessary.  Under Section 15 the Minister may at any time by Order remove any member of the board from office.  It does seem to me that the board will not be given any real functions if this threat is held over them, that they may be removed from office at a moment's notice.  They are completely and utterly under the Minister's control and under the Department's control.  I deplore that kind of thing.  You ought to give that board a definite function and put them in a position that if they incur the displeasure of the Minister or of the Department in any way they will not be got rid of overnight.</P>
    <P>Section 16 also gives the Minister rather arbitrary powers.  Sub-section (1) reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Minister, if he is satisfied that the board have not performed <Col N="568" /> any function which they are required by this Act to perform, may by Order require the board to perform such function....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Sub-section (2) of that section says that if the board do not, within a period specified by the Minister, comply with an Order made under sub-section (1), the Minister may by Order remove from office the members of the board.  It does not seem to me from that that the board has any real function whatsoever except to do what the Minister wants them to do or what his advisers would have them do.  If they do not do that, <i>ipso facto</i> the whole lot of them will be cleared out.  That seems to be a bad beginning for a board which is to be set up and nominated by the Minister himself.</P>
    <P>I feel it is only right and reasonable that there should be a certain amount of control by the State when a new organisation such as this is being set up.  I think that if the Minister is going to set up a board like this for three years he should give them reasonable authority to function.</P>
    <P>Reading this Bill, I did not see that they will have any function whatsoever except to do what is suggested to them.  That seems to amount to total and complete State control.  Why not have it that at the end of the three-year establishment period, the board, which must function as an autonomous board financially&mdash;they get no subvention whatsoever&mdash;would be free to elect their own members from the different societies to which they belong?  The Minister could retain one nomination.</P>
    <P>One cannot have any real objection to the provision in the Bill for the right of appeal to the Minister in the case of anybody being removed from the register.  There would seem to be two avenues of approach&mdash;one can appeal to the High Court or alternatively to the Minister.  I do not see any particular objection to that because as everybody knows an appeal to the High Court is an expensive business. It may so happen there may be a mistake or an injustice and a member is removed from the register.  Under this Bill he may go to the Minister with his appeal instead of to the court and the Minister will act in consultation <Col N="569" /> with the board and will have all the facts before him.  That is reasonable and a more economic approach from the point of view of the party concerned.</P>
    <P>I have detained the House for a good while on this Bill and I should like to say in conclusion that I do not think this Bill is well drafted; I do not think that all the facts and factors have been taken fully into consideration. I think it is an effort to try and give this country some sort of control against those promiscuous individuals who go down the country and try to prey on the gullible public.  But I do not think that the Minister has taken sufficient advice from experts on all matters and I would ask him, above all, to remove as many State controls as possible from the board when it is set up and fully functioning because State control means another file in his Department and another file in his Department means more civil servants in Ireland.  We have enough civil servants in this country to last for our lifetime.</P>

      <P>There are several interests concerned in this Bill.  We have the opticians who are at present selling spectacles and to whom people with eye diseases go for glasses.  In most cases the glasses accordingly supplied seem to suit the people who get them and I take it, as Deputy Dr. Ryan remarked, these people will be protected by the Bill.  I should like to know what will be the position of the assistants employed for four or five years by these people.  Will they get an opportunity of qualifying?  I must confess I have not read the Bill very carefully and I should like to know if these assistants will get an opportunity of qualifying as opticians.  If they have served four or five years to this type of work it would be unfair if such an opportunity were not afforded to them.  After all they have been in the same business as the qualified opticians.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dr. Ryan dealt with people who suffer from eye diseases.  I feel quite sure that people who suffer from such diseases are intelligent enough to see a doctor or an ophthalmic surgeon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="570" /> I feel quite sure they do not first go and get spectacles.  Deputy Dr. Ryan also referred to the people who suffer lack of vision through age and other causes.  At the present moment a lot of these people go to the multiple stores which sell spectacles and try on several sets until they get glasses that suit them.  There is not any evidence to show that there is much damage done by that practice.  He also pointed out that there is nothing in this to prevent a person who was unqualified as a doctor from carrying on as heretofore.</P>
    <P>I wonder if it is the idea of the Bill that the ordinary man, whose sight is failing through age or for other reasons, and who gets&mdash;and as far as I can see it is all he wants&mdash;glasses that magnify the letters on newspapers he wants to read to such an extent that he can read them comfortably, will not be in a position to do that but will have to go to some of the registered people? If so, I have no doubt he will have to pay a lot more when he goes to the registered people.  We have sufficient experience to know that in those places where those glasses are not in big supply on the counter&mdash;mass production or whatever you like to call it&mdash; glasses are bound to cost more.  I would support Deputy Dr. Ryan in so far as he says we should bring in the registration of opticians and other people concerned, but still I would not cut out the person who in my opinion is giving a useful service to the people at a cheap rate.  If the Minister has any evidence that those people are doing considerable damage to those who go in and select spectacles to suit them, and if he has any evidence, that we do not know of, that damage is occurring I certainly might have a different opinion.  From what we hear &mdash;and I know many people who go into such places&mdash;we know of them having the glasses examined by ophthalmic surgeons afterwards and being told that there was very little wrong with them.  That was the answer they were given.</P>
    <P>These are matters I would like the Minister to consider.  I would also like if the Minister would give us any information he may have about the <Col N="571" /> opticians' assistants which would indicate what will happen to them when this Bill comes into effect and whether they will have an opportunity of carrying on in the business.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAFinlay1954" hpid="Mr. Finlay Mr. Finlay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finlay</NameTxt>
      <P>There are one or two matters in this Bill which have been discussed and which seem to me to be of some importance.  The first one which occurs to me is the general point which was made by Deputy Dr. Esmonde of the danger that by creating two classes of lawful registered opticians there would be a further maltreatment or lack of treatment, through ignorance, of people who are suffering from diseased conditions of their eyes by persons who are not skilled medical practitioners.  If I thought the effect of the Bill would be as Dr. Esmonde feels it may be&mdash;to create that situation&mdash;I would be as concerned about it as he is.  I think possibly his fears are too great and it seems to me that Section 45 of the Bill provides a strong prohibition against the treatment by anybody of diseases of the eye and against the holding out by anybody&mdash;when I say anybody, I mean anybody other than a qualified medical practitioner&mdash;of any skill or willingness to treat diseases of the eye. If properly enforced&mdash;and presumably an efficient board will enforce the prohibition section&mdash;that should remove the danger with which Deputy Dr. Esmonde was concerned.  It seems that the Bill should have the opposite effect to that which Deputy Dr. Esmonde fears; it should eliminate the people who without medical skill have held themselves out either explicitly or implicitly as capable of treating diseases affecting people's eyes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one other matter raised by Deputy Dr. Esmonde which seems to me of some importance and it is this question of the extent to which the Minister and the Government has taken control in the Bill over the board.  I would like to put before the House and the Minister a slightly different view from those already expressed. It is this: I agree we should be very careful indeed in any legislation controlling any profession or occupation of the freedom of anybody to <Col N="572" /> follow a profession or occupation.  We should be careful of tying it too closely to the Government, or even closely to the Government in some cases.</P>
    <P>I think we ought also be very careful if we are creating in effect a monopoly &mdash;in other words, if we are going to create a group by registration or listing or qualifications which will be the only group entitled to carry on a certain profitable activity in this country&mdash;to ensure that we do not hand over to that group itself the power of excluding other people from joining its ranks.  We do not want, merely by legalising opticians, by attempting to ensure that unqualified persons are not allowed to carry on the business of opticians, we do not want, by freeing the board too much from some sort of supervision by the Minister and the Government, to create a situation whereby the board and the profession as a whole expressing itself through its elected representatives to the board could start a sort of exclusive or closed-shop policy for the professional opticians.  I think those two considerations must be balanced and I am not at all satisfied that they are not fairly well balanced so far in this Bill.</P>
    <P>It may be that certain freedom could be given at a later stage to the board or to the profession or vocation when it has proved itself capable of managing its own affairs with a sense of responsibility. It might be possible to put in this Bill even now some provision which would allow for a loosening of the strings between the Department and the board as the board grows up, but I would certainly not be in favour of abolishing the major control or supervision of this board by the Department unless we had some very solid and effective guarantee that we would not create a situation whereby the first group or generation of people to get themselves registered as opticians in either of these classes and who got their representatives on to the board managing their own affairs could then create a sort of closed shop against other young people quite willing and quite fitted to come in.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter which is possibly more a matter for the Committee <Col N="573" /> Stage because it is a detail, but it is a detail which goes through one whole section and as it is seems to me to be a matter of principle I would like to mention it at this stage for the Minister's consideration.  It seems to me that one of the most important provisions in this Bill apart from the penalties for actually carrying on the business of an optician is the title assuming section.  It has been our experience in regard to all such matters, in the case of the medical and the dental professions and so on, that entitlement to direct control against people who are unqualified assuming the title of qualified people is most important. Section 47 appears to me in its present form to be of little use because it merely prohibits a nonregistered ophthalmic optician or dispensing optician from calling himself a registered ophthalmic or dispensing optician.  It will be a long time before the ordinary man in this country understands the distinction of a registered dispensing optician.  I think we must provide the correct savers for people carrying on the business and who are waiting for the period during which they can be registered, but I think we should go further than Section 47 goes at present and provide that nobody except those qualified to act in one way or another should be entitled to hold themselves out as dispensing or ophthalmic opticians.  I may be wrong in my reading of Section 47 but if I read it correctly it would be no offence to hold oneself out as a dispensing optician whether you are entitled or not as long as you did not put the word registered before your claim.  I do not think the word &ldquo;registered&rdquo; will receive its due importance in the minds of the ordinary people for a very considerable period after the Act has been in operation.</P>
    <P>The only other point I would like to mention is something which may really be again a matter of construction in the Bill and, so long as I am satisfied the Minister has it in his mind, it may possibly be of no importance.  I refer to the advertising section of the Bill. I agree with what has been said of the tragedies one sees in the country of people being treated by charlatans and chancers for eye trouble, with all the <Col N="574" /> tragic consequences that ensue and the tragic losses that are sometimes sustained.  It has been my experience in a number of country districts, and this applies particularly to the less densely populated areas&mdash; for instance Mayo&mdash;that apart from any advertising in local papers or billposting in local shops or hotels an extensive canvass is carried on by people whose <i>bona fides</i> are doubtful and who are certainly not very highly qualified.  I would like the Minister to ensure that Section 49, which gives the board power to prescribe rules controlling advertising by dispensing or ophthalmic opticians. also gives the board power to make rules controlling canvassing on the part of these people.  I am thinking of the sort of thing which has come within my own experience where certain people arrive in showy looking cars, giving the impression of affluence and skill, at small houses in the more lonely parts of the West and persuade old people, and it is easy to persuade old people, that their eyesight is not as good as it was 20 years ago.  The result is a pair of four guinea spectacles which are, so far as the layman can judge, of no apparent value whatsoever. Now that is not done by advertising.  It is done by the old system of the soft talk and the canvass. If the board is to have power to control advertising the Minister might also consider giving it specific power, which it may not have as the measure stands at present, to draw attention to the question of canvassing orders.  If it is intended to give to the vocation or profession of dispensing and ophthalmic opticians the power to draw up their own register, to manage their own affairs to a very large extent and have proper examinations, we should go further and give them that extra power.  In effect, we give them a monopoly once they establish themselves as a profession.  If we do that, we are entitled on behalf of the ordinary people to insist in return that they should adopt very high professional standards as between themselves and in relation to the general public.</P>
    <P>We should keep in mind in approving of this measure, and it appears to me to be a desirable measure in its <Col N="575" /> general outline, that we are, in effect, giving to this particular occupation or profession a monopoly it did not hitherto enjoy.  Not only are we requiring a body which was unorganised before to organise itself now and put its house in order, but we are giving that body a monopoly; and, in return, we are entitled to expect from that body&mdash;and we should not be slow to make this requirement under the Bill &mdash;a very high standard of professional conduct.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I would like to compliment Deputy Finlay on his speech.  He has made exactly the case I intended to make on behalf of the ordinary people, particularly in the West of Ireland, an area which is one of the happy hunting grounds for quack opticians of one kind or another.  I have not heard any contributions to this debate except that of Deputy Finlay and possibly the matters with which I wish to deal may already have been dealt with by some other speakers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that the section requiring people to satisfy the board that they have carried on business as ophthalmic or dispensing opticians for a specified period, together with proof of their being citizens of Ireland and so forth, is hopelessly weak.  It means, in effect, that these people will be allowed to carry on.  They may not be allowed to advertise as they have been doing.  God forbid that they should; but, even so, it looks as if we will allow these quacks in and allow them to continue to practise when, in fact, they are not entitled to carry on that profession or business at all.  I do not want to mention any individual in debate.  I think that would be against the tradition of the House, but there are firms which supply glasses to the public, controlled and managed by people who have no qualifications whatsoever.  They have not even passed one examination in ophthalmics to justify their engaging in that occupation or business.  It is not good enough in a country very largely unconscious of the importance of proper treatment for the eyes that these people should be allowed to continue operating and <Col N="576" /> that we, in the legislation we introduce, condone that by not causing regulations to be made obliging these people to pass examinations in order to qualify for the carrying on of this particular business.  It is not good enough that an individual simply by waving a citizenship paper and saying: &ldquo;I am a citizen of Ireland and therefore I am an optician&rdquo; should be entitled to practise as an optician. Before the Bill passes into law it should be altered so that no person other than a man properly qualified will be allowed to register either as a dispensing or ophthalmic optician.</P>
    <P>I understand that when people are doing the courses necessary for this particular avocation they do a lot of physics and certain other subjects, subjects they do not really need in practice.  I am not suggesting we should ask these people to return to the university and start all over again on theoretical courses; but I think we should insist on a practical examination for all except those who have certain recognised degrees and qualifications. That is the very least we should do if we want to protect the people from the continued ministrations of quacks.</P>
    <P>Deputy Finlay did not exaggerate when he spoke about canvassing and described these people going around in flashy cars in the West of Ireland.  They publish advertisements, many of which are fraudulent.  Indeed, they go a good deal further than that.  They run down those who are qualified.  They say: &ldquo;Oh, he is useless,&rdquo; or &ldquo;the diagnosis was wrong.&rdquo;  It is particularly easy for these people to carry on such a campaign canvassing from house to house, sitting on the hob and so forth. It is a sort of technique against which the qualified person has virtually no defence, particularly in the country where the people are so sadly behind the times in their consciousness of the importance of proper treatment for the eyes.  Very often one will see an old lady producing a pair of spectacles to sign a document or read the paper. They are tied together with a piece of string or a few strands of thread.  She puts the spectacles on and says: &ldquo;Oh, those are no good; those are the ones I got from Mary in America.&rdquo; She tries <Col N="577" /> on another pair which are not much better and she says: &ldquo;I got these from John, the time he came home from England.&rdquo;  I know of cases where glasses have been given by these quacks, glasses which are pretty well useless to the recipients, as useless as the spectacles that John passes on to his mother when her sight begins to go dim.</P>
    <P>The principal grievance against the Bill for my part is that I think it does not go half far enough and that we must, in my opinion, amend Section 26 so as to provide for the practical examination which everyone, other than certain categories of people who have the proper degrees, would have to pass before they would be allowed to register or practise as opticians.</P>
    <P>I understand that an opportunity has already been given to those people to pass an examination but that many of them have refused to do that.  There are quite a few who have done this practical examination.  I do not see any reason why another examination should not be set and that these people be told either to give up their business of optician or prove that they are able to carry it on.  After all there is not any more exact science, if you like, than prescribing and supplying proper glasses.</P>
    <P>Take for instance the ordinary chemist who has perhaps a lifetime of experience dealing with spectacles.  If you have not the special qualifications, he would not know, for instance, if the left-hand glass was fitted into the right-hand frame and <i>vice versa.</i> That is a particular case I have come across in practice myself.  The glasses were properly fitted within the frame and the frame was according to prescription but the wrong glass was put in and the chemist was not qualified enough to know that that was so.  Not being an expert in these things myself, I do not want to dogmatise about them but I understand the most important thing in curing or helping to cure a defect in eyesight is proper refraction.</P>
    <P>I notice on reading through this Bill that the word &ldquo;sale&rdquo; appears all over the place and that there is provision for the sale, in a wholesale manner, of <Col N="578" /> spectacles.  I am wondering what exactly that means.  Does it mean that Woolworths or other firms like that can sell spectacles at 2/6 or 5/- and that they may be supplied wholesale to them?  If so, does the House think that that sort of practice should be encouraged, or, in fact, allowed?  After all, if the exact diagnosis, proper refraction, and so forth, is the important thing and the proper fitting of the frame for the supply of spectacles afterwards is almost as important, this appears to be a highly technical thing that only highly qualified and skilled people should have anything to do with.  In the circumstances, I fail to see, unless I am misreading the Bill, what is the meaning of allowing the sale of spectacles by wholesale.  Section 50, Part V, says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Nothing in this part of this Act shall operate to prevent or restrict&mdash; ...(b) the sale by wholesale of spectacles.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Another important point is that some of the big firms that manufacture glasses have a special representative in their shop and, because they are getting two profits instead of one, they are able to undercut all other people. That is a small matter and I suppose it is one that is not very important at this stage of the Bill, but I am wondering again if it does not give an unfair advantage to one person over another; in other words, that a person who is prescribing glasses should not be in the same place, in my opinion, as the person who is manufacturing them.</P>
    <P>I welcome in principle any Bill which would be designed to clear up the mess that has existed down the years in regard to optics generally. I welcome this Bill as an advance on the right road.  I welcome it particularly because it will focus public attention in a country where attention needs to be devoted to eyesight generally and to the importance of caring it and getting proper treatment, in the hope that people will become properly conscious of their duty to themselves and particularly to their children so that the day when the mother passes on the glasses to her child when she ceases to have any use <Col N="579" /> for them, will pass very soon in this country.</P>
    <P>In that hope I welcome this Bill but I hope also that the House will agree with me that the Bill does not go far enough.  We should take steps to ensure that only qualified persons are allowed to practise as opticians.  When I say &ldquo;qualified&rdquo; I do not necessarily mean&mdash;I think I have made it clear I do not mean&mdash;people who have gone through only certain university courses, and so forth.  What I mean is that those people, and such others who have been in the business and have made their money and their livelihood by it but who have proved by passing the practical examination that they in fact have the knowledge and the experience to carry on the business, should be allowed to do so.  Otherwise we are going to defeat the purpose of this Bill and we are going to have as registered opticians people who are a nuisance and a danger in the community. I do think we should face that fact fairly and squarely and not allow anybody, merely by waving a citizenship paper in front of the board, to get away with the fact that he has no qualifications and no right to practise.  Before the Bill leaves this House it should be designed in such a way that certain types of people will be excluded.  After all, we shall only then be bringing this profession into line with every other business and profession in the country.  I do not say that I would not feel sorry for people having been denied their livelihood.  I would feel sorry for them as individuals losing their livelihood but when I know what some of these people have done to the plain people of the West of Ireland, particularly in the area I come from, I would not feel a bit sorry that they would be forever excluded from the threshold of these Irish homes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. A. Byrne Mr. A. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>My first duty is to congratulate the Minister on bringing in this Bill which we welcome.  I congratulate him on the Bill and all other Bills he has brought in for the improvement of the health of the people. I was requested to ask a question <Col N="580" /> although I am not sufficiently qualified to discuss the merits of it.  In certain medical halls all over the country, highly qualified chemists have been dealing with the optical section of the business.  Some of these people have five and six years' service and it is feared that some monopolist interest will try to keep them out of the business because they are described as something other than opticians, although they have been engaged in it all their lives and have been earning their living at it.</P>
      <P>I am informed that some time ago there was an examination for which 17 chemists, or people engaged in some sideline of the chemists' business, sat, and not one of the 17 was allowed to pass.  I suggest that the Minister should see to it that such qualified persons will not be debarred, because there is a fear expressed in one or two places in the city that somebody will try to keep that type of person out of the business.  I ask the Minister to make sure that if he gives power to anybody to decide on examinations, or on who shall sit for examination, no young student, coming straight from his college without any practical experience, will be allowed to do out of his employment a man who has at least five years' practical experience.  If there is a man with this practical experience who is certified by his employers to be a good man, the Minister should take steps to protect him and see that he is not victimised by any examination board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to express my appreciation to the House, and particularly to the Deputies who took part in the discussion, of the manner in which the Bill has been received by the House.  I can assure Deputies generally that the points of view which have been expressed on different aspects of the Bill will be considered very carefully by me between now and the Committee Stage, but perhaps I might deal with some of these points now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to be the consensus of opinion amongst Deputies that there is, in relation to this problem of the supply of glasses and spectacles up and <Col N="581" /> down the country, a public nuisance, which does require the intervention of the Dáil.  I have here specimen advertisements which are a regular feature in most country newspapers&mdash;advertisements inserted by a number of persons styling themselves as well-known qualified opticians, eye specialists and all the rest of it, and advertising their knowledge in all matters appertaining to defects of the eyes.  Every Deputy who has any knowledge of country life is aware that unfortunately advertisements such as these and the canvassing mentioned by Deputies Finlay and Flanagan do lead not infrequently to the passing of money by old and defenceless people to some of these gentlemen for a worthless article.</P>
    <P>This public nuisance, as I describe it, has been in existence for a great number of years, and I think the House can be satisfied that the legislative proposal we are now discussing has not been hastily thought of and has not been rushed.  The necessity for it has been growing over the years and it is only now that, having taken full stock of the situation, it has been necessary to suggest this way of dealing with the problem.</P>
    <P>Whenever one mentions registration, one is conscious that perhaps a closed shop may be created, and, of course, any proposal for registration is open to criticism on that ground.  It is very hard to know the best way of setting about a matter of this kind, because what we all desire is to see better standards adopted and it is in seeking for better standards that one is driven into saying: &ldquo;We will specify the standards&rdquo;, and, in effect, that means registration.  Once you decide on registration, then, if you are serious about your standards, you have to prevent everyone who is substandard from carrying on in the business or profession concerned, so that I am conscious of the fact that there is a danger of a monopoly in an occupation being given to those who are registered, and certainly, since that danger is there, the provisions with regard to the functions of the board will be very carefully examined.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Ryan mentioned, quite rightly, that, while in the past the <Col N="582" /> State has seen fit to provide, in effect, the same kind of registration for medical practitioners, for dentists, for pharmaceutical chemists and for nurses, on these other occasions, the State did not go so far as to say: &ldquo;If you are not registered, you may not carry on in the business&rdquo;&mdash;if I may use that phrase.  That, of course, is quite right and true, and Deputy Dr. Ryan's point is well taken.  The trouble in this connection is that the problem is created by the sale of &ldquo;phoney&rdquo; spectacles. The problem is created by the prescribing of spectacles by persons without knowledge.  It is the very operation of these people that creates the problem.  If they did not exist, there would be no problem.  The fact that they do exist creates the problem, and, accordingly, if we are to attempt to deal with the problem at all, we must go the whole way, and, having established our standards and set up our register, we must be quite rigorous in putting the people who do not make the standard out of business.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Ryan may be surprised to learn that he, in fact, as Minister, decided that the whole step was necessary, and, as Minister in January, 1954, having decided to go ahead with this legislation, approved of a scheme of registration and also of a prohibition on people who did not succeed in getting registration either prescribing or dispensing spectacles.  I must say that, having given considerable thought to the matter myself, I could not see that there would be any worthwhile alternative way of dealing with the problem. Merely registering and prohibiting people describing themselves as what they are not would not deal with the problem in a satisfactory way.  We would still have these gentlemen conducting the same kind of dangerous business that they have been doing for a number of years.</P>
    <P>When the board has been convened and the register has been established, all of those people who hold recognised qualifications, whatever they may be, will be registered on application. I was concerned, with Deputy Dr. Ryan, with the fact that there are a great number of people in the country who are carrying on a fair and <Col N="583" /> decent business as opticians of different kinds.  They have their own code of etiquette and they conform to certain reasonable standards of conduct. It would seem unfair to me that these old established persons or firms should have to undergo an examination, often in the winter of their years, and accordingly in the Bill we have taken the period of seven years, which I do not think is unreasonable.  However, I am open to conviction on that.  We have taken the period of seven years and have said that any person who has been in recognised practice as an ophthalmic optician for seven years and can show that he is a citizen and that his main source of livelihood is his practice should be entitled to registration. If any Deputy has any strong views on this matter I would invite discussion on the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>With regard to the further period of five years mentioned in the Bill, there again I am open to conviction.  It was not in the previous scheme because I was concerned with the position of chemists in the country.  As most Deputies will appreciate most chemists have, for many years, been dispensing spectacles and have been engaged in the work referred to in the Bill.  I felt that some special provision should be made for them.  They could not qualify under the section dealing with the seven years' practice because this part of their business could not be regarded as their main source of livelihood. Accordingly it is provided in the Bill that if these chemists have been in that business for a period of five years&mdash;and that again is a matter on which I have not any very strong views&mdash;if they have been carrying on that business for that period of years, and have established by examination that they have certain qualifications and know what they are doing, then they will be registered.  The examination will not be the type that a person would have to undergo who is just entering into the business.  It will be specially designed for persons in this category.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Ryan also referred to the question of the removal of persons from the register.  I must confess that <Col N="584" /> I am concerned with what he said in that direction.  I think that there may be a danger that the board, in drawing up its rules, might take powers to itself which might be used unjustly or capriciously against persons on the register.  I would point out to Deputies however that this again is a matter to be considered in more detail later.  I would refer Deputy Dr. Ryan to the fact that under Section 18 the rules to be adopted by the board must have the consent of the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I took it that that only applies to Section 18.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised that it applies to all rules that they may make but I will have that matter examined. Section 18 is the rule&mdash;making section and any rules must have the consent of the Minister.  Later on any rules referred to would be rules already made with the consent of the Minister. I think that will remove some of the dangers that the Deputy had in mind.</P>
      <P>On the question of appeal from removal from the register&mdash;again I have no very strong view on that.  I think it was Deputy Dr. Esmonde who expressed my feeling on it.  The procedure of appeal to a judge of the High Court is a very cumbersome from of appeal and it may be an expensive form of appeal.  While I think it is desirable that it should be there it appears to me that we should also provide appeal to the Minister.  Again I have no strong views on that and I will welcome the views of Deputies on the Committee Stage of the Bill.  The appeal to the High Court is designed merely to ensure that if a person is removed from the register and feels that he might not get a fair hearing from the Minister for the time being then he will be able to appeal to a judge of the High Court if he so wishes.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dr. Esmonde has referred to a number of objections which I have heard expressed already in discussions dealing with the Bill.  I know that this Bill is not liked by the ophthalmic surgeons and the medical people who deal with this specialty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can, of course, quite understand <Col N="585" /> their point of view and sympathise with what they say.  At the same time I do not think we should be going around in blinkers in a matter of this kind. The facts are that any ophthalmic surgeon to whom I may go or to whom Deputies Dr. Esmonde or Dr. Ryan may go, if he prescribes spectacles for me, he will give me a prescription to take to an ophthalmic optician, generally in practice not very far from his rooms.  I think all ophthalmic surgeons do recognise that there is a reputable person engaged in the business of dispensing prescriptions and selling spectacles.</P>
    <P>In addition, I think they also recognise that there are persons who engage in this business as a speculation and who are out to make money quickly and who are unconcerned as to the danger they might do.  The facts being pretty well common, the only concern is to provide a measure on common facts to deal with the problem recognised by everybody as being in existence. Deputy Dr. Esmonde says that this Bill, which legalises ophthalmic opticians, may lead to harm.  Of course that is not correct.  Ophthalmic opticians do not need any legalising from this Bill; they are perfectly lawful as it is.  At the moment there is nothing to prevent any person who feels that there is something wrong with his eyes from going in to an ophthalmic optician and getting spectacles and going in again and getting more spectacles, and if he is unfortunate, as Deputy Dr. Esmonde says, and finds that he is going blind this Bill does not create that danger.  The danger is there already.</P>
    <P>All this Bill does is to ensure that a particular man will not have to undergo the danger of being canvassed or of going to some person who is completely without qualifications and reckless in the advice and treatment he may give out.  When we talk about the danger of a person who has eye disease getting wrong treatment or advice from an ophthalmic optician registered under this Bill we must not allow ourselves to commit the mistake of thinking that such a danger was created by this Bill.  As I have <Col N="586" /> said, it is there already and I think the danger is far greater at the moment.  I also think&mdash;I have expressed this view to those representing the ophthalmic surgeons&mdash;that those who use the argument that this Bill is going to encourage people to go to non-medical persons and seek from them medical advice, illustrate that they have a very poor opinion of our people here.  No one is going to think that a person going to an ophthalmic optician will get medical advice; most people know very well the distinction and the difference that does exist between an ophthalmic optician and an oculist or ophthalmic surgeon, and most of our people are very quick to understand when their complaint requires the advice of a doctor, or merely requires the provision of spectacles.  When I say that, I am referring to ophthalmic opticians who, under their rules, do not advertise or carry on their business but try to give a fair service to the public.  I feel that ophthalmic surgeons might be in far greater danger from some of those gentlemen who advertise in the provincial Press and who, by their advertisements, tell the public that they are the greatest eye specialists in the world.  I would have expected the I.M.A. and the ophthalmic surgeons to be more than anxious to join with me in preventing people such as those from preying on the gullible public and who hold themselves out, in effect if not in fact, as being qualified medical persons.  I think that this Bill, if it aims at preventing that, is conserving the position whereby a person who wants to get medical advice in relation to a disease or difficulty in his eyes will go to a properly qualified person and will not be in danger of being codded by a few unqualified persons.</P>
    <P>In that connection may I say that under the Bill very great care has been taken to pinpoint the fact that a registered optician under this Bill is nothing but an optician; that the Bill pinpoints the fact that there is no danger of a misunderstanding on that matter?  There is provision in Section 45 which says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(1)  A registered optician shall not, on or after the appointed day&mdash;<Col N="587" /> (a)  treat any disease of the eye or prescribe or administer any drug or other medical preparation for that purpose,</P>
    <P>(b)  prescribe or administer any drug for the purpose of paralysing the accommodation of the eye, or</P>
    <P>(c)  suggest by any written or oral statement or by any action that, in relation to the treatment of the eyes, he has done or is capable of doing anything which is other than the providing of spectacles or, in the case of a registered ophthalmic optician, the prescribing of spectacles.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is written into the Bill in order to make quite sure by legislation that a registered optician is registered as such and is precluded from administering drugs and from suggesting that he can do or has done anything more than prescribe or supply spectacles.</P>
    <P>It is the same as in the case of the dentists' board where there is representation for medical practitioners who are not dentists.  The dentists have the major share on that board because it is a dentists' board.  It does appear to me that it is only fair and reasonable that that should be done.</P>
    <P>I shall certainly consider very carefully what Deputy Dr. Esmonde said in relation to the removal from office of members of the board.  I shall certainly consider that between now and the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Deputy Finlay has referred also to the danger of the closed shop which I have already mentioned.  He referred to a possible defect in the title assuming section and I shall have that examined between this and the Commitee Stage.  In relation to canvassing which he mentioned, I do not think he need have any fears with regard to that.  Advertising will be prohibited and registration will take place.  I do not think there will be much danger then&mdash;at least if there is, it is very hard to prevent it.  The only canvassing that could take place would be done by persons who are not registered and who in effect would be committing an offence when this Bill becomes an Act. However, I shall have the matter considered <Col N="588" /> in detail between this and the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I have endeavoured to cover some of the major points that have been made by Deputies.  I think that the Bill is necessary and I am glad it has been accepted so generously by the House. I can assure the House that if any Deputy has any particular view on reading the Bill more carefully before the Committee Stage any amendments which are put down will be considered very carefully and sympathetically. I hope by so doing we shall provide as well as we can for the solution of the problem covered by the Bill.</P>

    <P Just="Center">SECTION 34.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>On the section.  I understand that the Minister is aware that a certain section of the public is concerned about the opportunity that exists through the introduction of Section 34 for the alleviation to some extent of a grievance which they have. Perhaps the Minister will understand what I am leading up to if I first of all point out to him that we have licensed bookmakers in this country and that licensed bookmakers operate mainly under the Racing Board Act.  They are tax collectors for the Government to a very great extent and they are bound to fulfil all their obligations notwithstanding the Gaming Act.  If they do not, if they default and if they are reported to the Racing Board, the board may put them out of business. On the other hand, they have no means of enforcing the law against a client.  I am not suggesting that the Gaming Act should be so altered as to permit bookmakers to claim with full force of law for gambling debts, but I do feel that the Minister should recognise that since a certain action took place against the stewards or against the Conyngham Club, as it is known here, there is no means of dealing with <Col N="589" /> defaulters even to the extent of warning them off racecourses.</P>
      <P>We are not in the position in which bookmakers are in England where you have a Tattersalls.  If a person is reported to Tattersalls not only is the warning-off effective in England but such a person is warned off even in this country.  I am not in a position to make a formal suggestion yet, but I was about to discuss the section with a view to ascertaining if the Minister would give any indication that he has something in mind to meet the situation so that if not I would probably try to draft an amendment for the Report Stage that might be acceptable.  What I have in mind is this: If the Minister can say&mdash;I do not know whether he can or not&mdash;on behalf of the Cabinet, or if the Attorney-General can say or indicate that the other Act would be amended so as to restore the Conyngham Club to some status enabling it to enforce&mdash;if you like&mdash;the law against either the bookmakers or the clients, then I would be quite satisfied with such an undertaking.  If not, would the Minister agree that there should be some limited rights attaching to the licensed bookmaker for the recovery of debts?  What I intended to suggest was that he might be able to say that the limit to which a court could go would be to grant an instalment order, the court to fix the instalment, and that in the event of the death of either party to the transaction, the whole order would become void.  In other words, the family of a very imprudent person would be protected against loss of property arising from a gambling debt.  I do not know if that could be done in law but I do believe in justice there should be some protection for these people.  They are licensed; they are recognised by law; they collect taxes for the State, if they default they are put out of business but they are not in a position to have any means of collecting from their clients if, when they bring a client to court, he pleads the Gaming Act.  I would be satisfied if there was an undertaking that something will be done to bring into being again the Conyngham Club so that it could act as Tattersalls act in England.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know if that can be done <Col N="590" /> under this Bill.  Perhaps the Minister might give some indication as to whether or not there are some means of avoiding what I refer to as a hardship, and a very grave hardship, on a section of our community.  Quite a number of people are involved.  They give considerable employment and so forth.  Whether or not people like bookmakers and gambling, the fact remains that we have by legislation in its fullest form recognised their existence and, consequently, I would ask the Minister at this stage if he could indicate any view on the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a lot of common sense in the Deputy's remarks.  I would, however, refer him to the speech I made on the Second Reading of the Bill.  While one may have, as the Deputy points out, grievances on the part of the bookmaker, one has to consider also grievances on the part of the family of some unfortunate individual who might be foolish enough to &ldquo;plunge&rdquo; in an effort to recover his losses.  For that reason I have nothing to add to the remarks I made on the Second Stage.  I regret I am not in a position to meet the Deputy's case, because I agree with a good deal of what he has said.  However, I think that if he takes the general position and considers the effects such a provision might have on innocent people, I am sure it would be neither his intention nor his wish to deprive people of their homes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I paid particular attention to the views expressed by the Minister on that particular matter and I am not unaware that the vast majority of the members of my own Party share the view expressed by the Minister that innocent people must be protected.  But, as the Minister stated, there is ground for grievance on the part of the bookmakers and I am asking now if it is not possible to design a limited form of protection.  In other words, if a person goes out of his depth and incurs a debt to a bookmaker that bookmaker should be entitled to go to court and obtain a limited judgment.  I am not asking that such a judgment should affect a person's property.  It could be limited to instalments fixed by the court in full <Col N="591" /> possession of the man's circumstances. His property and his home could be protected.  In the event of his death, or the death of the bookmaker, the whole transaction would be void. Surely there is some means of devising some little bit of protection for the bookmaker.  It is all one-sided at the moment.  The bookmakers do not want the repeal of the Gaming Act.  They accept the principles expressed by the Minister.  They feel, however, as a result of a court case where the Conyngham Club was found not to have sufficient authority to take the steps they did take&mdash;the club is now non-existent&mdash;that something should be done either by way of giving them a limited means of recovery or alternatively putting somebody in, like Tattersalls in England, to deal with such matters.</P>

      <P>This is a drafting amendment which follows from some earlier amendments. The point of it is that as the term &ldquo;slot-machine&rdquo; is no longer defined as referring solely to a machine to which Section 9 applies, Section 35 must be amended to provide that it is only the slot-machines to which Section 9 applies that may be seized at any time.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Norton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  This Bill is designed to regularise the position in regard to ownership and registry of Irish ships and will also deal with the duties and functions of registrars of shipping, transfer and transmission of ownership, mortgage of ships, national character and flag and survey and tonnage measurement.</P>
      <P>It has long been apparent that the law relating to merchant shipping in this country, which consists mainly of adapted British statutes, requires amendment and codification.  The law is contained in the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, and some 20 other enactments amending and extending that Act which, although technically continued in force under Article 73 of the Constitution of 1922, are of imperfect application to the circumstances of this country.</P>
      <P>The main Merchant Shipping Act is the Act of 1894 which was intended to cater for the merchant shipping position in all parts of the British Empire as it was at that time.  It was enacted to apply to ships belonging to all parts of the then British Empire and applied throughout to &ldquo;British ships&rdquo; that is, ships owned by British subjects and British registered companies and registered in some port in British territory.  Under this Act, a ship, no matter in what part of British territory it was registered, remained a British ship from the time of registry until it became a total loss, or was sold to non-British ownership, and the law applicable to it was the same whenever it came within British jurisdiction.  In such a scheme there was no room for the concept of an independent Irish Mercantile Marine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="597" /> Although unsuited to the new status of, and the conditions in, this country on the establishment of the State in 1922, the Merchant Shipping Acts have remained almost unchanged on the Statute Book.  This was largely because there was no pressing need for their replacement, as an ocean-going Irish Merchant Navy had not come into existence before the war.  The whole problem assumes a fresh and new importance with the development of an Irish merchant shipping fleet, and with the change in political relations between this country and the former British Commonwealth which was brought about by the Republic of Ireland Act, 1948, and the Ireland Act, 1949.</P>
    <P>Many problems are involved in an amendment and codification of the law relating to merchant shipping, many phases of which have international as well as national implications.  The preparation and enactment of legislation to cover the whole field of merchant shipping will be a lengthy process. There are over 1,000 sections in the existing code which, however, it is hoped to reduce substantially.</P>
    <P>As part of the general codification and amendment of maritime law to meet Irish requirements, the Bill makes provision for the class of ships to be known as Irish ships.  It prescribes that these Irish ships must fly national colours as laid down in the Bill and that only Irish ships may fly these colours or assume Irish national character; these provisions are already in Part I of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, as adapted and in the Merchant Shipping Act, 1947.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that the following classes of persons only shall be unconditionally entitled in law to own Irish ships:&mdash;(i) the Government; (ii) a Minister of State; (iii) Irish citizens; (iv) bodies corporate established under and subject to the law of the State and having their principal place of business in the State.  The Bill also provides, however, that any ships, whether owned by the foregoing classes of persons or not, which are registered at a port in the State on the date of introduction of the Bill, shall be deemed to be duly registered.  This provision is a saver for those persons or corporations which had, in exercise of a previously <Col N="598" /> existing right, registered vessels at Irish ports.</P>
    <P>Provision is also made in the Bill whereby the Government may make Orders granting rights of registry at Irish ports to citizens or companies of other States in which Irish citizens and companies enjoy corresponding privileges, under the law of such States. The making of such Orders will also be subject to the condition that it is in the national interest to do so.</P>
    <P>Apart from making specific provision for &ldquo;Irish ships&rdquo; as a special status, the main change involved in relation to ownership and registry is that citizens and companies of Britain and Commonwealth countries will not as heretofore automatically be qualified to own and register an Irish ship. They will only be entitled to do so where a reciprocal Order is made by the Government in respect of the State concerned.  A new requirement as to registry is that a ship owned by persons qualified to own an Irish ship and acquired after the enactment of this Bill must be registered in the State unless consent is given to its registry outside the State.  This is a logical development of existing law which prohibits the transfer of an Irish ship to foreign registry without approval. The inclusion of a provision whereby consent may be given to register outside the State is designed to permit persons qualified to own an Irish ship to acquire ships abroad, in circumstances where entry on or transfer to the Irish register is not practicable, for example where ships in the registry of another country could not be acquired if transfer to the Irish register were insisted on.</P>
    <P>The provisions of Part I of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, in relation to transfers and transmissions of ownership in ships and to shares in a ship and in relation to mortgages will be re-enacted in the Bill without any significant change.</P>
    <P>The existing law governing the survey and tonnage measurement of ships is contained in Part I of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894.  In that Act, the procedure for survey and tonnage measurement is set out in considerable detail.  While no substantial <Col N="599" /> departure from the existing provisions is contemplated, this Bill will include only the main principles of survey and tonnage measurement.  Matters of detail will be dealt with by directions to be made from time to time as required.  The object of this change is to ensure flexibility.  The survey and tonnage measurement of ships is a matter affected by international agreement. The existing rules for survey and tonnage measurement are at present being studied on an international basis and it is likely that the outcome of this study will result in changes being made which will have to be followed by this country.  The inclusion of only the main principles of survey and tonnage measurement in the Bill will enable whatever changes are approved of internationally to be put into effect in this country without the necessity of having recourse to further legislation.</P>
    <P>This Bill will repeal the Merchant Shipping Act, 1907, Part I of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, together with certain sections of Part II of that Act and of the Merchant Shipping Acts, 1906 and 1947.  The repealed sections will be re-enacted with amendments and adaptations as required in this Bill which represents the first stage of the codification of Irish merchant shipping law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not very much to say on this Bill which has been in the course of preparation in the Department of Industry and Commerce for many years.  It became clear long ago that the adaptation of the British Merchant Shipping Acts was imperfect and doubts existed as to whether any effective merchant shipping legislation was in force here.  In any case, the desirability of having a Merchant Shipping Act of our own was obvious although in my experience I never met any case of difficulty arising for anybody by reason of the uncertain legal position.  As the Minister has said, this Bill mainly secures the re-enactment, in a new Bill, of provisions which are contained in the existing law, if that existing law is properly in force here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="600" /> The only question of policy that arose in the preparation of the measure related to the definition of the class of person entitled to own Irish ships and to have them on the Irish Register.  Even on that question the single issue which arose concerned the definition which should be given to an Irish body corporate for the purpose of the Bill.  I came to the conclusion, when the Bill was being prepared, that there was no good reason why the definition of an Irish company or body corporate should be rigidly drawn.  I decided that, as far as I was concerned, the Bill would merely provide that a company registered here and having its head offices in this country would be entitled to have its ships on the Irish Register no matter who owned the company or held its shares.</P>
    <P>I note with interest that the present Minister arrived at the same conclusion. This Bill provides that in future an Irish ship may be owned by an Irish national or a company registered in Ireland with head offices in Ireland. It may also be owned by a British citizen or company.  That clause, dealing with reciprocal arrangements with other countries, will, in effect, apply only as far as Britain is concerned.  The British legislation, to which the Minister refers&mdash;the Ireland Act&mdash;gave our ship owners a special status in Britain and was so framed as to cause no disturbance in the existing position.  It may be that some other countries illay wish to avail themselves of this reciprocal arrangement but I think it is improbable.</P>
    <P>The provision that an Irish person owning a ship must put it on the Irish Register is logical but presumably an Irish company owning a ship on the British Register will be permitted to continue in that position.  I doubt if much can be done about it in any case, because the restrictions on the transfer of registration brought into operation during the war are still in force in every country, although a situation may develop when the pre-war practice in that respect will be restored.</P>
    <P>As far as I am concerned I have no further comments to make on the Bill. The only issue of policy was that which <Col N="601" /> I have mentioned as to the definition of an Irish company or body corporate which should be entitled to own an Irish ship and the Minister has reached the same conclusion on that matter as I did.  I have not read the Bill in detail and I do not know if there are any amendments which I might like to put down to it.  I would like a week or so to examine the Bill and see if there are any amendments necessary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Norton) William Norton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Norton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The main purpose of the Bill is to enable the board of C.I.E. to raise the finance necessary for the rehabilitation of the railway system.</P>
      <P>The railway system which the board inherited in 1950 had, through years of neglect, fallen into a general state of disrepair, much of the operating equipment being obsolete and ill-fitted to meet modern transport needs; no locomotives had been built since 1937 and no coaches since 1939; the number of wagons built had been far short of requirements and the permanent way had been neglected.  In addition to these physical disabilities the board were faced with the ever-growing competition from road transport which threatened the very existence of the railways.  The task before the board of rebuilding the railway system to meet modern requirements was indeed an unenviable one which required a high degree of enterprise, foresight and courage for its accomplishment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The board applied themselves with <Col N="602" /> vigour to the task before them.  Having carefully surveyed the over-all position the board came to the conclusion that nothing less than a complete renewal of the rail operating equipment would save the undertaking from total collapse, and that the undertaking could only be put on an economic footing by an almost complete change-over from system to diesel traction.  The wisdom of the board in plumping for diesel traction has perhaps been nowhere more clearly illustrated than in the recent decision of the British Transport Commission to change over to diesel traction in the very home of coal.</P>
    <P>As a first step towards the rehabilitation of the undertaking the board prepared a programme of capital works in May, 1952, costing £2,500,000 which have already been largely carried out. Included in this programme were a number of diesel railcars which since their introduction have proved their worth both in their contribution towards the financial improvement of the board and in their appeal to the travelling public.</P>
    <P>In 1953 the former Government approved of a ten-year dieselisation and reorganisation programme drawn up by the board, which involved an almost complete change-over to diesel traction, the renewal of a considerable proportion of the existing rolling-stock and the improvement of certain stations with a view to a more expeditious and economical handling of merchandise.  The cost of this programme was estimated at £10,650,000. At the same time C.I.E. were authorised to proceed with the development of a suitable type of locomotive capable of burning either turf or oil.  It was proposed that, when a suitable prototype had been developed, 50 of these locomotives should be constructed by C.I.E. at an estimated cost of £1,000,000.  In addition to these capital programmes, expenditure of the order of about £250,000 per annum will arise on the provision of capital additions required for the normal development of the undertaking.</P>
    <P>Under the Transport Act of 1950 the capital borrowing power of C.I.E. is at <Col N="603" /> present limited to £7,000,000.  A stock issue of £2,500,000 was made in 1953 to finance the programme of capital works drawn up in May, 1952.  A further issue of stock for £4,500,000 to finance part of the dieselisation and reorganisation programme was made in April, 1955, thus exhausting the board's existing borrowing power.  To enable the board to finance their capital development over the next three or four years it is proposed to increase their capital borrowing powers from £7,000,000 to £12,000,000 and provision is made to this effect in Section 2 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, the financial position of C.I.E. has already shown a considerable improvement due largely to the introduction of diesel rail cars to the system.  The board expect as a result of the more complete change to diesel traction and the general reorganisation programme to be in a position within a few years to meet all revenue charges other than interest on transport stock.  They hope to reach a position of complete solvency within a few further years.</P>
    <P>In view of the improvement expected in the board's finances the payment of subsidy by the State, which had come to be regarded by many as an inevitable feature of our public transport system, has now been discontinued and it is proposed that any losses which the board might incur within the next few years should be met by short-term borrowing which may be guaranted as necessary by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>The existing statutory limit on temporary borrowing by the board is £1,000,000 and the amount which may be guaranteed by the Minister for Finance is limited to £500,000.  Section 2 of the Bill provides that the board may borrow up to a maximum of £1,500,000 on a short-term basis and Section 3 provides that the Minister for Finance may guarantee such borrowing up to a limit of £1,000,000.</P>
    <P>The prospect of a modern, efficient and self-supporting transport undertaking will be welcomed by all sections of the community.  It will be particularly welcomed by the railway employees. <Col N="604" /> Their position in the tottering organisation of C.I.E. in the past has not been an enviable one.  Over a number of years the collapse of the railway system had been averted only by the substantial contributions of the taxpayers.  The recurring deficits of the concern could only have meant for the railway worker growing insecurity and instability of employment.  The reorganisation of the system should in time bring about that secure and stable employment which can only be provided by a self-supporting concern. The main economy to be secured from diesel traction is in fuel costs but there is also some reduction in staff requirements.</P>
    <P>I have had discussions with representatives of both sides of the industry in this matter and I have made it clear that the redundancy involved should be kept to a minimum and that the problem should be approached with the utmost humanity.  I have been assured by the board that everything possible will be done to minimise the problem and to provide redundant workers with alternative employment.  The board expect that a number of redundant employees will be absorbed on the construction of the turf/oil locomotives and on the carriage and wagon programme which are part of the reorganisation scheme.  I have every hope that between new work and normal wastage most of the redundant men can be absorbed.  This would be conditional however, on the men accepting the alternative employment provided by the board which in some cases may involve a complete change of duties.</P>
    <P>Some cases may arise where the board are unable to offer any alternative employment to a redundant employee or where the conditions of the alternative employment are worse than those ordinarily attaching to that kind of employment.  Section 4 of the Bill provides for the payment of compensation in such cases to permanent employees or to any employees with three years' continuous service with the board.</P>
    <P>On the 30th November, 1949, the Dáil authorised the payment to C.I.E. (1945) of a repayable advance for capital expenditure amounting to <Col N="605" /> £2,462,369.  In view of the financial difficulties which the present board have been obliged to meet since their establishment in 1950 there has been no repayment of principal or payment of interest on this advance.  While the efforts of the board have resulted in a substantial improvement in the financial position of the undertaking there seems to be little prospect that they will be in a position to discharge this liability in the foreseeable future.  The Government have decided that in order to assist the board in their efforts to achieve solvency they should now be relieved of this burden of debt. Section 5 of the Bill provides that the advance in question should now be treated as a non-repayable grant.</P>
    <P>The provisions of Sections 6 to 8 of the Bill are of minor importance.  They are designed to remove some legal difficulties and anomalies which have emerged in the course of the operation of the existing legislation governing the abandonment of railway lines on which all services have been terminated. I do not propose to deal with them in detail now but if there are any matters which Deputies may wish to raise in regard to these sections they can be discussed on the Committee Stage of the Bill.</P>
    <P>In recommending this Bill to the House I am sure that every Deputy will wish to facilitate the recovery now being made by our national transport system.  As I have said the primary function of the Bill is to enable C.I.E. to proceed with their capital programme which, I am confident, will lead to an efficient self-supporting public transport system so vital to our agricultural, industrial, commercial and tourist needs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is identical, in all respects except one, with the draft Bill which was available in the Department before I ceased to be Minister for Industry and Commerce.  That one point of difference is, however, of very great importance.  The draft Bill which I prepared provided for raising the amount of money that might be borrowed by the Board for capital purposes to £15,000,000.  This Bill raises it only to £12,000,000.  Unless there has <Col N="606" /> been some very substantial alteration in the board's capital development programme, £12,000,000 total on capital borrowings does not provide enough and the board will require further legislation to raise the limit to £15,000,000 or to something a little short of £15,000,000 before that programme can be completed.  From the figures that were used by the Minister it did not seem that there has been any change in the board's capital needs or in the dimensions of the programme upon which it has embarked.  If there has been any substantial change, I think the nature of the change should be specifically pointed out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no change in principle.  The object is merely to come back to the House with the idea of giving the House a chance of reviewing this matter when the £12,000,000 is exhausted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not a very convincing reason, because the difference between the amount fixed and the amount required to finance the full capital programme is comparatively small and I cannot see any sense in putting the board in that position&mdash; that they cannot plan with the knowledge that the capital necessary will be available to them as they require it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The full cost of the programme which was prepared by the board and approved by the Government of which I was a member and apparently approved by the present Government involved the board in new outlay amounting to £11,650,000 assuming they got in about £500,000 in respect of the resale scrap value of their obsolete stock.  Over and above that, I understood the Minister to say that the board would require during the next year or two about £250,000 to meet normal capital expenditure not associated with this programme at all.  Upon that basis the limit of the board's requirements would be about £14,300,000, and eventually if the board carries through that programme in full the limit will have to be raised to something around that figure.  I proposed to fix the limit at £15,000,000.  I think it is not unlikely that during the next <Col N="607" /> two or three years when this programme is being put into effect costs may rise and the board may find that its estimates for some of these expenditures&mdash;prepared as they were in 1953&mdash; are on the low side.  Indeed, some of them are little more than intelligent guesses at the present time.  The board has placed the order for the diesel electric locomotives and the cost of these locomotives is now known.  I cannot say from memory whether the contract with Metropolitan Vickers contains any price variation clause.  If it does, and if the supplier is entitled to increase the price if the costs of steel or labour&mdash;which are the usual variants in English contracts of this kind&mdash;increase, then it is almost certain, knowing as we do, that labour and materials costs in Britain are rising, that the board will have to pay more than the £4,750,000 which was specified when the contract was signed.</P>
    <P>The estimate that the 50 locomotives designed to burn either turf or oil will cost £1,000,000 is little more than, as I said, an intelligent guess.  The board's works engineers were asked to give a figure which would roughly indicate what one of these locomotives would cost to manufacture.  In fact, I do not think the final protoype has been approved yet and consequently they could have submitted to the board nothing in the nature of a firm estimate of the cost.  I think that is very largely true also in respect of the work that is to be done on the provision of new carriages and wagons.  Their estimate for that was £5,500,000 and that expenditure is to be spread over five years.  Costs are likely to vary considerably during that period.  Again, the board's staff in the Inchicore works and other places where these vehicles are built gave what was, no doubt, a very intelligent and reasonable figure but I am quite certain they would not regard themselves as bound to it and under obligation to do the work within that limit.</P>
    <P>I can see no sense, therefore, in changing this Bill for the purpose of reducing by £3,000,000 the limit placed upon the board's capital borrowings. If the board is to be told that the programme <Col N="608" /> is approved it should have the evidence of that approval by the enactment of legislation by the Dáil providing ample capital resources to carry it through.</P>
    <P>There are a few other points in connection with the programme to which I think the Minister should make reference.  When the decision to change over to diesel electric traction was taken and approved by the Government of the day we were naturally concerned about the intended departure from the practice in which the locomotives used by C.I.E. were completely constructed in their own workshops. It is true that the great majority of the locomotives in use were very old, and, indeed, the steam locomotive must now be considered an obsolete engine. but the change is likely to have consequences which we should try to minimise.  An examination was made as to the possibility of doing any substantial degree of manufacture on diesel electric locomotives and it was decided that that, generally speaking was not practicable.  But we did decide that the replacement parts for these diesel electric locomotives should be manufactured by C.I.E. and C.I.E. was instructed to plan its general operations on the basis of manufacturing in its own workshops replacement parts for these locomotives; and the contract with Metropolitan Vickers, Limited, obliges them to provide the board with complete working drawings and all similar facilities to enable them to do that manufacturing.  I think it would be a reassurance to the workers employed in the board's works if they are told that that is still the intention and that whatever case may be made for the initial purchase of new equipment abroad, the aim is to continue to operate the policy of manufacturing, as far as is technically possible, all the parts required for its operation.</P>
    <P>They had included in the original programme&mdash;apart from the diesel electric locomotives to be supplied by Metropolitan Vickers&mdash;provision for 19 diesel hydraulic locomotives to be supplied, I believe, by a firm in Germany, and in relation to these 19 diesel hydraulic locomotives the decision was that only the engines and transmissions were to be imported and the <Col N="609" /> locomotives were to be built in Inchicore. Again, I would like to have an assurance from the Minister that that intention is unchanged.</P>
    <P>It would be useful, I think, at this stage if he told us what precisely is the position regarding the 50 turf-oil locomotives, these locomotives which are to be designed to burn oil and to be operated on oil during normal times but which are capable of being operated on turf fuel in times of emergency when oil supplies might not be available to us.  The board has spent a long time experimenting on a suitable design for that locomotive.  They did, I think, get a locomotive built which appeared to operate satisfactorily but then, so far as I know, certain changes in design were decided upon.</P>
    <P>Admittedly, £1,000,000 is a substantial sum to lay out on what is really an insurance scheme, but it is not too much when one recollects the immense difficulties with which we were faced in this country during the last war when rail transport had to be very sharply curtailed because of inability to get adequate supplies of imported fuel.  It was not possible then to operate the railways upon any fuel available from home sources.  With the main part of the railway system operating by diesel electric traction we will be completely dependent on the import of diesel oil for it and it is essential that we should have available some locomotives capable of operating upon fuel derived from internal sources.  Fifty such locomotives are a small number but the practicability of so designing locomotives that they can be economically operated continuously on oil, when there is no difficulty in importing oil, makes that outlay justifiable because it is not merely a matter of building 50 locomotives and putting them into cotton wool against a possible emergency; it is a matter of building 50 locomotives which will be in daily use, like all the other locomotives of the board, but which will be capable of being adapted for use with turf should any situation arise outside the country which would interrupt, whether for a short or a long period, the importation of fuel oil.</P>
    <P>I never felt that the board's engineers <Col N="610" /> were putting the drive into the development of that type of locomotive which they would have done if the prospect of another international emergency was closer at hand; and, with the improvement in international conditions, any drive there was seemed to diminish.  But I am quite certain they should, by this, have produced a suitable prototype and should now be in a position to plan steady production of these locomotives.</P>
    <P>Again, that prospect of substantial activity in the board's works on the manufacture of these locomotives, involving, as it probably does, the full utilisation of its capacity to produce locomotives for some years to come, will be an assurance to the skilled workers which the board employs in that activity.  The need for substantial capital outlay upon new carriages and wagons is, I think, obvious.  The programme involves replacing one-half of the existing carriages and 25 per cent. of the existing wagons.  A high proportion of the wagons and carriages are completely obsolete and are extraordinarily expensive to maintain.  The production of new carriages and wagons through that capital expenditure will substantially reduce operating costs and similar economies, I understand, are likely to be derived from the improvements contemplated through capital expenditure on the goods depots at Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Sligo, Ballina and perhaps some other centres.</P>
    <P>As the Minister indicated in his speech one of the most important matters that arises in connection with this Bill is the effect of these developments upon the board's employees and, in particular, on the issue as to how any resulting redundancy will be dealt with.  Of the annual saving to the board of something over £1,500,000, which it is assumed will come from this capital expenditure, £1,000,000 will, as the Minister said, represent a saving in fuel costs, and that is a real saving in every sense of the term, and the other £500,000 will result from the reduced expenditure upon maintenance activities&mdash;that is, the maintenance of rolling stock.</P>
    <P>There is some suggestion that the <Col N="611" /> reduced expenditure on maintenance is attributable to the purchase of diesel electric locomotives.  That is completely wrong.  If the board purchased an equivalent number of new steam locomotives there would be a similar saving upon maintenance.  The saving arises from the fact that the board will have new equipment instead of old, obsolete and defective equipment. Apart from a saving on maintenance and the possible effect of that saving upon employment in the board's works there is the fact that diesel electric locomotives require fewer workers in their operation.  The board estimated that some 40 per cent. of its employees in the operative grades would, in course of time, become redundant under this programme and about 20 per cent.  of the employees in its workshops. Now that is a substantial number of people to have classified as redundant, but the problem is not nearly as serious as those figures would suggest because the normal wastage from the board's employment, the number of people who leave the board's employment for one reason or another during the year, averages about 600 so that in a couple of years normal wastage alone would take care of that redundancy problem provided there was free transferability of employees within the board's system.</P>
    <P>The difficulty arising from these changes is not attributable to the fact that the total number of the employees of the board will be reduced. That is not a problem at all because normal wastage will take care of that and nobody will have to be disemployed for that reason.  The difficulty arises from the fact that there are so many sections of workers in the board's service and a number of different trade unions catering for them, all of which have little restrictions of their own upon the admission of new members or the transferability of members from one type of employment to another.  I was interested to hear that the Minister has had discussions with the unions representing these workers because it seems to me that their co-operation will be required if this redundancy problem is to be handled without any hardship.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="612" /> Under the system of employment and under the agreements made by the board with the trade unions in respect of different classes of their employees, it is the practice to deal with redundancy on the basis of &ldquo;last in, first out&rdquo;, and that means that if any number of workers are regarded as redundant it is the newcomers who are so classified; that is to say, the younger men.  It seems to me that in the case of the younger men, those who have most recently entered the board's service, it is far preferable to offer them employment of any kind within the board's service rather than offer them a system of compensation by way of small pension.  If the problem of redundancy had to be dealt with by pensioning off some of the board's staff, it is clearly those at the other end of the scale, those who are near the retirement age, who should be kept in mind.  But the agreements to which I have referred preclude that.  It is the younger men, the last in, who have to be dealt with.  I imagine they themselves and those responsible for policy in that regard would agree that the better system is to offer alternative employment.  The Bill provides that the board is obliged to offer alternative employment to any person who becomes redundant within the meaning of the term as used in the Bill and is not obliged to pay compensation unless the conditions of the new employment offered are worse than those ordinarily attaching to such employment.</P>
    <P>That is the provision which I contemplated making and I think the Minister was wise in proposing a similar section here.  It may be that some problems will have to be solved there.  The complexity of the trade union situation is very considerable.  If the Minister met the trade union representatives catering for the C.I.E. staffs he had a mass meeting, as I think I said once before here, because there are more than 30 unions involved and it is not always easy to get complete agreement on a scheme when so many people have to concur.  But I would certainly urge on everybody concerned, the board, the trade unions and all those who can influence the course of events in this regard that it <Col N="613" /> is far better to take these younger men and new entrants who would normally be dispensed with if redundancy had to be met in that way and to give them alternative employment and that for the time being any practices, regulations or restrictions affecting employment in the company's organisation should be modified so that the problem can be met in that way.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his remarks rather suggested that even with all that being done, even with complete co-operation and goodwill in securing for those who are redundant in any part of the company's services new employment in some other part, some redundancy would still be left.  I was rather surprised to hear that because when I discussed the matter with the representatives of the board in 1953 their advice to me was that provided they were able to handle the problem of redundancy by offering employment in other sections of the board's organisation, there would be no redundancy at all and no cost had to be taken into account in respect of compensation under that heading.</P>
    <P>There was also a proposal which had a bearing upon this question being entertained by the board at that time to undertake the manufacture at Inchicore of equipment which was at that time being imported by other State bodies.  The board contended that if they could get the business of manufacturing that equipment it would absorb a very substantial proportion of the redundant maintenance workers.  I did not anticipate that there would be any difficulty in making arrangements to have that done provided the board were able to demonstrate their capacity to undertake the manufacture of that equipment efficiently at Inchicore.</P>
    <P>As the Minister said, the other sections of the Bill are not very important.  They deal only with certain modifications of existing law required to enable the board to abandon completely the railway lines on which they have ceased to operate services. I think certain defects in the law has shown up from experience in that regard.  As I said, the Bill is in all respects similar to that which I had <Col N="614" /> been prepared to introduce myself except in that one respect, the limit on capital advances, and that is a matter at which I think the Minister should have another look.  I feel quite certain that there is wisdom in telling the board through the legislation that the capital reorganisation scheme has been approved in full and that the Dáil has given the authority to go ahead and raise the full amount of capital required for that purpose.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to say very much about this Bill but I want to join issue with Deputy Lemass in the last recommendation he made to the Minister.  Deputy Lemass has told the House&mdash;I take his word for it&mdash;that this Bill was in draft form when he left office and that it was a Bill such as would have been introduced by himself, if he were still Minister for Industry and Commerce, with the one difference that if he were there he would say to the board straight away: &ldquo;Go ahead.  You have the sanction of the legislature to borrow up to £15,000,000 and plan on that basis,&rdquo; whereas the present Minister has put the ceiling for the moment at any rate at £12,000,000.  In reply to Deputy Lemass the Minister indicated that that was done deliberately for the purpose of enabling this House to review the position when the borrowing to the extent of the £12,000,000 authorised had been made.  That seems to me to be a very sensible provision.</P>

      <P>Let me develop the point.  The Deputy was Minister for 19 or 20 years and I think in the Department which he administered, he probably ensured that periodically, whether weekly, monthly or annually, he received progress reports as to what was going on.  I think it is an excellent idea that this House should get the opportunity of examining the progress of the work that is being done, seeing exactly what is happening.  Every one of us knows, whether we have great experience or <Col N="615" /> not, that the easiest way to waste money is to open the coffers and say: &ldquo;Take what you like.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>No one who gets an invitation like that is going to show any sense of reason or economy in the application of the money.  I do not want to be taken as suggesting that the people who are in charge of C.I.E. at the moment are going to enter into a plan of development in any reckless spirit such as that but I do believe that it is a common-sense precaution for the Minister to take to indicate, as he has indicated, that he is not necessarily going to limit the amount which will be payable to the £12,000,000 but that he will give this House an opportunity of taking another look at the position.</P>

      <P>Deputy Lemass knows that we have been taking a look at C.I.E. for a great number of years now and another look will not do any of us any harm.  I am very sorry that this particular Bill is limited, as it is, to dealing with the railway services. I would welcome an opportunity of dealing with C.I.E. bus services.  We will not get the opportunity on this Bill and I hope we will get it on another Bill.  There are a number of Deputies, particularly Deputies from rural areas, who will be anxious to get an opportunity of speaking here in regard to railway development, the progress in replanning our railway system and the results of the change-over from steam to diesel traction.  It is reasonable that they should get that opportunity. Deputy Lemass has spent most of his parliamentary life on this side of the House telling Deputies who put down questions that this, that or the other is no function of his, that it is a matter for the board of C.I.E., that it is a matter for the E.S.B. or someone else.  Most Deputies, while they appreciate that that is in fact the position, feel that the position has been created by the legislation passed in <Col N="616" /> this House and that something in the nature of a rein or a check should be kept on it, that Deputies should be given an opportunity every now and again of discussing these monopolies which have been set up by the Oireachtas and seeing what is going on.  The point made by Deputy Lemass, I gather, is that if the development plan as laid down is worked out, a particular sum of money is required to complete it and that it is a tidier operation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;of discussing the position again.  That is reasonable and I think it is a very sensible move for the Minister to make.  That, I gather, is Deputy Lemass's only objection to the Bill which the Minister has introduced&mdash;that his idea has been varied to the extent of deleting £15,000,000 and inserting £12,000,000. The Minister has given his reason for that and Deputy Lemass disagrees with the reason given.  He said he did <Col N="617" /> not think it was a convincing reason and I think I am correct in saying that that is the only point on which Deputy Lemass disagrees with the Minister.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister's view is a sound one.  I am expressing my personal opinion on that.  I imagine that if there are stronger reasons than those I see, the Minister will be prepared to give them to Deputy Lemass.  I mention the point only because I was following on the last few sentences of Deputy Lemass's contribution.</P>
      <P>I want to say on the Bill that, so far as the transport workers who are affected are concerned, the question of redundancy is a real danger to them. Deputy Lemass seemed to indicate that, from his discussions with C.I.E., the normal wastage which would take place annually in a concern the size of C.I.E. would obviate anything in the nature of redundancy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In total numbers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>He pointed out very soundly that the type of redundancy that will be created by a change-over from steam engines to diesel engines is redundancy in particular sections rather than what might be called general redundancy; in other words, that the normal wastage would take care of anything in the nature of what I am describing as general redundancy, by which I mean a reduction in the number of people whom it is necessary to employ in C.I.E.; but that there would be a real redundancy in, if you like, specialist positions where workers have been trained and have for many years worked in the sections dealing with steam locomotion and who now find that the particular section is to become redundant.  I know, because in the particular constituency I represent there are very many C.I.E. workers, that they feel this to be a very real danger, and while I think they will welcome the words of the Minister and Deputy Lemass and the assurance of the board that everything will be done to keep them in employment, at the same time, I feel that it is only right that as many Deputies as possible should urge very strongly on the Minister that he would keep constantly <Col N="618" /> under consideration and constantly attend to this question of redundancy, and, in particular, the question of redundancy in these specialised or sectional works and departments.</P>
      <P>I think I would be merely expressing a view on which there would be general agreement when I say that I hope the day has come when this question of public transport can no longer be considered as a political question, a matter subject to political controversy.  There is no doubt that, from the point of view of the travelling public of this country, the railways of the country have been falling into a state of very sad disrepair, and I think that, by and large, the travelling public and the business and commercial sections of the community who require rail transport will welcome the effort of any Minister for Industry and Commerce who co-operates with the board of C.I.E. in endeavouring to remedy that position.  All of us will join with the Minister in saying that we hope the day is not too far away when we will have an up-to-date, modern and adequate railway system in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFlynn" hpid="Mr. J. Flynn Mr. J. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the efforts being made by the Minister in this matter, but I should like to refer to his statement about the danger of redundancy.  I submit that he is rather optimistic in his statement that no redundancy, or very little redundancy, will take place.  So far as I can learn from C.I.E. workers in my constituency the approach of the board to this question is not very sympathetic.  I may put it that way.  Take the case of firemen and cleaners and such men who have been engaged in that class of work for a number of years.  When this adjustment takes place and if the board decides to offer a certain type of work to a man who has been trained and who has given service in a special category, he will be totally unfitted for that work and the result will be displacement or unemployment.  That is the point which has been put by the C.I.E. workers' union to the board and, so far as I can learn, the board are not very favourable.  Their approach, to use the words of the <Col N="619" /> chairman in reply to some of these representations, is: &ldquo;Any type of alternative employment.&rdquo;  That is the problem to which I should like to refer the Minister who I know will be sympathetic, and, as a trade unionist himself, will see that these men get justice.</P>
      <P>That is why I referred to this matter at all.  Because there is a danger that the board, in their zeal to bring forward some great development or very modern scheme, may do so to the disadvantage of these workers who will then have no alternative but to emigrate. They are in a special category as I have stated.  It should not be the attitude of the board to say: &ldquo;Take it or leave it, we have nothing else to offer to you.&rdquo;  I hope the Minister will see to it that there will be no danger of these men being treated improperly and that he will use his best endeavour to intimate to the board that the Government will not stand for such treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>We all realise that in these modern up-to-date times there must be modernisation and it is only natural that the railway industry should come into line in that respect. However, there is a great danger, I am afraid, that the progress that will be made as a result of the dieselisation of the railway industry may be offset by redundancy.  If that should happen it would be a very retrograde step.  In that respect I am glad to know that the Minister has given an assurance that, as far as he possibly can do it, there will be as little redundancy as possible.  The danger is there, never-the less, and I trust that when there is any actual danger the Minister will have conferences between the C.I.E. officials and the trade union officials so that they may arrive at amicable and mutually acceptable decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to compensation to redundant workmen, I would suggest that the figure would have to be very big indeed to be effective.  We can recall, some time ago, at Greenore, County Louth, when some of the employees of the L.M.S., which was run by the Great Northern, were disemployed, <Col N="620" /> they were compensated to some extent but they still had to emigrate.  The amount of compensation was not sufficient.  We could not offer them a sufficient amount to keep them for the remainder of their lives and we would then have a greater evil still in adding to the annual rate of emigration.</P>
    <P>With regard to the possible effect of the dieselisation programme in Inchicore and Dundalk, I would imagine that if there was an effort made to set up a heavy industry it would, in some way, offset the redundancy in these railway workshops.  You would not need much extra machinery to engage in such heavy industry because the plant would be available.  I think that is a point well worth considering.</P>
    <P>This Bill refers to C.I.E., but I do not think it would be amiss if I could get from the Minister an assurance that this threat of redundancy will not be applicable in any great degree to the Dundalk workshops of the G.N.R.</P>

      <P>I would like to mention that point, anyway.  I was glad to hear that the Minister expressed the hope that any branch lines that may be in danger will not be closed until the tests at present being carried out have been examined.  He has stated that they are now being run by light diesel engines and that there will be no danger of any sudden closing until the result of these tests have been examined.  The main problem to be considered is the question of redundancy and I am sure that the Minister is doing his best to ensure that as little redundancy as possible will result from his dieselisation programme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Mr. Lemass raised a number of points in connection with this Bill but I think there is not much difference between his and our approach to the solution of the problems except the issue as to the finances of the board.  In 1953 the then Government approved of a ten year dieselition reorganisation programme which had been drawn up by the board and <Col N="621" /> the assumption is that it will take the best part of ten years from 1953 to complete that programme.  It is an immense programme being undertaken by the board which has itself to place contracts for rolling stock and other equipment and has got to take its place in the queue.  The 1953 programme, as it was then prepared by the board, was one which it was estimated would take a considerable amount of money.  It may take more now because costs are rising and the 1953 estimates may not reflect costs in the times in which we now live.</P>
      <P>My examination of the financial position of the board in relation to its programme has indicated that the board has so far issued stock to the amount of £2,500,000 in 1953 and £4,500,000 in 1955, making the total of £7,000,000.  That is its capital limit under the 1950 Act and the proposal is to give the board authority to raise another £5,000,000.  My estimate is that it will take three years at least, and very likely four years, before the board will spend the £12,000,000 now being made available to it.</P>
      <P>In other words the board have in sight a spending period of £12,000,000 which is not a bad length of rope to give them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely it is not a question of time.  May I put this to the Minister: if the board are planning to produce a certain number of wagons or locomotives, have they not got to plan for the whole operation?  They cannot operate on a basis that they might have to stop suddenly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>My experience of the board&mdash;and I am sure it is the experience of Deputy Lemass as well&mdash; is that it sets more wolves than any other normal board and from the point of view of coming to me and making complaints I can assure the House that I do not suffer any loneliness.  They always tell me of the number of rocks they see ahead and of how quickly they can get sturdy lifeboats to save them. While we may disagree on that specific point I think there is common ground between us in this Bill.  It is true that C.I.E. were directed to see if they could make as many diesel parts as possible at their headquarters here and I have spoken to C.I.E. on that matter. I am bound to say to Deputy Lemass that when the decision to direct them to do that was taken, C.I.E. did not feel there was adequate consultation with them.  They made approaches to the firm supplying them with diesel engines and the firm in question has undertaken to make its designs and blueprints freely available for the purpose of making parts here or for arranging for the manufacture of any replacements necessary here.  This is a firm of international experience, a firm with very high reputation and, relying on their technical knowledge of diesel engines and rail parts, they feel it will be completely uneconomical for C.I.E. to try to make these rail replacement parts unless they are prepared to face up to paying for the parts they require substantially more than the parts could be got for in the place where the parts and engine are manufactured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point made against the proposal is that the whole purpose of dieselisation is to give the railways a sound railway engine, a piece of mechanical equipment which is recognised internationally for its sturdiness and durability.  The replacement of parts is not something likely to occur with rapidity.  The view of the makers, and the view now expressed by C.I.E. is that they hope they will rarely need parts and that such parts would not be needed in such volume or as frequently <Col N="624" /> as would necessitate the setting up of a replacement section for diesel parts.</P>
    <P>I notice that Deputy Lemass used one phrase in the course of his discourse: &ldquo;As far as it was technically possible, C.I.E. should be asked to do so and so.&rdquo;  I take it that the Deputy also takes the view that such developments should be looked at realistically; that he would agree that if, say, the making of parts would involve too abnormal an expenditure, or that you could buy quicker and cheaper elsewhere the necessary parts, C.I.E. should not be asked to commit themselves to uneconomic expenditure of this kind.  On the general question of C.I.E.  I have suggested to them that their works at Inchicore are equipped for the making of parts not only for themselves but for other State-sponsored bodies which, at the moment, have to import these parts.  I have asked them especially to go after these State-sponsored bodies and see if they could arrange with these bodies who require such goods which they now import to have these goods manufactured by C.I.E. for them.  In that way we are hoping to retain within the country manufacturing capacity which is at present going on outside the country.  I know C.I.E. have discussed this question with some of these bodies and I hope further discussions will enable them to carry on this work of manufacture in their workshop at Inchicore.</P>
    <P>I suggested to C.I.E. that in present circumstances in Great Britain, where the railway company has decided to embark upon a dieselisation and railway reorganisation proposal costing £1,200,000,000, C.I.E. might see whether, in the circumstances operating in Great Britain, and in view of possible redundancies here, they could not get some of that work here in order to keep our people in employment and in order to add to C.I.E. finances to some extent.  I know that matter is under consideration by C.I.E. with a view to ascertaining what they can get in that field.  On the question of locomotives capable of burning oil and turf, I have been pressing C.I.E. to get on with that work and to complete it as soon as possible <Col N="625" /> In fact, with a view to ensuring that the board was in no doubt as to my desire to have this matter brought to finality with the minimum delay, I have asked the board to let me have a monthly report on the progress that is being made in the construction of the locomotives, and I think I must offer that as evidence to Deputy Lemass that in this matter I have been alert in trying to impress on the board the desirability of completing the programme which was assigned to them in that field with the minimum delay.</P>
    <P>The only other question raised I think was the question of redundancy. This is a problem which at first looked as if it would provide some very acute difficulties, but I think the problem is less serious now.  I saw the railway trade unions and I saw the railway company and I told them that this problem of redundancy on the railway, particularly if it was likely to be a problem which was widespread, would cause me quite considerable concern, and that I was most anxious that it should be dealt with in a way which would indicate complete understanding of the human needs of the people whose future and whose destiny we were dealing with.  I told C.I.E. that I thought in the first instance they should put all their cards on the table and tell the railway trade unions what the extent of the problem was, and having done that, they should invite the co-operation of the trade unions in finding a solution.  These discussions took place and I urged the unions to co-operate with the company so as to make a genuine contribution to the solution of the difficulty which would mean for the company smooth and efficient operation and for the trade unions and their members that their economic security had been safeguarded.</P>
    <P>I went further and I suggested that when the broad problem had been discussed by the unions and the company, a small committee should be set up to deal with redundancy problems as they arose from time to time.  I urged that C.I.E., while giving the unions information as to the full extent of the problem to be dealt with, should themselves so arrange matters that the <Col N="626" /> whole problem of redundancy would be dealt with in a progressive way and that nobody was to be brought up against a crisis of large-scale dismissals or anything of that nature.  I told C.I.E.: &ldquo;You have to filter out this problem in small doses and let C.I.E. see what contribution they can make to finding a solution.&rdquo;  I said it would be a disastrous failure from the point of view of the company's working, and horrifying in its consequences on the workers if we were faced with any announcement of large-scale dismissals due to redundancy on the C.I.E. system.</P>
    <P>I think these discussions have gone well, or at least have gone as well as one would expect, having regard to the problems to be dealt with, and I hope that the company can so arrange matters that by wastage of staff it would be possible to avoid any redundancy whatever.  I do not think it will be possible to keep all the people in the jobs which they have at present. It will probably be necessary to move a man from one job to another, but if that movement takes place the man will not suffer financially if we provide him with alternative employment of a character which will give him his wages.  I think we are meeting the problem in as broad and humane a way as possible.  I cannot accept Deputy Flynn's view of the problem at all&mdash;that you must keep a man in a particular job and if he is moved out of that job he has to emigrate. I think that is a horrible libel on the utility and versatility of Irish railway workers.  I can see no difficulty in a man leaving one job and taking up another job.  From his own point of view he might even have a better outlook and a better outlet, but to suggest that a man moved out of a particular job would have to emigrate to a country where very probably he would not get the same job as he left, and where, in any case, he would have to take up another job, is not a realistic approach at all.</P>
    <P>I am not insensible to the fact that the trade unions may be a bit difficult on this issue of a man being removed from one job to another, but I would say to them that this is an issue in <Col N="627" /> which a sense of protocol should not be allowed to obscure the facts and that no sense of punctilio should prevent the unions and C.I.E. from getting down to finding a sensible solution. I think if we can guarantee men alternative jobs at wages appropriate to these jobs&mdash;and I would hope at wages that would be not less than the wages in the jobs they left&mdash;we would make a significant contribution to solving redundancy.  I should hate to see an able-bodied man rendered redundant and sent out with a relatively small pension either to rot on that or try to find employment elsewhere in this country or outside it, when the solution of this difficulty could have been found by the man taking another job in the company in which he had so many years' service.</P>
    <P>My aim will be to avoid redundancy entirely.  I have done, and I shall continue to do, my best with the company to ensure that the problem is dealt with in the most sympathetic way possible.  If the unions make a contribution by a sensible approach to the problem on the lines I have indicated I hope it will be possible to avoid any redundancy and the dismissal of any person, certainly dismissal through redundancy of any person who is a permanent employee of the company.  It may be necessary, as Deputy Lemass said&mdash;and I have mentioned this already to the board&mdash;that in order to avoid redundancy we should deal with the problem at the top, because of the beneficial reactions of tackling the problem at that end when a solution might not be available at the other end.  It might be desirable if you had a grade where you could tempt men&mdash;I say tempt, not drive or force them&mdash;to go out on pension when they were near the retiring age by giving them certain pensions earlier or giving them a higher rate if they went out at that time, to try to find a solution for redundancy in that way.</P>
    <P>These are matters which I have no doubt will occur to the versatile minds of the management and the similarly-constructed minds of union officials who will be negotiating with the company on these matters, and I must leave it to them to tease out the <Col N="628" /> problem and endeavour to find a solution.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I want to say to the House that I am glad to have the support which has been expressed for the desire that this problem of redundancy should be dealt with in a very human way.  In any subsequent discussions which I have with C.I.E. in this respect I shall make it clear to them that the views which I have expressed and which I still hold are not merely my own views but the views expressed in this House in discussing this problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to delay the House to-night.  I dealt last <Col N="629" /> week in great detail with the various aspects of the licensing laws and I gave, in so far as I was able, the reasons why I believe it is now essential to amend the licensing code. I am glad the Minister for Defence is here because I am sure he will agree with me when I say that the idea behind my motion in relation to the need for amending the licensing laws was the idea he had in mind when he was a member of the Government in the former inter-Party régime.  At that time there was a motion in the name of Deputy Corry dealing with a certain aspect of the licensing laws and the present Minister for Defence, who was then Minister for Justice, stated here that the Department of Justice &ldquo;were examining and are examining the whole licensing code.&rdquo;  That statement was made on the 17th February, 1949, almost six years ago, and I do not think that I can be described as being unfair to, or taking the present Minister at a disadvantage, in reminding him of his predecessor's remark six years ago.</P>
      <P>One point I would like to have the Minister's opinion on is the number of inquiries that have taken place within the Department of Justice in connection with the administration of this code.  I understand that several years ago when Deputy Boland was Minister for Justice the higher officers of the Garda Síochána were asked for their opinions as to whether or not the code was satisfactory and as to whether or not they considered or would recommend any changes.  My information is that practically 80 per cent. of the higher officers of the Garda Síochána recommended an amendment of the licensing code.  Surely the advice given by men who administer the law is based on years of experience and, if they so advised amending the law, they must have had very sound reasons for doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know if Deputy Boland, the former Minister, will refer to that when he moves his amendment, but I would like the present Minister to comment on it.  The fact that Deputy Boland has seen fit to table this amendment shows that in his opinion there is need for a revision of the licensing <Col N="630" /> code.  It is a serious step for a man of the standing of Deputy Boland to move an amendment which states that he believes a Select Committee should be set up to examine into the operation and administration of the licensing code.  I feel sure Deputy Boland would never have put down that amendment unless he believed there was very grave need for it.</P>
    <P>If the Government and the Minister find that the motion I have drafted is not one that meets with general approval, it is not my intention to try to force it on the members of this House.  I am merely motivated with the idea of having the present licensing laws amended.  It is an important matter and one that will need careful consideration.  As such, I think it would be better for the Government to take over rather than have a private Deputy dealing with the problem.</P>
    <P>If there is any intention of agreeing with the motion, in the spirit or otherwise, or if it is agreed to accept a motion on the lines of Deputy Boland's amendment, I would like to stress that this committee should not be used either as a way out or as an excuse for the Government to dilly dally. We have had painful experience here of fact-finding committees being set up; we all know that one would need a Hoover to take the dust off the reports submitted by these committees. The danger I see in this amendment, therefore, is that the report of such a committee will never see the light of day.  Whatever Government is in power will take the opportunity of saying: &ldquo;Thank goodness, we are safe for another three or four years, anyway; nobody else will bother about these licensing laws and we will put off the evil day.&rdquo;  Deputy Boland's amendment is acceptable to me.  If it is acceptable to the Government I would like to stress that a time limit should be imposed as to when the report should be submitted.</P>
    <P>If we find that a report has been submitted Deputies can then proceed to extract from the Government what their intentions are as to implementation or otherwise.  But we want a definite date fixed by which the report will be submitted.  That should not be <Col N="631" /> very difficult.  It should not take years because if what we were told in 1949 is true, namely, that the Department of Justice was inquiring into this matter, plenty of evidence must be available and the committee will not have to sit for long hours in order to familiarise themselves with the various aspects of the law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to second the motion and, in doing so, I want to suggest to Deputy McQuillan that if this committee is set up he and I will put a time limit to it.  I suggest we give the committee three months to report back and, if they do not, we will bring in another Private Deputy's Bill and try it out.  That will not be any trouble.</P>
      <P>I am glad Deputy McQuillan introduced this motion.  I am also glad that he made it wide enough to give plenty of scope to any committee set up to cover all the ground and investigate every aspect.  We know that the licensing laws at the moment are a joke.  We know the members of the Garda Síochána look on them as a joke. We know that no decent Garda is prepared to enforce them.  I do not know what happened since February, 1949, when the Minister for Defence, Deputy MacEoin, the then Minister for Justice, asked to have this matter left to him.  Apparently the Department of Justice left it as such things are usually left.  Nothing was done anyway until Deputy McQuillan's motion was brought in here to deal with it.  The present licensing laws are derogatory to the Constitution of this State.  I do not pretend to be a lawyer but I have legal opinion to the effect that if those laws were the subject of a decision in the Supreme Court, they would be beaten on the grounds of equal rights for all citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People living in rural districts, unlike other sections of the community, must work on Sundays.  We have not yet invented a six-day cow; cows must be milked on Sunday morning.  A farmer and his family must go out on Sunday morning and feed their cattle and milk them while the city dweller is in bed.  After that <Col N="632" /> they generally go to last Mass.  If they dare go into a public-house they are committing an illegal act and are liable to be fined, unless they travel three miles after doing their morning's work. The city dweller can go to last Mass; even though he is only living across the road from the public-house he can cross over to that public-house and drink and he is legally entitled to do so.  How can we apply the clause with regard to equal rights for all citizens that is enshrined in the Constitution of the State?</P>
    <P>Let me take the description given by the present Minister for Defence as to what was happening in rural Ireland over a period of 20 years.  Speaking in this House on the 16th October, 1942, at column 1442, Volume 88, of the Official Debates, he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;As regards Sunday opening, it is only reasonable that the same law should extend to the whole country. There should be some period on Sunday in which trading would be legalised in the country.  Everybody knows that there is a certain amount of illegitimate trading in every village in which the publican resides on the premises.  The only place where that does not occur is where the publican is non-resident and, when he closes down on Saturday night, does not open until 10 o'clock on Monday morning....</P>
    <P>I heard a publican complain that a sergeant of the Garda was persecuting him&mdash;not prosecuting him.  I knew the sergeant to be a reliable, steady officer.  I thought that it would be no harm, if I met him accidentally, to mention the complaint to him, which I did.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&lsquo;Everybody knows that, on Sunday, I enforce the licensing law until 1 o'clock.  While the <i>bona fide</i> traffic is on from 1 o'clock to 8 o'clock, I do not run into every pub to see who is in it because I know that Paddy and Johnnie, who have been working hard all the week, are getting a pint.  I am not going to follow those people.  When the dance hall opens at 8 o'clock and when a bunch of brats come, <Col N="633" /> armed with poteen, take a few glasses, distribute the rest, and then go down to a pub and get a couple of pints to throw on top of it, which sets them mad&mdash;these people I will prosecute and persecute so far as lies in my power.&rsquo;</P>
    <P>I said: &lsquo;Good luck to you.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a statement made by the present Minister for Defence on the administration of the licensing laws and that is the actual situation all over the country.  No decent Garda will enforce the licensing laws; no decent Garda has any intention of enforcing them.  Speaking on that matter also the late Deputy Dr. O'Higgins at column 1796, Volume 88 of the Official Debates on 4th November, 1942, stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I would like to see in operation here a set of licensing laws that would have the approval and support of the average citizen, and that would then be ruthlessly carried out by the officers in the service of the State.  What is happening at present and what has happened in the past is this: If the police in town or village are to do their normal job efficiently as policemen, the job of preventing and protecting crime, they have to be on good terms with the public in their area.  The common sense of the Guards and of the ordinary citizen would regard it as unreasonable to have a person, who got into a licensed house on a Sunday and had one drink, taken into custody and brought before the court.  The Guards feel that.  As well as the Guards every reasonable person in that area would say: &lsquo;Ah, could you not have let him for a drink; what is the harm in a man having one drink?&rsquo;</P>
    <P>There is no use in talking about the law, since if that man lived in the city he could drink for three hours on a Sunday afternoon and do that within the law.  People are not fools. They could never see any just case for that differentiation between the country and the city.  The view of the Guards, men of common sense, coincided with that of the average man, and when they saw a man trying <Col N="634" /> to get a drink on a Sunday they just walked the other way.</P>
    <P>If the Minister, by sticking to the present legal position, is under the impression that there is no drinking going on in the country or that there is no drinking going on all over the country on Sunday, then he does not know the country.  Whether or not the Minister legislates to have an opening all over the country for two or three hours on Sunday will not affect, by one bottle of stout, the amount of drink that is consumed in the country on Sunday.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Those are statements made, one by the late Deputy O'Higgins, God rest his soul, and the other by the present Minister for Defence, in this House.</P>
    <P>I do not believe the Minister has changed his mind in respect of that matter.  He is a reasonable man.  He lives in the country and he knows what is happening in the country just as well as I do every Sunday of the year, in places where there is what we will call a hard Garda Sergeant who seeks to enforce this unjust law&mdash;not the decent man the Minister described here.  That sergeant goes to Mass on Sunday and the ordinary working man, after doing his morning's work from 8 o'clock until 11.30, goes to Mass.  Can he hear Mass properly?  His time is spent at the door because the sergeant, being a most respectable man, must go up and sit in a seat.  The sergeant must wait till Mass is over, but when the priest turns around for the sermon, three or four of the men go out the door and over to the pub, where it is: &ldquo;Three pints, Jack.&rdquo;  The three pints are filled and Jack keeps a lookout, saying: &ldquo;Hurry up.&rdquo;  The three pints are swallowed down; they are followed by three more; and the round is finished with three more; and those men leave the public-house drunk.</P>
    <P>In the ordinary way, if that public-house were open, the same as the city public-house is open, those men could walk in decently, sit down and enjoy their pints and have a chat over them. They could have a second one, and, if they had a third one, they would have two hours in which to drink the three pints and none of them will be drunk. I have had that experience for years. <Col N="635" /> In order to supply Deputy McGrath's constituents with hot milk in the evening&mdash;twice a day deliveries&mdash;my people have to milk the cows at two o'clock every Sunday.  I have seen them come up from last Mass within half an hour of the time of their coming out from Mass and they could hardly see the cows, not to mind milk them.</P>
    <P>That is the condition in which this unjust law is at present placing the rural community and there is no denying it.  No man is going to tell me that there would be any excessive drinking in the country, if the public-houses were open as they are open in the city.  There would not be any excessive drinking, and, as a matter of fact, there is this peculiar circumstance, that I have seen the same team of men come out from Mass on a holiday of obligation, when the pubs are open, and walk steadfastly past the pub and go home&mdash;the very same crowd who slip in the back door of the pub on Sunday.  I have seen them do that because they knew they could go home in peace, eat their dinner and do whatever work was required, and then walk down in the evening and have a quiet drink, without interruptions from anybody.</P>
    <P>That is one side of the picture.  Let us take the other side with which Deputy McQuillan also dealt and see what that is.  There is a certain section of the community, mainly in the cities, who stop in the public-house until closing hour and then get into their cars and drive out to the country where, under the existing joke of a law, they are entitled to drink until 12 midnight; but if Jack and Mick and Pat, after a day's threshing, who, if the threshing is late, have worked until nine o'clock or 9.30, are caught in the pub after ten o'clock, they are summoned.  The joker who can stop work at five o'clock or six o'clock and go to the local pub after his tea about seven o'clock can stay there from then until ten o'clock, and then, provided he has nice company with him, can go out and have a few whiskeys and gin-and-its in the country public-house until 12 midnight.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="636" /> That practice is going on and if the Minister has any doubt about it, I invite him to my constituency and I will show it to him there.  I do not think he would have any occasion to travel further than a mile outside the boundaries of this city to see it for himself.  Is that a just law?  Is there anybody opposite who thinks it is a just law?  The Minister for Defence does not think so, from his statement about the sergeant who told him he turned his back at 1 o'clock and was not going to look at any man going into a public-house from that until 8 o'clock on Sunday evening.  Good luck to him.  Why carry out this law?  Is it laziness on the part of the officials of the Department that has held this up for six long years?  When the present Minister for Defence was Minister for Justice, he told us they were dealing with it six years ago.  Is it in the next generation they intend coming into production on this Bill?</P>
    <P>It is a very grave injustice to the ordinary rural citizen and I would not mind if I did not see in this House an exhibition that made me ashamed of the representatives here.  I have here two division lists.  I do not propose to read them, but I advise Deputies to get them and look at them.  Let them look at the division lists of 17th November, 1948 and 17th February, 1949.  Let them look at both.  In my opinion, some of the Deputies ought to crawl out the gate outside and not come back&mdash;the Deputies who sanctimoniously marched into the Lobbies to prevent the rural people from getting a drink on Sunday and who, three months afterward, marched sanctimoniously into the same Lobby to ensure that the city fellow was not deprived of his drink on Sunday.  One law for the city man and another for the country boy fool!</P>
    <P>That was done.  I have it marked out here so that any Deputy who wants to see it may see it.  If there is any of the older Deputies who wants to know where his name is in the roll all he has to do is to go to the Library and look at the two volumes of the Official Reports.  If any Deputy considers that it is unjust or wrong in any way to open the rural public-houses on a Sunday and let a man in the front door who <Col N="637" /> is at present going in the back door, and that is all you are doing, why, then, should you come along three months afterwards and walk into the Lobby in order to see that the city men, who have no work to do on Sunday, and have no work to do from Saturday afternoon at 2 o'clock, may have free leave and licence to walk from their own doors across the road into the public-house and sit down for four hours on a Sunday and drink away within the law?</P>
    <P>Nobody wants that law.  There is not a decent Garda in this State who is prepared to enforce that law except against his will.  Why carry it on? That is, to my mind, a fair picture of what is happening in this country to-day. Those laws were made at a time when most of the people&mdash;the best-off people in this country&mdash;travelled in a trap or side-car.  What is the three-mile limit to-day to a <i>bona fide</i> traveller?  It is only five minutes in a motor-car.  But the ordinary worker in the country has not got a motor-car. The rural worker has not got a motor-car and he has to do his work on a Sunday morning whether he likes it or not.  I see no justice in forcing him to break the law every Sunday of the year, and that is what you are doing.</P>
    <P>I have heard this matter thrashed out by pioneer associations and others. I would like to say this, that the pioneer associations who are anxious that the rural public-houses would not be opened on a Sunday were very silent when it came to an endeavour to close the city ones on Sunday and they remained silent.  Are there members of this House who look on the ordinary rural worker as something that is half savage; something that cannot be trusted; something that is of an inferior nature to ourselves? That must be the opinion of some of the Deputies in this House who walked around the Lobby in the way I have described.  I cannot account for their actions in any other way.</P>

I am not going further on that line and I have no intention of holding up the House.  I have given the case as I see it here and I only want to ensure that if this committee is set up there will be a time limit placed on it; that we will not have the farce that we had on the Milk Costings Commission and the farce that we have had on other committees in this House which were set up from time to time and where there were three or four general elections before we had any report from them.</P>
      <P>A Committee of this House is set up to do work.  We should limit them to a reasonable time and not let them be like the Department of Justice that set out to do a job six years ago and have not completed it yet.

      <P>I move the following amendment:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and to insert:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;a Select Committee consisting of 15 members to be nominated by the Committee of Selection, of whom five shall be a quorum, be appointed with power to send for persons, papers and records, to examine the operation and administration of the present licensing laws, and to consider and report what changes are necessary or desirable therein.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason I am doing it is that I think it is a better way to handle the situation than Deputy McQuillan's motion would have been.  I may be wrong, but I imagine Deputy McQuillan felt pretty certain he was pushing an open door, having taken into consideration the words of the present Minister for Justice in the House here last July.  He may have also taken into consideration the words of the present Minister for Defence when he was in opposition here.  Of course the words of the Minister for Defence, uttered when he was an Opposition Deputy, do not carry the same weight as those of the Minister.  But the present Minister for Justice, when winding up the debate on his Estimate last July dealt with a complaint made by a Deputy on this side that the <Col N="640" /> Guards, particularly the younger Guards, were instructed to raid public-houses. He said that no such instructions had been given and at column 754 of Volume 152 of the Official Report he is reported as having said this:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I know that drinking after hours is against the law, but in the country places there are many more serious things than that.  I see nothing criminal in five or six men sitting in a country public-house at night time after a wet day or talking about the threshing.  They would not spend 10/- in a whole night while there would be £10 spent in a club in Dublin.  I see nothing criminal at all in the instance I have mentioned and I ask the Guards to use their common sense and if they do so we will have a better country and better respect for the law.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I, personally, agree with the sentiments then expressed by the Minister but I think that when a Minister for Justice makes a statement like that he is bound to bring the law into agreement with the practice.</P>
    <P>That is his view; it is my view, and apparently it is the view of the Minister for Defence.  I do not see how the Minister for Justice, having made a statement like that, can avoid bringing in legislation along the lines of such a statement.  For that reason I do not think a very long debate is necessary at all.  Perhaps I was absent from the House at the time, but I do not remember in 1949 the Minister for Defence, then Minister for Justice, saying that the whole licensing code would be looked into.  From 1951 to 1954 I was Minister for Justice and if the licensing laws were being examined by my immediate predecessor I was not told of it.  An examination may have been going on but it would not be like the Department not to tell me what was going on and therefore I shall have to assume that whatever inquiries were going on had finished when I took office.</P>
    <P>When the 1942 Bill was before the House there were two reasons for its introduction, the principal one being that Howth had been brought into the City of Dublin and the licensing laws <Col N="641" /> in relation to it had to be adjusted, because otherwise there might have been abuses of the <i>bona fides</i> regulations. At the time the opposition from the other side of the House and from my own side was so strong that I had to compromise, and instead of allowing the consumption of drink all night, which was the law up to then, we made it illegal for anybody to drink after midnight, and we left the country opening on Sundays from 1 o'clock to 8 o'clock.  After 12 o'clock at night on week-days it was made illegal to drink anywhere.  Before that, a Guard could find people drinking at 2 o'clock or 3 o'clock in the morning and do nothing about it and it rendered the law unenforceable.</P>
    <P>It is now an offence to drink after 12 o'clock and the law can accordingly be administered much more easily.  I think that Deputy McQuillan was right when he remarked that that change was only an experiment and the late Deputy O'Higgins, God rest him, said at the time that we should give the present system a trial.  I think that at that time we granted an increase of from 9.30 p.m. to 10.30 p.m. in the licensing hours for cities.  That narrowed the gap between the <i>bona fides</i> closing time of midnight in the country so that it would not be worthwhile for people to go outside the cities to continue drinking.</P>
    <P>However, I think that has not worked out so well in practice.  The city people still go outside the cities but not nearly as much as when they could drink all night.  That should be looked into.  I recall participating in a debate in 1942, when I was challenged by people from all sides of the House, including my own and including the present Minister for Defence, to justify the differentiation between the town and country.</P>
    <P>I said I would not do that because the Bill then being introduced was to impose further restrictions.  We on this side of the House when in Government followed the principle of collective responsibility; whatever my personal views were on the matter my colleagues had to stand over every action I took and we were not prepared to have the same licensing laws for the country as for the city.  The feeling I <Col N="642" /> have about the matter was that expressed by the present Minister last July and if I were Minister for Justice and gave expression to an opinion like that I would feel morally bound to amend the law in accordance with that sentiment.  I understand that the Minister made a speech in another place&mdash;he may contradict me if he likes but I was told about it by a person who said he heard him making it&mdash;that he did not care so long as the publicans did not pull the shutters down.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course I accept that but it has been broadcast that the Minister made that statement.  As far as my recollection of any committee set up by this House goes they, unlike the Milk Costings Commission, did their work expeditiously, there was a certain amount of agreement between all Parties constituting the committee, they furnished their report fairly promptly and brought it before the House in good time.  I do not think I want to say much more about this. There are other points besides Deputy McQuillan's three that require consideration also but they could be considered by this proposed committee.  I think Deputy McQuillan should accept my amendment and if the Government accept it in principle I would not tie them to the exact wording of the amendment.  If they have the whole position since 1942 examined by a Select Committee I feel sure a good job of work will be done.  When I was Minister&mdash;I feel sure the present Minister has the same experience&mdash;I got letters from all parts of the country saying that there was discrimination, that the sergeant liked one publican and allowed him to stay open after hours while all the others had to close. The whole thing made the task of the unfortunate sergeant an unenviable one and an impossible one to fulfil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know how much truth there is in these complaints but I got almost concrete evidence that the sergeant had a friend in this public-house and would allow the publican to remain open while a neighbouring public-house would not be allowed to stay open for <Col N="643" /> five minutes after the time.  Of course, every law, if unpopular, is unenforceable. I would conclude by pleading with the Minister to have this committee set up and have a law passed which everybody will respect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to second Deputy Boland's amendment.  In doing so I should like to be taken as concurring with a lot of what has already been said in favour of the motion.  I think there is nobody in this country to-day who would disagree with the suggestion that the licensing laws need amendment.</P>
      <P>I suppose there is no law which is more honoured in the breach than in the observance than the law relating to <i>bona fide</i> traffic in the licensed trade.  Anybody can make a very good case for the countryman who cannot have a drink when his fellow townsman can have one and I do not think anyone could ever justify that situation being written into the licensing laws in this country.  But that is not really the position as it stands.  It is a question of the townsman or the city-dweller being able to get a drink by the front door while the countryman has to have it by the back door.  No countryman is being deprived of a drink on Sunday.  That is actually the situation and anyone who thinks otherwise knows very little about the way in which the licensed business is conducted in this country.</P>
      <P>The Minister acquiesces in that situation to a certain extent when he says he does not believe that the Gardaí should be active in certain cases.  It amounts to this&mdash;that under the present circumstances the publican scarcely knows where he stands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Corish) Brendan Corish">

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not say the publican's life is an enviable one at the present time, apart from other adversities which cannot be discussed under this heading.  He may be fortunate in having reasonable Gardaí in his area who will permit a certain amount of laxity or he may live in an area where opening is not permitted <Col N="644" /> under any conditions after the <i>bona fide</i> hours.  Then if he attempts to take a chance he does not know when he may find himself in court although his next-door neighbour may be practising to a greater extent the same breaches of the law and may escape all his life.  Under the present system which certainly gives occasion to that sort of irregularity there is a situation in which I would say the licensed trade itself would like that the law would be either amended or enforced.  If a publican was certain when he closed his door at ten o'clock in a country village that he was not permitted to allow another person to cross the threshold without incurring the risk of a fine himself he could close his door in contentment and go about his business, go to bed or go for a walk.  If somebody knocks at his door and is not admitted under present circumstances the publican knows perfectly well that that customer of his will gain admission in some other public-house and may be a customer of his no longer, as would be quite natural if he is not admitted after hours when some other publican is prepared to admit him.  The result is that late illegal drinking is the order of the day with every publican taking a certain amount of risk and not knowing when, at the whim of some official of the Gardaí, he may find himself in court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would say: let the law be enforced strictly so that if I turn out my customer my next-door neighbour will not take him in, or else let the law be completely amended to abolish the <i>bona fide</i> hours entirely and, as Deputy Corry said, leave the position so that the people who seem to relish a drink just because they get it after hours would no longer be in that position. Possibly you would have less drinking. There is a type of person who would not go in until the lights are blinking and the signs creaking.  Then they go along to the back door to have a pint.  These people would not think of going in when the front door is open.  There may be some virtue in the pint under those circumstances, but it all comes down to the fact that the present licensing laws are a farce. The argument that the city dweller can get a drink while the countryman <Col N="645" /> cannot may seem a very good one, but the facts do not bear it out.  The fact is that there is no man deprived of a drink on Sunday at the present time and if he is getting a drink within his own area outside the <i>bona fide</i> arrangements he is getting it illegally and probably will continue to get it until some Minister has the courage of his convictions, as Deputy Boland said, and gives expression to the pious hopes and amends the law so that public-houses will be closed when they are supposed to be closed, or else licensed hours will be abolished entirely as they are in some countries where no closing hours are fixed at all.</P>
    <P>Some people might think that that would lead to a considerable amount of drunkenness in this State.  I personally do not think it would result in one extra bottle of stout being sold. Let us set up a committee to examine the position thoroughly.  There are a few of us in this House who have experience as publicans and are not ashamed to say so.  Remember it is not an enviable position.  The publican is a man at whom many insults are aimed from different sections of the community; yet he is fair game when there is money wanted for anything even when it comes to revenue to uphold the State.  He provides, I think, over one-quarter of the total revenue.</P>
    <P>I remember a resolution being put forward once by a certain body calling for an increase in the rate of duty on spirits to an extent that would abolish their consumption completely.  The reply of the Minister for Justice at the time was that he would like these people to indicate in what way the loss in revenue could be made up, what other 15 or 20 commodities or essential foodstuffs could be taxed to bring in the fraction of the revenue that is brought in through the much-maligned publicans of this country.  Let us at least put them in the position where they will know where they stand.  If there is a law, will that law be enforced or will its administration be left to the whims of those whose duty it is to implement?  I do not think that is the best solution.  The present position is crying out for immediate attention.  The motion proposed by <Col N="646" /> Deputy McQuillan goes a long way towards meeting many of the grievances but there are certain aspects the situation which require careful consideration. For that reason I am supporting the motion proposed by Deputy Boland, namely, that a Select Committee be set up thoroughly to examine the whole question of our licensing laws and their administration with a view to making suggestions as to their amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>A law that is not obeyed is a bad law and a law that is notoriously disobeyed, as the licensing laws are at present, injures the whole national foundation.  We should stop that and, in order to stop it, we should alter the law and remove the discriminations implied in it.  I would support any proposal to examine the situation and place all citizens, irrespective of whether they live in urban or rural areas, at equal advantage under the law.  What is right for the city man should be right for the countryman; and what is wrong for the countryman should be wrong for the city man.  What is wrong for the whole community is the <i>bona fide</i> trade as it is run to-day.  We want to put a stop to that.  We want to remove the discrimination through the law. Then, we can enforce the law.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. MacCarthy Mr. MacCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the House must go a long way with Deputy McQuillan in some of the points he has put forward.  He said that the present system of <i>bona fide</i> licensed trading should be completely examined with a view to correcting existing abuses.  I think it should be examined from the point of view of its original object and its application to-day.  This archaic law should undoubtedly be changed.  It was framed at a time when the rural population travelled all night on foot or with horses in order to reach the cities and the towns in time for the morning market.  That situation has altered fundamentally and, consequently, the application of the law to that particular aspect of the lives of the community should be changed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If Deputy McQuillan means by abuses late drinking in pubs or clubs I am 100 per cent. with him.  If he <Col N="647" /> means uniformity in the law I am 100 per cent. with him.  I think, however, that the amendment is the better way of approaching this matter; a committee of the House should be appointed to examine into the various aspects of it.  I do not think I would be prepared to go all the way with him in his second proposal about St. Patrick's Day, but I see no reason why the Sunday opening hours should not apply generally on St. Patrick's Day. That is an aspect of the matter which should be examined.  On St. Patrick's Day there are various functions in various places at which those who are invited can enjoy themselves as they wish and at will while the ordinary people have no such facilities.</P>
    <P>In relation to the <i>bona fide</i> trade, hurling matches, football matches, bowling and other games often take place on Sunday and there may be as many as 5,000 or 6,000 visitors.  They have no chance of getting refreshments of any kind unless the public bars help by opening their doors and providing sandwiches and beverages of various kinds.  If a friend or a relative comes from some other town or village be can go into the public-house but the relative he is visiting or the friend resident in the town cannot join him unless he is prepared to break the law and run the risk of prosecution. Anomalies of that kind should be removed. Really it is so obvious that it is almost a waste of time debating the matter here.  The whole country knows the position.  The whole country is calling for a change and, in response to the wishes of the country, we ought to make that change.  The best way to do that is by having, as is suggested by Deputy Boland, a Select Committee of this House to consider the various aspects of the matter.</P>

      <P>I listened to Deputy McQuillan speaking the other night and I was very impressed with the number of points he made.  In some of the roads he travelled to make his points I think he rather overdid it. As a member of the Pioneer Association I do not think it is right to say that they are somewhat in the nature <Col N="648" /> of which hunters, as Deputy McQuillan said the other night, or that they try to put halters on anybody.</P>

      <P>The Pioneer Association is far more interested in keeping horns and wings off people.  Deputy McQuillan described the situation very well in so far as the <i>bona fide</i> trade is concerned on the outskirts of Dublin City and many other cities and towns after 12 o'clock at night.  In these areas even angels fear to tread.  I often leave Dublin very late and until I pass the last <i>bona fide</i> house the road is a death-trap.  The motorists coming in are a menace because nine out of ten are so drunk that they cannot drive a car.  Deputy McQuillan made a very good point when he spoke about that.  I would not agree, however, that he is entirely on the right line and I think Deputy Boland's approach is a more realistic one.  I am a pioneer and I am sure I speak for every pioneer when I say that I do not believe a man should not have a drink.  Just because I am a pioneer I do not believe everybody else should be debarred from drinking.  Provided a man has the money, can afford to drink and feels he needs it he is quite entitled to drink.  I object to the licensing laws which allow a certain class of people to get beastly drunk and then go out on the country roads with motor-cars where they are a menace to every living being.  The sooner the licensing laws are amended to stop that, if possible by preventing those people from getting drunk at all after hours, the better it will be for everyone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether or not it <Col N="649" /> would be feasible to carry out a number of the suggestions made here during this debate and whether it would be the ideal thing to have all the public-houses open on St. Patrick's Day.  The visitors coming in here would find it a bit awkward if the people who get drink late at night, get into their cars and drive on the roads, started doing the same thing on St. Patrick's Day.  I am sure that is something which we do not want to see happening.  Nor do I agree with Deputy MacCarthy's suggestion that we should have the same system as on Sundays&mdash;I presume he was referring to the system of having the drink handed out in parcels at the back window.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. MacCarthy Mr. MacCarthy">

      <P>Whether that is so or not, I think Deputy Boland's amendment is far more realistic.  If a committee, set up from all Parties in this House, sit down to produce amendments to the present licensing laws we may see something reasonable emerging.  I am afraid that haphazard resolutions to amend the licensing laws will not solve the problem.  It is something which will have to be studied.  I myself have a dread of commissions. They take too long to bring in conclusions. However, I am sure in this case there is the possibility that since a great number of people are interested in the result, enough pressure could be brought to bear on the people comprising the commission to see to it that the results would be brought in within a reasonable time.  Therefore, I would be prepared to support Deputy Boland's amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAFinlay1954" hpid="Mr. Finlay Mr. Finlay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finlay</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the motion before the House in the name of Deputy McQuillan I would comment on&mdash;I will not say criticise&mdash;the motion by saying that it is somewhat too narrow in scope.  I think that comment probably shows up an underlying decision that I think this House must reach before it goes into any detail on the amendment of the licensing laws.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="650" /> Deputy McQuillan's motion could fairly be described as containing the possibility for three amendments of the existing licensing code which presumably the Deputy considers to be the three most urgent amendments. That is one way, as I see it, of attacking this problem and it is attacking it in a narrow field.  It is unlikely in my view that the sort of amendments which could possibly arise from consideration of the three topics with which the motion deals either through a committee, a commission or through this House sitting in Committee, would represent perfect or permanent amendments in relation to this problem.</P>
    <P>Another possibility which has obviously been mooted by some of the Deputies who have spoken before me is that what is really required at this stage is not an amendment or two or three amendments of the existing licensing code but much rather a reconsideration and a re-examination of the attitude of the Legislature and of the law to the whole problem of the drinking of alcohol.  I think that before we embark on an amendment in any form of the licensing laws, it would be worth the while of the House to consider whether or not we should first try to form some sort of a general policy on the question of licensed premises, licensed trade and drinking in the country.</P>
    <P>A short review of the history of the last 30 or 40 years shows that this problem is by no means domestic and by no means internal.  It is a problem in connection with which, more than any other social problem as far as Europe and America are concerned, we have seen more examples of failure to deal with the problem even partly adequately outside this country than we have with any other social problem in current politics or in politics over the last 40 or 50 years.  It is worthwhile considering that in Scandinavia at this particular moment there has broken down one of the experiments which was created to try to deal with this particular problem.  We had in the twenties the complete breakdown in America of Prohibition as an experiment. It probably did more harm to the social structure of America between <Col N="651" /> the two world wars than any other single factor.  There was then the Scandinavian attempt, which dates from roughly the same date as Prohibition, to ration drink according to certain classifications.  That has been abandoned and I think in Sweden within the last 12 months it has been abandoned to the extent that it has been so enlarged that it could hardly be called a ration any longer and the best information one can get is that it was only abandoned by a Government or people or Legislature that was very devoted to it, because it had become so palpably wrong and so palpably impracticable.</P>
    <P>I agree with a very considerable amount of what has been said in the House already about the unsatisfactory working of the existing licensing laws. The very history of the <i>bona fide</i> licensing law, the law which was made to give sustenance to a traveller because he had gone three miles, shows when you relate that to any form of modern transport, good, bad or indifferent, that it has become a complete anomaly.  But the fact that it has become a complete anomaly may not mean it is necessary to get rid of it or make it desirable to alter it drastically.</P>
    <P>The question we must face up to is this.  I honestly do not believe that any amendments which suggest flattening out the situation between the cities and towns, which suggest opening the public-houses for any period on St. Patrick's day instead of keeping them closed on that day, one day in the whole year, will make a substantial alteration in the relation between the practice and the law or in the general attitude of the people of this country to that particular law.  I may be wrong in that and I would not like to impose a sort of hopeless pessimism on a problem of this description and say: &ldquo;It is no use.  We cannot do anything about it.&rdquo;  But I do think it is wrong to believe that amendments on the three matters which are before us in this motion are amendments which will make any great contribution to the solution of the general problem.</P>
    <P>If that is right, if that view is even <Col N="652" /> credible or can be generally supported, then if we are going to embark on amendment of the licensing code in general, we must recognise that any examination by a committee of this House or a commission of outside persons with power to hear witnesses, will create a situation in which a fairly substantial alteration of the existing code is going to follow.  I think that, once you start this snowball, you cannot stop it.  Once you start the people in the country in their various interests, in their views, prejudices or sound opinions&mdash;whatever they are&mdash; on a wide contemplation of the relation of the licensing laws to morality and social legislation, I do not think any examination is going to end without a drastic alteration of those laws.</P>
    <P>I should like to put a view to the House, which will probably be considered as retrograde to a fair extent, as a possible view for consideration, and it is this, that the licensing laws in their operation are unsatisfactory&mdash; grant that; that there are marked inequalities in the way they are operated and marked inequalities even in the laws themselves&mdash;grant that; that it appears to be the situation that the people who get the greatest facility for drinking in public-houses are not the right people and the people who make the best or wisest use of these facilities&mdash;that is another possible view; but leaving all that as definitely accepted, I think it is worth the while of the House considering that they are going to do considerably more harm by altering in any substantial way the licensing laws of the country than they are going to do good.</P>
    <P>If anybody came forward here with a concrete, well-thought-out policy with regard to the control or licensing of drinking in this country, I for one would be personally very anxious to support a re-examination with a view to putting that policy into effect, but merely to say that it is unsatisfactory as it stands and to give examples of the way in which it is unsatisfactory and then to embark on a large examination which, as I view it, must inevitably end up with a large alteration of the licensing laws, is wholly unwise until we are completely satisfied that substantial alteration is going to mean <Col N="653" /> substantial improvement.  It could easily happen that, bad and all as the licensing laws of this country are, and worse as may be their practical application, we would run the general framework of the social life of the country into much greater trouble by upsetting what is a bad and creaking old machine and replacing it with something new and streamlined which is not fitted for the situation.</P>
    <P>The suggestion has been made in the House and we hear it outside the House&mdash;I do not want necessarily either to become indignant about it or to sneer at it&mdash;that licensing hours are one of the main difficulties and that if there were no licensing hours, if the public-houses operated like any other shop or service in the country, if they served their customers while they thought it good business to serve them and the customers used them while it suited them to use them and the State did not enter into the question of whether they were open or closed, there would not be any more drinking than there is now and it would probably be done in much better conditions.  That is a view one hears very widely expressed.  I think that the European countries in which that sort of freedom exists do not prove that.  I may be wrong, but I understand that in France, for instance, where there is a much wider latitude in regard to hours than there is here&mdash;if there is any restriction at all&mdash;its statistical position in the matter of alcoholism is one of its most upsetting features and it ranks extremely high amongst the European countries in that regard.</P>
    <P>That is a view that has support in this country and I think it is worth while considering that, if we go into an examination of the matter&mdash;and I think it must be a large examination or no examination at all&mdash;we may find ourselves in the position that the pressure of opinion in the country for either some form of prohibition or some form of easement of restrictions would be so strong that the House would be forced to one or other extreme.  I have no doubt personally that all the examples around us of the attempts of other countries to legislate on this matter within the past 30 or 35 years <Col N="654" /> show that neither of those two extremes is likely to have any result, but an extremely harmful result to the social and moral life of the country.</P>
    <P>Therefore, while, as I say, I can see great force in the points which Deputy McQuillan and other speakers made and have a full realisation in the case of my own work, apart from anything else, of the extreme impracticability of the application of the licensing laws at present, I should like the House to consider the possibility that, by interfering with this machinery and organisation, bad and all as it is, we may do more harm than good.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>With the previous speaker, I am inclined to agree when he speaks about the present system being possibly better than anything we might start off anew or anything we might superimpose upon it.  There is, to my mind, a lot of truth in that statement, but assuming that it is true and that we accept it as true, I feel that there are, as enumerated here by previous speakers, a number of grievances under the existing code, and would it not then appear to be a rather simple matter to proceed to eliminate the grievances that have been mentioned, and of which all of us know, and amend, somewhat on the principles laid down in the motion, the existing legislation?  If, after a time, we find that these amendments, that the legislation mentioned is not satisfactory, we possibly could come back again and rehash, or, if necessary, throw aside the old law entirely and bring in something new.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have the view in the country, at any rate, that there is discrimination against the country worker and the country dweller.  I think it is admitted by everybody in the House that the law, as we now have it, is biased in favour of the city dweller.  That is entirely wrong and possibly even equality in this matter might not go far enough. I feel that if there is to be any difference in the licensing hours for city and country, the later and longer hours would, of necessity, suit the country much better than the other-way-round position we now have.  There are many abuses that any of us can see up and down the country and many of us know <Col N="655" /> that these abuses are associated with drinking at illegal times&mdash;the crawling in back doorways and laneways, the getting into public-houses by many routes other than by the front door.</P>
    <P>The real trouble arises when people have got inside, because they will remain inside in many cases as long as they will be kept inside, and, as long as they are kept inside, they will drink and will drink more than they would drink if they had free access to the premises.  They will then find themselves, as many of us know, if not drunk, partially drunk.  They will find that on a Sunday after Mass, as has been instanced here, they will not get home in time for their dinner.  They may not go home for dinner at all. They will not leave the public-house for the reason that, if they leave, the local Gardaí may in the meantime take a walk around or possibly stand about, with the result that they cannot get in again, so that, once inside, the tendency is to stay inside, and naturally when they stay inside it is a question of drinking as much as possible while they are allowed to remain.  The result is drunkenness on Sunday throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Then we have the other extreme which is even worse.  We have the case where the local Gardaí are so strict that there is absolutely no possibility of getting in the back door. In that case we find a group of men, three or four of them, getting together and going in a car for three, four or five miles.  Would anybody tell me or get me to believe that having travelled three or four miles they will be satisfied with one or two bottles of stout or one or two halves?  They will go out for an evening's drinking and drink they will for the evening.  The trouble has not ended there because there is still the problem of getting home.  Having drunk their fill for many hours they will have to get home in the car they came in.  They will have had no food and too much to drink.  Very likely the driver will be one of those people who had no food and he will have drunk enough to make him incapable of driving.</P>
    <P>He then sets sail with his load of drunks and as well as being a menace <Col N="656" /> to himself and those with him he is also a menace to other users of the road.  Not very far from here we have roads leading to and from Dublin where, at every bend, a monument could be erected to persons killed by this type of carry on in and around Dublin.  One could mark out the roads and points on them where people have been killed without any excuse except the thoroughly inadequate facilities, or perhaps the too great facilities, given for the consumption of alcoholic liquor.</P>
    <P>We should then, in my opinion, if we accept the amendment consider the grievances that are so long outstanding. These are that the people in the country should be given the same facilities as the people in the city as far as Sunday is concerned and that there should be no <i>bona fide</i> selling of drink in this country.  I believe emphatically that that is more a cause of drunkenness in this country than anything else and because of that drunkenness there are accidents and deaths that should not occur.  We can remove the causes of these calamities by giving to the people of the country the facilities which the people of the city now enjoy and by wiping out the inequitous system whereby, if you travel three miles, you may drink all you wish for as long as you wish and so do all the damage you wish on the way home.</P>
    <P>I feel that the terms contained in the motion possibly may not go far enough in the minds of some and may go too far in the minds of others.  For that reason I will agree to the setting up of the committee.  I will point out for the benefit of some who have spoken that it is not a commission which it is proposed to set up but a committee, and it need not have all the faults inherent in a commission that there may be long delays.  We do not want to see that happen in this case.  This could be a committee of the House given a specified time to report back to the House. I feel that it should take the line pointed out by the last speaker and that they should not try to give a new licensing code to the country.  It should be made plain to them that they are there to remedy the grievances we now have and to see if they can be <Col N="657" /> removed by slight improvements on the present system.</P>
    <P>If their recommendation should not give satisfaction and if the grievances still existed then we can still come back and try some other means.  I am fully convinced that we must do something about this evil&mdash;and it is an evil. It is going on in every town and county of the State, week after week, year in and year out.  Everybody knows it and why nothing has been done about it is more than I can see.</P>
    <P>An endeavour was made previously to get something like this done and why it was not carried I do not know. Neither do I know why the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association at the time should have opposed the extension of city facilities to the country.  I cannot understand it except perhaps that some people may have thought that we were providing more facilities for drunkenness.  I think they did not understand the situation and I would ask them to look at it from the point of view of ruling out the theoretical consideration that the longer one has to drink the more one will drink.  That can be proved to be entirely wrong.</P>
    <P>I would then appeal to the people in this House and to those outside it who hold strong views on this matter and particularly to the Government to recognise that in pushing this matter and in asking for the grievances outstanding to be remedied I am at one with the people who want to see this done and who want to reduce drunkenness in the country.  I am not, in any way, giving my approval to facilities which would increase drunkenness.  It is purely on the basis that it would reduce drunkenness that I ask that these grievances be remedied and that country dwellers be given the same facilities as city dwellers and that the inequitous <i>bona fide</i> racket should be done away with.  I ask that in the belief that it would make our people a little more temperate in their drinking habits.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>There seems to be nearly unanimous agreement in the House that the existing licensing code is defective in many respects.  In its origin it is in many respects archaic and it suffers from the fact that it has <Col N="658" /> been amended and patched up here and there.  I was very impressed by the speech made by Deputy Finlay and the last speaker, but I think that their judgment to a certain extent errs when, having recognised that the existing code is defective, they baulk at the idea of having the whole position examined again.  It does appear to me that the proper approach should be to try and have the whole of the licensing code examined from top to bottom and then to formulate concrete proposals for a completely new approach to our licensing laws.</P>
      <P>I think every Deputy in the House will agree that the existing <i>bona fide</i> traffic is one of the evils that should be dealt with.  There are probably many other evils that result from the existing licensing laws which also need to be remedied but the whole problem seems to boil itself down to this, as far as the House is concerned: is a committee of the House the best way of dealing with the question?  I know that commissions have a bad name in that they take a long time before they produce a report.  On the other hand, I think we should be quite frank in approaching this question in the House.  We are all aware that if a committee of the House is set up a number of vested interests of one kind or another &mdash;some actuated by motives of gain, others by quite altruistic motives&mdash;will get busy and pressure will be put on the different Parties and the different members of the House who are on the Select Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that such pressure would not deflect them from doing whatever they thought was best, but I fear it is true that possibly members of the House are not the best qualified persons to give an objective view on the best course to adopt.  For those reasons, despite the fact that a commission might take a long time, despite the fact that it may be a cumbersome piece of machinery, I think better results would be obtained by a commission, carefully selected of persons who would be able to give the whole question really undivided attention.  It may be said, of course, that a commission of this kind, with no responsibility, would be likely to produce a <Col N="659" /> report which might not be practical, which might not meet with the approval of the House, but in so far as it does, in so far as the report is unacceptable, the House need not implement it, but at least the commission would provide the House with a reasoned and I hope a well-informed report containing a number of proposals as to how best to deal with the whole problem.</P>
    <P>For those reasons, I would suggest to the mover of the resolution, and also to Deputy Boland who moved his amendment, to consider whether or not in the long run better results might be obtained by having a commission of responsible people with special qualifications to examine this whole question over a period of time.  True, the question of <i>bona fide</i> traffic is an urgent one but we have allowed the position to obtain over a good many years now so that the delay of an extra three or four months would not be likely to affect the issue.  I do not know whether a Select Committee of the House would be so satisfactory.  It would be rather an unsatisfactory body which might suffer from lack of full attendance at its meetings.  Different members would attend on different occasions.  I do not think a committee of the House would have either the time or often the inclination to go into the amount of detail necessary to formulate constructive proposals in regard to this problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister wants to get in, I would give way to him, but I want to say only a few words on this problem as both the motion and the amendment have been fairly well discussed and many members of the House have already made up their minds, if it comes to a vote, as to how they will cast their vote.  I am convinced it has been conclusively shown that there are serious abuses of the law as it exists. Deputy Boland, when Minister for Justice, brought in the last Licensing Act that we have had in order to cure some of the very serious abuses of the <i>bona fide</i> traffic at that time.  But that was in 1942, 13 years ago, and many things have happened since; for instance, the amount of motor transport <Col N="660" /> that has come on the roads in the meantime has done much to aggravate the abuses.</P>
      <P>It is a well-known fact, well-known to the Department and to the Minister as well as to the members of this House, that very many of the fatal accidents which occur in this country take place late at night as a result of the <i>bona fide</i> traffic.  What I am mostly concerned with, and every member of the House should be so concerned, is that there is no doubt there are serious abuses all over the country of the existing licensing laws.  I say that these abuses are committed with the connivance of the Minister for Justice. The Guards are told to lay off and not to enforce the law and I think it is bad and rotten for this community that laws in existence are not being put into operation on the advice of the Department and Minister for Justice.  They advise the Guards, who have the responsibility for administering the law, to lay off and not to enforce the law. Laws were made to be enforced and it is the Minister's bounden duty to amend the law so that it can be enforced, either that or do away with the licensing laws altogether.  There is another way for solving the problem and that is to reduce considerably the alcoholic gravity of all drink and then to do away with all licensing laws. That is one way of solving the problem. Then there would be no necessity for enforcing any law.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>There are other countries where there are very liberal licensing laws but the alcoholic gravity of the main beverage in these countries is very low.  I am now pleading with the Minister to do one of three things: do away with the law altogether as I have suggested; amend it so that it will be enforceable; or enforce the existing law.  It is no use bringing the law into disrepute.  Considering the background, I do not think the Minister enhanced the reputation of this or any other Government when, last July, he made the following statement in the House, as reported at column 754 of Volume 152 of the Official Report:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="661" />&ldquo;I know that drinking after hours is against the law, but in the country places there are many more serious things than that.  I see nothing criminal in five or six men sitting in a country public-house at night-time after a wet day or talking about the threshing.  They would not spend 10/- in a whole night, while there would be £10 spent in a club in Dublin. I see nothing criminal at all in the instance I have mentioned and I ask the Guards to use their common sense and if they do so we will have a better country and better respect for the law.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy MacBride, who spoke a few moments ago, pointed out a very serious matter that arose in his experience as an advocate in the courts.  He pointed out that at least 50 per cent. of the serious accidents that occur at night are due to the consumption of alcoholic drink after hours.  The Minister is aware of that and has the evidence of a Deputy of this House who is an advocate and has experience in the courts every day of the week.  I think that in itself should be sufficient reason for the Minister for Justice to have the law amended and so do away with all this <i>bona fide</i> traffic at night, as Deputy Blaney suggested.  Every night that the Minister for Justice himself leaves this city he personally has his life in his hands for many miles of the road as he drives home.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to detain the House very long, but I do ask that the amendment suggested by Deputy Boland should be accepted.  It is admitted on all sides of the House and by the Minister that there is cause for investigation of the licensing code and there is no better body in my opinion, no more efficient body which could make that investigation than a Select Committee of this House.  Each and every one of them has sufficient knowledge of the abuses of the existing law.  I do not agree at all with Deputy Finlay that because the law is wrong, because it cannot be administered as it is, that no effort should be made to amend that law.  Dáil Éireann will be in session for the next century at least and probably for the next seven centuries, and the law may be amended every year <Col N="662" /> or every five years, but an effort must be made now to amend the law.  It may be difficult but that is no reason why we should avoid it.</P>
    <P>The question of Sunday drinking is a matter for this committee, and I do not propose to go into its merits now or into the merits of city people who can get a drink without being <i>bona fide</i> on Sunday or the merits of the case for the countryman who gets a drink at the back door, as Deputy Brennan says.  Personally, I believe there is not one adult male in every 1,000 of the people of this country who seeks drink on Sundays&mdash;nor probably one in every 5,000.  It is a very limited number of people we are asked to cater for but nevertheless they are entitled to their liberty and their rights.  Every section of the community is entitled to certain liberty and certain rights.  The section seeking drink on Sundays in the country is mainly drawn from the working class and the small farmers in my experience. These men work hard all the week and if they require some relaxation on Sundays and have not got a motor car to drive three miles that is a matter that should be considered&mdash; whether they are entitled to get a drink in their own town or not.  Personally, I am opposed to giving drink on Sundays and I would not have any drinking on Sundays or holidays. Travelling around my constituency I find, thank God, that my own area is not as bad as others that I have seen in regard to Sunday drinking.  I have seen many abuses of the law, and if the Department of Justice and the Minister for Justice are aware of this the Minister, however he would manage it, should set out to remedy those abuses.</P>
    <P>The Gardaí should be enabled to enforce the laws and should not be ashamed or afraid to enforce them and there should be no suggestion as there is at the present moment of undesirable practices in many many towns&mdash;I will not say more than that.  I think we cannot have a sound country, or a sound Garda force when they are told by the Department of Justice to turn a blind eye to breaches of the existing law.  I think that should not be so and <Col N="663" /> that the Minister should not be afraid to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Only one Deputy as far as I remember has made reference to a statement which I had the courage to make when others were sending word down along the line not to put certain Acts into operation.  Deputy McQuillan, Deputy Boland and I practically share the same views.  The licensing laws in my opinion must be revised.  Deputy McQuillan's motion has referred to the question of St. Patrick's Day but that has been decided in this House on two occasions, I think.  I appreciate what the members on both sides of the House have said and I realise that what I advocate would come better from me as one who does not know the taste of intoxicating liquor.  Like Deputies McQuillan and Boland I recognise that members of the licensed trade are a very important and very influential section of the community although they may be twitted in trying to carry out the law.  At the same time I realise that we have abuses and how to remedy these abuses is the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When Deputy McQuillan moved his resolution Deputy Boland came forward with a very wide and important amendment but then I had to remember that Deputy Boland gave me advice on the Gaming Act when a Deputy of his own Party suggested that there should be a committee of the whole House.  With his experience he pointed out the difficulties involved in having a committee of the whole House to consider this point and I have been wondering since Deputy Boland put down his amendment if the same considerations would apply if we appointed a committee of the House in <Col N="665" /> connection with the revision of the licensing laws.  I am afraid they would.</P>
    <P>Now Deputy McQuillan put forward a very reasonable case when he dealt with the position of the licensing laws, their non-observance and the situation generally throughout the country at the present time.  I would be prepared to have a commission to inquire into every aspect of the present licensing system, a commission representative of all Parties in the House.  I would guarantee that the Deputies selected to sit on that commission would be selected on the recommendation of the House.  In that way we would avoid having perhaps a Party political commission. There would also be represented on it those interested in the licensed trade, those interested in the Pioneer Association and so forth.  All the grievances mentioned by the various speakers here could be put before that commission, particularly in relation to the <i>bona fide</i> trade.  There was such a commission in 1925.  Probably Deputy Boland remembers it.  It took some six months for that commission to send in its report.</P>
    <P>I know that certain people have a horror of commissions because of the time they take but, if it is agreed to have such a commission, I would place upon the body the obligation of making its report as soon as possible. I would not allow it to sit for years. As I have said, that commission would be representative of all Parties in the House together with the outside interests affected and it could not, therefore, be said that it was representative of politics, or the licensed trade or the temperance organisation only.  Such a body could go into the matter thoroughly.</P>
    <P>I do not want to give my own personal views if it is the intention that such a commission should be appointed since I do not want to influence the commission.  I think Deputy Boland knows my views.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to embarrass the Minister, but he has put himself on record as to what his views are and, that being the case, I think we can expect him to implement those <Col N="666" /> views without appointing any commission at all.  He has spoken as Minister and not merely as a Deputy or a member of his own Party; he has spoken as Minister and he has put his views on record.  How he can go back on those now, I fail to see.</P>

      <P>If we agree to have a commission I do not want to influence that commission by stating my views here.  I want that commission to examine the position in the interests of the public and of all concerned.  We do not want to do it as a Party matter.</P>

      <P>Views have been expressed by all Parties.  I think Deputy McQuillan deserves congratulation for the manner in which he brought forward this matter.  I think it would be in the best interests of all concerned that a representative commission, such as I have outlined, should be appointed.  I think that would serve the interests concerned best.  Such a commission could not subsequently be accused of being influenced by any political Party.  I do not want to influence such a commission by any statement now of my own opinions, Deputy MacBride has suggested a commission. I do not think Deputy McQuillan would object to that so long as all aspects are examined.  I think such a commission could give a report within a very short time and that report could then be considered by all Parties here and we might possibly have agreement on a Bill to be introduced forthwith to implement the majority decision of such a commission. If Deputy Boland is prepared to accept that suggestion, we are prepared to appoint such a commission.</P>

      <P>I do not think there is any need to prolong the debate. When this motion was tabled I knew <Col N="667" /> quite well that there were parts of it with which many Deputies would not agree and I knew equally well there were parts of it with which they could agree.  I appreciate the manner in which the Government has met the proposals. I think the amendment to the motion was a sound way of dealing with the problems I mentioned; indeed, it covers some matters which were not mentioned in the motion at all.  I am somewhat afraid of the idea of a commission because very often this House is inclined to shelve or evade its responsibilities by appointing commissions.  The Minister has, of course, tempered the matter to some extent by the promise to include on that commission representatives of all Parties in this House.  If it were a commission composed solely of outsiders, no matter how much we could depend on them, I think it would be wrong to leave the matter entirely in their hands.  In other Parliaments, in the American House of Representatives and Congress, the people's representatives have confidence enough in themselves, through their sub-committees, to deal with many matters of public importance embracing the whole of the United States.  I think this House should now give itself an opportunity of carrying more responsibility. Members would take a more active interest in the welfare of the community and in the drafting of legislation if they could sit on more committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government appreciates the position that the licensing laws need amendment.  My motion has not been accepted in its present form and evidently the Government, in its wisdom, considers the idea of a committee of the House, as suggested by Deputy Boland, would not be the best means of dealing with the matter.  It has been decided to set up a commission on which members of this House will be represented.  I would like the Minister to let us know whether this commission will have for its terms of reference the three sections of my motion plus the matters included in Deputy Boland's amendment.  If those matters are part of the direction given <Col N="668" /> to the proposed commission I will be satisfied to abide by that.</P>

      <P>When I put down this question I did not realise that the necessity would arise for me to raise the matter on the adjournment debate. The question is of the greatest public interest and, in my innocence, I was convinced that the Minister would see fit to give a comprehensive and lucid reply, dealing with all the matters raised by me.  But the only information we got from the Minister was that the National Stud is a separate entity and, as such, can do exactly what it pleases.  The Minister adopts the attitude that he has no functions whatever in the matter.  When speaking on the debate dealing with the purchase of Tulyar on 26th February, 1951, the Minister for Finance, then Deputy Sweetman, stated:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is no good for the Minister to shelter behind others and say this is not his decision, that it is a matter for the directors.  This is the people's property and, no matter by whom the decision is taken&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>To summarise it, the present Minister for Finance then Deputy Sweetman, said that the matter was of such public importance the Minister for Agriculture at the time should not shelter behind the <Col N="669" /> directors of the National Stud.  But to-day the Minister for Finance, Deputy Sweetman, himself sheltered behind the directors of the National Stud.  I do not think it is good enough that the public should not be fully informed. I asked the Minister to make a statement as to the conditions of the sale of Tulyar and the purchase of Vimy.  We were given two figures: £240,000 for the sale of Tulyar and £105,000 for the purchase of Vimy.  There is no mention there of any incidental expenses such as fees due to the negotiating agents who took a 6&rdquo; double column in some of the daily papers to inform the public that they had negotiated the sale of Tulyar on behalf of the purchaser and had also negotiated the purchase of Vimy.  Does the Minister suggest that these people are working for nothing? When he gave that figure to-day, surely he should have mentioned what cut, if any, they got.  I hope when the Minister is replying now he will let us know exactly what the conditions were.</P>
      <P>The point I am anxious to elicit in this debate is why Mr. George Hancock and his associates, and they alone, knew that Tulyar was for sale.  No one else knew that he was for sale until a hint was given in the <i>Evening Press</i> that Tulyar would be sold.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a statement made by the purchaser of the horse to reporters from very reputable newspapers at Shannon Airport.  I am very sorry it is not true because this has been a damaging blow to the bloodstock industry.  The Minister said the directors of the National Stud recommended unanimously that Tulyar be sold, but the Minister should have seen through the position that after making a hash of the Panaslipper affair the directors of the National Stud were afraid the lot of them would get the hammer and so to redeem themselves and do what they thought might be a popular thing they turned round and flogged the horse.  Even at this late stage I would ask the Minister to see if the deal has definitely gone through, because the most eminent authorities in the Bloodstock Breeding Association maintain that it was a bad day for Ireland that Tulyar has been sold.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance and the Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Dillon, both spoke in favour at the time of the purchase of Tulyar and the Minister himself used the words that &ldquo;we must take the long term view&rdquo;. Now after three years we are disposing of the horse.  As the then Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Walsh, remarked at the time, when we are calculating the monetary value of Tulyar we are considering a period of 12 years not of three years and even at that <Col N="672" /> time Deputy Walsh calculated that the income would be in the region of £12,000.  In actual fact I understand that £39,000 was received in stud fees in respect of Tulyar.  It is bad enough to have made a hash of the Panaslipper job&mdash;buying him for stud purposes and then racing him.  As I say, if the National Stud or any other State body could not make a mistake without being castigated it would be a bad thing for the country, but having made one mistake when they disposed of Royal Charger, they should have seen that with Royal Charger gone, all we had in the National Stud of any value to-day&mdash;I do not want to undermine the other sires&mdash;is Preciptic.  We have Black Rock and the others&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We hear a lot of talk about factories to bring dollars into the country.  In Tulyar, we had a readymade factory and a ready output per annum and in three years, through the investment of £250,000, £500,000 was obtained from his progeny.  If that is not good business I do not know what is.  A sum of £250,000 made £500,000 and we still had him after three years.  Now the goose that laid the golden egg is gone.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Sweetman) Gerard Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Sweetman)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley to-day asked a question and suggested that the answer I gave to it was not a lucid one.  I am afraid I must beg leave to differ from the Deputy.  What I said to-day in reply to the question and to the Deputy's supplementary questions was quite specific.  The Deputy seems to be entirely under a misapprehension in relation to many of the matters he has mentioned to-night.  When this matter of Tulyar was discussed here some years ago, it was discussed because of an Act which Deputy Walsh, then Minister for Agriculture, brought to the House for the purpose of increasing the share capital of the National Stud.  It was made quite clear by him at that time, and properly so, that it was that question was under discussion.  The National Stud was set up by Act of this House, and, by the Act of this House, the choice was made as to the manner in which the stud would be run.  The House then determined that it would be run, not by a Government Department, but by a company set up under the Companies Acts, with all the legal implications that involves, as regards the board of directors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Walsh must have been feeling somewhat uncomfortable while Deputy Briscoe was interrupting to say whether a horse should be bought or sold was a matter requiring the Minister's sanction because Deputy Walsh said many times, in my hearing, that it was not.  You have the Board of the <Col N="676" /> National Stud set up to do this job, a board which, if my recollection is correct, had all its members, with one exception, appointed while Fianna Fáil was in power.  I think I am right in saying that only one member of that board is not a Fianna Fáil nominee. The Board of the National Stud, on this occasion, informed the Minister that they proposed to sell Tulyar. They were not bound to do so under the terms of the Act.</P>
    <P>It was not a question, like it was on the previous occasion, when the board had not the money to carry out the act which they wished to do.  On this occasion it was a question of a sale and the funds had not to be specially provided.  The Minister for Agriculture informed the board that the question of the sale was a matter within their discretion.  He takes the view, and I agree, and the Government agrees, that in any question where the stud is concerned it has got to be run directly by their direction.  The only alternatives you have are to keep them in office or get rid of them.  You cannot blow hot and cold at the same time &mdash;you cannot leave the directors in control of the company and at the same time say that you will not permit them to carry on their job.</P>
    <P>The Board of the National Stud decided that they would negotiate for the sale of Tulyar.  I do not know the reason which operated in their minds as to why they decided to do so but I do know that if I, or any other Deputy, was going to sell a house we would go to an auctioneer and decide for ourselves the most suitable auctioneer to deal with our property.  If we wanted to sell by private treaty we would leave it to the auctioneer.  The Board of the National Stud decided to adopt what they thought was the best method and I think they were right.</P>
    <P>If they, having decided to sell Tulyar, published that fact to the world, and then were unable to sell at the price they thought suitable, they would have done great damage to their own property.  They would have depreciated his value without any question if they had dealt with the matter in the way the Deputy suggests and were not able to dispose of him at a price they considered suitable.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="677" /> Deputy O'Malley stated that he has got expert opinion to the effect that Tulyar was sold too cheaply.  I hope he will agree with me that I know a considerable number of people in the bloodstock industry and everyone I met told me a different story.  Their view was that the board was lucky to be able to get out at that price.  I am not going to suggest that Deputy O'Malley has invented the opinions he quoted and I know he will not suggest that I have invented the ones that I have mentioned.  If he makes inquiries amongst bloodstock breeders he will find that the opinion I have quoted is far the more prevailing and has been accepted by bloodstock breeders all over the country.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley has also suggested that Deputy Dillon was responsible for the sale of Royal Charger.  Royal Charger was sold when Deputy Walsh was Minister for Agriculture.</P>

      <P>I know the circumstances, as Deputy Walsh knows the circumstances, in which Royal Charger was sold and again there is no doubt in my mind that the board was right in effecting that sale.  I think Deputy O'Malley is embarking on a complete mare's nest when he suggests that it was possible in any shape or form to get anything in excess of the price paid for Tulyar.  I said to-day, and I repeat it now, that the decision to sell Tulyar was taken by the unanimous resolution of the board of the National Stud and that the decision to sell at that price was the unanimous decision of the board of the National Stud.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the question if the decision to purchase Tulyar at the price for which he was purchased was the unanimous decision of the National Stud?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am looking for information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that you ask your colleague, Deputy Walsh.  I <Col N="678" /> thought that I had made available to-day to Deputy O'Malley the salient points in accordance with the practice built up over the years in relation to companies of this kind.  There has been a long history of precedents in regard to what one might call State sponsored companies as to what information would be given and what would not be given.  I think the information I gave is in accordance with that precedent. It was because I wanted it to be in accordance with that precedent that I gave the information and limited it the way I did.</P>
      <P>I have no desire to hide anything from Deputy O'Malley or from this House, but it has been said again and again by the Ministers of the two Governments that it is undesirable in certain circumstances to disclose every detail in relation to State sponsored companies such as would be done in respect of departmental matters.  I feel that there are matters that should sometimes be disclosed and details that should not be disclosed.  There are differences.</P>
      <P>I think that the information I gave to-day was the proper information to give and if the matter had been left at that it would be all right.  Deputy O'Malley has asked specific questions and if the position was that I did not answer those questions there might be a suggestion that there was something wrong about it.  We all know that when an agent is appointed for any transaction, be it auctioneer, or solicitor or engineer, he gets paid for the work he does.  In this case an agent was appointed by the directors of the National Stud and acted for the company in connection with the sale of Tulyar and that agent was paid commission by the National Stud for so acting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as the purchase of Vimy is concerned I do not know anything more than the advertisement I saw in the paper and that the deputy also saw.  With regard to the deal that has been made by the National Stud, let me be quite clear that if I had been asked to give my formal approval to it I would have given it because I believe that the sale of Tulyar in these circumstances was in the best national <Col N="679" /> interest.  I believe that we have sufficient of that blood in the country now and I believe that it would be quite wrong for the National Stud, having got sufficient of that blood in the country, to have all their eggs in one basket.  I am sure of that because it could be, and I hope it will not happen, that the progeny of Tulyar, when they come to race in 1957 and 1958, might not be a success. When the former National Stud Bill was going through the House I said I thought it was better policy for the <Col N="680" /> National Stud not to buy one horse only and so use up all our money for that purpose but that in the interests of the bloodstock industry it would be better to have more sires for the total amount of money available so that they could serve a very much larger number of mares throughout the country than obviously could be served with the limited number of mares available to a horse like Tulyar.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11 p.m. until Thursday, 10th November, 1955, at 3 p.m.</P>
