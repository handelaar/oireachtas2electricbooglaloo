      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware that farmers in South Wexford, who have heretofore produced beet on a large scale, are being asked to curtail their acreage of the crop because the freight subsidy, on account of the long distance to the factories, is over 17/3 per ton; and, if so, if he will give immediate and favourable consideration to the establishment of a beet factory in New Ross.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Norton) William Norton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Norton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been informed by Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann, Teoranta, that no farmer in South Wexford or anywhere else has been asked or will be asked to curtail his beet acreage on account of high freight subsidy charges.</P>
      <P>The existing sugar factories have a manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet the country's full requirements of sugar and are in fact capable of handling additional quantities of beet if it were available.  The establishment of an additional factory would not, therefore, be justifiable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood the Minister to say&mdash;I did not hear him very well&mdash;that no farmer would be restricted in acreage on account of the freightage.  I have actually a letter in my pocket where a farmer is restricted in acreage because the freightage would be over 17/6 a ton.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have informed the Deputy that the sugar company has <Col N="504" /> informed me that no farmer in South Wexford or anywhere else has been asked or will be asked to curtail his acreage on account of the high freight subsidy.  If the Deputy has any letter which is in any way incompatible with that statement, he should take the matter up with the sugar company and I am sure the position will be put right.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFlynn" hpid="Mr. J. Flynn Mr. J. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he has yet received a report from the E.S.B. in connection with the proposed scheme for the development of the Cummeragh River, Waterville, County Kerry, and, if not, if he will ascertain from the board the cause of the delay in furnishing him with the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not yet received the report referred to.  As the Deputy has already been informed, the board are examining certain problems which have arisen in connection with the proposed scheme.  I am satisfied that there has been no avoidable delay in dealing with the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFlynn" hpid="Mr. J. Flynn Mr. J. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there any truth in the statement that certain vested interests made representation to hold up this scheme?  I would be glad if the Minister would clarify that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>No vested interests made any representation to me.  The position is that the E.S.B. is now examining a detailed report from its fishery adviser on the possibility that the establishment of the station there might cause damage to the spawning beds and that there might be other interference generally with local fisheries which I think everyone desires to continue unimpaired.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (General Mulcahy)</NameTxt>
      <P>A grant has been sanctioned <Col N="505" /> by my Department towards the cost of the provision of a new school to replace the existing boys' national school at Glenties and the arrangements for the erection of the new school are in the hands of the Commissioners of Public Works.  I understand from the commissioners that tenders for the work will be invited at an early date.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education whether he is aware of the growing shortage of primary teachers, particularly in rural districts, and, if so, if he will state what proposals are under consideration in his Department for dealing with the matter; further, if he will make a general statement in regard to the recruitment of teachers for national schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the shortage of trained teachers for service in national schools.  To deal with the situation, the following measures have been adopted:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  It has been arranged as a temporary measure that in certain circumstances principal, assistant and lay assistant teachers may be retained in the service until the end of the quarter in which they reach 68 years of age.</P>
      <P>(2)  In addition to increased accommodation which it has been found possible to secure in St. Patrick's and Mary Immaculate Training Colleges, for men and women respectively, provision for the accommodation of 55 extra women students in Our Lady of Mercy Training College was made with effect from September, 1954, and accommodation for a further 65 women students will be available in that college as from September, 1955.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(3)  As a temporary measure, from September next, pass university graduates (as well as honours graduates) accepted as training college candidates will be permitted to complete the training course in one year, instead of two as was the practice hitherto.  This will result in an increased output of trained teachers from <Col N="506" /> the training colleges.  The question of how the supply of trained teachers may be increased still further is being examined.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands if he will state the present position in regard to the erection of a fence, starting at octerlinn Chapel, Rathmullan, and ending at Croghan, between the Batts and Fenton estates, County Donegal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. Blowick) Joseph Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Blowick)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Batt and Fenton estates have both been vested in the tenants for many years and the Land Commission are not prepared to undertake the construction of the fence described by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it be too much to expect the commission to have given that reply to the representations made to them about six months ago, or do we have to wait for a year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy made representations some time prior to June last and was informed then that they were not prepared to undertake the fencing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the difference now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>For the Deputy's information, I might point out to him that one of those estates was vested in 1902 and the other in 1925.  The Land Commission has no responsibility for land once the ownership is vested in the tenant.  This is the first time that this has been raised and it is a strange thing&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid the Minister has misunderstood.  I made representations which eventually reached the Land Commission upwards of six or eight months ago.  Now I find this is a matter which they cannot deal with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy got a written reply from the Land Commission on the 11th July last stating that the Land Commission&mdash;in reply to his representations&mdash;were not prepared to undertake the fencing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice whether he received a petition to reduce a sentence of imprisonment in a certain case, and whether he rejected the petition; further, whether he subsequently altered his decision in the case, and, if so, the reasons therefor.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Everett) James Everett">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Everett)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case to which the Deputy refers the prisoner was released a few days before Christmas, 1954.  Prior to that several petitions were disallowed as I considered that the time was not ripe for clemency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister state why he did not reply to my letter of the 30th December seeking for the information now requested in this question, and if I made representations why had not his Department the courtesy to inform me that this prisoner was going to be released?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy made representations in June or July.  The other Deputies made representations in September and they received a similar reply to the Deputy that I was not prepared to release him.  His wife made an appeal on the 7th December on behalf of her seven children and I considered that it would be unjust to keep him in and punish the seven children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's further reply, and his suggestion that the wife made representations and pointed out the fact that she had seven children, does the Minister agree that I gave all those salient factors in June?  Is it also true that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, Deputy Keyes, made further representations after I had failed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs made representations on the 23rd September and received a similar reply to that which I sent to the Deputy.  I regret if the Deputy <Col N="508" /> sent a letter on the 30th December which did not come before me.  The prisoner was released on the 24th or the 20th.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the letter of the 29th July, 1954, which the Minister sent me and in which he said that he had given full consideration to all the facts and circumstances and was not prepared to interfere with the decision of the court and he regretted that the law must take its course, will the Minister state what new features occurred since?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture whether he is aware that the manufacturers of artificial manures have announced in the public Press that the cost of fertilisers is being increased by 12½ per cent., and, if so, whether, in view of the consequent increased production costs, he will reconsider the price fixed for wheat and feeding barley in the coming season.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EugeneGilbride" hpid="Mr. Gilbride Mr. Gilbride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilbride</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture whether, in view of the statement recently made by importers and distributors of fertilisers that the Minister for Industry and Commerce was prepared to sanction an increase in prices, he will make a statement in regard to the effect such an increase will have on farmers' production costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to <Col N="509" /> reply to Questions Nos. 7 and 8 together.</P>
      <P>I am not aware that the fertiliser manufacturers announced that the cost of fertilisers would be increased by 12½ per cent., but I understand that an application to increase the price of certain fertilisers by less than 3 per cent. has been approved by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I do not propose to make any change in the prices already announced for wheat of the 1955 crop.  A price has not been fixed for feeding barley of the 1955 crop, but growers are assured that the price will not fall below 40/- a barrel delivered for barley in good sound condition and suitable for grinding into feed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister expect to get feeding barley at 40/- this year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the farmers will get the maximum price which the world prices will permit, but I propose to ensure that in no circumstances can they be required to accept less than 40/- a barrel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>And the Minister is, therefore, prepared to leave this country in the same position after next harvest as he alleged he was left in after this harvest&mdash;that he had to go abroad and pay whatever prices were demanded?  Is that the attitude of the Minister now?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite that reply of December last, could not this matter be dealt with under the Flood Relief Bill of which so much was promised?

      <P>asked the Minister for Defence whether he is aware that stoppages of £4 per month have been made from the special allowance payable under the Army Pensions Acts to D.P. 22118 to recover a debt due to the Land Commission, and, if so, if he will state the statutory authority under which these stoppages have been made, and if he will take steps to have the full allowance restored to the man concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the stoppages in question.  The statutory authority for the stoppage of moneys due or owing to a State authority is contained in the Army Pensions Acts, 1923 to 1953.  The specific provision is in Section 13 of the Army Pensions Act, 1949 (No. 19 of 1949), which replaced sub-section (10) (3) of the Act of 1923 as amended by Section 21 of the Act of 1932.  Payment of the special allowance at the full rate will be resumed as soon as the amount due to the Land Commission has been recovered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that, in the case of these special allowances, it was the intention of the Oireachtas to give these allowances without any deductions?  He must be aware that the allowance is payable to enable Old I.R.A. men to exist above the starvation level.  A man must qualify in respect of means and of being totally incapable of earning his living, and, in view of the terms under which a man can obtain the special allowance, will the Minister see to it that the stoppages in this case are returned to the individual?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is bound by statute.  I can pay it or the Deputy can pay it, but the statute lays it down that the stoppage must be made.  If the Deputy feels that the Act should be amended in some respect, he should seek to have that amendment made when the opportunity arises.</P>

Would it hold in law?</P>

    <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, there is inevitably delay in making the necessary arrangements to give effect to any new scheme.  There was the further complication in the case of Cork City that it was necessary to determine whether the South Cork Board of Public Assistance or the Cork Corporation would administer the allowances scheme.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>When the debate closed last evening, I was dealing with the question whether the County Management Act of 1940 had effected the improvements in local government legislation that it was set up to effect. I have no hesitation in saying that it has not.  It was supposed to effect a good deal of economy.  It was supposed to co-ordinate local government services and generally give to the people a better system of local government than they hitherto enjoyed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What do we find since 1940?  The principal feature we find under the County Management Act, 1940, is that you have this small country swarming with hordes of highly-paid officials all enjoying substantial salaries, plus travelling allowances.  That is the main measure which in my opinion the County Management Act, 1940, has effected in this country.  I have no doubt that if the position which obtained prior to 1939 was in existence during the past ten years the number <Col N="519" /> of these officers would not be near as great as it is to-day.  I am not implying in my statement that there was need for some improvement.  I appreciate the difficulty of the elected members of a local authority dealing with minor matters, but I believe that the people who are put on county councils by the general public are entitled to direct policy; that power was taken from them in 1940 and it is clear that this Act does not give the power to them in any measure of consequence.</P>
    <P>Another important reason for the introduction of the County Management Act, 1940&mdash;some would say it is one of the main reasons&mdash;was that a good deal of corruption existed in local authorities; in other words, that county councillors in this country were incapable of carrying out the duties assigned to them in a straightforward and honest manner.  That was a very important point in the bringing in of the County Management Act, 1940.  If we examine that contention we find that all Governments in this country believe in the maxim which we very much objected to when it was used by the British: that the Irish people were not fit to govern themselves.  That was the implication behind the introduction of the County Management Act when corruption was generally alleged in local bodies.</P>
    <P>I believe it is a great reflection on local authority representatives.  I also believe from my own personal knowledge that irrespective of what Party local authority representatives are elected from they are generally honest, and reasonably capable and efficient.  I am definitely of opinion that probably as much corruption exists in local authorities to-day as it ever did under the system which obtained prior to the 1940 County Management Act.  If this allegation of corruption in local authorities is true, is it not reasonable to assume that the same allegation can be made against the members of the Government or against Deputies elected to this House?  Are we not all elected on the same basis? Every county councillor in this country was elected by the votes of the people, <Col N="520" /> mainly by the votes of his own neighbours and I have sufficient respect for the intelligence of the Irish people to know that they will not elect to any county council in this country a councillor who is not worthy of such a position, except in very isolated cases.</P>
    <P>In addition, if an unworthy representative of the people secured election and if he failed to implement any assurances he gave to the electorate, the people get an opportunity periodically of removing him from office or at least of passing judgment on him. Every member of a county council retains his position only for such time as he retains the confidence of the people.  Can we, as members of this House and members of successive Governments, claim that almost all power should be removed from these councillors and that any powers allowed to them should be of little or no consequence?</P>
    <P>I have indicated the position of local councillors, but let us take the position of the county manager.  The county manager is appointed by the Local Appointments Commission.  He is assigned to a county and if he does not measure up to the requirements of the people who put him there it is unlikely that he will be removed from office unless he commits some grave blunder.  We all know very well that once any of these officers are appointed it is almost impossible to remove them from office.

      <P>Once the county manager is appointed, he never has to go before the people for their views in regard to the way he is looking after the affairs of the county.  He never has to submit himself to the judgment of the people like the elected representatives. He is in office, and if any person feels aggrieved about any decision of his it is more than likely that he will have to bear with his grievance because the county manager cannot be approached.  That is not the position with the elected representative.  He moves among the people, and if they have a grievance they will go to him and not to the county manager.  The unfortunate position is that a county councillor has no power whatsoever in 99 cases out of 100 to help that person, unless he gets the manager to agree with him.  This puts the local representatives in the position that they are nothing more than contact men between their constituents and the county manager.  This leads up to the position that councillors have to try and get into the county manager's good offices or curry his favour in order to retain his seat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill opens up a wider avenue for corruption and misrepresentation than under the system which obtained prior to 1939.  It is not a well-known fact that if a member of a county council is not in favour with the county manager it is more difficult for him to hold his seat, and help people, than it is for a man who is on the right side of the county manager?  Unfortunately in a few counties we have the position where probably some county councillors in order to help their constituents will sacrifice to some degree their principle, if you like, on many matters, and try and agree with the county manager and the other officials.  That is the deplorable <Col N="522" /> position which obtains in this country to-day, and it is well for the Minister to bear that fact in mind.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say that he is as conversant with local government as any member of this House.  He may state that Deputies who do not agree with this measure have no practical knowledge of the subject on which they are speaking.  How is it that local authorities carried on efficiently before 1939?  How did they function at all, if what we are told now, and the statements made in support of the County Management Bill are correct?  Judging from what I have heard in County Cork&mdash;and I was not a member of the council under the old system&mdash;from members of the county council who had given service there before the County Management Act, matters were as efficiently carried out as they are to-day, with this exception, that there was much more economy effected. While services have been improved one can see in County Cork that the rates have been trebled since this new method of local government legislation came into being.  Reading over the Bill and the explanatory memorandum, there is little or nothing in it.  As I mentioned last night it is a bulky document which contains very little.</P>

      <P>It is Section 6, excuse me.  In that section there should be included temporary officers as well, because that is a new way of <Col N="523" /> giving jobs now by the county councils, which employ a number of temporary officers and keep them going until such time as they are able to get a permanent job for them at public expense, without doing any useful work.  If members of this House who believe in the City and County Management Act, and who believe that it is altogether better local government legislation&mdash;now that the Act has been in force for 14 years&mdash;I believe that the question could be posed: what useful services do the county councils give at the present time?  Why not suggest abolishing county councils?  If the members are incapable, as the general opinion here in Dublin seems to be, of carrying out any worthwhile functions, then what useful purpose do they serve?</P>

      <P>We will go into that later.  What I am now referring to is a general abolition.  Every county council is abolished if it does not obey the county manager.  Is that the position?  Is it not the position that, say, at the estimates meeting&mdash; and that is the only meeting where county councils are supposed to have any vital say at all&mdash;if the county council refuses to pass the estimate as prepared by the county manager, the manager can get the Minister, as he has got him on a number of occasions, to abolish the council?  Examining it from that light the council has no power even at that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree there is little in this Bill, and well he knows it?  Before I leave <Col N="524" /> that point, I would like again to say that if the elected members of county councils are not entitled, as they would seem not to be entitled, to powers of worthwhile consequence, a good case could be made for their abolition.  I believe that the Minister, no matter what Government is in power, should, if he has no confidence in local authority representatives, say that they should not be there at all, and abolish the farce of holding local government elections next June, costing thousands of pounds.  In County Cork 46 members from different parts of the county come to the meeting at public expense.  There are also a large number of highly paid officers at the meeting.  To my mind, the county manager is fully entitled to sit back in his chair, put cotton wool in his ears if he likes, and nothing can be done about it.  I for one expected that the Minister would do something to improve the existing position.  While he has made a step forward, I must say it is a very small step indeed.</P>
      <P>One improvement that the Bill could effect would be that the council would have a vital say in the number of officers.  It is referred to in the Bill but that power extends only to permanent officers.  I hope before the Bill becomes law it will include temporary officers and we will give over this idea which seems to have taken root of appointing temporary officers here, there and everywhere.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>If anything goes wrong in a county, it is not the county <Col N="525" /> manager who gets the blame but the county councillors who unfortunately have no responsibility for what happens.  People around the countryside who find it difficult to meet their commitments either by way of rates or taxes will comment to us how difficult it is for them to pay their rates.  They refer to swarms of officials knocking around the country employed by the council.  I believe that statement is true and the county councillors get the blame for it but they have no power whatsoever.  They are getting powers now so far as the permanent people are concerned.  It is the general opinion that county councillors have far more power than they actually have as the public are not thoroughly conversant with the terms of the County Management Act.</P>
      <P>You often hear derogatory comments on county councillors.  Possibly there is no section of the community who suffer more unfair criticism than they do.  I would say for the body with which I am associated, the Cork County Council, we have people there of all shades of opinion and while we disagree on many items I believe it can be said generally that every member of that council is in his own way trying to do the best he can for the people he represents even though his views may be quite the opposite to those of another member of the council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I deplore the practice which appears to be creeping in of people, particularly newspapers, and so on, availing of opportunities for criticising local authority representatives and commenting in the most derogatory fashion on their activities.  I think it may be put down as unfair and unjust criticism.  This is a democratic country and if any member of the public finds fault with the way the county council is carrying out its duties there is nothing to prevent him from standing at the next election and if he can secure the confidence of a sufficient number of people he can become a member himself and point out where all the improvements can be effected. Adverse comments on the activities of county councillors have come mainly <Col N="526" /> from people who if they went before the electorate might not receive a dozen votes.</P>
    <P>There is another provision in the Bill to which I wish to refer.  It deals with all officers and employees of the council.  The Minister has approved in no uncertain terms in this Bill of giving to the manager complete control over every employee of the council. If any improvement could be effected in this measure I believe it is that of giving to the elected members of a county council the right of comment on how officials or workers employed by the county council carry out their duty.  The people who are on that council representing those who have to find the wherewithal to pay all these officials should surely have a right, if the occasion demanded it, of commenting on the manner in which council officials or any of their employees carry out their duties.  It is specifically set out in this piece of legislation that elected members of the council should have no right or say as to how any officer of the council, irrespective of whether he is big or small, should carry out his work.  I hope some amendment giving power to the county councillors to have some say on the activities of the employees of the council will be embodied in this measure before it becomes law.</P>
    <P>It is also clearly set out that so far as health functions are concerned the local authority members will have no say whatever.  It is completely and entirely a managerial function and the manager can act as he thinks fit.  He is not responsible to the council for his activities in that matter nor is he obliged to make any statement as to his attitude in that connection.  Then we have the question of appointments. It may be said, of course, that that should be taken out of the hands of county councillors.  We all agree to that, but surely county councillors have the right, as members of the local authority, to get some information as to how these appointments are made.</P>
    <P>I listened very carefully to Deputy Smith, the former Minister for Local Government, speaking on that subject a few months ago in this House.  I feel sure he had first-hand information <Col N="527" /> in his capacity as Minister for Local Government.  He deplored the normal line of action now being adopted by county managers that when an appointment is to be made a selection board is set up and whoever the board recommends is appointed.  That may sound very well.  If any person then questions the county manager he knows nothing about it: &ldquo;I appointed so-and-so on the recommendation of the selection board.&rdquo;  We must bear in mind who set up the selection board.  Are not public representatives entitled to know the composition of the selection board?  Is there any danger that corruption may exist in that body just as it may exist among the elected members?  Are we to assume that every selection board set up in this State is infallible, that it is completely honest, that there is no dishonesty or personal influence in any shape or form?  I say it does exist and it is just as likely to exist in that type of board as among the elected members of the council.  I believe the manager should&mdash;subsequent to the appointment being made&mdash;at least give to the elected representatives of the local authority concerned a concise account of how the appointment was made, the number of applicants, a synopsis of the qualifications of the successful applicant together with a statement as to the composition of the selection board. That would help to do away with the allegations that some of these appointments are already decided before the selection board sits.  I wish to stress that the elected representatives of the people are entitled at least to some information as to how appointments by local authority managers are made in each case.  I feel sure the former Minister for Local Government, Deputy Smith, would not comment adversely on that system were it not that he is well aware that everything is not as it should be.</P>
    <P>Another unfortunate feature of this measure, as against the amending Bill introduced by Deputy Keyes when he was Minister for Local Government, is that no reference is made here to the <Col N="528" /> title of these administrators.  It may seem a small point but in my view the very expression &ldquo;county manager&rdquo; implies that he has full and complete power.  Every county manager is a little dictator in his own territory.  In my view, the amendment introduced into this House by Deputy Keyes to change the title of &ldquo;county manager&rdquo; to &ldquo;county officer&rdquo; was a reasonably good proposal.  It is unfortunate that even that small amendment is not contained in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies who contributed to this debate commented on the method of appointment of rate collectors in this country.  Many of them deplored the fact that rate collectors are appointed by the vote of the council. I believe we should have no rate collectors and that, instead, the rates should be collected through the office because it is a better and a more economical method.  Leaving aside, however, that question&mdash;because it is a matter for each individual council to decide upon&mdash;if we are to make appointments, I believe that an appointment made by the county council members by way of a vote is just as good as one made by a manager or interview board.  Whilst it is quite usual for county councillors at such elections to vote on a political basis, at least every candidate knows how he fares.  With a selection board, however, a candidate has no knowledge as regards his prospects, good, bad or indifferent. He is called into a quiet room, looked over by two or three individuals and, except for the successful applicant, the next thing he hears is that his application was unsuccessful. He is given no further information whatsoever.</P>
    <P>We are rather disappointed with this Bill.  It does not measure up to our requirements and it is not giving the elected representatives of the people a fair chance in this country.  If you like, it is completely leaving to the county managers the administration of millions of pounds&mdash;just as obtained hitherto. The councillors in any elected body, whether in corporations or in county councils are getting no say.  They must levy the money and, under existing legislation, the manager is entitled to spend it as he likes because very few <Col N="529" /> obstacles are placed in his way by legislation.  I hope that, before this Bill is passed through this House, some vital amendments will be made to it so that it will help to make local authority legislation much healthier than it is.</P>
    <P>I am sorry I must be critical of this measure but I believe it deserves to be criticised.  It is a very small step forward&mdash;and a welcome one&mdash;but some of us who have good experience in local authorities feel that it is disappointing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I had hoped to see in this measure not so much a curtailment of the powers of the manager as some curtailment in the powers of the Department of Local Government.  I think that is mainly where the shoe pinches. A lot of the increases to which Deputy Murphy has alluded are not increases due to action of the council or due to action of the county manager but are increases due to action of the Department of Local Government and the other different Departments.  We have bitter experience of that.  The thing has gone so far now that I suggest to the Minister that he give it an overhauling himself.  For example, we got a bill this year for a sum close on £10,000 for engineers.  We were informed that their application had been received from their organisation some time in 1952 and from 1952 to the end of 1954 the officials of the Department of Local Government were hatching on it.  The result of the hatching was that they decided the officials were entitled to the increase and that it should be given to them.  However, the retrospective payment went back to 1952.</P>

You have what amounts practically to corruption carried on in these matters. For example, on one occasion a committee of which I am a member, decided to increase the salaries of certain officials.  They sent that up for sanction to the Department.  We received a letter back stating that the Minister considered that the increase granted on a certain date was a basic increase and he, therefore, refused the application.  That was in February. There was a general election in May. Four days after the Dáil dissolved, the Minister, who was still Minister, decided to change his mind and he sent us down another letter.</P>

      <P>If not, I shall have to bring in a new Bill.  At present I do not see how local authorities, no matter how diligently they work, can work without the assistance of the county manager.  I admit that we have been very lucky in County Cork in the manager we have got.  Take the present position and consider it in relation to the proposed estimates committee.  I can see no use for that committee, to be quite frank.  At present you have a committee for housing and sanitary matters.  You have three of these in Cork County and if the Minister wishes to make one improvement I suggest that he gives them autonomous powers, not to have them as a recommending <Col N="533" /> body but to give them power to do their work in their own areas.  They need not be bringing everything into the county council afterwards for sanction because the expenditure is levied as area charges, chargeable to the particular area concerned and it is unfair to have councillors from other areas deciding whether people will get the benefit of these works or not.  Then you have a mental hospital committee and a board of assistance dealing with South Cork and Cork City.  I wish there was some clause in this Bill under which we could have a divorce of these two areas; it would give considerable relief to the ratepayers in the South Cork area.  Then you have a health committee and a sanatorium committee, an agricultural committee and a special roads committee.  You have in all eight different committees outside the county council proper.  I think that any member of the county council has his hands pretty full attending to those committees.  I admit that there are sections in this Bill for which I have looked for a very long time.</P>
      <P>When I tell the Minister that it was only a month ago that I looked for the salaries of certain officials, and I think there should be some kind of stay on the appointment of extra officials, I was informed by the legal advisers that my opinion in that respect was illegal and could not be taken.  Thank goodness, after this it will have to be taken.  Provision is made for that, and I am glad to see such provision.  Because of all the committees the members of local authorities have their hands pretty full.  I would like to impress on the Minister in that connection that every one of these committees go into their own respective estimates.  The estimates are prepared by the manager in conjunction with his officials.  They are then examined in detail by each of the committees and dealt with by them.</P>

      <P>The committee of the board of assistance is a statutory body and the manager must present his estimate to that committee for examination. The mental hospital committee is another statutory body and the manager must present his estimate to that committee.  I suggest to the Minister that in relation to the other committees, they should also be made statutory bodies and should be given full powers.  It is very unfair that if the people of South Cork decide something is required and are unanimous in that respect, their recommendation must subsequently come up before the county council and it is then the West Corkman and the North Corkman who will decide whether or not South Cork will get something and vice versa.  I think the Minister could easily give statutory powers there.  As far as the other committees are concerned, we have always looked for separate estimates and we have never had any difficulty in getting them.  Perhaps we were lucky in the managers we have got but, since the State has taken on the job of appointing the managers, it is the duty of the State to see that the manager sent down to the particular local authority receives proper instruction in his duties and responsibilities.</P>

      <P>As far as selection boards are concerned, and I have examined this matter pretty thoroughly, I agree with what Deputy M. P. Murphy has said.  I do not think these selection boards set up by the manager get the best material.  I do not think they have the knowledge and experience that is supposed to be possessed by these selection boards.  I will go further and say that, in my opinion, the elected representatives of the council should be members of every selection board.  Every selection board should have on it either the chairman or some appointed member.  In that way, some local knowledge would be brought to bear in relation to work done by such boards.</P>
      <P>I do not agree with Deputy M.P. Murphy in his remarks about discipline. If any discipline has to be exercised over officials, then the manager must have full control.  I certainly would not be prepared to take any of that responsibility from the manager. The manager is responsible for his staff and it is his duty to supervise that staff properly.  I have frequently heard Deputy M. P. Murphy very fluent in his criticism of officials who, in his opinion, were not doing their duty.  Any member of a local authority has power to do that.  I intend to bring in some amendments to this measure.  If they are not proper to this measure, then it is always open to a Deputy to bring in a private Bill and I intend to take full advantage of that.  If I cannot get it one way, I will try to get it another.</P>

      <P>This Bill should not be a very controversial measure because it has been sponsored by both sides of this House.  This system was first introduced by Cumann na nGaedheal, but it was left to Fianna Fáil to bring it into operation.  The inter-Party Government now intends to remove some of the defects that have become apparent over the years.  There are four or five major defects which, when remedied, should render the county managerial system a fairly <Col N="536" /> satisfactory one.  This will not be the final Bill.  As time goes on and local government becomes more complicated further Bills will be necessary.</P>
      <P>The question of housing, the employment of staff, the estimates committee, the issuing of tenders, the requisitions for special meetings, if necessary, are all matters that needed to be remedied and the Minister has dealt with those in this Bill.  That is a step in the right direction.  In our county we have been very lucky in getting good managers who worked harmoniously with the council.  There was very little controversy over the years.</P>
      <P>This system was first introduced because of local representatives falling down on their jobs.  Had we had the proper type of representative there would have been no necessity for a County Management Act.  Political controversy was introduced into councils and people became soured with public life.  The type of representative needed would not come forward and we were left with the third-rate and fourth-rate type seeking representation on our councils.  That type does not take responsibility very seriously.  As a result of that, the running of the county councils was anything but satisfactory and the managerial system had to be introduced to clean up the mess.  The defects that are being remedied now will allay much of the bitterness and misgivings in some counties in connection with the managerial system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The passing of the County Management Act originally brought with it an enormous increase in staffs year in and year out.  These staffs were invariably made permanent and pensionable after a month or two in office, and in each county council area now big staffs are employed.  I do not believe that the staff of Leinster House 25 years ago was as big as the staff of a county council to-day.  That is a thing I do not like because I am quite satisfied we have far too much staff.  I do agree that things have become more complicated and that there is more work, but I am equally satisfied that if those people on the staffs of county councils would work their due share there is no <Col N="537" /> need for us to be cluttering up our offices with so much permanent staff. I am satisfied also that as far as tenders are concerned it is only right that public representatives should have the right to examine them before they are given because there are many things that do happen at the moment in which local representatives should have a say.  I think now that the public representatives have the right to see the tenders being opened, these things will not happen in future.  That is a provision that will allay some grievances in my county.</P>
    <P>As far as the giving out of houses is concerned, I am satisfied that before the County Managerial Act came in it was a public scandal in my county. Unless you became a strong member of Fianna Fáil in those days you could not get a house because all voting was on the Party line and Fianna Fáil had the majority in the council, with the result that whether the man was most deserving or not the man Fianna Fáil wanted got the house.  Since the Managerial Act came in its operation has immensely improved that position. Houses are now given out in my county on merit.  There may be a few grievances, but by and large, the allocation of houses is giving a fair amount of satisfaction due to the manner in which the Managerial Act was operated in my county.  Again where my county is concerned we will not feel much of a change through the passing of this Bill because the council and the manager&mdash; there were a few managers&mdash;have always worked in fair good harmony. Though the manager had the power and could do certain things he always consulted us and took a broad minded view of the work on which he allowed the county council to co-operate.  That is, of course, with the exception of the appointment of staffs.  In that particular domain we had some grievances.</P>
    <P>However, as far as the giving out of houses was concerned there was a fair amount of satisfaction in my county. In any case where there was a controversial issue about the allocation of a house the councillors for the particular area concerned always got a note from the manager asking for their views on <Col N="538" /> the five or six applicants for a particular house.  That would arise only where there was a controversial element involved.  The manager could not know at all times who was the right person to have appointed and so he would ask for the viewpoints of the local representatives in the district concerned and he always got good guidance.  The manager always held over the controversial problems and consulted the people from the area concerned in such problems.  In such cases he nearly always came to a final decision that a certain person was the right person on the views expressed by the councillors from the particular area.  He was always satisfied that such things were matters which a manager should concede to us and which he might not if he did not like.</P>
    <P>But in the past before we had any county managers there was far too much wire-pulling.  Everything was done through the medium of political pull.  The coming into force of the managerial system eliminated that to a great extent.  If it were not for the advent of the Managerial Act I am satisfied that most of the people on my side of the House in my county would have had to emigrate if they stood in need of a house because they would not have got a house under the old system.  Neither would they have got work on the roads had the Managerial Act not come into being and had it not cleared up the mess.  I always supported the country management system as an improvement on local administration.  But then we had the county managers tending to form their own organisations and we have now a managers' association and I do believe such an association could be a menace and should be nipped in the bud. There is too much of a tendency nowadays towards regimentation.  People try to get more control than they are entitled to so that they can force their way too much.  I would ask the Minister to keep a close eye on those associations and see that too much power does not get centralised in them so that they would not be able to force the Government and the Ministers concerned to do certain things.  I know the Minister is a strong man who will <Col N="539" /> see what is going on and nip it in the bud if necessary.</P>
    <P>I am glad also that councils cannot now, under this Bill, hide behind the manager's cloak.  Since the Act came into force there has been a great lot of talk by certain members of local councils who say: &ldquo;Since this so and so Act was brought in we have no powers and if we had the powers what would we not do.&rdquo;  All was blamed on the manager.  I am satisfied that much of that blame would rightly rest on the councils and I am equally satisfied they have now got back some powers and I hope they will act up to them so that they will always stand up to their duties and not throw the blame on the managers as heretofore.  Everybody wants to take the easy way, and up to now certain local representatives always had the excuse if anything went wrong that the blame was with the manager.  And it was not the manager's fault at all.  The blame should have been on the clamour for more services from the people and on the weak type of councillors who fell for that clamour.  That was the cause of most of the high costs of our local councils.  There was too much sucking after people.  Because councillors listened to the clamours thousands of pounds were squandered and wasted.</P>
    <P>I hope the coming local elections will remedy things, supported by the enactment of this measure.  I hope these things will result in a better type of local administration and in a better type of representative being elected. We have had far too many of the you-scratch-me-and-I-will-scratch-you type of candidate getting elected.  I hope we shall have a change now and root out these people from our local councils.  We want manly, strong people in our local councils.  We want that type of person on all sides of our council chambers.  Up to the moment on all sides of the chamber we have had four or five hangers-on who have the gift of the gab at the crossroads and in the public houses and who have had the sleight-of-hand.  These people have always got elected though they were by no means the right type of people.  I do hope that when the <Col N="540" /> public now see that the local representatives will have more powers they will try to elect the right type of people and not put in the mollycods and the sidheoga that we have elected over the past 40 years.  These type of representatives were no credit to the people who elected them.  Now with more power in the hands of the local representatives I want to see more manly, progressive councillors and better work being done on behalf of our people and I want to see the scratch-me system cut out.  I want to see no such thing as wire pulling.  I do not want to see men putting their hands out behind their backs for money for doing certain things.  Those things happened and I hope we shall now see the last of them.  These are the things that nobody but the public can remedy and I am now appealing to the public to do their duty in the coming elections. I want to see the public refusing to elect a bad man whether he be on the Fine Gael or the Fianna Fáil side.  I want to see these bad men rooted out.  I want to see that we get public representatives in office who will do their duty and who will use cautiously and well the extra powers that now are being given to them.</P>
    <P>With the changes in the managerial system now brought in by the Minister I am satisfied that things can be run in a much better way and much more smoothly.  As far as the preparation of the estimates is concerned I always found full co-operation from the county manager and from the county engineer and his staff.  The council were always given an opportunity of giving their views sitting from morning till night examining the estimates.  Of course it will be realised that the manager and the engineer always bring in high estimates because they know quite well that the council will cut them down. The manager is always certain that his estimates will be cut down and I have always found the manager quite happy after the council's tightening up of his figures.  No matter how much we cut his estimates I think he always had the feeling that he still got more than he expected.</P>
    <P>On every occasion high estimates are put before the council because the <Col N="541" /> manager and the staff know that the council will cut them.  Therefore the estimates require very close scrutiny and they should always be cut.</P>
    <P>There has been reasonably good harmony in local administration and were it not for the fact that the managers were there there were occasions on which we would not have been able to get on as well as we did.  The manager always tries to remove the difficulties and to give a guide and a lead.  That applies also to the county engineer. In future we will be able to have a better type of council and, I hope, a better type of representative, and the county manager will not be a boss but a leader and a guide to the people. I hope that his services will be at all times available to the public representatives so that we can have clean, healthy, good administration, and that any money spent will be spent wisely on behalf of the people who have to pay it.</P>

      <P>I am very sorry that certain Deputies and Ministers are not in the House because when the County Management (Amendment) Bill was being discussed in February, 1954, most of its opponents and critics who now form the Coalition Government regarded it as a joke and called for what might be called the complete abolition of county management.  I have here some quotations.  In Volume 144 of the Official Report, column 1049, the present Tánaiste referred to the County Management (Amendment) Bill, 1953, in these terms:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;...whether or not this Bill is passed does not matter twopence so far as the powers of local authorities are concerned.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I am sorry.  It is worth while putting on record his attitude. He is a member of one of the Government Parties and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government who is putting the Bill through the House.  At column 1062 of Volume 144, Deputy Davin, as he then was, said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I and my colleagues who are members of this group&rdquo;</P>
      <P>&mdash;that is, the Labour Group&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;at different periods violently opposed the managerial system.  I thought it a ridiculous thing that, in 1929, five or six years after we had received the authority of the people to form a Government to manage our own affairs&mdash;and the electors who are responsible for election of Deputies to this House were equally responsible for the selection and election of members of local authorities....&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He was violently opposed to it but I take it that, while he might be opposed to it still, he is not so violent.</P>
      <P>Now we come to the gem.  The present Minister for Lands, the leader of the Clann na Talmhan Party, at column 1118 of Volume 144, was responsible for this emphatic sentence:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I think it is generally admitted by everybody, except Fianna Fáil Deputies, that the county managerial system established some years ago was a first-class administrative blunder.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Deputy who has just spoken, Deputy Giles, says it was a good thing to bring in the managerial system in order to take away from Fianna Fáil councillors the power and the practice of allocating houses and giving jobs to Fianna Fáil supporters.  It seems strange that on the one hand we should have the present Minister for Lands, then Deputy Blowick, accusing Fianna Fáil of a first-class administrative blunder in bringing in the managerial system and, on the other hand, Deputy Giles saying it was a good thing that it was brought in.</P>

Many of us thought and I, in particular, thought that there would be a radical change in the present situation and that very substantial control would be restored to public representatives on local authorities and that the Minister in going around the country ascertaining the views of the various councils he visited was seeking advice on that.  If anybody reads my speech in the debate on this matter when it was last before the House under the former Administration, he will find that then, as now, I was in favour of the managerial system, but with a certain release from the stranglehold on both elected representatives and managers by the Custom House.  When I speak of restoring powers to the elected representatives I mean that they should be restored to the local authority, which consists of the elected representatives and the manager, and that between them they should be allowed to manage their affairs with as little interference and as little dictatorial control as possible.</P>

      <P>The Minister will find that I will be reasonable and fair in my criticism of this Bill.  I hope he will seriously consider the suggestions which I shall make.  I make those suggestions, not for the purpose of scoring but, as I think the House will agree, with a view to creating better local administration and a happier set of circumstances between the representatives, the managers and the Department of Local Government.  We do not want to be always fighting, bickering and exchanging letters.  We want to be able to manage our affairs and we submit willingly to that control which the Department is entitled to assert and exert over us.</P>
      <P>Section 2, sub-section (1) says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Subject to the provisions of this section, a local authority may by resolution direct that, before the manager performs any specified executive function of the local authority, he shall inform the members of the local authority of the manner in which he proposes to perform that function, and the manager shall comply with the resolution.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That would be all right if you did not have sub-section (3), which removes from the control of the local representatives any matter relating to staff. Sub-section (3) says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A resolution under sub-section (1) of this section shall not apply or extend to the performance of any function of the manager in relation to the officers or servants of a local authority or the control, supervision, service, remuneration, privileges or superannuation of such officers or servants or any of them, and any resolution purporting to be passed under sub-section (1) of this section which contravenes this sub-section shall be void.&rdquo;</P>

If that were to be applied to this House and if it were to be suggested that the Civil Service was to be <Col N="545" /> put on a basis where that sub-section should apply, you would have a very strange state of affairs.  I think the Minister wants to be as reasonable as he can and wants to make whatever improvements he is making to meet the point of view expressed by public representatives generally all over the country.  But I ask him to consider that surely sub-section (2) has little or no meaning when you take sub-section (3) into account.</P>
    <P>We come now to Section 3 which says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Where the members of a local authority are informed pursuant to Section 2 of this Act of any works (not being works which the local authority are required by or under statute or by order of a court to undertake), the local authority may by resolution direct that the works shall not be proceeded with, and the manager shall comply with the resolution.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Of course staffs are not involved here but you have that in any event.  If the manager comes to us and says&mdash;and I can speak only as a result of my experience of the City of Dublin administration and cannot tell how things operate elsewhere&mdash;that he wants to spend £50,000 on erecting a building for a certain purpose, we have power at the moment to say &ldquo;no&rdquo; because we are the people, the direct representatives, who strike the rate, on the final analysis of the expected expenditure for the ensuring year.  We can say we are not going on with that job.  I agree that it is no harm to have it clarified, in case there is any doubt in existing legislation; but so far as Dublin is concerned that has been the manner in which it has been operated. We have no objection to that section except in so far as it again excludes any reference whatever to staff.  I do not know whether new staff taken on would be brought into it.</P>
    <P>Section 4 deals with the things a local authority may require the manager to do&mdash;any act which could lawfully be done or for which money has been provided.  The resolution must be signed by three members. There is no objection to that section <Col N="546" /> except other than that we cannot deal with&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Might I suggest that a good deal of this would be more proper on the Committee Stage?  We are dealing now with the general principles of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but I must refer to it section by section in order to come to the general viewpoint on it. The Minister in introducing it dealt with certain sections to explain the policy behind them and those sections are all related to what might be regarded as a change of policy.  I want to emphasise that right through this Bill the safeguard is there, from the Department of Local Government point of view, copper fastening in section after section the removal of the right of the elected representatives to have any say whatsoever in connection with officials who are in the service or who may be appointed.  That is one of the things that I certainly object to.  I am wondering whether the Minister will accept the suggestion, when the Committee Stage comes, which may be put to him in the form of amendments or whether he himself would be prepared to introduce amendments.</P>
      <P>I do not want to see a long harangue on this.  It is not worth it really, for the changes being made.  I do not want to see the Dáil held for 30 or 40 hours discussing this particular Managerial Bill.  It is not worth it. The amount of changes being effected does not warrant that, but nevertheless there has to be a strong stand taken on certain issues.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 4 tells you you can do certain things.  A certain number of individuals, three of them, can call by their signatures for a special meeting for the purpose of putting before a special meeting, if not an ordinary meeting, a special resolution; but Section 4 again says that can be done only so long as it does not concern staff matters.  Why this emphasis, right through the Bill, in every <Col N="547" /> section, for fear there may be any doubt that even under that section something might slip in which would give you a right to approach your own employees, your own servants, even in the case of what you might call humane things?  The Bill says &ldquo;no&rdquo; and it is cut out, for fear it may be concluded that it is involved there.</P>
      <P>Every one of us on public authorities knows that we must be concerned with the doings of our officials.  We must be satisfied that their welfare is such that they are working under happy conditions.  The master of the local authority is the public, through the representatives who are sent there by the public for the administration of local authorities.  The sooner those in the Custom House get that into their heads the better it will be for local administration.  As Deputy de Valera said, these things are brought in by ways in which you cannot possibly detect them.  I am only able to put my finger on them because I have read this Bill many times since it was circulated. I did not think it was going to be taken in such a hurry.  I have read it ever since I got it.  I have taken it to bed with me and the first thing in the morning I have taken another look at it.</P>
      <P>Section 5 deals with the appointment of a manager and again I cannot understand the peculiar manner in which we go to amend existing legislation and what the amendments of previous legislation are.  This brings about a situation which makes it difficult to know how you are supposed to act when you are discussing something.  Section 5 deals with the appointment of a manager. Section 53 sub-section (3) of the Local Government (Dublin) Act, 1930, provided that &ldquo;the appointment of a person to be a manager shall be made by the council.&rdquo;  That was the original situation&mdash;that the manager was appointed by the council in a certain way.  This sub-section was repealed by Section 13 of the Local Government (Dublin) Act, 1940, and this provided that the appointment would be made by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="548" /> Now we come to this Section 13 of the Act of 1940 which is being repealed by the present Bill, and Section 5 thereof provides for all applications being made to the Local Appointments Commission by the council before the commencement of the Order in Section 14 of the Bill&mdash;the application must be a joint one from the city council and Dublin council.  The power of the council to appoint a temporary manager pending the appointment of a permanent manager is not being restored and the temporary appointment will now be made by the Minister. This is a most confusing situation. Under this Bill, which has now, after a very stormy and rough passage, reached its present stage, a position arises where the city manager of a particular local authority, having reached a certain age, will be permitted to retire on pension.  He has the right to exercise his retirement, say, next June, and next June there is to be an election so that the City of Dublin is faced with the possibility of a new city manager, or a temporary one, and immediately after that, a new city council.  Deputy Larkin will quite appreciate the difficulty that could arise then.  You may have a complete change in the composition of the council.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. D. Larkin Mr. D. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>It might depend on the council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.  Nobody would know where they were.  It is unfortunate that those two situations are about to clash.  Nevertheless, assuming the present city manager were to exercise his right and retire as he will have a statutory right to do, we have the position where the Minister would step in and appoint our temporary manager whereas previously we appointed or nominated a temporary manager to carry on until such time as the proper care and precautions would be taken to secure a successor of the calibre required for the management of a city like Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am wondering whether, first of all, the Minister will recognise the seriousness of the sequence of events and whether he would be prepared to consider this&mdash;that no matter who the <Col N="549" /> manager is who is appointed or selected, no matter how he is selected, at least there should be a period of trial before he becomes permanently married to the local authority, because there can be no divorce except under very peculiar and special circumstances. We may get a manager and everything may look grand.  He may appear to have all the qualifications necessary and all the capabilities but it may turn out that the job is too big for him, that he is not able to do the job properly and everybody&mdash;the Minister and the local authority and the city&mdash; is saddled with this man who might become a misfit.  I want the Minister to understand there is only one position of manager in the City of Dublin.  We have had some experience now of the managerial system and the managerial system has not worked out, generally speaking, badly, notwithstanding the fact that managers were appointed into a new system and there were practically none who could have been said to have had experience.  But to-day we have men of considerable experience who are acting as managers and the representatives and the Department of Local Government all have a considerable amount of experience and some of us have more knowledge than others and others have a good deal of knowledge. I want to appeal to the Minister to consider seriously between this and the Committee Stage whether there is not something in what I say&mdash;that there is a certain danger, particularly where you may take a person who is not a local authority official and who is not a civil servant, but who may have what appear to be outstanding abilities and who, even in the opinion of a great number of people, even in the opinion of a selection board, might appear to be the answer to the prayer for the most suitable and desirable person to be the manager of the City of Dublin. But then he may not turn out to be such, and then where do we go from there?  I certainly am going to give that particular matter a certain amount of thought and I think it is something of considerable importance to us.  I would like to refer again to the position that will arise in Dublin after June. We will have the local authority election. <Col N="550" /> We will have a temporary manager for a limited period.  We do not know who will be appointed by the Minister under this Bill but we know whom we would appoint as temporary manager until the council gets going, and is able to go through the performance of looking for a new man.  We would obviously appoint one of the present assistant managers.  Then we know we are not making a violent change from policy or procedure, and at least the man knows the job, and he would soon get to know whatever was required.</P>
    <P>Section 6 again requires some reexamination by the Minister and I hope the Minister will bear with me. Section 6 says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The manager shall not submit any proposal to vary the number of permanent offices under a local authority for the sanction of such Minister as may be empowered to sanction the proposal save with the consent by resolution of the local authority.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That sounds all right, but Deputy Murphy from the Labour Benches was talking about temporary employees. Would the Minister agree that temporary and permanent employees, all employees, should come under the same umbrella?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>We are trying to do that by way of regulation, where you may only employ them for nine months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Take it from me, unless that is put in the same way as in the case of permanent appointments we are going to have trouble.  What happens is that as the Minister says you cannot employ temporary staff for a period longer than nine months, but they can be re-employed for another nine months&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>No, we want power to prevent the position arising which could arise and which sometimes does <Col N="551" /> arise where temporary staff grow up and some of them have been reappointed and reappointed and the position then is that the manager comes along and says: &ldquo;I am going to make these permanent&rdquo; and the local authority says: &ldquo;You are not going to take in another 50 permanent staff?&rdquo;: he says: &ldquo;You do not expect me to pitch that many out of work because I must either make them permanent or let them go.&rdquo; We want to avoid that position.  We want to know where we are.</P>
      <P>It is no secret that members of the Dublin Corporation are at this moment faced with the situation of a certain section of our undertaking suddenly having added to it numbers of new officials about whom none of us knew anything, but for the payment of whose remuneration we must make provision in the coming year's estimate. The Minister can do no harm if he puts such of the corporation servants or officials as are temporary in this section and lets the manager say: &ldquo;I need another 15 typists or 15 engineers temporarily&rdquo;, and then let us decide whether he should make the necessary request to the Minister for sanction. Is there anything unreasonable in that?  Why is this particular door to be left open?  I can tell the Minister that I do not like it and I will fight very hard against it, although I do not think a fight should be necessary.</P>

      <P>The Minister sees what I have in mind, I think. Sections 7 to 10 deal with the estimates committee meetings and I have only one suggestion to make in that regard.  I am not opposing anything in these sections, but I want to make a suggestion for a better understanding of them.  Perhaps the Minister intends that what I have in mind is to be the case.  It would be preferable if, on the passing of the Act, the Minister would prescribe the period and the form of the estimates once only, subject to his being authorised to prescribe in future years, on request by a council, any new form.  The present position is that there is a prescribed form, but we have to apply formally every year, to go through the performance, and I should like the Minister to say: &ldquo;While I will prescribe the period and the form, you can carry on from year to year unless it is altered either at your request or by me for any particular reason.&rdquo;  The Minister will find that it is fair for me to conclude that under these sections we must apply every year.</P>

      <P>We come now to Section 11 and again I should like the Minister to understand a difficulty, because he is trying to close a door, but it is not being closed.  The section deals with limitation on expenditure and it reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  At any time after they have adopted an estimate of expenses, a local authority may, as respects the local financial year to which the estimate relates, authorise by resolution the expenditure of money or the incurring of a liability in excess of the expenditure for any particular purpose specified in the estimate.</P>
      <P>(2)  Save with an authorisation given by resolution under sub-section (1) of this section, the total amount of money expended and liability incurred by a local authority as respects any local financial year for any particular purpose specified in the estimate of expenses for that year shall not exceed the total amount specified in that estimate in respect of that purpose.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>What I want to avoid is the manager coming to the finance committee or to the estimates committee and saying: &ldquo;I am sorry, boys.  I had to spend this extra £20,000 and I want you to sanction it now.&rdquo;  I want that section to include some protection in the form of some wording to ensure that he will not come <i>post facto.</i></P>

If the new council says they do not want their manager to be manager for Dún Laoghaire and County Borough as well we want the right to say that.  But the Bill says that will only be so if Dublin City and the County Borough make the demand. The position remains as it is.  I say that is most unfair to us in Dublin. We want a city manager of our own. We do not want to have the farce that operates continued.  The position is that the city manager, when there is a conflict between ourselves and the county, tells us: &ldquo;I will have to write to the county manager.&rdquo;  He then goes out and sits in a seat elsewhere and he is then the county manager.  He writes back to the city manager and says that the county manager cannot do so and so.</P>

We will supply you with water for a certain number of years but after a certain date if you have not built your reservoir we will charge you so much per 1,000 gallons for excess water used.&rdquo;  What happens?  They do not build the reservoir.  We send out our bill and I, as chairman of the finance committee, with the full agreement of the other 44 members, say to our city manager: &ldquo;Collect this £20,000 off the Dún Laoghaire Borough Council.&rdquo;  The city manager is pressed by their committee to know how the payment of this £20,000, which would mean 3/- or 4/- in the rates, can be avoided.  He is asked to get the boys in Dublin to wait or wipe it out as it would only mean 2d. in the £ on the rates in Dublin.  The point is that I will not be a party to inflicting on the ratepayers of Dublin a charge to provide water for the ratepayers of another area.  When this matter arose my advice was and still is that the Dún Laoghaire Borough Council should pay us whatever they owe and ask the Minister to permit them to borrow the money for this purpose and pay it off over 35 years.</P>

Take what happened when we wanted to extend the area.  We had to have an inquiry between us and the County Dublin in connection with taking in the additional area.  The city manager was no use to either of us. He had to keep out of it because he had to serve two places honestly and he could not do it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I say it is a farcical situation to have three competing interests with the one managing director in respect of each of them. That is what I am saying is farcical. The Minister says: &ldquo;All right, boys, if both agree to make this demand I may meet you.&rdquo;  It does not say &ldquo;I <Col N="558" /> shall&rdquo; or &ldquo;I will&rdquo;.  This is one section of the Bill in respect of which I am going to try and get all the support I can in this House to have remedied if the Minister will not meet it.  I think it is ridiculous.  Every day in the week you have some conflicting interests between the two or three bodies and you have the poor man who is responsible for all three of them trying to make a decision which will satisfy every one of the authorities. That is impossible.  There is no person on this earth and there never has been so far as I know in the past 1,000 years who could sort out a situation like that to the satisfaction of the individuals concerned.</P>
      <P>Section 17 deals with the delegation of powers by the manager to others.  I want to know if the Minister is prepared to take the view that instead of having what are called assistant city managers we have deputy managers and that the manager can then delegate to these deputy managers whatever powers are necessary?  The Bill says that if the city manager happens to be absent through illness or otherwise he can delegate power to a deputy and specify who the deputy can be and what rank he should hold.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dublin City controls an area and a population of some magnitude.  I think it might be considered&mdash;I do not know whether the House will agree with me or not&mdash;that for a city like Dublin it might be necessary to have a manager and three deputy managers.  We have an assistant city manager who is completely in charge of housing and who, by virtue of his appointment, is, in fact, more a deputy of the manager and who can make orders and directions on his own.  I do not know whether the manager is responsible in full or not, but the position is not a proper one.  I should like the Minister to consider the manager having either two or three deputies.  To these only should powers, held by the manager, be delegated.  The Bill is very funny, of course, on that particular point.  If the manager, for any reason whatsoever, wants to appoint a deputy, what has he got to do?  He consults the Lord Mayor.  He is not obliged to <Col N="559" /> accept the advice of the Lord Mayor.</P>
    <P>What is the purpose of putting this into the Bill?  It is what one would call window dressing.  If the city manager has to go away and is going to appoint a deputy, he can consult with the Lord Mayor, and he may agree or not.  &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; you say, &ldquo;he has power to appoint a deputy&rdquo; for the Bill suggests he can by agreement with the Lord Mayor whoever he may be.  After all the deputy knows that in his absence he is going to be city manager.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am suggesting is the way out.  With assistant city managers or deputy city managers, any one of whom he can appoint, there may be no problem, no quarrel and no misunderstanding.  That is the proper way of dealing with the matter.  To my mind these theoretical ways are extraordinarily childish, and to put into the Bill something which means nothing is an absolute waste of print. It says how he will do it, but if the other fellow does not agree he will do it his own way anyhow.  Why put it in at all?  A reasonably sensible city manager, if it was not in the Bill, would say: &ldquo;I am going off on leave of absence&rdquo;, or he may say: &ldquo;If it is agreeable to you So-and-so could act in my absence&rdquo;.  His deputy will have full responsibility, and what the deputy does will be the city manager's responsibility.  What I am suggesting is, in fact, the best method of dealing with it.  Abolish this idea of assistant city managers with certain rights and powers.  The city manager has his deputies, and let him delegate to them or tell them whatever he wants to do, if he has to go away.  Nothing in Section 18 points out that at present the appointment of a deputy manager is not subject to the confirmation of the Minister, but under the section the appointment will be subject to the Minister's approval.  The manager goes through the formality of having a consultation with the Lord Mayor, and whether they agree or not the <Col N="560" /> Minister comes in and says: &ldquo;I think the manager should say yes.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>He could have if he had survived as Minister for Local Government. If you will read the report of the debate on the Bill you will see that my amendment was no different then.</P>
      <P>I am not approaching this bit of legislation from a Party standpoint.  I am approaching it with a view to securing, with the little experience or knowledge I have, the best way from the point of view of good local government administration.  I want to get rid of a lot of schoolboy ideas about efficient management that probably came from some debating society, with no real relation to practice whatsoever.  That is why I say that is a very poor situation. The Lord Mayor does or does not agree, and so if &ldquo;X&rdquo; is the deputy manager appointed the Minister can say: &ldquo;No, I do not agree.  I would not have him.  I am appointing So-and-so&rdquo;. But &ldquo;So-and-so&rdquo; is not known to us.  He might be any kind of person, but certainly we know nothing about him; he is being dumped in on us, and may be good in his way.  The Minister has full powers.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will not press this section because it is bringing the city management back again to the farce from which we want to get away, from the position in which the Custom House will run the City of Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Giles talked of the hope of a good type of candidate putting forward for the next local elections.  I can assure the Minister that unless he gives these people a full and complete feeling that they are going to manage, with their own manager, the affairs of the city, that their views will be taken note of, and that they will not be this &ldquo;cupboard at the back&rdquo; from which <Col N="561" /> every now and then a curtain is pulled back and a hammer comes down on the head of everything, we are going back again to a position of unhappiness in this matter of local management. I object to that.  There will be two deputy managers in the City of Dublin in future, and it is quite possible under this section and I would say it is almost possible or it is almost probable, that even if the manager were to appoint one of his own deputy managers the Minister could say: &ldquo;No.  I will not accept him as deputy manager when you are away&rdquo;. What confidence can we have in our managerial system if this is to be inherent in the whole set-up?  I do not know what is going to happen.  Is the Minister prepared to indicate now that he will accept the proposition that if the City of Dublin declares itself in favour of having its own city manager the city manager shall not be a manager of several of the adjacent bodies now helping the borough manager?  Is he prepared to meet the City of Dublin on that?  If he is not I can assure him that the troubles which are created will continue to develop and goodness knows what way they will end.  Our city manager has also to be town clerk, and under this Bill is the manager going to remove the anomaly of the city manager being something which he is not, and will he allow the City of Dublin to appoint our town clerk the same as every other local authority?  Is he going to allow us to let the city manager be city manager and restore the position of town clerk which existed after the introduction of the City Management Act and afterwards repealed?  I will not take up very much more of the time of the House.  I wanted to say to the Minister that if we are really sincere in trying to improve city and county management let us do it.</P>
    <P>This Bill does not do very much.  It does something, but unless it deals with these matters which are of vital importance to us in the City of Dublin, it will not be possible to have affairs run properly.  I mention a few things which the Minister said he would look into for Committee Stage.  I have mentioned other things on which I have no <Col N="562" /> indication from the Minister as to what his attitude will be.  I would urge him to consider seriously these matters.  I do not think there is any local authority which can compare with ours in work and population.  If there is a small county or in fact a county with not a very large population or possessing much housing and so forth, which likes to share the county manager with some other administrative area, that is their business.</P>
    <P>It should not be made mandatory on us to have this position obtain.  There is no use putting into a Bill that if Dublin City applies to be separated and if it is done simultaneously by the county, the Minister may agree.  If, on the one hand, the Bill said that if both &ldquo;did&rdquo; the Minister &ldquo;shall&rdquo;, then I would not be so violently opposed to this particular section because I think we would have the wit to bring about such a row between the two bodies that the manager would have to take one side or the other and bring the issue to the proper light.</P>
    <P>We cannot go on nursing a situation such as we have had.  There are bordering areas; we have conflicting interests.  From time to time we have to help each other, and so on, and the only occasion where the City of Dublin and the county or the City of Dublin and Dún Laoghaire can get together, iron out problems and come to agreement is when the public representatives of these authorities meet with each other.  We did that the other day.  The County Dublin representatives met representatives of the City of Dublin.  Officials were there, but the strange thing was that the county manager or the city manager was not there.  Nevertheless we were able to iron out the difficulties.  There was give and take.  There was an explanation of what was wanted, what was to be done&mdash;roads bordering one another, where one side was county and one side was city, who was to do it, the people who were to be employed, and so on.  We got understanding and agreement in principle.</P>
    <P>That is why I say if there are certain matters which are managerial functions <Col N="563" /> and have to be discussed between the city and the county, they should be discussed between the two managers and not left in the position in which they have to be left now.  I beg the Minister to accept my approach to the Second Reading of this Bill, not as one of a carping nature but as one really meaning to try to help him and help the House to make the necessary alterations in existing legislation in regard to the main steps that need to be taken from time to time, to restore to local authorities control of their affairs and secure proper control over them by the local authority, to remove a certain number of controls previously exercised which we consider were not necessary and which were the cause of problems and dissatisfaction.  Deputy Byrne, the Lord Mayor, if he were here, would be the first to say that, from time to time, with the number of delays and problems which you might say brought about frustration, some of the members were almost inclined to throw their hats at it.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether it would be permissible for me at this stage to explain what I mean in this connection. I have here a typical letter which we receive&mdash;I will not read the signature under the particular matter &mdash;and which I would like to put on the record of the House.  Perhaps somebody could tell us what it means.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no alternative but to accept the ruling of the Chair. What I was trying to point out is this. In city and county management there is control asserted by the Minister and the Department of Local Government. You sometimes find that control reduced to a level of unimportance with consequent files being developed from writing about something that should not cost you five minutes' talk to find out this and that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the same way, when we get to discussing this section which deals with the appointment of deputies by the city manager, if he going on leave, what is going to happen?  This is a vital matter. The Bill has a picture of the city manager saying suddenly that he is going away for a month or, alternatively, he is ill and he says: &ldquo;Somebody has to manage.  According to the Bill, the first thing I must do is send for the Lord Mayor and consult him and he and I will either agree or disagree. If we agree, all the better, and if we disagree it does not matter.  But whether we agree or disagree the Minister now has to agree and if the Minister does not agree he appoints.&rdquo; Let us take the first stage.  Supposing the Lord Mayor at the time happens to be a member of the Party to which the particular Minister belongs, and the manager disagrees with the Lord Mayor.  Is it not quite clear that the Lord Mayor will say to the Minister: &ldquo;The manager is going to appoint &lsquo;X&rsquo;. I think &lsquo;Y&rsquo; should be appointed&rdquo;? <Col N="567" /> The Minister might agree not to appoint either &ldquo;X&rdquo; or &ldquo;Y&rdquo; and he might say: &ldquo;We will bring in &lsquo;Z&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash; and then we would have a nice kettle of fish.  Surely the Bill should be specific. There is the city manager.  He has at least two deputy managers.</P>
    <P>In the event of his going away or becoming ill then one of these deputy managers can have the powers of manager delegated to him in the manager's absence.  Is anything wrong with that?  Why is this other thing brought in?  Are we to take it that, with all the care you take in the selection and appointment of a city or county manager, there is a fear that you are then going to have duds as deputy managers and that, therefore, the Minister has a right to question their authority as acting managers in the absence of a manager?  To me that seems childish.  I do not know who thought that out.  I do not know where that emanated from but to me it seems so unnecessary and ridiculous that I hope the Minister will accept the suggestion I am making to bring this thing to a proper understanding and a proper practice.</P>
    <P>I do not know when the Minister will indicate his views on the suggestions made here and, arising out of that, I do not know when we shall have the Committee Stage of this Bill.  I just want to say that I shall pursue the points I have raised for the purpose of correcting in this Bill what I believe are mistakes.</P>

      <P>I have noticed in this debate that every speaker on the Second Reading has made, in effect, a speech which, as indicated on more than one occasion by the Chair, would be more appropriate on the Committee Stage.  There is a reason for that.  The reason is that this Bill does not effect any material change, as far as I can see, in the present situation and represents no fundamental departure from the managerial code as we know it. Therefore, it is impossible for Deputies to make a properly grounded Second Reading speech because there are no general principles at issue in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must confess I am very disappointed <Col N="568" /> with the Bill.  At all times I have been an advocate of the restoration of the maximum power to local authorities and I have been an opponent of the managerial system for quite a long time.  My Party has indicated its stand in that regard on more than one occasion.  I regret to say that there are certain aspects of this Bill which reinforce some of the most objectionable sides of the managerial system, a great deal of which are entirely unnecessary.</P>
    <P>Let us take, for instance, this proposal regarding the estimates committees. As far as I am aware, in practically every county where you have any kind of a reasonable person acting as manager, we already have estimates committees prior to the actual estimates meeting of the council of the local authority.  It is quite customary for Dublin County Council, for instance, and indeed for Grangegorman Joint Board, acting in committee, to examine the estimates put forward each year by the manager, to state their views on what they think should be deleted and on what additions, if any, should be made.  The general practice has been that the manager has tried to meet the views of the local authority.  It may be that there is, perhaps, in some obscure part of the country a manager operating a different system from that.  If that be so, that manager must be a very foolish man to be making trouble for himself with his own elected councillors.  Therefore, I say there is no need to have written into a statute a provision to provide the council with a right to set up an estimates committee.  What makes this proposal ridiculous, in my view, is the suggestion that you can get a number of councillors&mdash;with the time, the experience and the knowledge&mdash;to come together to formulate the estimates themselves, because that is what is in Section 7 of the Bill. Section 7 states, in effect: It will be the duty of the estimates committee to prepare the annual estimate of expenses and to furnish the members of the local authority with financial statements in such manner and at such intervals as the local authority may direct.  Does that not mean that you <Col N="569" /> would need a committee of men who could devote all their time for weeks, if not for months, before the actual date of the estimates meeting to the preparation of a complicated piece of business?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>The manager of each local authority must give several weeks of constant consideration to his estimate. In County Dublin, it must surely take the manager from six to eight weeks to familiarise himself with all the different proposals and with all the various details connected with the expenditure of hundreds of thousands of pounds.  Here, it is suggested that persons who are working voluntarily and in the public interest on local authorities should have sufficient time to do that job.  To my mind, that is completely unreal.  I cannot see in the suggestion of an estimates committee, as it is set out here, anything more than a gesture towards a lot of the ill-informed and uninformed criticism of local authorities which we read from time to time in the correspondence columns of the daily and Sunday newspapers and which, sometimes, is part and parcel of the pronunciamentos of the gentlemen sitting behind editorial desks who seem to have nothing very much else to do except criticise the voluntary work of members of a local authority.  As I say, this proposal of an estimates committee does not represent to us, at any rate in Dublin, any material change except that it could impose an impossible obligation on members of the council.  It suggests the imposition of an obligation upon members of county councils everywhere, an obligation which, I submit <Col N="570" /> in common sense, they cannot discharge or be expected to discharge.</P>
      <P>I had thought that there would be some progress in regard to staff matters.  Like others I am decidedly opposed to the idea that all matters relating to staff&mdash;employment, remuneration and superannuation matters in respect to workers&mdash;should be left to be dealt with by the manager and that the elected representatives, who are the real employers of those workers, should have no say whatever in the manner in which the workers will be treated.  There is nothing democratic in that, quite the reverse.  It is a centralisation of authority which, I think, the Minister should seriously reconsider.  Arguments have been put forward that this procedure under which staffs will be dealt with by the manager, makes things easier for county councillors.  I think experience has proved the opposite.</P>
      <P>In areas where staffs have felt aggrieved&mdash;I refer particularly to servants of the council such as manual workers&mdash;as a result of the county manager not dealing fairly with them, the blame for that situation has not fallen on the shoulders of the officials. It has invariably fallen on the shoulders of those who have to go before the people and ask them for their votes.  Mind you, if you talk to any average person, in rural Ireland particularly, and try to get him to understand that, despite the fact that people are called upon to go to the polls every three or five years to vote for local councillors, these local councillors when they go into the council chamber have little or no power, it is almost impossible to get the average person to appreciate that situation&mdash; naturally enough, because that situation is ridiculous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had hoped for a far more radical approach in principle to the managerial system from the Minister and I am, as I say, like many others disappointed. I should like to join with other Deputies in what has been said in regard to the separation of the city and county.  I do not anticipate that there will be any disagreement between Dublin Corporation and Dublin County <Col N="571" /> Council on the need for separation of the two authorities, so far as management is concerned.  The fact that we have had one man trying to carry the dual responsibility of manager for city and county&mdash;an impossible task&mdash;has created grave problems for the authorities concerned.  Again, why all this caution when it comes to a question of making a change?  What are all these safeguards for?  What is the danger?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>There again we come up against something which I think has been a grave difficulty, so far as Dublin City and County is concerned, over a long period of years.  That is the seemingly impossible job of getting the Minister and his staffs in the Custom House, for whom he is responsible, to appreciate that when they are dealing with the City and County of Dublin they have an entirely different problem from that of any other local authority in the country, in every sense of the word.  While it may be, as the Minister says in this instance, that some counties do not want to de-group, everybody knows that everyone in the City and County of Dublin wants to de-group and that we want separate managers.  Everybody knows that the present system has led over the years to administration of a kind which makes difficulty for everybody. Yet, we have written into this Bill restrictive clauses whereby we have got to go through a certain ritual before we can achieve a very simple thing.  Common sense would dictate that these clauses should not be there, that there should be more simplification. I hope that when the present Minister is examining legislation of this kind or examining generally any problems that arise in relation to the City or County of Dublin, he will try to bear in mind&mdash;it seems to be difficult to get non-Dublin people to <Col N="572" /> appreciate this fact&mdash;that there is an entirely different set of circumstances here.</P>
      <P>There was a suggestion from somebody, by way of interruption, in regard to this de-grouping of Dublin County and City that the solution might be to combine both.  Of course, that is the other extreme of illogicality because there is nothing whatsoever in common between the small farmer or the agricultural labourer, so far as his way of life or his particular economic interests are concerned, and the dock worker on the quays or the person living, say, in the heart of the Liberties.  You cannot get adequate or proper local representation if you have one central authority trying to cater for the opposite and diverse classes that exist in between these types.  Therefore, the suggestion that there should be one authority for a population almost approaching 750,000 is ludicrous.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">

    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I know it did not.  I am not making any reference to the Minister but that suggestion is contrary to every concept of democratic local government.  The real thing to be aimed at in any legislation connected with local administration is to secure, as far as possible, that intimate relationship which formerly existed between councillors and electors.  It may not have been perfect but there was that intimate relationship between the elected councillor and the people of his electoral area.  He was not alone their councillor; he was their counsellor as well, one to whom they spoke familiarly and to whom they could turn in any difficulty.  The idea that one big combine could cater for 750,000 people or that such a large number of people could be ruled over by a relatively small group, even if there were 50 members in the corporation, is in direct contradiction to all concepts of democratic local government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can never understand why in successive Bills of this kind no change has been made in the status of rate collectors.  On how many occasions have rows originated, been carried on for years, time wasted and enemies <Col N="573" /> made in county councils throughout the country because of the fact that county councils still have the right themselves to appoint rate collectors? I do not know for what reason that power was left to county councils.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>They can abolish rate collectors if they want to and collect the rates through the office.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not suggesting that rate collectors as a class should be abolished.  Possibly a lot of people think they should be.  I am not suggesting they should be abolished; I am suggesting there should be laid down in law a direction from this Parliament providing for a change in the future. That would make for more economical administration.  It would do away with many of the undesirable aspects related to the appointment of rate collectors, aspects well known to those of us who are members of county councils.  It would do away with a good deal of the persecution we suffer when a vacancy comes up.</P>

It is undesirable that this system of rate collection, which must have originated in the time of the Druids&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Exactly!  That system has been handed down over a long period.  We still retain it.  Why we <Col N="574" /> do so I do not know because it is certainly an uneconomic system.</P>
      <P>The system also creates another problem apart from the difficulties I have already mentioned.  It is possible for a rate collector, doing very little work, to get a very large salary.  Other officials of the council who are called upon to give all their time and do twice as much work may only earn half what the rate collector earns. These officials of the council have to have a certain standard of education, have very often to sit for competitive examinations in order to be appointed to the staff of the council, and have to serve a number of years before they receive promotion; the rate collector comes along and he is regarded, I am sure, with very mixed feelings by the staffs.  They are confronted with the spectacle of some individual coming in because he has particular friends who form a majority on the particular council; he gets the job and he is paid twice as much as the staff of the county council.  That is wrong in principle and I do not see why we should retain that system.  If county councillors told the truth most of them would say that they would prefer the Dáil to take away that right because of the barrage that is put up by these gentlemen when they are applying for the job of rate collector.  Every conceivable form of inducement is held out to those who are fortunate, or unfortunate, enough to be county councillors.  That is something most county councillors will never forget.</P>

      <P>This Bill seems to be based on the assumption that every county manager up to this was a rigid dictator.  It ameliorates in some small degree difficulties which have existed in one or two counties.  Now the average county manager is a decent man. He wants to get along with his council. Most of them co-operate with their councils far more liberally than they may be required to do under this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Labour Party as a whole is concerned with securing democratic <Col N="575" /> control in every sense of the word for members of county councils.  I am particularly interested in securing that county councillors will have some voice in saying how the workers should be treated.  That right is not being given to county councillors except in a very limited measure under this Bill.  While the Bill does not represent a step backwards, it does not represent a step forward either.  I would ask the Minister to consider the points which have been made, particularly in relation to Dublin City and County and to see what he can do between this and the Committee Stage to meet the points put forward.  I would particularly like him to separate in his mind&mdash;and when I speak of his mind I am speaking of the mind of his Department, too&mdash; the problems of Dublin County Council <i>vis-à-vis</i> other county councils.  I would like him to get away from the old idea that one must deal with Dublin County Council on the same basis as a county council in the Midlands, in the South or in the West.  The problems are entirely different and it is high time we had a different approach.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dunne says that he and the Labour Party would wish to have full democratic rights in the fullest sense of the term restored to county councillors.  That being so, it is not easy to understand his references to the system of rate collecting.  Where county councils appoint rate collectors they have full control over selection and the system of collection which he seems to advocate would in fact take away from them that already existing democratic right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anybody can pontificate as to what is the best method of collecting rates. I understand that collection has been carried out by various methods in various administrative areas and that those who have experience of these various methods will not say that any one of them is perfect.  There is one rural administrative area in which rate collecting is done by some method other than personal collection and I understand that the results would not be accepted as any criteria upon which to go in deciding upon reasonably efficient standards of collection.  As the Minister has explained, these alternative <Col N="576" /> methods are open to local authorities.  They can choose between them.  Perhaps it is best to leave the method&mdash;to leave that discretion&mdash;to the wise decisions of these various councils to make for themselves.  And if one particular system appears to break down through the inability of the people, having been put to the test, there is no reason why they cannot adopt an alternative.  But it does seem to me that it is not a matter which the House should exercise itself about particularly, and I notice that the Minister in this regard has ignored it completely.</P>
    <P>I was listening to Deputy Murphy of the Labour Party defending public councils, and I must say I should like to endorse his remarks.  I was a member of a county council in premanagerial days, during the time when corruption was supposed to be rampant in the local authorities.  I must say from my experience of about 40 members of that county council that I do not think anybody could point the finger to any member during that period as having acted in a corrupt fashion in relation to appointments or in relation to any other matter.  It may have happened that a member of the council either before or after a meeting might have been seen in the company of somebody who had business at the council meeting in one way or another; they might have been seen together in a hotel or public place of refreshment, but the most that I could see on which anybody might hang a charge against the member was that he was indulging in this sociability or good-fellowship.  But who will say that that is evidence of corruption or in fact in any way evidence of influence in the actions of a member of the council?  It would be very interesting to compare the ability to administer public moneys in other spheres of activity which are not subject to the same light of publicity as are the elected public bodies.  I have no doubt in the world that if the conduct of these public bodies was compared in an equally microscopic examination with that of other bodies, the comparison would not be against the elected representatives.  After all, <Col N="577" /> they are men with no public administrative qualifications.  They come in because the people choose to send them in and after all that is the people's prerogative and the people have an opportunity every few years of correcting any mistakes they may decide they have made in previous elections.  Any attempt to restrict in any way that right of the public in local government would, in my opinion, be a mistake.  This Party has been responsible for bringing in the managerial system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>Extending it.  I stand corrected by the former Minister for Local Government, but he will permit me to say that while a commission sat to take evidence of the advisability of bringing in managerial administration by the Cumann na nGaedheal Government, they did not seem to have the courage to apply it except in one or two experimental areas&mdash;and these were not rural areas.  I was very interested&mdash;amused I should say&mdash;by the remarks of Deputy Giles that the managerial system had put an end to all the Fianna Fáil corruption and wire-pulling that had gone on in the councils before the adoption of this system.  It is strange, indeed, that he should attribute to the Fianna Fáil Party, whom he denounces on occasion, the job of removing corruption&mdash;in other words, that we brought in an Act to remove a bad state of affairs which was our own creation and in which, in fact, we revelled and which produced us good electoral results not alone in local affairs, but in the Dáil elections. That argument does not hold water and it would be far better if, in discussing a non-political topic like local administration, these charges were not made, especially charges which are not true.  If there was any weakness in this particular field of human endeavour as well as in others, I feel sure that Deputy Giles will admit that human nature on his side of the Chamber would be just as weak as what would be found on ours, and that if he were to cite all the cases&mdash;the total of <Col N="578" /> them would not be large&mdash;he would find they were pretty fairly divided.</P>
      <P>However, I do not hold there were any such weaknesses.  They were not there during my experience of a large council.  As a matter of fact I do feel that I should take this special opportunity of saying some words of commendation when speaking to a debate on a local authority measure. The Minister made a grand tour of the Twenty-Six Counties when the Dáil went into recess last year and he raised very high hopes of sweeping and fundamental changes in the managerial system.  In fact, he created the impression, whether he intended to or not, that the managerial functions would be clipped very considerably and he held out hopes that what has been referred to as the democratic rights of the public authorities would be restored to them.  Anybody who has read through this Bill section by section will have to admit&mdash;and the Labour Party speakers have so admitted&mdash;that the Bill, to say the least of it, falls very far short of that hope and it is interesting if one goes through the sections.  Take, for instance, Section 2, which deals with prior information to members of local authority of manager's proposals. Sub-section (1) says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Subject to the provisions of this section, a local authority may by resolution direct that, before the manager performs any specified executive function of the local authority, he shall inform the members of the local authority of the manner in which he proposes to perform that function, and the manager shall comply with the resolution.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the complaints I have heard expressed by members of the local authorities is that they do not know what he is going to do and if they do not know what he is going to do in respect of certain executive functions how can they presume to guess what he intends doing or that he intends doing something?  How can they guess what that something is?  I think that sub-section will be ineffective in practice. Then this resolution may not <Col N="579" /> affect in any way the manager's control and supervision of the officers concerned or their superannuation, etc. I do not suppose anybody will cavil at that.  It is best that staff and staff matters should be controlled by the manager, but it does remove a large field of functions which were formerly performed by the county councils and which, judging by some of the Labour speeches we have heard, Labour members would like to have restored to them.  They are not being restored to them.  Sub-section (3) provides for that.</P>
    <P>Under sub-section (5), such a resolution may not deal with a health function.  We know how interested public representatives are at the present time and have been for some time past in the administration of the various health schemes that come within the scope of these authorities.</P>
    <P>It is provided in sub-section (7) that the manager shall inform the members of a local authority before any works of the local authority are undertaken and also before committing the local authority to any expenditure in connection with the proposed works. Paragraphs (a) and (b) of sub-section (7) exclude works of reconstruction, maintenance and repair. That is a very large part of the expenditure of a local authority in respect of public works.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (9) provides:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Nothing in the foregoing provisions of this section shall prevent the manager from dealing forthwith with any situation which he considers is an emergency situation calling for immediate action without regard to those provisions.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is very easy for the manager to say in respect of any non-accepted work or undertaking that it is in fact an emergency proposal on his part.  It is not set out here who is to decide whether it is so or not.</P>
    <P>When one has regard to all these exceptions it is obvious that Section 2 is only a jumble of words that mean nothing and do not give a tittle of extra power or authority to local authorities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="580" /> The purpose of Section 4 is, apparently, to provide for the doing of what might be classified as new works.  From our practical experience of local administration we know that these would amount to what would be requested by a county councillor on a notice of motion&mdash;the making of a bridge, the taking over of a new road, and things of that sort.  Section 4 provides that the local authority may provide for the carrying out of such new work but in Section 9, sub-section (3) we read:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Where the manager considers that an estimate of expenses prepared by the estimates committee of a local authority (whether by reference to the whole of the estimate or to any part or parts thereof) would, if adopted, seriously prejudice the efficient or economical performance of the functions of the local authority, the manager shall prepare a separate report specifying the provision which in his opinion is necessary.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That could be interpreted as nullifying the powers that are apparently given in Section 4.</P>
    <P>From an examination of this Bill it is quite obvious that its provisions are ambiguous and that definite meanings are not to be taken from any section in it.  I take it that where a doubt exists what will happen is that the manager will decide the matter, that is, where the resolution of doubts is not provided for and the occasions on which the resolution of such doubts is provided for in this Bill number only two or three.</P>
    <P>A good deal has been made about the power to set up an estimates committee.  Again I think that will prove to be a very illusory power indeed.  I was chairman of a finance committee of a county council and I know how difficult it is for the ordinary members to have detailed intimate knowledge of the various documents of account and the volumes of figures that are submitted to such a committee. The delegation of this work to a committee nominated by the local authority will double the work rather <Col N="581" /> than simplify it.  I have no doubt that, when the estimates committee reports, there will be a full dress session on the report and a detailed examination of the estimates all over again, in so far as that is possible, by the county council as a whole.  It would be just as well to let the county council act as the estimates committee, if the council is competent to give a detailed and intelligent examination of the estimates.  I think they would be as well able to do it as an estimates committee which would meet, I gather, as a private committee.</P>
    <P>Section 11 provides for limitation on expenditure.  It is provided that a local authority may increase the estimate in respect of any particular measure which they want to have carried out only by a resolution of the council and, otherwise, they may not exceed the estimate which they themselves have produced.  That is fair enough.</P>
    <P>Sub-sections (3) and (4) do not seem to me to be decisive.  Sub-section (3) provides:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Where, as respects any local financial year the manager is of opinion that the proper performance of the functions of a local authority requires the expenditure of money or the incurring of a liability in respect of any particular purpose in excess of the expenditure for that purpose specified in the estimate of expenses for that year, he may prepare and submit to the estimates committee of the local authority an application for the authorisation by the local authority of the excess expenditure.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There again a power is being given to the manager and not to the council, but in sub-section (4) we read:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Where an application is submitted to an estimates committee under sub-section (3) of this section, the committee shall consider the application and shall then submit it, with their recommendation thereon, to the members of the local authority.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>But it does not say what the local authority is to do about it.</P>

      <P>The remark of the Minister for Lands is very illuminating. The whole basis of this Managerial Act&mdash;and at best it was an experiment when it was brought in&mdash; was to enable local administration to be more efficiently and expeditiously carried out, and that the shortcomings of councils were not in fact based on any crookedness&mdash;or corruption, as one member of the Fine Gael Party said&mdash; but on the inability of a council to deal in a businesslike way with the growing volume of local business. Here is a sub-section put in which carries out that principle and enables the manager in pursuance of it to do certain things.  The Minister for Lands tells me that in accordance with Section 4 the county council is given power to nullify the good work which the manager is supposed to be capable or competent to do and to counteract the default of the council.  I think that leaving things in that indeterminate way without any final decision, without anyone to decide as to what is to be the fate of the proposal, is not a satisfactory way of dealing with the functions either of the manager or of the council, because both sides of functionaries are involved in this sub-section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is nothing really in this Bill at all.  It is not worth the time that has been wasted on it.  It is quite obvious <Col N="583" /> from the Labour Party speeches that that is what they think.  Perhaps now, after this period of experience of managerial administration, it would be a good thing if Dáil Éireann set about an examination of our experience in relation to this matter.  We on this side of the House, who were largely responsible for having managerial administration accepted in the country, would welcome an examination of the whole system, with a view to giving back as far as possible the democratic rights which several speakers have mentioned.</P>
    <P>There is one example of managerial administration of which the Minister should take cognisance.  It was expected and intended that what was called &ldquo;patronage by local bodies&rdquo; would be ended.  We have not had any definite proof that patronage was exercised by those bodies that was not, in fact, exercised by the substitute authorities which do the same things for the council.  Is there anybody here who can say definitely that the authorities who now provide the personnel for all these services are definitely and completely immune from influences which were supposed to have a banal effect on the elected councils?  I have no proof that there is any such banal influence operating on them.  All I can offer by way of opinion is that the results have not been entirely satisfactory.  We know that a great many appointments made by the Local Appointments Commission have not been a success.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go into that in detail, but there is one particular function of a manager which I would request the Minister for Local Government to examine before he puts this Bill in final legislative form.  It is the exercise of patronage by the county managers in respect of temporary appointments.  All the important offices are filled by the Local Appointments Commission.  The exception is that of the collection of rates and apparently there are divided views about that.  If an executive officer is to be appointed to fill a temporary vacancy, would the Minister not consider allowing that temporary vacancy to be filled by the <Col N="584" /> council, seeing that there has been a good deal of emphasis on democratic rights?  It may be an engineer, a doctor, an accountant or some other of these executive posts.  What objection can there be to allowing a county council to make an appointment of that sort, if it is a temporary one, when we bear in mind that the medical post must be filled by a qualified doctor, that the engineering post must be filled by a man who has already qualified as an engineer, that the accountancy post must be filled by a man who has passed accountancy examinations, and so on?  If the post is to be only a temporary one, can the council go very far astray in making the appointment, even if it may be regarded by some people as an exercise of patronage&mdash;and if there is to be an exercise of patronage and if the choice is to be between the manager and the council in the exercise of that patronage, who is to say that the manager would be a better person to exercise that patronage than the council?</P>

      <P>In any event, I think it was relevant, because I was discussing it in relation to managerial administration and I did not go into it in any great detail.  I think this change ought to be brought about for one very obvious reason which I will ask the Minister to consider.  Very long delays often take place&mdash;I do not say always&mdash;before these posts are filled permanently.  I take it that the manager is very largely the power who will decide the length of time which elapses between the temporary <Col N="585" /> appointment and the making of the permanent appointment.  If the appointment were made by the local authority I feel that the manager&mdash; who, I expect, would look upon a change of this sort as being somewhat critical of himself, and I do not think it would do any harm to the managerial system to have a little bit of criticism injected into it&mdash;and if he did look upon it as criticism of his particular exercise of this function in the past he would see to it, if the council made the temporary appointment, that the permanent one was made as quickly as possible, and that is one good result which would accrue.</P>

      <P>It would be the best guarantee he would have that the appointment would be made quickly, because even with the ministerial powers he will find very often there are obstacles and difficulties in particular cases and that these powers are not sufficient to enable him to proceed quickly.</P>
      <P>I do not think there is any other observation I want to make on this Bill.  I think that the Minister has exercised himself quite unnecessarily in relation to this matter.  As I pointed out, he made a very big tour of the country and saw a great many people. I do not think the selection of the people in all cases was well done for him and, in fact, if he had met the councillors and had a discussion with them, a good many of these discussions might not have been completely informative but they would have given the Minister a much closer insight into public reaction towards the managerial system.</P>

The Minister has, I take it, done the best he could to meet a number of points of view and a great many of these points of view, I know, have nullified one another and the result is that we have a measure&mdash;and I say it without offence to the Minister or to his intentions&mdash;on which it is not really worth wasting the time of the Dáil.</P>

      <P>I would like to welcome this Bill and congratulate the Minister on it.  I welcome it so far as it increases the powers of the elected representatives.  A number of Deputies have spoken to-day about the position as regards the City and County of Dublin, but I would like to ask the Minister to appoint a separate manager for the Borough of Dún Laoghaire.  This is a matter of which I am sure the Minister is aware.  We in Dún Laoghaire have asked for a separate manager over a number of years.  I am sure there are very many proposals from the Dún Laoghaire Corporation in the Custom House on this subject and I am glad that we had Deputy Briscoe and Deputy Dunne, a county councillor, who are prepared to support this proposal.</P>
      <P>I would like to welcome also in this Bill the appointment of Mr. O'Keeffe as county manager.  That is a step in the right direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding Section 14, I would like the Minister, under that section, to give to Dún Laoghaire Corporation the power of de-grouping that is given to Dublin City and the county council.  I also notice that both Sections 13 and 14 are subject to the consent of the Minister for Health and the Minister for Social Welfare.  I would like to know what will be the position supposing the Minister for Health and/or the Minister for Social Welfare refuse to give their consent.  Say that the Minister for Health refuses&mdash;does that mean that in the section as it stands at present, <Col N="587" /> the City of Dublin and the County of Dublin are denied the chance of de-grouping?</P>
    <P>I would like again, in conclusion, to ask the Minister either to amend Section 14 as I have said to give power to Dún Laoghaire Corporation to de-group, or if I bring that amendment in myself, to accept it?</P>

      <P>I presume it was purely by accident that the introduction of this Bill coincided with what could be termed the silver jubilee of the management system.  The first Management Act was passed in 1929.  I think that was the Cork City Management Act and 25 years later we have the City and County Management (Amendment) Bill, of 1954.  Going back over those 25 years, great though the opposition to the management system has been, I think in general it has worked well and has enhanced the reputation and the name of local administration in this country.  Nobody will deny that conditions existed in the years prior to 1929 when many aspects of local administration throughout the whole country were not becoming in any administration, and in some unfortunate instances they were definitely showing signs of decadence in the body politic.  I think the most important aspect of administration that has been improved is that of making public appointments by the manager. Nobody will deny that for many years there existed a very unsatisfactory system of appointment of local authority personnel whereby members of different authorities were approached by applicants for posts no matter how lucrative, no matter how menial, and were induced by one means or another to vote for certain candidates.</P>

      <P>When speaking on this Bill last night, I was dealing with a number of points&mdash;the cost of living, unemployment and emigration&mdash;and, on emigration, I had stated that we were alarmed by the large number of young persons who were leaving this country at the moment and who have left it over a short period back. Organisations throughout the country are becoming alarmed by the situation which exists at the moment, that is, <Col N="589" /> the emigration amongst the age group of between 17 and 20 years.  Those young boys are leaving and leaving at an alarming rate.  The cause, of course, is not far to seek.  They look around them and see an unemployment figure of 72,000 and that despite the promises which were made at the last general election, promises by Labour, Fine Gael and the others, that the unemployment figure would be drastically reduced and that every means at the disposal of the Government would be called into operation in order to remedy that situation.</P>
      <P>Yet, we have a situation to-day in which, from September last, when we had an unemployment figure of 48,000 &mdash;and, of course, the Coalition are not going to take credit for the existence of such a reduced unemployment figure in September, after being two or three months in office; they would not have the &ldquo;neck&rdquo; to take credit for that&mdash; up to the present time, the figure has soared and mounted, with the result that to-day we are faced with 72,000 persons unemployed.  Is it any wonder then that these boys and girls of that age group should look around them, and, seeing their brothers, sisters and fathers registering as unemployed, decide for themselves that, as there is no prospect of improvement, the best thing they can do is to emigrate?  That is something which both clergy and laity are seeking to do something about.</P>
      <P>We can appreciate the conditions and the mode of life to which these young people are going across the water.  It is bad enough in the case of older persons, those who have been in the habit of crossing over to earn their living as casual labourers, as migratory labourers, on the other side.  We have a tradition of that sort of thing, of workers from the West of Ireland and other parts going over for periods of the year and coming back again.  It is something which has been going on for a long time, but this is something new&mdash;the under-twenties leaving the country.  There is no prospect that they will come back.  Many of them will get into ways and modes of life over there and, even if they did come back, they would not be an asset to this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="590" /> Last night, I took several statements from last year's debate on this Bill and I took several quotations from what the Minister for Industry and Commerce said when he was a Deputy on this side last year and did not have the responsibility of putting into effect the subject-matter of his statements. We find that the statements he made then, the accusations he made against Fianna Fáil and the Fianna Fáil Government, apply to-day but in a more severe degree.  One of his statements at this time last year was with regard to the cost of living and high prices and he coupled with that the then unemployment figure.  He said that we had 60,000 people unemployed in this country and asked how those people who have no other income but what was paid to them at the labour exchange could afford to buy tea at 5/- per lb. and how could they afford to buy the other items he mentioned at the prices they were then at.  Yet, 72,000 unemployed to-day have to buy these self-same items and have to pay a higher price for meat, for coffee, for cocoa and other things.</P>
    <P>A great to-do has been made because this Government managed to pin down the tea price to last year's figure.  It has been represented as a great achievement, but the piper has still to be paid and thereby hangs another tale or another tune.  One of the speakers from the opposite benches said that everything in the garden must be lovely because the people were not crying out about high prices and because there was no agitation amongst the people.  He drew the conclusion from that that everything was hunky-dory.  I can assure him that there will be a day of reckoning.  It is true that there are no unemployed marches and I do not know why the organisers of the unemployed marches are not busy at present, because when Deputy Norton was speaking then, at the time the unemployed marches were taking place through the streets of Dublin and the sit-downs were being carried out on O'Connell Bridge, we had 60,000 unemployed.</P>
    <P>I mentioned last night the commodities the prices of which have increased since the present Government <Col N="591" /> took over.  The litany is rather long. I shall not repeat it now but, long as it is, we could see some ray of hope if the Minister showed any signs, no matter how remote, that he would do something about it.  But week after week we have questions tabled in this House by all Parties regarding the prices of essential commodities and invariably we get the same reply: &ldquo;Yes, I am aware that the price has increased but it is not my function to interfere.&rdquo;  That is from the Minister who last year said&mdash;I am quoting from Volume 142, column 1710 of the Official Report&mdash;in regard to the suggestion he made that Fianna Fáil were running away from price control: &ldquo;I do not think it will be easy for the Minister or the Government to ride away from what should be their obvious responsibility&mdash;that is, to give the public an efficient system of price regulation, price control and, above all, price supervision.&rdquo;  What control, what regulation or what supervision has the present Minister for Industry and Commerce applied to the price of American coal which is being sold to the merchants in Dublin at a price of £5 11s. per ton and for which the Donegal consumer is paying £10 per ton?  He says it has nothing to do with him and that it is not subject to any control.  But surely the Minister who issued the following statement when he was a Deputy last year is acting in a worse way than that in which he suggested the Minister for Industry and Commerce was operating last year?  Coal is being sold in Dublin at a certain figure and it is being sold in Donegal at double that figure.  The Minister told several of us by way of answer to parliamentary question that he was going to do nothing about it.</P>
    <P>Then, again, you have another Minister who allows the prices of animal feeding-stuffs to soar.  Of course, when that happens you can expect dearer commodities, because if farming costs go up, naturally it is the consumer who must be asked to pay those higher costs.  Certainly, this contribution by the present Minister to last year's debate in the light of what has happened since and in the light of <Col N="592" /> what is happening in regard to prices &mdash;and there will be other prices which will increase in the future&mdash;makes very interesting reading.  All we can do is ask ourselves if he is the same person as the person who, speaking from here last year, said these things and the same person who has the power in his hands, with the backing of all the Coalition Parties behind him, and the array of promises that were made during the election campaign in respect of each item spoken of here last year by him?  We are wondering if the Minister has any say at all in the matter.</P>
    <P>The best we can get from the other side at the moment in regard to the promises which many of the speakers on this side of the House quoted as coming from the different Parties and the different individuals forming the Government is that they did not make any promises and that they did not tell the people they would reduce prices but told them they would do their best.  What did Deputy Dunne mean when he told his audience during the election campaign that if Dunne cannot do it it cannot be done?  I wonder what does all that mean? Surely it did not mean that Dunne would do his best, and if Dunne's best could not be done then it could not be done.</P>
    <P>Another interesting statement from the Minister when speaking here last year was: &ldquo;Does everybody not know perfectly well that it is harder to live to-day for the ordinary man and woman than it has ever been in the past 30 years?&rdquo;  That was last year's statement. Could not the present Minister get up and truthfully say the same thing to-day?  Although he is in power for the past six months he could get up and say: &ldquo;Does everybody not know perfectly well that it is harder to live to-day for the ordinary man and woman than it has ever been in the past 30 years?&rdquo;  and he would be telling the truth because, ever since he took over, the prices of very many things&mdash;I am sorry I have not got the list&mdash;have gone up, and the only price which has come down is the price of butter.  That is the only price reduction of any of the essential commodities used in the ordinary <Col N="593" /> home which has taken place over the past six months.  In all other cases, where any change took place, the increase was upwards and in some cases very steeply upwards at that, so that last year's statement by the Minister applies with increased truth and positiveness this year.  While he accused the previous Government's Minister for Industry and Commerce of sitting back and doing nothing about these things, he himself seems to occupy that position to-day.</P>
    <P>He then said that there was no good or valid reason for continuing the Supplies and Services Bill for a further year, and yet he tells us now that the Supplies and Services Bill will be continued for another 12 months and that in the meantime he will have a look at things.  He said there are difficulties in the way; that it is very hard to get any effective system of price control and that even at the end of the year it might still be necessary to introduce the Supplies and Services Bill for a further year.</P>
    <P>We know there are difficulties in the way.  We know it is difficult to control, regulate and stabilise prices.  Fianna Fáil never said that simply by going out to a public platform and waving a magic wand, prices would topple.  It is the people opposite now who said that this could be done, that taxation could be reduced, that in a ten-minute speech in the Dáil taxation could be reduced by as many millions.  It is not too much then for us, and especially the people of the country who were led to believe we would have less taxation, reduced prices, less unemployment, a reduced figure of emigration, to expect that a Minister such as Mr. Norton would, despite any difficulties, take effective steps.  They may not be perfect steps but at least they should be taken, whether they are perfect or not, to remedy a situation which he said existed last year, and which exists to a degree which is 25 per cent. worse this year.</P>
    <P>I will come to another statement made by Mr. Norton last year on the food and drink question.  I would like to hear some of the Deputies opposite on the question of drink.  I see beer, <Col N="594" /> stout, whiskey and ale mentioned here as the poor man's pint, and the question asked what was the Fianna Fáil Party going to do about it, and so on.  Actually this speech by the then Deputy Norton was the keynote.  It set the headline to the other speakers. I will not tire the House by going over and looking at what the other Deputies said, but Deputies of all Parties when they were over here, kept in line with the opening statement or the statement early in the debate by Deputy Norton.  We still have them with us to-day. Although the people are not marching the streets of Dublin there are very few letters being written to the <i>Irish Independent.</i>  Nevertheless, we have a worse situation to-day than at the time Deputy Norton said this. We have a higher unemployment figure, higher prices, and emigration of a type which is worse than that which ever existed in this country.  Surely before even their own supporters try to force the Coalition Government and the Parties forming it to act, they will try to do something at least to live up to some of the solid promises they made during the general election campaign.</P>

      <P>So far as this debate is concerned it has turned out to be a debate mainly on prices.  Although the Supplies and Services Bill, as we were told, covers a multitude of problems, and provides powers for a large number of Government Departments, I do not think anybody would differ with Deputy Lemass when he says it would be probably preferable to have some form of permanent legislation.  Out of the kindness of his heart he informed the present Minister that when he (Deputy Lemass) left office he left behind a drafted Bill apparently dealing with price control.  Somehow I doubt if any Bill on price control drafted by Deputy Lemass as Minister would be acceptable to anyone in the Labour Party, in the light of the attitude of Deputy Lemass to price control, and the record of his Government since 1939.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However I still agree with him that it is essential that we should try to consider the question of prices in this <Col N="595" /> country on a more long term basis than was originally intended by the Supplies and Services Bill, because prices somewhat synthesise all our economic and social problems.  Whether we look at the problem from the point of view of agriculture, from the effectiveness of an attractive system for industry or from the point of view of the standard of living, or from the point of view of imports or exports, they are all finally significant and show themselves in the form of prices.  Therefore when we come to deal with the question of prices, we are touching, as I say, the whole economy of the country.  Even when we try to consider the question of retail prices we find in trying to deal with them we are brought back until we are dealing with the basic economic problems of the country.</P>
    <P>I think it would be as well for all Deputies, no matter on which side they sit, to accept some fundamental points. First of all, so far as prices are concerned in the country as a whole, they are everybody's problem.  In particular they are a problem to those who are forced, because of their station in life, to depend on wages and salaries and on the various forms of social service payments, or the small fixed incomes of pensioners.  When we are dealing with the mental attitude towards the problem of prices I think we should try and distinguish between what has always been present in everybody's mind, namely, that the relationship between prices and income determines a person's standard of living.</P>
    <P>It is natural for the mass of the people to look and hope for a rise in the standard of living, which could be secured either by a rise in incomes in relation to prices, or by a fall in prices in relation to stationary incomes.  Having that aspect of the matter before us we should bear in our own minds the background of the past 15 years which of necessity played a very important role in the attitude of our people to this question of retail prices.  They have had, during those years, a very bitter experience, and it is not unreasonable that they are somewhat cynical, that they have become somewhat tired trying to hold the tide out, as it were, between <Col N="596" /> prices and their incomes, and they have become impatient with whatever Government is in power.</P>
    <P>Secondly&mdash;and I trust Deputy Cunningham will remember this&mdash;no matter what Party we belong to in this House we all make commitments at the elections, Fianna Fáil as well as Labour, because we cannot avoid the question of prices.  What may be the range of those commitments is not so important because quite frankly&mdash;there is no use side-stepping the issue&mdash;an Opposition speaks probably sharper and more frankly than they do when in Government.  It is very noticeable that many of the things that were said to-night by the members of the Fianna Fáil Party they were exceptionally quiet about when they were sitting on this side of the House and saw the Government push up the cost of living by 19 points in a few months.  They did not criticise then.</P>
    <P>We are not so quiet on this side of the House.  If we are going to deal with this question of prices in our commitments there are certain things that should be taken into account and especially when we come to deal with the records of the various Parties.  I do not mind in the least any political Party fighting its corner.  That is what they are here for, but there are limits to what we should descend to.  When I listened to a responsible Deputy like Deputy Cunningham dismissing the whole problem of the price of tea with a nice-sounding slogan: &ldquo;tea on tick&rdquo; I considered that was about typical of Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">

Why do we not talk about the farmers who are provided with loans as carrying on their industry on tick?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not.  It is your attitude of mind.  We are dealing here with something which in its own peculiar way in relation to our mode of life in this country is an essential food.  Nobody has any doubts about that and when we face a problem of fairly big magnitude in so far as the price of tea is concerned and an attempt is made to deal with it, and it has got to be dismissed not on the basis of a political attack upon the Government or whether there was some alternative, but on the basis that our people are being given something on tick to which they are not entitled, everybody knows that whatever is to be the outcome&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the problem.  If it were subsidies&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. J. Larkin Mr. J. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>We will deal with that in a moment.  Nobody interrupted the Deputy.  If, as was shown indisputably, certain economic factors outside our immediate control affected the price of tea in this country, and there was&mdash;and we all accepted it&mdash; an unanswerable argument for an increase in the price of tea and we did not increase the price of tea, the Deputy knows that some way or other we would have to meet that problem now or in the future.  Nobody is disputing that.  But why should it be objectionable to try to meet that problem on behalf of a great mass of people with low incomes for whom tea is a daily necessity, on exactly the same principle as the good businessman applies to his own business? What is wrong with it?  Are we to apply a different set of principles when we are dealing with the business of agriculture or somebody wanting to start a new industry against the principles we apply to the old age pensioner, the worker, the small farmer or farm labourer if we have an immediate problem in regard to the price of tea?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prices have sky-rocketed and if there is a question as to whether those high prices are going to continue or whether they are likely to fall, are not the ordinary people of this country entitled to a breathing space to see what <Col N="598" /> is going to happen?  If this year or next year there is a fall in tea prices is there anything wrong with marrying that price so as not to force on the people at the moment an increase as we now measure to the extent of 1/4 or 1/5 a lb.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that going to be done?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know.  I am asking you is there anything wrong&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>You will not answer now.  You will answer when you find out but you will not take a chance in advance any more than your Party would say that the price would be up by 1/4 a lb. if you were over here, though right well you know it.  If, on the other hand, the question of the change in the price of tea cannot be solved by marrying a low price to a high price and this can be put off, again is there anything wrong with that?  You claimed credit yourself when you were over here for using a policy of subsidies, and surely if at any time and in any circumstances the use of subsidies is justified it is when we are dealing with one of the essential foodstuffs in respect of the price of which factors outside the Government's control affect it.</P>
      <P>We can argue about the price of wheat, beet, sugar, milk and other things we produce at home.  These prices are determined by our own policy.  The policy may be good or bad but we can differ on it.  We cannot very well argue between ourselves as to whether the policy in Ireland is good or bad in relation to a policy being determined in Ceylon or India. In a situation such as we have had in regard to the price of tea it seems to me there is a stronger argument for availing of the system of subsidies than in relation to any commodity we produce at home.  However, whether the policy was good or bad it has been applied, and whatever may be the blame or the credit we are quite prepared to take it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one thing of which I am <Col N="599" /> quite sure, as I said earlier, that if we had been sitting where Deputy Cunningham is to-night and if he were over here there would not be any question of arguing as to how the increase in the price of tea had been staved off.  It would have been past history and all we would have been arguing about would be the price of tea with 1/4 added on.</P>
    <P>When we come to deal with the problem of prices, any member of any Party in this House is entitled to criticise and put forward their policy and they are quite entitled to recall commitments or promises made.  However, Fianna Fáil need not think that just because they are over there they can sit back and say: &ldquo;We have no responsibility.  All we are going to do is look over the election literature and see what promises were made and keep throwing them up,&rdquo; and that they are going to get away with it.  After all, this whole problem we are discussing to-night started, in so far as its present aspect is concerned, in 1939, at the outbreak of the war, the start of the emergency.  It is as well to recall, and it is as well to keep it marked up on the blackboard in case Fianna Fáil forgets, that the gap between wages and prices started when Fianna Fáil decided to control wages and left prices lying to one side for a while. Finally, under pressure of public opinion throughout the country, they started to try and deal with the problem of prices but they never really believed in it.</P>
    <P>Year after year, we have had the main spokesman for Fianna Fáil, Deputy Lemass, tell us, as he told us the other night, that when economic factors are forcing prices upwards you cannot do anything about it and, similarly, when economic factors are forcing prices downwards you cannot do anything about it&mdash;in other words, leave the people to make the best of the situation and just wait for the economic factors to change again.  That is a nice, simple policy designed for an ideal community.  Unfortunately, we are not living in an ideal community. With that background of those 15 years, during which there was a never-ending <Col N="600" /> demand not merely from the Labour Party and the Opposition Party but from the people generally, and even supporters and members of the Fianna Fáil Party, for some more effective measures to be taken on the problem of prices, the Fianna Fáil Government were forced to try and secure some system of control.  Yet, all along, they did not believe in it. Even in the early stages of the emergency, when we had a penalty provided by law for over-charging, you will recall that it was only after public outcry that measures were taken to try and deal with it.  Even below the surface when, on the one hand, Fianna Fáil Ministers were inviting members of the public to co-operate with the Government in ensuring that Price Orders were observed by retailers, there was the position that if an unfortunate member of the public went to the Department he would finally start to realise after about seven or eight months, that no action was going to be taken.  It is this background of lack of faith in any type of price machinery in this country that is creating the problem for the Government. There would be the same problem for Fianna Fáil if they were in Government now and seeking effectively to deal with the matter.  The great mass of the people do not genuinely believe that, even to-day&mdash; whether or not it be a Labour Minister who is in office&mdash;we have a system of machinery in respect of the control of prices in which they can put any faith &mdash;and personally I do not blame them.</P>
    <P>In the debate last week Deputy Childers gave us a long and somewhat dull picture in respect of the conditions obtaining in 1947-48 and again in 1953. In the course of many statistics he gave us he pointed out the relationship in 1953 between prices and earnings. He suggested that, generally, things in Ireland were such that, as earnings had increased to a greater extent than prices, real wages and the standard of living had gone up.  I have to deal quite a lot with problems of price index and wage index.  I want to say here that never, up to the moment, has the trade union movement accepted the index for earnings as a guide.  It is one of those indexes <Col N="601" /> which are not dependable and which do not present a real comparison.  It is confined purely to workers producing transportable goods and, therefore, it has a limited effect.  I think you will find, moving around the people, that, whatever the index, it would be very hard to convince the average worker trying to maintain his family on a wage of, say, £4 10s. to £8 or £8 10s. a week, that, in effect, his standard of life is higher to-day and more secure and that, generally, he finds it easier to live than he did in 1939.  I doubt if any member of this House genuinely believes it either.  The mass of the people feel that 15 years have passed in which, year after year, they have been trying to fight this battle against rising prices and they have gone on fighting a losing battle. Before the war, prices of various commodities could rise and fall.  Maybe the price of coffee would go up, the price of cocoa might come down, and there might be a slight change in the price of bread and butter.  Generally, unless there was a sharp and significant change, no particular attention was paid to it.  They were part of the normal features of life.  When, however, over a period&mdash;often lasting as long as five or ten years, or more&mdash; there would be shown to be a steady change in the cost of living, you would find a general reaction starting in and an effort made to improve wages and salaries.  Now, we are in such a condition that even the slightest change in the most unessential commodity seems to ring a bell in everybody's mind and we immediately start to become fearful that prices will start to go up again and, before we can adjust wages and salaries, that prices will have gone so far ahead that we shall have lost.  In other words, people are nervous, lack confidence and at times are fairly desperate.  For a great deal of that atmosphere, Fianna Fáil must take the credit.</P>
    <P>Whatever may be the change in the index from the time of the general election last year to to-day, the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Government he represents will have to work fairly fast to equal the record created by Fianna Fáil in driving <Col N="602" /> the index up from 109 to 124 in a few months.  That is pretty good going even for Fianna Fáil &mdash; particularly when they got back to office on the understanding that they would maintain the subsidies and that they would ensure that the price of essential food would not go beyond the people's reach.  It is on the basis of the index of 126 to-day that we have to deal with the problem of prices.  While the Opposition are entitled to rampage around the House, reviving all the old election cries and holding themselves up as Simon Pures who never made a promise and therefore never broke one. they should bear in mind that the background we are dealing with to-night is the background since 1939 and that, over the most important periods of those 15 years, they were in office.  They have to take a great deal of the responsibility for the mental attitude that exists amongst the masses of the people of this country in regard to prices.  I am speaking now of those who support Fine Gael, the Labour Party, the Clanns and Fianna Fáil&mdash;leaving aside political distinctions altogether&mdash;when I say that the people generally have no real hope that, at any time when pressure starts to raise prices, there is machinery to cope with the matter.  They do not expect that, in every case of a price rise, the machinery will reduce it: nobody is so foolish as to believe that, under all circumstances and irrespective of the prevailing conditions, prices can be kept down.  The people generally have no real hope that, in considering whether the price should be allowed to go up and whether there are justifiable reasons for it, there is effective machinery in which they have confidence to ensure proper investigation and control.  I have spoken of that problem many times in this House.  I spoke of it from the Opposition Benches; I speak of it to-night from the Government Benches, and I will continue to speak of it, because our main problem is the lack of confidence on the part of the public in anything that has been done up to the moment in trying to deal with prices.</P>
    <P>Again, whatever may be our political affiliations or views, I think all of us should accept the point of view that <Col N="603" /> the people are entitled to protection, not just from any humanitarian consideration but because they are making a contribution to the whole economy of the country as consumers, under our mutually agreed system of affording protection for our industries and providing markets and other forms of support for the agricultural industry and because in the end the burden of that policy goes back on to the consumer. We are not operating under a system of free competition.  We are not operating even a system of pure private enterprise.  We are operating a system under which the masses of consumers are being asked, by a policy agreed upon by all the political Parties, to carry a burden for the sake of building up our industrial and agricultural economy.  While, in theory, there may be competition between different trading units, in practice we know that in many branches and spheres of industry that competition does not really exist and, if it does exist, it can very readily be pushed aside by agreement between the different trading groups.</P>
    <P>For that reason, it is essential that, first of all, we should not place too heavy a burden on the consumer. Secondly, to ensure purely from the point of view of efficiency that our system of protection is not being abused, we should have some means of affording protection in respect to final prices, protection in the form of investigating retail prices and protection in the form of being able to investigate the whole chain, either from the point of production or the point of importation.  Because we have not got that as I say, at any time of an upward surge in prices there is somehow a nervous reaction and the fear that we are again entering a new phase where prices are going, not to skyrocket but to go up by 5 or 10 per cent., and to go up in such a form that, even if incomes are subsequently levelled to meet prices, already ground has been lost that cannot be regained.  After all it is very seldom that wages can be adjusted completely to meet a rise in <Col N="604" /> prices and never are they adjusted with sufficient retrospective effect to cover the full rise in prices, with the result that ordinary people are out of pocket.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cunningham and other Deputies of Fianna Fáil, as they were quite entitled&mdash;I do not see how anybody could object&mdash;waxed eloquent on many of the statements made during the general election campaign.  I want to go back, because my conscience was troubling me, to see what I said. Luckily enough, I was very careful. However, there is no use trying to deal with this problem on a purely individual basis because this is something for which we have got to carry collective responsibility.  However, I have looked at the programme of our Party. Programmes and promises disseminated through pamphlets often differ and what is said in responsible Party documents may be different from what is said at a cross-roads meeting.  Let us see what was set out in our Party programme.  The statement of the Labour Party, made at spaces of the election campaign, was that they were seeking the support of the people so that they would be able in the Dáil&mdash; this was before we decided to join in the Government&mdash;to urge reductions in food prices and the use of food subsidies in respect to essential articles of food; and secondly, to secure a strict control of prices through investigation by an independent tribunal.  That statement could, as I readily admit, be changed into all kinds of peculiar election platform speeches.  We know that when we are on an election platform we all say things that we probably will regret a little later, but to keep to a serious approach to the matter, in so far as the Labour Party was concerned, we stated that in our opinion it was possible to approach the problem of effecting reductions in food prices.  In particular, we went on to say&mdash;and that this was what was intended is quite clear&mdash;that where that was not possible by ordinary means of investigation and control, that where economic factors were such that it was not possible to bring down the price of essential foods, then, in our opinion, the policy of subsidisation should be utilised.  As far as I know, the Labour <Col N="605" /> Party has not changed its view on that up to to-night nor, I think, are we likely to do so.</P>
    <P>But having said that, it does not alter the fact that the election is now some eight months behind us and that in the meantime the problem of prices has still continued to be a problem.  It is quite correct to say, I suppose, that some 15 to 20 items of various kinds have increased in price.  Some of them we can easily try to dismiss by the argument that they are not essential. While the increase in the price of coffee, for instance, has its own significance, nobody is going to suggest that it has the same significance as increases in the price of bread, tea or sugar.  What is significant is that among the number of items in regard to which prices have increased there are some important food groups.  There has been an increase in the price of tea.  There has been, as usual, a periodic or seasonal increase in the price of eggs though the price of eggs is now coming down.  We have had increases in the price of such commodities as cocoa and oatenmeal. These are essential foods.</P>
    <P>I think any member of this House who tries to shut his eyes to these happenings or tries to argue that there has been no increase, and that everything in the garden is lovely, is not only being foolish from a political point of view but is storing up trouble for himself.  The situation with which we are faced is present to the mind of every Party.  There has been a small or large increase in the price of a number of items, some of them important, some of them not so important.  Some of us have the feeling that the index has not changed more than one or two points, that the situation is not serious and that, maybe, if we hold on for a couple of months more, the index will drop to the previous figure.  My fear is that we are in a situation which, if we do not try to deal with it now, will develop in the next two or three months to a point where we shall not be able to stop a really significant increase in prices and the cost of living, because prices are like a snowball. If the price of coffee increases, <Col N="606" /> for instance, there seems to be a peculiar attraction for the price of cocoa, paraffin oil and rubber motor-tyres to go up.  These increases usually occur one after the other, snowball-like until finally you have got a situation that it is almost impossible to control. Therefore, as I have said, to try to dismiss them as unimportant or even as in the case of meat&mdash;and goodness knows that is one of the most difficult &mdash;to take the line that the increase is solely due to the presence of English buyers who come in here, offering exceptionally high prices and to say that if we only wait until July or September, the price of meat will drop and the butchers will be able to let us have cheap meat again and every thing will be all right, that way disaster lies.  If there is one peculiarity about prices here it is that it is very easy for prices to go up but they are very very slow to come down particularly in a period when it is not a question of an increase in the price of one item but when it is a question of a whole range of increases coming along, each inter-playing upon the other.  That is why I still believe that, even though the Labour Party has supported, and is represented in, the present Government, it is still important, particularly for those of us who have to face this problem of prices and, above all, the relationship of prices to wages and salaries, to speak out very openly in regard to this problem, though we may have at the same time some understanding or appreciation not merely of the Government's problem, and every Government has its problems, but of what the Government is seeking to do and what its general policy is.  I noted that Deputy Lemass in his speech the other night made one very profound statement with which none of us could disagree: he said that the force of inertia in Government Departments is tremendous and it takes a tremendous opposing force to overcome it.</P>
    <P>Sometimes I have grave doubts, even in relation to the present Government and even in respect of the present Minister for Industry and Commerce, my own colleague and my own Party man, whether it is possible for pressure <Col N="607" /> from outside, from the consumers, from men and women, from the families living in the urban and rural areas, from the trade unions and the various organisations who seek to speak on behalf of the consumers, from members of this House to effectively overcome the dead-weight and the inertia of Government Departments in relation to prices unless we push, and push very hard.  That is why, apart from feeling that it is essential as a Deputy that I should stand up and face, if you like, the criticism of the Opposition in making clear my own position, I think it is also important and indeed essential, irrespective of whatever Government is in office or on whichever side of this House we may be sitting, to keep this pressure up in present conditions and keep focussing attention on the problem of prices because, otherwise, I do not believe they will get the effective attention that is required.</P>
    <P>I have said that the Labour Party entered into certain commitments.  As far as I am concerned I accept responsibility for those commitments and I have no doubt that the other members of my Party will, like myself, try to fulfil those commitments.  I feel that we have to some extent at any rate honoured some of those commitments. At least we have not reneged our commitments; that is what the Fianna Fáil Party did.  We said that we believed that the prices of essential foods should be reduced.  Whether the reduction in the price of butter is or is not a very significant contribution to a reduction in the price of essential foods, I will leave to the members of Fianna Fáil to argue amongst themselves.  One thing is important; whatever we have tried to do, it has been in the direction of reductions.  We did not add 15 points.</P>

      <P>Everybody knows that it would have been the easiest thing in the world to come in here and put before the House the bald, economic explanation as to why the price of tea should go up.  Very likely we would have had Fianna Fáil creating a mild hullabaloo over such an increase and making as much political <Col N="608" /> propaganda out of it as they could; but, in the end, they would have accepted that it was the proper thing to do, and it would have blown over. Instead of that, and this was public knowledge for a period of nearly three months, the price of tea was held while the matter was being considered and, finally, there was a decision not to increase the price.</P>
      <P>I recall a quotation from James Connolly; I am not using it just because it was part of his writings, but because it is very helpful: &ldquo;It is not only the speed at which you are travelling that is important.  It is also important to know the direction.&rdquo; Now we may have been travelling somewhat slowly in relation to this question of prices.  I would be the last to deny that because I personally am not satisfied.  I do not think the Labour Party is satisfied.  I do not think the Minister is satisfied but, at least, we have pointed out by actual example the direction in which we are trying to progress, and that in itself is significant.  We still accept the commitments for travelling in that direction as is indicated by our attitude to the question of butter and tea. But we have got to travel further and, in travelling further, we shall have to increase our pace.</P>
      <P>In so far as this question of prices is concerned, it is desirable that we should have something in the form of permanent long range policy.  I confess that I can see many difficulties. There are many things yet upon which I am not quite clear myself, but I recognise that it is much easier for Governments and Ministers who deal with this problem because they have access to much wider fields of information and inquiry than are available to ordinary Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lemass on one occasion tried to tackle this matter on the basis of his Prices and Efficiency Bill in which he sought to tie up, admittedly to a somewhat limited extent, the question of the control of prices in protected industries with the question of efficiency. That Bill did not get on the Statute Book.  We understand that during his last period in office he was <Col N="609" /> seeking once more to deal with the problem.  What his approach was I do not know, but it is quite clear, and this has been recognised by Fianna Fáil and the other Parties, that after a period of some 22 years in which we have been implementing a policy of protection to our industries and affording very considerable help to agriculture, there is a need now to review the whole range of that policy, not from the point of view of terminating our system of protection but from the point of view of ensuring that it is, in fact, fulfilling its main objective to build up and strengthen the general economy of the country and provide better living standards for our people.</P>
    <P>If we intend to do that it means that, when we come to deal with the question of prices, we cannot limit our investigation merely to retail prices because very often retail prices have their origin much further back, starting with actual production or manufacture, or the point of importation, and one of our problems must be to ensure that right along that whole chain each individual who contributes in one form or another to the manufacture or the importation of the particular goods and their ultimate distribution will get a fair price, a fair wage, a fair salary or a fair profit.  They are entitled to no more than that and we have grave suspicions that at many points along that chain at present somebody is finding it possible to take more than his fair share.  Even if he is not, the investigation would be useful in itself because it would help us to decide whether our general system in relation to our industries is acceptable, whether it requires some improvement or some adjustment.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear on the information available that we would probably find a number of weak spots.  We know that generally, in so far as the economy as a whole is concerned, the cost added on to the final cost of the goods in respect of distribution is running somewhere around 17 or 18 per cent. Whether that is too high a figure or not and whether it could be cut down is hard to know.  We also are aware that in regard to generally essential retail products there are tremendous gaps <Col N="610" /> between the price sought by the producer and the price paid by the consumer. We are equally aware that on the one hand you have widespread complaints by producers of agricultural goods as to the inadequacy of the prices, and on the other hand you have complaints of the inability of the consumers to meet the present prices for those agricultural products coming on to the consumer market.  Nobody is objecting, in fact everybody wants to see agricultural producers getting a fair and proper price for their produce, but if, in order to ensure that an additional levy has to be paid by the consumer&mdash; a levy which will be soaked up between the consumer and the producer&mdash;then that is something that should be inquired into.</P>
    <P>We are further aware that in regard to profits there is a peculiar situation. Some years ago when the corporation profits tax was in operation the amount held was somewhere around £5,000,000 out of the total of £17,000,000 that was provided in the form of income-tax and other corporate taxes charged to companies&mdash;the excess profits tax was abolished&mdash;and that taxation group has now gone up to £27,000,000 or £28,000,000 and the corporation profits tax is down to about £2,000,000.  Reading the company reports from week to week it is quite clear that for many companies engaged in various manufactures times are fairly good, so good in fact that instead of issuing their profits in straight dividends they are holding them up and issuing them in the form of free bonus shares so that the rate of dividend is cut initially.</P>
    <P>These are things which do not inspire confidence in the consumer and they are the kind of things that do require some form of investigation that would result in some satisfaction to the consumer.  The consumers need an assurance that these reserves are not being built up out of prices that could be lower.  It is also important to look at profits from the point of view that the margin you have got to work out in regard to retail prices from the point of view of getting a reduction is so small that it is not possible to effect an actual reduction in the retail price, and we have got to ensure that the <Col N="611" /> resultant gain is attained not by the particular manufacturers or distributors. In that case you have got to fall back on the question of looking into the profits in order to ensure that the consumers are not being rooked too severely.  Taxation is another form of ensuring that, as I said before, the general burden borne by the consumer in this country is not too excessive or unwarranted.</P>
    <P>In earlier debates on prices here, the Labour Party and I myself pressed very strongly for the introduction of the last point in the Labour Party's election programme&mdash;investigation of prices by an independent tribunal sitting in public.  We have had that for some years and it is time now to re-examine the position.  I recall on one occasion saying to Deputy Lemass when he was Minister for Industry and Commerce that the Prices Section of his Department, which up to then was used as the watchdog for the consumers, had completely lost the confidence of the consuming public and that it should be replaced by some other type of machinery in order that the confidence of the public might be restored.  I very much fear that the Prices Advisory Body now in existence has in turn lost the confidence of the public, and I think we should examine that point very carefully because if at any point the general mass of the consuming public become convinced that the machinery devised either by this House or by Government office is no longer safeguarding and watching their interests, they are going to look for other remedies.</P>
    <P>In so far as the present Prices Advisory Body is concerned a number of suggestions have been put to the present Minister as they were put to his predecessor.  First of all, it seems to me that the one essential characteristic which any investigating prices body should secure and maintain right from the beginning is that it is neutral as between the consumer and the manufacturer or distributor who has the power of fixing prices, because the consumer is entitled to, if you like, a champion and a defender.  People engaged in manufacturing, in industry, <Col N="612" /> in agriculture or in distribution are specially privileged in the sense that they are dealing with their own costs &mdash;they have a knowledge of their own costs, they have a knowledge of how the final cost of a particular product is arrived at.  They have got their own accounts, which are regarded as confidential information, and they are well able to make their case.  But nobody is in the same position to act for the consumer.  If to-morrow morning an application is made before the Prices Advisory Body for an increase in the price of some particular product manufactured or imported, those who go to make that application are experts not only in the sense that they know their own business but they have their own expert auditors and cost accountants and the case is presented to the body which is up to the moment presumably expected to be impartial and neutral and likely to decide on the merits of a case as presented to them. And against the strength of that application for an increase in price the consumer is dependent for his protection on such bodies as the Lower Prices Council, the Irish Housewives' Association, the Trade Union Congresses and so forth, who are all amateurs in this field.  They have not got the training or the informed experts which those making the application have got.  They have not got access to the figures and to the accounts which are treated as confidential.</P>
    <P>In passing it is well to remind ourselves that in this country it is exceptionally difficult to get information in regard to companies' figures which is readily available in England and elsewhere.  When the present Attorney-General was Minister for Finance in 1948 he commented on that fact and promised a Bill to try and make it possible to secure much wider and much more dependable information in regard to the operations of public companies and other types of enterprise than we are able to get at the present time.  There is that difficulty to be faced by the consumer in regard to all applications for increased prices.</P>
    <P>I think also that such a tribunal and its personnel should be full-time.  I <Col N="613" /> cannot possibly conceive how in a period where there are rising pressures and prices, a tribunal constituted of ladies and gentlemen who give only part of their time to the task can hope to give satisfactory and full consideration to the type of problems presented to the prices body; I imagine that, not merely would they require to be full-time but, in order effectively to discharge the responsibilities placed upon them, they would find it necessary to work well beyond the normal hours of office work to keep fully informed and to be able to measure and adjudicate upon the case put before them, either for or against, in respect of any particular price.</P>
    <P>I believe also that it is essential to have on the tribunal not only responsible representatives of the consumers but persons who have experience and capacity in dealing with these particular problems.  In addition, there should be available to the tribunal its own independent expert staff of investigators who would be immediately available and immediately subject to the control and direction of the tribunal.  As far as I know, that is not the position.  Again, it is a question of putting the consumers on a level in defending themselves with those who are coming before the tribunal to seek increases in existing prices.  In theory, if a person is charged with an offence against the law and is to be tried by judge and jury, the State prosecutor has the responsibility of placing before the judge and jury, not merely the case for the prosecution, but all the known evidence so that the judge and jury will be fully informed and not influenced to find the defendant guilty on half knowledge.  Equally, in the case of a prices body, we should think in terms of having machinery in the form of experts who, when an application is made to the prices body for an increase in price, would gather together all the available data and facts subject, if you like&mdash;although I have reservations in regard to it&mdash;to matters that are strictly confidential to the particular applicant which at present are ruled out from public consideration. Short of that, every known item of information should be gathered by the experts and presented to the <Col N="614" /> tribunal, not in any biased fashion but merely as facts.  In that way those who would speak for the consumers will be placed in a position somewhat relative to the position of those making the application.  Let both sides argue the merits of a case and let the tribunal then make its decision, always with the reservation, which I make quite definitely, without equivocation, that the sympathies of the tribunal should be on the side of the consumer and it should take much more to convince them of the merit of an application for a price increase than to convince them the other way, because the consumer requires protection and there is no other way that I know of providing it.</P>
    <P>I would also suggest, both for the good of their soul and the reputation of any Minister for Industry and Commerce, that it is time that we cleaned up&mdash;I do not mean by improving but by terminating&mdash;the activities of the Prices Section of the Department of Industry and Commerce and tried to get something completely new.  I am not criticising the officers who staff that section but they have been there too long and over the years they have developed a cynical acceptance of many of the propositions put up to them and are bound in many ways by the precedents that they themselves have set up in dealing with various problems presented to them.  The procedure that is followed at the moment with regard to price increase is that, say, a group of manufacturers make an application to the Minister: he refers it to the Prices Advisory Body; the Prices Advisory Body hold an inquiry and make their recommendation. I do not know what would be the attitude of the present Minister or his predecessor but I take it for granted that, being busy men with a great deal of responsibility, when they get a recommendation, in the ordinary way, they would hand it over to the leading officials in the Prices Section for comment and guidance.  Quite frankly, I have pity for any Minister for Industry and Commerce who is dependent on the guidance of the Prices Section of his Department because even in the small number of cases that were heard by the Prices Advisory <Col N="615" /> Body in its first year of activity it was clearly shown that facts and figures that had been presented to the Prices Section and on which increases had been allowed, when examined with a different eye and from a different viewpoint by members of the Prices Advisory Body were shown to be completely incapable of sustaining the application.  That clearly indicated the very bad preparation of the case and the manner in which many of the applicants were chancing their arm in going before the Prices Advisory Body. That was shown by the Press reports of the hearings.  I recall that on one occasion there was an objection made to information which had been made available to the Prices Section being referred to and being used by the Prices Advisory Body.  I do not know on what ground that objection was made except that the members of the Prices Advisory Body were making very good and effective use of the information to demolish in public the case being made on that occasion for an increase in price.  Those same figures had apparently been accepted year after year by the Prices Section of the Department as a basis for justifying permission to increase prices.</P>
    <P>I have commented somewhat severely on the Prices Section, but no matter how effectively the Prices Advisory Body may operate or how deep their investigations may go or how effective may be the protection they give to the consumer, there will still be need, either within the Department of Industry and Commerce or through some other body, to maintain continuous and watchful control and supervision over general profit margins, because often the only way in which you can protect the consumer against excessive prices is by dealing with the profit margin in the particular industry.  That profit margin cannot always be dealt with as a factor in the final cost price but must be collected in some other form. That is why it is essential that we should retain that type of machinery.</P>
    <P>I opened by saying that the Prices Advisory Body should not be neutral in so far as the consumer is concerned. The consumer is entitled to protection. He is also entitled to advice.  During <Col N="616" /> the war years one of the most effective helps given to the consumer in England was the weekly or twice-weekly advertisement issued by the Ministry of Food in which they gave very excellent advice to the consumer in regard to essential foods, prices, various foods that were available and that could be used in order to keep down the household budget.</P>
    <P>An advisory tribunal here, knowing the difficulty there is in getting effective information from the consumers, should be authorised by the Government to expend money, if necessary, in buying space in the newspapers in which to give advice and guidance to the consumers.  I understand that people who have attended the hearings of the Prices Advisory Body and who have listened to the presentation of the cases and the discussion there, have come out and have been amazed when they read the reports in the newspapers of what was alleged to have gone on in that hearing.  Very often the reports bore no resemblance whatever to the case presented by any of the parties or even to the activities of the tribunal itself.  That in part, I suppose, is one of the reasons why so few members of the public have any great confidence in the Prices Advisory Body.  It is because they have been misled by lack of information, by incorrect reports and very often by prejudiced reports in the newspapers.</P>
    <P>I would therefore suggest that the Advisory Body&mdash;or the Minister, if there is doubt about giving such powers to the Advisory Body&mdash;should utilise the means of publicity through the daily Press&mdash;paying for it, because I do not think you would get it for nothing&mdash;to advise and guide the consumer. It does not necessarily mean that he has to launch into a public attack upon some particular product or manufacture, but there are many ways in which guidance can be given.  For example, at the present time the complaint is being made that, despite the present high price of meat in the retail butchers, the great mass of people are not trying to save themselves by buying the cheaper cuts.  The same question was raised in regard to bacon.  I do not know exactly what <Col N="617" /> the explanation is, except that I notice that over recent years there has been a much greater increase in the cheaper cuts of meat than there has been in the dearer.  That is correct.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>An increase in price?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. J. Larkin Mr. J. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, an increase in price.  I also gather from many women that they feel that the difference in price between, say, the first-class and second-class cuts of meat or bacon in respect of economy, taste and quality, is far too small and that in fact it is better buying to buy the dearer cuts because of the overall return.  Whether that is correct or not I do not know, but it is clear that there are many ways in which an effective and vigilant body, concerned and interested in the welfare of the consumers, could help through effective publicity.  I think it should be considered from that point of view.</P>
      <P>I want to close on one note that I think is important.  Quite clearly, it is not prices in themselves that create the problem: it is the relationship between prices and wages and salaries. From that point of view we should bear in mind again that, after all, the objective of our whole national economy, whether it be industrial or agricultural, is not just to produce goods; it is to provide a standard of living for our people and, we hope, a rising standard. Up to the moment the only way in which the people can measure that standard is by the relationship between prices and their income.  It is for that reason that it is so important that the Government and the responsible Minister would pay particular attention to the situation that is developing.  There is uneasiness, there is a growing fear that prices are starting now on an upward path and will get out of hand; and that, not through any lack of desire to try and tackle the problem of prices but, if you like, through lack of knowledge, lack of competency or just ordinary practical difficulties, there is not going to be any effective control enforced against those rising prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am particularly concerned with this problem because I have to look at it from the other angle; and already those who speak for the trade union movement are starting to speak out <Col N="618" /> aloud.  Already it has been stated quite openly that if the present situation is to continue, if the trade unionists&mdash;and the trade unionists are a very important body in this country; first of all, in the Twenty-Six Counties they represent some 300,000 workers and, with their families added, they represent a very considerable section of the whole population&mdash;if the trade unionists, who have on several occasions since the emergency tried to make their contribution to stability in prices, again find they are to be disappointed and that the commitments that we have made, members of Parties in this House, in respect of prices and price control will not or cannot be given effect to for any reason and that price stability is not going to be maintained, that prices are again starting to rise, then the trade unionists are starting to make it very clear that they are going to look after themselves, because quite clearly nobody else will do it for them.</P>
    <P>Nobody is anxious to see that situation developing, but it is already developing in the unions.  Whether there is still time or not to deal with it I do not know.  Trade unions and their officials are the servants of the members and they have got a responsibility. The task of trade unions is not merely to protect the members but also to raise their standard of life.  The only way we can do it under the present system is to increase our wages relative to prices or to hold our wages and see prices go down.  But even if there is not this uncertainty in regard to prices, we have still got, as far as the trade union movement is concerned, our responsibility to seek to raise the standard of life of our people. We do not propose to forego that right in respect of raising that standard, either by way of improved wages or by securing greater purchasing power for the wages we have got, for any political Party or any Government.  That is what the trade union movement is for, and we are going to carry out our responsibility.</P>
    <P>At the same time, we have got a sense of responsibility in regard to the economy.  In 1946, at the end of the emergency, we made our contribution. By agreement, we limited our claims <Col N="619" /> at that time not to parity with what we had in 1939 but to 50 per cent. of the difference.  We made that contribution. That was wiped out in a matter of nine months by rising prices.  In 1948 we again made a contribution, when by general agreement the wage adjustments were kept within a figure which it was felt would not cause undue instability in regard to the economy and prices.  In 1951, while there was no great change in prices in that time, we did secure some improvements, restoring to some extent what we had lost since 1939.  Then again in 1952 we had the disturbing effect of the withdrawal of subsidies and we had again to try to adjust the relationship through wage increases.  No one can challenge or charge the organised trade unionists with having lacked a sense of responsibility in the post-war years.</P>
    <P>When responsible officers of trade unions are calling the attention, as they have already done, of the Government&mdash;this Government as it happens to be at the moment, or the Fianna Fáil Government as it happened to be in the past&mdash;to the seriousness and importance of paying attention to this present situation in regard to prices, they are not doing it from the point of view of creating a scare, but they are doing it because they are aware that pressure is already building up, and that if remedial actions are not taken they will be required by their members to seek through their organisations to adjust a balance which has been disturbed by the rising prices.  We are not going to make any apology for that, and if that happens because there is still ineffective price investigation and control we will then be told to have increased wages again, and consequently prices will have to go up and we will be back where we were in 1939 when prices jumped ahead, and we never really caught up since on them. If that situation happens, whether it be the inter-Party Government that is in office or the Fianna Fáil Government, it will be a serious situation for our economy as a whole and one that can give rise to serious difficulties. Therefore, it is important at the present moment to speak out quite frankly and without any fear of being thought <Col N="620" /> unduly critical of the Government you support or of the Party to which you belong.</P>
    <P>This is a problem with which we are all concerned and on which we should try to speak with a sense of honesty and responsibility.  The Government is on test.  I think every Government is on test since 1939 on this question of prices.  The Labour Party is on test. We are all on test because we have all accepted certain commitments.  We are trying to carry out those commitments, as I said earlier, and at least we have indicated the direction in which we want to travel.  We have done that in respect of butter and tea and we have not indicated that we want to travel backwards as the Opposition did in 1951.  Whether we can travel as far as we want to travel and as far as the situation warrants, I do not know.  The responsibility, so far as commitments are concerned, lies on every member of the House but the responsibility and power of dealing effectively with the the situation must, of necessity, lie in the hands of the Government.  I trust that they will appreciate the situation and understand how important it is to re-examine this whole problem of price control, particularly the machinery for investigation.  As far as the Labour Party is concerned and the ordinary Deputies, their responsibility is to speak out&mdash;not to sit, dumb and quiescent, as the members of Fianna Fáil did when they were on this side of the House&mdash;and see what the results are, and if the results do not come, then we will have to draw our own conclusions.</P>

      <P>I intended to make a point of price control, but it has been dealt with very effectively by Deputy Larkin and so I shall go on to the other points I want to make and the suggestions&mdash;say, on policy&mdash;to the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
      <P>I was at a function about ten years ago and the Minister's predecessor was there, and an industrialist said: &ldquo;I take my hat off to Mr. Lemass.&rdquo;  That was one day I kept my hat on.  I have never been carried away by the policy of the Department of Industry and Commerce and by the manner in which that Department did its job in the past ten or 15 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="621" /> In the first place, we could take the matter of ships.  Ships are the business of the Department of Industry and Commerce, through Irish Shipping, the building and providing of ships.  Much to my horror, I heard a statement from a Minister whom I thought was a responsible Minister, Deputy Aiken, at that time just when the war broke out, when he said that so far as he and Fianna Fáil were concerned he did not care if all the ships were at the bottom of the sea.  Twelve months afterwards Mr. Aiken was in America trying to pick up any old ships he could lay hands on to form an Irish fleet.  And now, to show that Fianna Fáil's policy was not what it should be and that the Ministers were not as well briefed&mdash;or maybe as well up&mdash;in the matter of ships as they might be, the present Minister's predecessor came to my constituency and he opened a magnificent dock there.  That night a dinner was given to him by the Chamber of Commerce.  The Waterford Chamber of Commerce are the true descendants of the people who met King John in Waterford.  They will meet anyone and show him the fair face and they would meet a Minister for Industry and Commerce especially if they thought they were going to get concessions out of him&mdash;for themselves, not so much for the city.  They have been doing that all the time.  They met everybody that came, Carew and Mountjoy, James and William&mdash;it did not matter who came. In any case, the Minister on this occasion must have been carried away by the choruses of &ldquo;He's a jolly good fellow,&rdquo; and when he was making his speech, again much to my horror, he described the policy and the programme of Irish Shipping Limited and said that they were about to build ten 10,000-tonners.  Thank God I had a word to say to this in a later toast, and it is the custom now at dinners that you do not speak to whatever is on the card but you get up and say whatever you like.  I just mentioned the matter of the Minister's ten 10,000-tonners and pointed out to him that none of those 10,000-tonners would ever tie up at the dock he had opened that day.  That was very bad briefing and I was surprised that he did not know <Col N="622" /> it without being briefed.  The matter was placed before him at any rate with a request to meet the members of Waterford Harbour Commissioners or have his officials meet them, and some of the ships were shortened.</P>
    <P>I think this is a matter which should be drawn to the attention of the present Minister, that when we are putting our fleet of ships together and in any future building we should try to build as many as possible suitable to go into as many ports as possible. I am not speaking for Waterford. Deputy Moher is laughing, perhaps he wants it all to go into Dublin and be lorried down the country.</P>

We should have a good mercantile marine and we have the basis of a good mercantile marine and when we build ships we should build ships that can go into&mdash;say, Youghal, that might be of interest to Deputy Moher &mdash;small ports throughout the country, and take in coal and artificial manure and what-have-you at the cheapest possible freight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last week there were speeches by members of the Opposition and some of them, I think, deplored the fact that Deputy Norton was Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I welcome the fact that Deputy Norton became Minister for Industry and Commerce for the very reason that most of the <Col N="623" /> industrialists that I knew did not like the appointment.  That is a fact.  But the people who are working in the factories liked the appointment, and the ordinary plain people of Ireland liked the appointment because they knew no concessions would be given out to any groups or cliques and that the weapon of protection would not be handed over to somebody to protect an industry.  They knew that weapon was not going to be used to stick up the people of Ireland and hold them up to ransom as we have seen it occasionally used, with no action taken by the previous Minister.</P>
    <P>I read a few of the debates on the various Supplies and Services Bills. There are some great pressure groups in this country.  Small industries are able to get their industries and their problems brought up here in the House <i>ad nauseam</i> and able to set up a howl about the number of people who are getting a livelihood out of these small industries; but I have seldom heard any word said for the greatest proportion of our agricultural industry, although we hear speeches made against it.  I refer to the Irish live cattle trade.  Irish cattle are carried mainly in English ships, in ships owned by British Railways.  The members of the cattle trade are continually protesting, not only that the freights are so high, but that they are so high that they are actually subsidising a large portion of British Railways as well. This is a matter to which the Minister should pay attention and he should consider the feasibility of entering the cross-Channel trade in consultation with Irish Shipping, if British Railways do not meet the Irish live-stock exporters in their reasonable demands.</P>
    <P>I have spoken occasionally and every time I mention the cattle trade I am met with shouts of &ldquo;bullocks&rdquo;, &ldquo;ranchers&rdquo; and &ldquo;grass&rdquo;.  I never heard of any ranchers who rear calves. The calf comes from the dairy farm and many of the dairy farmers rear them to the yearling stage and then sell them and they might eventually meet up with whatever few ranchers are left.  In any case, there is a good deal of money got for this country out of <Col N="624" /> them and they have not got to be subsidised. I have yet to find the machine that will feed a calf every morning and night.  These animals have to be given attention.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but I am pointing out to the Minister the great importance of the Irish live-stock trade. We have all these dead meat industries established all over the country and there are many people who are prepared to praise them and at the same time to talk about bullocks and ranchers.  Where are the cattle to come from?  It is not out of the air they will come.</P>
      <P>Last night, one of the cattle salesmasters said: &ldquo;In the days of 1932 to 1935, when producers were not doing so well, we battled along and complained very little, although the whole foundation of what we built up was falling to pieces.&rdquo;  It was Fianna Fáil's definite policy to destroy that magnificent industry, but even though every means was used to destroy it and to destroy a great many of the people who carried on that business, the Irish cattle trade, then as now, was carried on by men of resource, integrity, courage and initiative.  They are able to go up to a cattle market in Dublin which is small in area but the biggest cattle market in the world and £1,500,000 of money changes hands there every week; but if you mention this trade within a yard of a Fianna Fáil meeting, there are a few people who are now absent from the House who will come back with the old war-cry about bullocks and ranchers and grass.</P>
      <P>We have heard a lot of talk about prices and about promises by the greatest lot of promisers ever known. I remember seeing their big bills&mdash;&ldquo;We will bring back the emigrants.&rdquo; They did not promise to stop emigration at all&mdash;they were going to bring them back and we were going to have excursions.  Did they?  &ldquo;We will do away with unemployment altogether.&rdquo; Did they?  &ldquo;No man should have more than £1,000 a year.&rdquo;  I ask you&mdash;what did they do about that?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Corry&mdash;we have the Petronius of the Fianna Fáil Party now to correct me.  He produced the document and said that the Cork Flour Milling Company had published a price of 36/- a barrel for barley, and then went on to work himself into one of his rages over it.  It is all the same to the farmers.  If they published it at 36/- a barrel, he is not going to sell them barley, and whoever sold barley last year or this year at 36/- a barrel should get his head examined.  A price of 18/- a cwt. for barley!  When that famous circular was given out, the Minister for Agriculture intervened and the price of maize was brought down in the ports of Cork and Waterford and barley immediately rose. That, however, was only a quoted price because I tried to buy barley for myself and my relatives and I could not buy it.  At that time, if a man could buy barley at 18/- a cwt., he was being charged 36/- a cwt. for these feeding nuts which are produced and sold to farmers and God knows what is in them.</P>
      <P>It is the declared policy of Fianna Fáil to provide for 450,000 acres of wheat and the trend for the three years 1952, 1953, 1954 is shown in the figures of 254,000 acres, 334,000 acres and 491,000 acres.  If that had been allowed to go on, we would have had 100,000 acres of wheat in excess and then we would know what would happen.  The price of feeding-stuffs would go up £11 or £12 and the feeders would be made pay the price.  The feeders would have to pass it on to the consumer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Opposition complained about the increase in the cost of fertilisers.  That is caused by a duty of 20 per cent.&mdash; a concession given to the fertiliser factories by Deputy Lemass during his last term of office.  That has put the whole of the fertiliser business into the hands of Imperial Chemicals.  I say <Col N="626" /> that with a due sense of responsibility. During the past three years only £80 in import duty was paid on artificial manure.  That shows that the 20 per cent. tariff is effective.  We now have the <i>status quo</i> and we cannot cause unemployment in these factories.  The man who is now blamed for everything went outside the English and Dutch cartels when he came into office first and went to America and brought down the price of North African potash. Everybody knows that just before the inter-Party Government went out of office in 1952 every store in this country was stuffed with artificial manure. One common proprietary brand was selling, when the inter-Party Government went out, at between £11 and £12 per ton, but Fianna Fáil were not two months in office when it went up £5, £6 and £7 per ton.  Nobody opened his mouth then.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cunningham, who was described by Deputy Larkin as a most responsible Deputy, is a most irresponsible Deputy, in my opinion.  To-night he told us it was a crime to subsidise tea.  At the same time he complained that the Minister had not subsidised coal in Donegal.  I do not blame the Deputy for that.  It is a good thing to look for cheaper coal for one's constituents but if it is treason to subsidise tea for the community as a whole it is not treason, in Deputy Cunningham's view, to subsidise coal for Donegal.</P>
    <P>The first week I was in this House Deputy Cunningham challenged Deputy Dillon about tuberculin testing and advocated that it should be done in Donegal; that Donegal was exporting calves and was a most important dairying area.  I was in Donegal and I have often seen more calves in Newmarket in Cork than I saw in Donegal.  That was a most irresponsible statement to make.</P>
    <P>With regard to prices, nobody on the opposite side tried to bring down the price of meat.  Would Deputy Moher go back to his farming constituents and tell them he wants to bring down the price of meat and cattle?  I will leave that matter and deal with another&mdash;the snapping of factories from areas down the country <Col N="627" /> and bringing them up to Dublin or bringing them to places that do not want them.</P>

      <P>The question of prices was the main line adopted by the Opposition.  Nobody suggested anything about policy.  When the inter-Party Government got in, the first thing Deputy Lemass did was to take off the controls and nobody protested. They let him off because the industrialists had the most to gain by the taking off of controls and not the workers, the consumers or the ordinary plain people of this country.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether I would be in order to speak on the number of industries that are being opened in Dublin and down the country.  I asked the Minister a question this week.  In the past couple of years 207 new industries that he knew of were commenced in Dublin and 145 in respect of the remaining 25 counties. This is a question that should be examined.  I recognise that Dublin is the capital of Ireland but I do say that Dublin is getting top heavy and certain industrialists should be given a direction, if possible, to go down the country.</P>

      <P>With regard to coal, there is an enormous amount of coal in Dublin which is being made available <Col N="628" /> to the coal merchants all of whom are not resident in Dublin.  There are coal merchants who have quotas that they should use in Dublin but they are using coal from the Phoenix Park and sending their quotas down to Cork and Waterford.  They are taking an unfair advantage of those merchants.  That is also a matter that should be examined. I like competition but that is unfair competition.</P>
      <P>Finally, the Tourist Bill is before the House at present.  Tourism is one of the things we provide money for in connection with the Supplies and Services Bill.  I hope that the money provided here for tourism will be spent on the actual bringing of tourists to this country and that the Minister will see to it that British Railways be again brought to book about their freights&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>The course in which this debate has been directed is, I think, the best proof in support of the plea which Deputy Lemass made for the repeal of this particular measure. The Bill with which we are dealing was introduced, I think, in 1946, less than 10 years ago, and I suppose for the first five years of that period it was a very vital measure, and played a very important part in the period that can be described as an emergency period. In the course of time it gradually lost its value, and I suppose within the last three years it could have been repealed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Lemass has already informed the House, the last Government was making preparation to have the Bill replaced by the necessary legislation in the various Departments of State affected by that measure.  I know that the Department which I had the honour to represent was working on the legislation that would have been necessary in respect of that particular Bill in the event of the Bill being repealed. I know that the Government had issued instructions to all Ministers to have the same done in their Departments, and the Minister for Industry and Commerce must be fully aware that <Col N="629" /> even within his own Department these preparations were well advanced.  I think there can be no better proof of the desirability of having that Bill replaced by a permanent measure.</P>
    <P>I must confess that I have lost count of the number of times the Chair had to intervene in this debate to draw the attention of almost every Deputy on both sides of the House that the matter which they were discussing was more relevant to some particular aspect of another Estimate for another Department. I think that the Minister will be fully justified in taking the most speedy possible action in making an effort to repeal this Bill, and to have it replaced by permanent legislation.</P>
    <P>I was very glad to hear Deputy Larkin supporting the plea which Deputy Lemass made.  I think it is very desirable that that should be done. I know it is pretty difficult to blame Deputies for taking advantage of this measure to discuss practically every possible phase of Government activities, because over the years in which this Temporary Provisions Bill has been brought before this House, Deputies have been prone to discuss it in exactly the same way as it has been discussed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Davin who is now Parliamentary Secretary, said on one occasion in the course of the debate on this Department: &ldquo;Is it not a fact that that is the whole economic policy of the Government?&rdquo;  There are those who believe that on this particular Bill we can discuss every and any aspect of Government policy, even though the discussion may be duplicated, triplicated and quadruplicated by reason of the fact that the same arguments, the same discussion on viewpoints, can be put forward on each of the Estimates, as they come again before the House.  It is for that reason that I am supporting the plea put forward by Deputy Lemass.  I hope that this is the last occasion on which it will be necessary to refer to that matter.</P>
    <P>Now that Deputy Larkin is back again in the House I would like to refer to some of his remarks.  He appeared to me to have constituted <Col N="630" /> himself the St. George of the inter-Party group as against the dragon of Fianna Fáil.  I was glad in a sense to see him, for the first time in my recollection, engendering a fair amount of heat in initiating the debate on this Bill.  I am sure that a lot of that heat was engendered as a result of the miserable retreat which his colleagues on the right made from the promises which they gave on the public platforms throughout the period of election, promises which they now try to convince themselves they did not make.</P>
    <P>I have a very distinct recollection of the present Minister for External Affairs coming into this House on one occasion, when he was representing the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and telling the House, in what we imagined was a very innocent manner, that prices had not risen during the course of the Coalition Government.  I can recollect that the gasp of dismay which arose from these benches on this side of the House was smothered completely by the howl of derision that arose outside at such a statement, because it was obvious anyhow, to the housewives of Dublin City&mdash;whatever it may have been to the housewives of the country&mdash;that the statement was not only false, but was misleading. Quite a number of people attribute the defeat of the Coalition Government at a shorter period later on to that statement.  I have no doubt that the howl of derision which went up on that occasion will be repeated again when they hear this miserable attempt to, as I say, run away from the promises which they then gave.</P>
    <P>Deputy Larkin took Deputy Cunningham to task for his reference to subsidies in regard to tea and he asked Deputy Cunningham what was the difference in borrowing money to subsidise tea as against loaning money to industrialists, capitalists or farmers in order to go on with their industries and to cultivate their farms.  Everybody must be fully aware that the subsidies which will go to keep the price of tea at its present level will not be recovered.  It will go up in steam whereas the money which is being loaned to industrialists is an investment, an asset to the State which will <Col N="631" /> be restored with interest in due course. It is the other way in respect to the loan for tea: the State will not only have to pay the principal but it will also have to pay the interest on the principal.</P>
    <P>We all know, at least I am satisfied that I know, that prices can only be controlled in a limited manner.  I am not going to suggest that the present Government can perform miracles any more than the last Government could perform them.  I am not going to suggest that within a period of seven months all the promises they made on the platforms should be honoured. However, it is not a question of a period of seven months that is at issue; it is a period of three and a half years plus seven months because quite a number of the people who made these promises were very responsible people with managerial experience behind them.</P>
    <P>I can well understand a young man who is endeavouring to get into public life, who goes on a platform before the public and makes his appeal to the people, making foolish statements&mdash;and believing in the foolish statements with no intention of lying&mdash;that these prices could be brought down, that the mere fact that a group of individuals who hold views like his become a Government, they can by reason of that executive position bring those prices down.  I can well understand that but what I cannot understand is that people who have been for three and a half years in ministerial positions should make statements they know they cannot in any circumstances honour.</P>
    <P>Deputy Larkin went out of his way to make certain that he did not make any promises.  He said that Fianna Fáil did not make any promises and, therefore, they did not have any promises to break.  In the course of his own speech he referred to the fact that he himself was very careful and having looked through his speeches he found that he did not make any promises that he would have to honour.  In fact he did not call them promises but referred to commitments. The only difference I see between a <Col N="632" /> commitment and a promise is that if one makes a commitment one must honour it but one can make a promise and not be able to fulfil the promise. However, his colleagues entered into these commitments and I think they ought to be making some effort to honour these commitments and not be saying at this stage that they did not make any promises.</P>
    <P>I can well understand also Deputies behind the Front Bench taking up that attitude and saying: &ldquo;We made no promises&rdquo;.  I can well understand it in view of the fact that they got a lead and from no less a person than the head of the present Government when he came into this House on an occasion and made this statement.  I am quoting from column 60, Volume 146 of the Official Debates of the 2nd June, 1954:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;But I made it abundantly clear in every speech I made that we were making no promises, and I said that anybody who was voting for me or anybody associated with me or who would be associated with me voted on that distinct statement that I was making no promises to anybody in the course of that general election campaign.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Everybody who knows the Taoiseach and who follows his activities up and down the country and throughout the cities and towns of the country knows that at every meeting he addressed he assured his listeners that the removal of Fianna Fáil was going to mean a reduction in taxation and a reduction in the prices of commodities.</P>

      <P>My concern in this matter now is that when the Minister was on the Opposition Benches of this House he did not take that point of <Col N="635" /> view.  He took the point of view that the Minister was responsible for every rise in price in relation to every commodity. He did not say: &ldquo;I know that the Minister has no function in regard to this, that or the other thing.&rdquo;  He just held the Minister responsible for every rise, be it large or small, that took place.  Let us now come to another Minister.  In this case it is the Minister for Education, Deputy Mulcahy.  He said&mdash;and I am quoting from the <i>Irish Independent</i> of the 28th April, 1954&mdash;&ldquo;The people must replace the present Government by one which would set itself vigorously to reducing the cost of living and taxation.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>His vigour must have been employed in a wrong direction. He must have been back-pedalling, because the cost of living which he was going to attack so vigorously has not been reduced: it has gone up.  There is no Minister on the Government Benches who will deny the statement that the cost of living has increased&mdash; not decreased.  Therefore, the vigour of the Minister for Education must have been dissipated.  However, he was not satisfied with that statement. He went a little further.  In this city, where he had a very fine audience of housewives who were anxious for somebody to come to their assistance, he had this to say: &ldquo;Dublin could now strike the decisive blow against over-taxation, the high cost of living and the resultant distresses caused by the present Government.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Hear, hear&rdquo; again, but where is the reduction?  Let us see the results.  We have not seen any results.  I want to stress that I am not dealing now with a period of seven months.  I can well appreciate that seven months is a short period but, even in that short period, results could have been achieved.  I am talking about three and a half years plus seven months when I am referring to these things.  Yet, Deputy Dillon&mdash;who is responsible for the agricultural policy of this country&mdash;made that statement. I think it was only the evening before last that I saw in very large type across the front page of another organ that supports the present Government the heading: &ldquo;The Rasher is Priced off the Pan.&rdquo;  I do not think any member of the Fianna Fáil Party made the statement that the rasher is priced off the pan &mdash; which means that the housewife can no longer provide that little luxury for her husband or for the other members of her family.  It is going to be a luxury in future.  Of course, it is a matter of amusement to the Minister now to hear these things, but it was not a matter of amusement when he used to speak with such feeling from this side of the House and plead for the very people to whom I am referring now.</P>

God help us, where is the housewife to look for relief?  That is what I want to know.  Nobody has any responsibility apparently.  The Minister has not, and the Minister for Agriculture has not. That is the position which exists at present.  Deputy MacEoin, another prominent member of the Front Bench, said that Fine Gael thought that the best way to make the country prosper was to reduce taxation, raise the standard of living and give the people the necessities of life at the cheapest possible rate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>What I want to emphasise is that you have no more control over the prices that you said you would bring down than the former Government had.  We did not stand on platforms throughout the country and tell the people that we could reduce prices.  We made it crystal clear that so long as this nation had to import things that were necessary for the ordinary general public, we could not reduce prices, that these prices were outside our control.  Every <Col N="639" /> Deputy in this House, knows as well as I do, that the standard of living is in the main governed by the fact that the greater the production, the mineral resources and the agricultural resources of a country are, the more independent that country is of any other country.  Nations with large resources of that kind can control their own cost of living.  We are not in that happy position.  This is a nation that has to import a considerable amount of the necessities of life.  So long as we have to do that we are at the mercy of the people from whom we import these goods.  Therefore, it would be foolish for me, foolish for any of my colleagues, to make statements that we knew we could not fulfil.  That is why I take objection to the fact that responsible Ministers of the present Government, knowing these facts as well and perhaps better than I do, made these irresponsible statements, knowing that there was no hope, no immediate hope anyway, of fulfilling these promises.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>Then we come to another Minister who had responsibility before as Minister, the Minister for Justice.  Deputy Everett went around the country and he had in front <Col N="640" /> of his platform a large poster.  On that poster he had detailed the prices of various commodities or necessities of life.  He charged the Fianna Fáil Government with being responsible for the prices then in existence, and he stated on this poster: &ldquo;Fianna Fáil deliberately increased these prices at the behest of the Central Bank. Reduce food prices by voting No. 1 for James Everett.&rdquo;  I want to know now is Deputy Everett also acting at the behest of the Central Bank?  Is he also a victim of the Central Bank?  Is he also increasing the price of foodstuffs because the Central Bank instructed him to do so, as he charged the Fianna Fáil Government were instructed?  I know that Deputy Everett used to have a ghost in the cupboard in the form of Communists in other branches of the Labour Party but, of course, when he had to associate as a member of the Government with other members of the Labour Party, he had to find some other spectre.  Of course, the Central Bank suited him very nicely.  The Central Bank is apparently now the bogey of the Minister for Justice.  It would be interesting to know if the Central Bank is still influencing the Government or forcing up the prices of commodities which the public require.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a perfect recollection of the end of the election when victory was assured to the inter-Party Government, when they knew that all that was necessary was that they should take office and everything would be all right.  I have a very distinct recollection of Alderman Byrne, as he then was, proposing a vote of thanks to the returning officer and telling the large assembly present that he was going to ensure that the promises that were made by the members of the new Government would be fulfilled and that his voice would be raised at all times to see that they would be fulfilled. Deputy Denis Larkin also made a brief speech on that occasion.  He said that his duty as a member of the Labour Party would be to see that the prices of the commodities which the people needed would be brought down and that the promises made from the various platforms would be fulfilled. He said that he, as one member of the Labour Party, would see that those <Col N="641" /> promises were fulfilled.  I am wondering now if he is satisfied with the degree of fulfilment to date.  Is he satisfied that the improvements he set out to secure have been secured?  Is he merely going to sit back and await events?</P>
    <P>I said at the outset that I did not expect any Government to perform miracles.  No member on this side of the House expects the present Government to perform miracles.  The days of miracles are gone.  What we do expect is that when responsible people go before the electorate and make promises, they will at least stand over those promises and will not run away from them.  We expect them to be prepared to say: &ldquo;We made these promises in good faith; we have failed to fulfil them to date but we hope, in the course of time, to fulfil them.&rdquo; That is what we expect and not what we have been listening to from all those Deputies who have spoken and said: &ldquo;We made no promises.&rdquo;  That sort of behaviour will not raise the standard of this House.  I was listening lately to some people discussing the condition of affairs in the country at the present time; it was regrettable to hear: &ldquo;They are all the same.  They are a lot of frauds.&rdquo;  That is a situation brought about by the non-fulfilment of the promises made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to Deputy Traynor, one could not help feeling that the Deputy had been asked to make a speech about the promises that had been made and allegedly broken, and he realised that the task he had set himself was a very difficult one indeed.  It is difficult to imagine any former member of a Fianna Fáil Government speaking with ease about broken promises.  I do not want to go back down the corridors of the years but merely to remind Deputies that one reason why Deputy Traynor is now Deputy Traynor, and sitting over there, is because he and his colleagues in a famous document issued over the signature of their leader in June, 1951, entered into a solemn commitment with the Irish people and the members of this House that they would preserve existing food subsidies, maintain the <Col N="642" /> price of tea at 2/10 and subsidise the price of bread, butter, flour and sugar.</P>

      <P>Point No. 15 of the famous 17 points, as I recollect them, contained words to the effect that a Fianna Fáil Government, if elected, would maintain the existing food subsidies and enforce a proper method of price control.  Having assumed office in June, 1951, the very Government which entered into that commitment&mdash;it was a solemn commitment and a solemn undertaking given over the signature of the leader of the Government subsequently formed; it was not made in the heat of an election meeting&mdash;proceeded in a matter of a few months to disregard that undertaking and to remove the existing food subsidies.  That is a matter upon which any Deputy of the Fianna Fáil Party, and particularly an ex-Minister, must feel some anxiety.</P>
      <P>I feel Deputy Traynor had a very difficult role to play this evening when he referred to speeches and promises that were either broken or forgotten. The trouble with the Opposition at the moment is that they do not apparently realise what role they should play. They are a very bewildered Opposition. They know very well that in the last Dáil this particular debate was the one that hurt them most each time it took place.  It hurt them so much that Deputy Lemass, as Minister, promised to repeal this legislation and to bring in permanent legislation which would avoid the necessity for a yearly stocktaking in relation to prices.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not discussing Deputy Larkin's views at all. I am hazarding a guess as to why Deputy Lemass was so anxious then that this debate should not take place each year.  At the moment the Opposition cannot be quite certain what is their best line to play.  They have a very bitter recollection of what happened to them here after the last election when some foolish enthusiast in their own Party led them into opposing their own Budget.  That particular piece of playacting last June reacted very considerably against them.  In fact, they became the laughing-stock of the country.</P>
      <P>They come in here now in this debate anxious to swipe but not quite sure what they are hitting at.  They are anxious to create a feeling about rising prices but they are not quite sure how far they can go or what is the best method of attack.  Some of them talk about the price of meat, whereupon every agricultural Deputy in the Fianna Fáil Party leaves the House.  Some of them talk about the price of bacon, and Deputy Gilbride nearly has a seizure.</P>
      <P>What is the proper approach for the Opposition in this debate?  Can they legitimately charge this Government with doing nothing in the last seven months in relation to price control and the cost of living?  To judge by some of the speeches, some of the Deputies would appear to be anxious to make that charge.  In fact, of course, the cost-of-living index shows that the price of food has dropped by two points in the last seven months.</P>

      <P>In relation to food, yes.  Unfortunately, rent and rates have gone up and that has more or less neutralised the reduction in food prices.  There is a considerable doubt, apparently, in the Opposition's mind as to what their correct approach <Col N="644" /> should be.  I was amused listening to, I think it was Deputy Cunningham, last night and to-day reading out a list of articles that he said had gone up in price&mdash;I am sure they have&mdash; then, following Deputy Lemass's line, criticising the Government for what it has done with regard to the price of tea.

      <P>We have cocoa and coffee.  Deputy Briscoe is in a bit of trouble about that but that is Deputy Briscoe's concern.  Deputy Cunningham and others, having talked about coffee and cocoa, then took a deep breath, put on a beautiful snowwhite cloak of financial purity and said: &ldquo;Look what the Government have done about tea,&rdquo; and proceeded to tut-tut around the place.  What were they tut-tutting about?  When an Opposition tut-tuts it must have some alternative to suggest.</P>

      <P>Deputy Briscoe may know a lot about that.  He has been clucking all the afternoon waiting to get in.  What policy should the Government adopt?  If we did wrong in preserving for at least the period to next September the existing price of tea and if Deputy Lemass, Deputy Traynor and other Fianna Fáil Deputies condemn us for doing that, have not they a duty to themselves, to the country, to the people they represent, to put forward their policy? What proposal do they put forward? What course do they suggest we should have followed?  Deputy Larkin has already suggested an answer to that question and he has not been contradicted, that if the Fianna Fáil Government were still in office the price of <Col N="646" /> tea at the moment would be up by 1/4 a lb. and consumers could look forward to a further increase of 3/5 or 3/6 next September.</P>

      <P>In relation to the subject of tea&mdash;I do not know whether it was in this debate or not&mdash; but I did see a speech by Deputy Lemass and, I think, by Deputy Childers who, of course, is the greatest exponent of financial orthodoxy that this country has ever seen, in which he says: &ldquo;Oh, the way you have done it&mdash;good heavens&mdash;that is terrible. There is something wrong in allowing Tea Importers to run an overdraft, when the facts are known, for a particular period.  That is something that could never be done.&rdquo;  Deputy Lemass and Deputy Childers seem to have forgotten that that is the particular course which they themselves found it advisable to follow in relation to fuel purchases during the emergency.  Fuel Importers were directed by the Fianna Fáil Government: &ldquo;Go out and buy as much fuel as you can get; run into the red and we will put it into a suspense account and we will discharge it some time.&rdquo;  Of course, that was financial orthodoxy as long as it had the Fianna Fáil stamp on it, but if it is done by an inter-Party Government in relation to an essential foodstuff then we must all throw up our hands in horror and go tut-tutting all over the country.</P>
      <P>I do not think that this debate has been a useful one.  It is rather a pity that more people are not enabled to listen to the speeches in this House, because to my mind this debate illustrates quite clearly that there is no cohesive opposition to the Government in this House.  There are 60 or 65 individuals, not even of one voice.  That used to be the great thing of Fianna Fáil in the past&mdash;they all spoke the same.  They do not know what they are speaking about to-day.  All they want to do is to have a crack at the Government.  The only trouble is they have nothing much to throw.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to get one or two things clear before I conclude.  When I was on the Opposition Benches, in company with my colleagues, I criticised the Fianna Fáil Government very vehemently and strongly on this subject of prices and the cost of living, but <Col N="648" /> I defy any Deputy in Fianna Fáil to find in anything I said or that my colleague said which blamed them for price increases which were beyond their control.  We never did it.  We did not do it.  But we did criticise Fianna Fáil for deliberate action taken by them to force up the cost of living.  And do Deputies in the Fianna Fáil Party think now that we were wrong?  Looking back on the last three years is it not true that in their Budget of 1952 Fianna Fáil, the then Government, followed what is now known to have been a mistaken financial policy or a policy embarked upon on false premises? Rightly or wrongly, the then Minister for Finance and the then Government believed that the people had too much money, that they were spending too much of it, that there was a danger to the economy of the country and that the excess money had to be creamed off and less of it allowed to stay in the people's pockets.</P>
    <P>Believing that, the Government in 1952 introduced the black Budget. They deliberately increased the price of essential foodstuffs as part of their financial policy, forcing up the prices of tea, of butter, sugar, flour and bread, so that these commodities, apart from others, would cost more and necessitate workers spending more on essential foodstuffs and so that a notional sum of money would not be over at the end of the week.  That was the financial policy which apparently was accepted by the then Government and followed by them.  It was done ill-advisedly because, as Deputy Traynor said, no Government is going to choose the unpopular path. I feel sure no Government is going to do it, but if a Government is sufficiently ill-advised they may follow a course feeling that though they are going through a dark forest there is a light at the other end.  That is what Fianna Fáil thought they were doing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>They wanted a series of candles.  On no ground was that policy successful.  The money which they said would be saved by the abolition and reduction of subsidies <Col N="649" /> was never in fact saved.  And the very moment prices of essential foodstuffs went up a series of wage increases had to take place.  That, in turn, led inevitably to increased taxation and we find now, some two or three years later, that because of the abolition of subsidies in 1952 the cost to the State has been much greater than the amount saved.</P>

      <P>Wages went up.  I do not know if the Deputy follows me.  I certainly do not follow the Deputy.  I am merely stating what happened and the Deputy can consult with his colleagues on this.  I am merely saying that the savings which Deputy MacEntee in 1952 thought he would effect through the reduction in food subsidies were never, in fact, realised because that policy in itself necessitated increased taxation in subsequent years.</P>

We were referring to butter and bread, to tea, sugar and flour&mdash;to the things that Government policy itself had forced up in price.</P>

      <P>May I put it this way to the House?  We have had a number of contributions from different members of the Opposition who have been trying to find some worth-while grounds upon which the Government could be blamed on the subject of prices.  It is always easy to pick out a number of articles at any particular time of the year and say their prices have been increased.  Nowhere will the Opposition find that this Government's policy itself has increased prices or, in so far as it is possible for any Government to do so, permitted prices to rise except perhaps&mdash;and if Deputy Traynor wants a present of it he can have it&mdash;that the Government might have decided to force down the price of meat.  Is that a suggestion to be made by the Opposition?  Is the very Opposition who clamoured about the price of wheat to come in now with different voices and different accents and talk about the price of meat?  Is that to be a suggestion from the Opposition to the Government?  I know it is very easy for an Opposition to say: &ldquo;We are in opposition; we are not in Government and we have no responsibility with regard to policy.  We are only going to criticise and we will not make any suggestions.&rdquo;  That is a method of convenience but it keeps <Col N="651" /> you there, and certainly will not convince the country that there is at the moment any worth-while alternative to this Government.</P>

      <P>We are referring to the last seven months&mdash;these are the months we have been in office &mdash;and I am endeavouring to deal with some of the scattered points made by the Opposition here.  One matter was employment.  The fact is that for the seven months there is less unemployment to-day than there was this time last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>There are still 60,000 unemployed.</P>

      <P>With regard to prices and other matters, the Government has done me things.  The price <Col N="654" /> of butter has been reduced.  I know that some Fianna Fáil Deputies apparently think that that was scarcely worth while doing.  I do not know whether that particular view would be popular anywhere in the country. A reduction of 5d. a lb. in butter, to my mind, was a fair contribution at that time and was well worth while doing.</P>
      <P>In addition, we have endeavoured to shelter the people against what may be passing price increases in relation to tea.  We have at least taken a stand with regard to that and we have shown that, unlike our predecessors, we are concerned, so far as lies within our power, to prevent every stray economic wind that blows from playing the devil with our economy.  I think that in those seven months the Government has shown to the people clear evidence&mdash;in some of the words used by Deputy Traynor in referring to speeches made during the last election&mdash;of its determination to pursue a vigorous policy aimed at a reduction in taxation and in the cost of living.</P>

      <P>The measure that we are discussing this evening is, as we know, a temporary one to give a series of controls to different Departments.  The fact that the Government seek that power of control for the Departments in the coming 12 months indicates pretty clearly that they accept the fact that things are far from normal.  By seeking these controls they desire to improve the position and because of that the Labour Party fully agree with giving them this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not only do we agree with the control and the initiation which it gives to the various Departments that depend to a good measure on it for their powers, but we feel, unlike some of the Opposition, that there is some form of permanent control needed. We believe that when a condition arises now, ten years after the Emergency, which requires food control powers for Industry and Commerce, in which the Department of Agriculture needs control to a large extent over the price of agricultural products, in which the Department of Finance needs to have control over borrowing powers and in which, to a lesser extent <Col N="655" /> Social Welfare and Local Government need certain powers, there is a responsibility on the Government to take to task immediately and to set out some permanent form of legislation.  It must appear reasonable that for the next ten years or perhaps 20 years this State will require that control if the interests of the ordinary public are to be protected.</P>
    <P>The main powers that Industry and Commerce use under this Bill are those of price control.  Through their various officers&mdash;and, in particular, through the Prices Advisory Body&mdash; they seek to protect the public or the consumer from any group of manufacturers <Col N="656" /> or retailers who may attempt to exploit the present position.  Now, while the Prices Advisory Body is, in principle, a perfect solution and a perfect instrument for carrying out price control, I suggest that one of its failures is the attitude of the body itself.  They appear to me, at any rate, to accept the idea that their main function in life is to examine applications for increases in prices that have been referred to them by the Minister. I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Wednesday, 23rd February, 1955.</P>
