      <P>The mineral resources of County Tipperary have been surveyed already, and the information which was obtained is made available by the Geological Survey Office to any person who is interested in exploring or developing the mineral deposits of the county.  The Deputy will appreciate that mineral development is a matter for private enterprise and that coal and lead deposits in Tipperary are already being worked on a substantial scale by private interests.  So far as other deposits in the county are concerned I will be prepared to grant any necessary facilities under the Minerals Development Act, 1940, in relation to such deposits to an applicant who can satisfy the customary conditions as to financial and technical resources.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware that the official canvass in the parish of Templenoe, near Kenmare, revealed that 81 per cent. of the householders were prepared to accept service <Col N="1552" /> under the rural electrification scheme, and, if so, when work on the extension of electrification to the area is likely to begin; further, when an official canvass is likely to be undertaken in the Tahilla-Sneem districts, west of Templenoe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Crotty)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the E.S.B. that the Templenoe area has been considered for selection by the board on a number of occasions but has not so far been selected.  The board states that while the percentage of acceptances in the area is almost 81 the returns have not compared favourably with those for other areas still awaiting development in the board's Tralee district due mainly to the low density population and the small size of the houses.  The areas will be reconsidered for selection by the board in due course and the board's decision will depend on how the area's returns compare with those for other areas awaiting development at the time in the board's Tralee district.</P>
      <P>I am also informed that it is expected that the official canvass of the Tahilla-Sneem districts will be undertaken by next autumn.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the E.S.B. that the Glenbeigh area has been considered for selection by the board on a number of occasions but has not so far been selected as its returns have not compared favourably with those for other areas awaiting development in the board's Tralee district. The board states that the prospects of the area being selected would be considerably improved if there were an increase in the number of householders who are willing to accept supply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also informed that an official canvass of Glencar rural area will be <Col N="1553" /> undertaken towards the end of next year.

Official canvasses have already been carried out in some areas and will be carried out in further areas during the coming year.

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands whether the Land Commission are aware that the average valuation of holdings in the majority of townlands in the electoral district of Corraun, Achill, and especially on the Dickens estate, is amongst the lowest in the country, and, if so, whether the commission propose to arrange for the migration of any tenants from this area in the near future.</P>

      <P>The Land Commission are aware of the congestion which exists in the Corraun district but, as I indicated in my reply to a rather similar question by the Deputy on the 15th December, 1954, there is a general reluctance among the tenants to migrate to eastern areas and to abandon their present means of livelihood.  The problem is to find an adequate number of suitable and willing migrants so that the holdings of those remaining can be properly rearranged and improved, but just now I can see little prospect of achieving that.  The position, however, is under constant review.</P>

Moreover, it would not be easy to frame an enactment to exclude foreign newspapers on other grounds which would not do more harm than good and interfere unduly with the rights of the public to choose their own reading though, if national sentiment is to be affronted by scurrilous publications of the kind to which the Deputy has drawn attention, I will have to give the matter further consideration.

      <P>The bovine T.B. eradication scheme has been in operation throughout the country since 1st September, 1954.  The Deputy may, however, have <Col N="1557" /> in mind the intensive measures under the scheme which apply in County Clare, County Sligo and in the Bansha area in County Tipperary.  It is intended to extend these measures ultimately to the whole country.  Our resources are already very heavily committed in the present areas of intensive eradication and it would not be possible at this stage to add to these areas.</P>
      <P>I presume also that in the second part of the question, the Deputy is referring to what has become known as the &ldquo;the double byre grant&rdquo;.  Under my Department's farm building scheme the primary grants are:&mdash; in the case of a new cow byre, £6 per cow for which accommodation is provided, subject to a maximum grant of £90 where accommodation is provided for 15 cows, or more, and for the improvement or repair of existing cow byres, 50 per cent. of the approved estimated cost of the labour required, subject to a maximum grant equal to three-fifths of the grant for a new byre.  Grants at double these rates are now available to participants in the bovine T.B. eradication scheme in all areas throughout the country who also fulfil the requirements of the farm buildings scheme.</P>

These schemes include the supply at reduced rates of bulls, rams, day-old chicks, seed oats, seed potatoes, barley seed, fruit and forest trees as well as practical demonstrations in the use of artificial fertilisers and in the cultivation of a wide variety of crops.  Should there prove to be a demand for an intensification of these schemes in the North Kerry Gaeltacht I shall be only too happy to do all I can to meet it, as I did before in the case of the Dunquin Gaeltacht.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton (for the Minister for Social Welfare) Mr. Norton (for the Minister for Social Welfare)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton (for the Minister for Social Welfare)</NameTxt>
      <P>Following the termination of Employment Period Orders, there are increases in the live register for some few weeks from the end of October in each year.  This year the increase for the two weeks ended the 5th November was 8,638 as compared with 9,605 for the corresponding two weeks in 1954.  For the four weeks ended the 19th November this year the increase was 12,003 as compared with 10,081 for the corresponding four weeks in 1954. The increases have occurred at some 50 local offices serving rural areas, and appear to be due to the earlier completion this year of agricultural and Bord na Móna work in the good weather conditions.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will note, however, that for the four weeks mentioned the register was from 10,695 to 7,033 lower than last year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>It varies.  The information I have given the Deputy is that for the two weeks ended 5th November the increase was 8,638 people as compared with 9,605 for the corresponding two weeks of 1954.  These are circumstances over which the Department has no control; it depends on the number <Col N="1568" /> of people who renew their registration promptly.  There may be cases where people come back promptly and some delay in coming back maybe for good reasons and some come back quicker than others.  The overriding fact&mdash;in which the Deputy will find consolation &mdash;is that the register is from 10,000 to 7,000 lower than last year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fanning</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will have the wages of workers employed on the Nenagh drainage scheme raised to the level of those of county council workers in North Tipperary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>The wages of labourers employed on the Nenagh and other arterial drainage schemes have recently been increased but, as I have indicated in reply to previous similar questions, these rates are not directly related to the wages of county council workers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he has sanctioned a general increase in the rates of pay of gangers, drivers, charge-hands and men employed by the Office of Public Works; further, what was the outcome of the meeting held last March between the men's representatives and officials of the office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the question relates to men employed on arterial drainage schemes.  Increases in pay have recently been granted to foremen, charge-hands and labourers employed on these schemes.  The rates payable to gangers, drivers and others are at present under consideration and a decision will, I hope, be reached shortly.</P>
      <P>Following the meeting referred to, which was with representatives of gangers, an increased annual leave allowance was conceded to that grade. The outstanding claims raise issues of a general nature and are still under examination.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government whether he has yet received any communication on behalf of the Dublin Corporation from the clerk of the council or the city manager in regard to the resolution, adopted by the corporation, requesting that increases in wages, bonuses and overtime payments should not be taken into consideration when assessing the means of tenants with differentially rented housing accommodation; and if, in order to alleviate the hardships caused to the tenants in question, he will sanction the proposals.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government whether, in view of the hardship created in many instances by the operation of the differential rent scheme, he will ask the Dáil to set up a committee of the House to consider and report on possible ameliorations in the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of a differential renting system is to regulate rents according to the family circumstances of the individual tenants.  I am not aware, therefore, of the meaning of the Deputy's reference to hardship created by the operation of the system.  It is primarily a matter for each housing authority to prepare and submit proposals for renting schemes to be applied to its houses.  The function of the Minister for Local Government is confined to consideration of the proposals of the housing authority.  In these circumstances, the <Col N="1584" /> establishment of a committee of the House for the purpose suggested by the Deputy would not be appropriate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickWPalmer" hpid="Mr. Palmer Mr. Palmer">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>An appeal was submitted to me under the Housing (Amendment) Act, 1948, by the owner of the premises known as the Caragh Lake Hotel against the decision of the Kerry housing authority refusing him permission to demolish the premises. The manager stated that he had refused permission &ldquo;in view of the importance of the tourist trade&rdquo;.  The Act provides that a person shall not demolish in whole or in part or use otherwise than as a dwelling-house any habitable house unless he has the permission of the housing authority or of the Minister given on appeal.  In deciding the appeal I had regard to the recent history of the premises as an hotel, the unsuccessful efforts of the owner to dispose of it in the open market for the purposes of an hotel and the impracticability of the future use of the premises for dwelling purposes within the meaning of the Housing Acts.  In all the circumstances I decided that I would not have been justified in using the provisions of a Housing Act to uphold the reason given by the manager for refusing to permit the demolition of the premises.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he will make a special grant available for the improvement of the Taylorstown road leading to Clonown, in view of the urgent need for ensuring that this work is carried out as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The procedure adopted regarding the financing of county road improvement is to make a bulk allocation or allocations to each county council each year and to leave it to them to select, subject to certain principles of selection, the county roads to be improved under such allocation and out of such moneys as they provide themselves, by way of loan or otherwise.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to depart from this procedure so as to make special grants available for particular roads.  If there is a special case for improving any individual road, it is for the council to consider whether they should deal with it under their bulk allocations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the people in the Clonown <Col N="1591" /> area suffered grievous hardship last winter due to the flooding which took place?  Is the Minister further aware that the normal route into Clonown is flooded in winter time and this is the only alternative route?  In view of the fact that practically all Government Ministers, except the Minister for Local Government, visited that area last winter and promised that special consideration would be given and special grants made to ameliorate conditions in the locality, will the Minister now reconsider his decision with regard to Clonown, and, in view of that specific promise made by other Government Ministers, not put the responsibility on the county council to do work and pay for something that has already been promised by the Government?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that when he gave that extra allocation in recent weeks a similar extra allocation was made to every local authority?  Is it fair then to suggest that Roscommon should divert from other roads, funds for the improvement of this road, when specific promises were made that special treatment would be given to the people in the Clonown area?</P>

      <P>In accordance with the provisions of Section 44 of the Health Act, 1947, allowances under the Infectious Diseases (Maintenance) Regulations, 1952, are payable to persons suffering from certain infectious diseases, including tuberculosis, who are undergoing treatment therefor to the satisfaction of the chief medical officer and who are thereby prevented from making reasonable and proper provision for their own maintenance or the maintenance of their dependents. The purpose of the scheme of allowances is to enable people who contract such diseases to seek treatment at the earliest possible date instead of continuing in employment, in order to support themselves and their dependents, until the disease had gained such a hold that its cure was impossible or unnecessarily difficult.</P>
      <P>This scheme of allowances is administered by local health authorities who, in deciding applications for allowances, must have regard to the purpose underlying the relevant legislation and to the particular circumstances of each case.

      <P>Members of the medical, dental and veterinary professions are authorised, under the Dangerous Drugs Act, 1934, and regulations made thereunder, to be in possession of dangerous drugs.  As it is not an offence against the provisions of the Act or regulations for such persons to leave drugs unprotected in cars, action cannot be taken against them.  It is, of course, particularly desirable, in the public interest, that medical practitioners and other authorised persons should take all necessary precautions to ensure that the drugs do not fall into the possession of unauthorised persons and it is an obvious and elementary precaution in this connection not to leave them in unlocked cars.</P>
      <P>In view of the fact that persons entitled to be in possession of such drugs must carry them with them in the course of their professional duties, the question of taking effective action to ensure against their becoming accessible to unauthorised persons presents considerable practicable difficulties.

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if, in view of the number of years <Col N="1602" /> that have elapsed since Ireland applied for membership of the U.N.O., he will make a statement to the Dáil setting forth the obligations which membership entails and the commitments it involves and if before membership is definitely accepted.  The will give the Dáil an opportunity of discussing the statement and considering the obligations and commitments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Deputy de Valera's question, I am pleased to be able to announce to the House that this morning the Government received official notification from the Secretary-General of U.N.O. that Ireland has been admitted to membership of the organisation.</P>
      <P>It is necessary to emphasise that Ireland made formal application for such membership following the motion moved in Dáil Eireann by the then Taoiseach on the 24th July, 1946, and unanimously agreed to by the Dáil on the 25th July, 1946; that successive Governments have made it clear, in statements from time to time, that the application continued to stand; and that that application has now been accepted.  Ireland is, therefore, already a member of U.N.O. and, this being the case, the concluding part of the question does not arise.</P>
      <P>If, at this stage, we no longer desired membership, what would be involved would not be acceptance or nonacceptance, but withdrawal from the position of membership into which we have already entered.</P>
      <P>The obligations which membership entails and the commitments it involves were fully set out in the Dáil by the then Taoiseach on the 24th July, 1946.  The only difference between the position as then set out and the present position is that the experience of the Korean war has demonstrated that the undertakings envisaged in Article 43 of the Charter of the organisation&mdash;regarding the making available of armed forces, etc., &mdash;are not mandatory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely there is the question of legislation involved?  We <Col N="1603" /> have been kept for nine years on the door-step and I think we ought to have some opportunity of considering the matter.  Is legislation not necessary? Is ratification of some kind not necessary?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as I know, speaking at the moment, ratification is not necessary nor is there any legislation required.  The Leader of the Opposition, when Taoiseach, went fully into the entire matter and gave an outline of the obligations.  He referred in particular to Article 43 dealing with military commitments. At that time it was thought that the obligation implied in Article 43 would be mandatory.  Experience has demonstrated that it is not mandatory but so far as any action by this country is concerned all the necessary action had been taken when the Government, led by Deputy de Valera, as Taoiseach, made the formal application.  It is right that perhaps I should refer to a number of statements that were made from time to time.  I only indicated them very generally in reply to the question.</P>
      <P>In reply to a parliamentary question on the 22nd January, 1947, the then Taoiseach stated: &ldquo;It is natural in view of what has happened that the question of withdrawing our application should be raised but at the present at any rate I do not propose to interfere with the course of events.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Again, in reply to a question on the 22nd April, 1947, the then Taoiseach stated: &ldquo;That the position was still as stated in his reply of the 22nd January, 1947.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In reply to a question on the 8th October, 1947, in which it was specifically asked why it was not proposed to withdraw the application, the then Taoiseach gave no indication that there was any such intention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In answer to a question on the 21st June, 1949, the then Minister for External Affairs, Mr. MacBride, stated: &ldquo;With the unanimous approval of the Dáil the Government applied for the admission of Ireland to the U.N.O. <Col N="1604" /> The U.N.O. has not yet disposed of the application.  The Government is not called upon to take any further action in the matter.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In reply to a supplementary question on the same occasion, the Minister stated: &ldquo;It is not a question of repeating the application.  The application was put forward in 1946 and is still there.  No steps have been taken by the Government to repeat the application.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On the 21st November, 1951, the then Minister for External Affairs, Mr. Aiken, in reply to a question stated: &ldquo;There is no question of reapplying for membership of the U.N.O. The position is that the application made in 1946 remains blocked by an objection in the Security Council.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In replying to a question on the 10th December, 1952, Mr. Derrig, on behalf of the Minister for External Affairs, stated: &ldquo;Ireland's application for admission to the U.N.O. still stands although it remains blocked by an objection in the Security Council.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On the 2nd March, 1955, the Minister for External Affairs stated: &ldquo;Ireland's application for membership of the U.N.O. still stands although it remains blocked by an objection in the Security Council.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In the course of the speech on the Estimates of the Department of External Affairs this year, the Minister for External Affairs specifically stated that the application for membership of the U.N.O. still stood.  Deputy Lemass at the meeting of the inter-Parliamentary Union in Helsinki in August last referred to this matter also and said that in view of the easing of the tension and the bettering of international relations he thought Ireland's application should be accepted, or words to that effect.</P>
    <P>The position, therefore, is that with the unanimous approval of the Dáil given in July, 1946, the then Government were authorised to make the necessary application and to take the required steps to apply for membership. Successive Governments&mdash;and I think there have been three of them since&mdash;have allowed that application to stand with the apparent and, I think, the real approval of successive Parliaments <Col N="1605" /> here.  Accordingly, with that position before them, the United Nations have unanimously admitted Ireland as a member.  We have to do nothing further in the matter.  If we were to take any positive action it would mean withdrawal.  The obligations, as I said, were stated in fair detail, and with considerable emphasis on the important parts, by Deputy de Valera when he was Taoiseach in 1946.</P>
    <P>All Parties in the House were represented in the debate that took place and everybody agreed to the making of the application, with full knowledge of the obligations which were being undertaken in our becoming a member. It would be contrary to our national dignity to do anything now except to accept the obligations of which the Dáil approved in 1946 and of which successive Dála have approved since that time.  The only difference is that the obligations are less onerous than appeared even at that time because it was thought in 1946 that acceptance of the obligation of Article 43 might involve us in military commitments. The obligations are lessened to the extent that any commitments of that nature are entirely within our own control.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite aware of all the details to which the Taoiseach has referred but nine years have passed since there was a discussion in the Dáil on the nature of the obligations and commitments.  We have a new Dáil that has not had an opportunity of considering these things and I do not think the public know fully what are the obligations involved.  It is true that nine years ago I went into some detail in regard to the nature of these obligations and tried to point out particularly that we could not have it both ways, that this organisation was being set up for what I might call collective security and the maintenance of peace and those entering the organisation had to undertake certain obligations.  I stated that they were of a very serious nature and that before committing ourselves we should consider them.  The Dáil at that time did approve but I think that there was a question at that time of ratification; <Col N="1606" /> certainly the original States only put their signatures to or initialled the charter.  In the cases of the original States, therefore, the charter was subject to ratification.  We did not have here any opportunity of dealing with it in that particular way and I am wondering whether, in view of the obligations and commitments involved &mdash;there would be financial and other commitments no doubt&mdash;there should not be a formal motion of ratification.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there could be any question of a necessity for ratification.  Undoubtedly there would be financial obligations and the Dáil would have to give its approval, and I would say that when we have considered what financial obligations are imposed upon us, and so on, we will be then in a position in the Dáil to discuss fully the entire matter, the financial commitments and any other obligations that may be imposed upon us as a nation because we have become a member of the U.N.O.  I do suggest that it would be utterly wrong that when the Dáil, in 1946, gave unanimous approval, after full discussion, to the then Taoiseach to take the necessary steps and when the three Dála since that time have approved of our application remaining there before the U.N.O. and when we have been admitted&mdash;after a long period of time, perhaps&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>When we have been admitted, without anybody here in the House saying that we ought to have withdrawn our application, it would be, as I said before, quite contrary to our national dignity now to withdraw it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nobody in this House in any way suggested that we should withdraw our application, even though we had been put on the long finger for so long and had been put in the position of having been made a pawn in the hands of the larger nations, but, certainly, in recent months, Deputy McQuillan, I think it was&mdash;I am speaking from recollection; he can correct me if I am wrong&mdash;intervened <Col N="1607" /> in some debate and asked when we were going to insist or what the Government was doing to try to make this country a member of the U.N.O. so that our problem of Partition could be ventilated to the world, and nobody objected to that and nobody suggested that we should withdraw our application.</P>
    <P>It is, I think, right and proper that we should now, apart altogether from the question of Partition, as a small nation with a very considerable degree of influence in the world because of our connections, our exiles throughout the world, take our place in the comity of nations and do our part to secure what small nations have always required, the maintenance of peace.  It would be utterly wrong to give in the least degree any notion that we are going to weaken in our resolution to do our duty in international affairs so far as we can as a small nation.</P>

At least one of the things we ought to take advantage of, if the others did not let us in, is to take advantage to look before and after, seeing that we have had nine years waiting.  I simply wanted to know whether the opportunity would be given to members of the Dáil, who have had no opportunity so far&mdash;quite a number of them&mdash;of considering this matter.  I would also like the Taoiseach to look at the Article of the Constitution which provides for ratification in cases of this sort.</P>

      <P>As a result of a Supreme Court judgment of 1933 the Moore family who had up till then enjoyed the exclusive right of fishing in the estuary of the River Erne were ousted from ownership and the fishery became a public fishery.  The fishery had been purchased in good faith by the Moores' predecessors in 1869 under a Landed Estates Court Conveyance and the fishery had been worked as a several fishery without interference until the incidents which led to the Supreme Court case occurred.  The Supreme Court decision settled finally, of course, the legal position but the aspect of equity remained and the Government at the time decided that in the circumstances of the case it would be only fair to compensate the owners for the loss of the property to which they thought they had a perfectly good title.  It was not, however, considered feasible at the time to assess a definite value for the fishery pending some experience of the payment of compensation claims which would arise under the implementation <Col N="1610" /> of certain sections of the Fisheries Act, 1939, which dealt with the abolition of freshwater netting and the acquisition of transferable fisheries.  As the dispossessed fishery owners had suffered grievous financial loss it was decided to ameliorate their position by making payments on account of the compensation which it had been decided to allow them.  Accordingly, Supplementary Estimates were passed by the Dáil on three occasions making provision for and approving of such payments, viz., 24th May, 1939, £25,000; 9th July, 1941, £6,000 and 12th June, 1946, £6,000. To the latter payment was added the sum of £1,500 as a contribution towards the cost sustained by claimants in the Supreme Court appeal.</P>
      <P>Part V of the Fisheries Act, 1939, has not yet been brought into operation but the settlement of compensation claims in respect of the abolition of freshwater netting has been almost completed and much experience gained in the assessment of compensation for the abolition of fishing rights.  When this case was reopened some time ago it was considered that it could be brought to finality.  Negotiations with the representatives of the quondam fishery owners were started and it was agreed with them that the capital value of the tidal fishery in 1933 was some £44,000.  While interest is not normally paid on ex gratia compensation it is felt that owing to the long period of time which has elapsed since the fishery was lost to the Moores allowance in respect of interest would be conceded in this particular case.  As already indicated, £37,000 has been paid by way of payments on account. The balance of capital moneys to be paid now is, accordingly, £7,000.  It is proposed to allow interest at the rate of 3 per cent. calculated having regard to the dates of payments of the sums already advanced and covering a period ending in a month or so when it is expected the payment can be made. The total sum now proposed to be paid to close the case is £20,500 and this amount covers all allowance in respect of interest, loss of profits and all other expenses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The payment of £20,500 will bring the total amount paid to the one-time <Col N="1611" /> owners for the loss of their fishery in the estuary of the River Erne to £57,500 plus the separate payment of £1,500 made as a contribution towards the costs of the Supreme Court appeal.  This amount is considered a very fair and reasonable one in final settlement of the case.</P>

      <P>This matter was brought to my notice in a very preliminary way only.  I did not have available to me anything like what the Parliamentary Secretary had available in the way of figures and amounts but it was clear to the people who approached the Fishery Branch at the time that the case, which was fully prepared and submitted, would be considered as sympathetically as circumstances warranted.  I take it that in any event the decision is in line generally with the consequences flowing from the litigation which has changed these fisheries from private to public ownership.  I do not think there is any further comment I wish to make on it.</P>

      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1956, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, including certain Services administered by that Office, and for payment of certain Subsidies and sundry Grants-in-Aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision in the current year's Estimates for grants to An Foras Tionscal, the body charged with the administration of the Undeveloped Areas Act, 1952, is £1,00,000.  An Foras Tionscal has now indicated that an additional sum of £35,000 will be required to meet grant payments in respect of approved projects.  It will be possible to meet this additional expenditure from savings on other subheads of the Vote for Industry and <Col N="1612" /> Commerce and accordingly, the Supplementary Estimate now before the House is for a token sum of £10.</P>
    <P>When the Vote for Industry and Commerce was introduced earlier this year there was some criticism of the fact that the provision for grants to An Foras Tionscal showed a reduction from the provision of £125,000 which appeared in the Estimates for the previous year.  However, as I pointed out then, there is of necessity a considerable time lag between the approval of projects and the payment of grants by An Foras Tionscal as that organisation very wisely insists that applicants must spend a reasonable amount of their own money on factory premises and plant before the grant is paid.  The actual payments made in any financial year do not reflect the volume of industrial projects approved in that year as it may take up to two or three years from the time when a project is approved in principle by An Foras Tionscal for the promoters to develop it to the stage where grants become payable.  Owing to the time lag An Foras Tionscal experiences considerable difficulty in estimating its requirements on an annual basis, as instanced by the fact that while last year's Estimates provided for an expenditure of £125,000, grants paid amounted to only £68,000.  The excess of £35,000 over the £100,000 provided in this year's Estimates arises from the fact that more rapid progress was made by the promoters on a number of projects than was anticipated due, among other things, to more favourable conditions for building.</P>
    <P>A more reliable guide to the progress being made in the development of industry in the undeveloped areas is the volume of projects approved by An Foras Tionscal and an examination of the figures for the period since the establishment of An Foras Tionscal in January, 1952, reveals an encouraging trend.  In the period of 15 months from January, 1952 to 31st March, 1953, grants amounting to £104,855 were approved; in the following financial year grants approved amounted to £159,000; for the year ended 31st March, 1955 the figure was £232,800; <Col N="1613" /> and in the current year to date An Foras Tionscal has indicated its willingness to make grants amounting to £542,293.  The total amount of grants approved by An Foras Tionscal since its establishment in January, 1952, is £1,038,948 which is slightly more than half the sum of £2,000,000 which, under the Undeveloped Areas Act, 1952, may be expended on this service in the period of seven years from 1st January, 1952.</P>
    <P>A number of the projects may not come to fruition for two or three years and some unforeseen circumstances might prevent some promoters from putting their plans into effect but nevertheless I feel that the figures I have quoted afford grounds for hoping that the problem of siting industries in the undeveloped areas, which had previously proved intractable, is now on its way to solution.</P>
    <P>The projects approved by An Foras Tionscal represent a total capital investment of the order of £3,000,000 and but for the inducements offered to industrialists under the Undeveloped Areas Act, very little of this investment would have been located in the undeveloped areas.  There are at present 22 units operating in the undeveloped areas, which were assisted by An Foras Tionscal.  They cover a wide field of activity and include woollen yarn, cotton condenser yarn, doubled cotton yarn, berets, woven labels, ladies' garments, narrow width textile fabrics, ceramic tiles, electrical accessories and other plastic manufactures, clay drain pipes, tipping gears for lorries, tyre retreading and locks.</P>
    <P>Apart from the benefits which these undertakings confer on the areas where they are located, they are contributing to the economic well-being of the country and in at least one case a useful export trade has been developed.  A number of other projects are in various stages of development throughout the undeveloped areas, but it would not be proper for me to give details regarding them at this stage as this would involve the disclosure of the intentions of private concerns.  I might mention, however, that in a number of <Col N="1614" /> these projects there is reason to believe that there are good prospects for the development of an export trade.</P>
    <P>I understand from An Foras Tionscal that there is a steady flow of inquiries regarding the facilities available under the Undeveloped Areas Act and, while it would be premature at this stage to assess the results of the efforts which are being made to attract outside industrialists to this country, it is a reasonable assumption that the undeveloped areas will share in the results.  In the circumstances it would not be unreasonable to hope that the recent increase in the volume of projects approved by An Foras Tionscal will be maintained.</P>

      <P>As far as we are concerned we are glad to note that the policy enshrined in the Undeveloped Areas Act of 1952 is working out, as it was hoped it would at that time.  When the Undeveloped Areas Act was before the House, there were some Deputies who had doubts as to whether its provisions would result in the flow of industrial activity to the western seaboard counties.  It is through that Act that the flow began in a weak and undecided way in the months immediately after the legislation became effective.  I expressed the opinion then that it would take some years before the effect of the Act would be felt and the figures given by the Minister to-day show that the effect is now being attained.  Naturally, we who had the responsibility for submitting that legislation to the Dáil and of advocating that policy here and throughout the country are gratified by the outcome. There are, as the Minister said, some 20-odd industrial units operating in the western seaboard counties which would be located elsewhere, were it not for the assistance given by An Foras Tionscal.  There are many more to come and I am quite sure if the <Col N="1615" /> policy of the Act is maintained and applied vigorously and intelligently by An Foras Tionscal that the unbalance which has marked industrial development of this country in the past will be negatived.  The Minister need have no hesitation at any time in coming to as with proposals of this kind so long as they are aimed at the fulfilment of the policy of the Undeveloped Areas Act.</P>

Is the Minister going to give any help in these centres such as there are in the South of Ireland where people are putting up sums of £50,000 for industries and are anxious to get any chance to start an industry?  It seems that everybody can go to the undeveloped areas and get all the money from the Government.  Are local people who are prepared to put up capital in the South of Ireland going to get the same privilege and facilities?  It seems to be all going to the West.  In my own town where local capital has been subscribed up to the extent of £50,000 we are waiting for an industry to give employment.  I would like some assurance from the Minister on that point, because the people interested in starting factories are awaiting an answer from the Minister.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>To deal with Deputy O'Leary's point first, I think it should be mentioned that the Undeveloped Areas Act was passed with, I think, the general approval of this House and there was then widespread recognition that it was only by offering these undeveloped areas special facilities as indicated in the Act that it would be possible to attract industries to these areas.  If one reflects on the backward economic condition of the undeveloped areas down through the generations it will be seen that they have been starved of industries and it was with a view to encouraging industrialists to go there and establish industries to stop emigration from the areas and raise the standard of living of the areas that the Undeveloped Areas Act was passed with the general benediction of all Parties in the House.</P>
      <P>It is true to say, of course, that if these special facilities were not available in the undeveloped areas, virtually no industries would go there because the natural tendency would be for industries to settle in the eastern and southern portions of the country and it is only through the instrumentality of the Undeveloped Areas Act that this tendency to get industries established in the West has been brought to the present degree of fruition.  I think it is a good development. There is no use in talking about western areas and no use in sympathising with the endemic poverty there; there is no use in regretting the backwardness of these areas unless we are prepared to make some contribution towards the establishment of industries in these regions.  It is for that reason that I think it was desirable that an Act of this kind should at least get the opportunity of letting us see what it could do.  When one remembers that at least 50 per cent. of the industrial workers are employed in the Dublin area and that more than 50 per cent. of industrial production comes from the Dublin area, one gets some idea of how lopsided is the location of our industrial effort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was frankly recognised in the Dáil <Col N="1617" /> at that time that this was a special type of legislation designed to help these backward areas and, therefore, the giving of grants to industries which locate themselves in these areas is in accordance with the desire of this House and the decision of all Parties in the House.  It is not a case, therefore, where a Minister is exercising any particular discretion in favour of one area as against another.  The House definitely said that there was to be a bias in the granting of facilities to western areas and to areas which constitute the undeveloped areas generally.  I am simply implementing the wish of the House in that respect. If there are towns in the rest of the country that desire to establish industries, facilities are available to them too.  The towns concerned can supplement whatever local capital is raised with trade loan guarantees under which the State comes to the assistance of new industries by making money available to them under conditions which enable them to get that money at lower rates of interest than they would otherwise get it.  Of course the State finance house, the Industrial Credit Corporation, is also available to invest in the establishment of industries which, in the opinion of the company, are soundly based and offer prospects of development.</P>
    <P>So far as the question raised by Deputy Lynch is concerned, I have no detailed particulars as to what the practice is in respect of any of these new firms in the training of operatives, but looking at the list of new industries which have been established as a result of assistance given by An Foras Tionscal, I know personally many of them have sent operatives abroad either to England or elsewhere to acquire the necessary technical skill, and I think it would be generally recognised by all of them that where that skill can be more expeditiously acquired abroad or where a visit abroad for training would help in perfecting a skill already acquired, these firms have been encouraged by An Foras Tionscal and by the Department of Industry and Commerce to permit their operatives to train elsewhere so as to acquire the maximum degree of <Col N="1618" /> technical equipment in the personal sense.</P>
    <P>So far as the operation of the Act is concerned, I am glad it was necessary to come back to the Dáil for a Supplementary Estimate and I hope that we will continue to indent heavily on the moneys made available by the Oireachtas to encourage the development of industries in these undeveloped areas.  I am glad the Supplementary Estimate has been received as it has been received.  I think on this question of aiding the establishment of industries in undeveloped areas there should be no two views on the matter. We should have a national policy which will not change with Governments, namely, that it is desirable to readjust the present lopsided industrial distribution in this country and to spread industries out as far as possible throughout the country and particularly in areas which have long been starved of industrial development.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I only want to make a short observation on the purpose of the Bill which I think everybody endorses and that is that in so far as it is possible to make land available for planting more readily everybody is in full agreement with it.  During the course of the debate arguments were advanced in favour of establishing a separate board to do the work of the Forestry Division of the Department and I myself, outside the House, expressed the opinion that perhaps such a board could function more effectively and more expeditiously than the Department of Lands which has other matters under its jurisdiction such as land division and even running a factory for the manufacture of soft goods and toys in Gaeltacht areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1619" /> Outside the House I did say that it was doubtful, and this is the purpose of my intervening here to-day, whether an independent board employing an acquisition staff who were no longer civil servants would be able to get land more readily.  I was reported in the Press as saying that if the acquisition staff no longer wore the Civil Service label they would be able to get land more readily.  I think that would have been a rather unsustainable assertion.  I believe that a board could possibly function more expeditiously and effectively but I doubt whether any acquisition staff, irrespective of their label or title, could get land more rapidly than the present acquisition staff.  Let us hope that under the aegis of the Bill land will become available in greater measure and more rapidly in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I read the report to which the Deputy has referred and which he has now corrected.  I am sure he has corrected what was obviously a misreport of his speech in Cork some time ago.  As a matter of fact I gave some attention to the question of a board and I came to the conclusion that a board would not do the work as successfully as it is being done at the present time.  I would be the first to approach the Government for approval for the establishment of such a board if that was the best way of getting ahead with forestry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present staff in the Forestry Division are doing a magnificent job of work and I think I should take this occasion to say that they are doing a job, the magnitude, labour and complexity of which, are not fully appreciated. A short time ago I gave a description of the amount of land that is being planted this year, 15,000 acres. If we reduce that to square miles it represents roughly 23½ square miles. Looking at it from another point of view, it means that this year the forestry inspectors, the foresters and the labourers employed&mdash;5,000 of them &mdash;are planting a strip of country a quarter of a mile wide and 96 miles long; that would extend from Dublin City right down across the Shannon to <Col N="1620" /> Loughrea in Galway.  That is an immense undertaking and I do not think the work they are doing is fully appreciated.</P>
    <P>I have examined the question of a board.  Perhaps in 20 or 25 years' time it may be possible to have a board then to cope with the sales of timber, which will run into £1,000,000 or possibly more, annually.  It may be possible then to put that into the hands of a board.  At the moment a board would not be feasible.  If we had such a board now we would be handing over to that board the acquisition of land on a huge scale.  Now land is a burning question in this country and any Government which would delegate that particular part of its functions to a board would not last 24 hours in office.  Bord na Móna has been put forward as an example.  Bord na Móna merely acquires bog.  In most cases the bog is not a source of profit to those who own it; it is more of a liability because it is a deathtrap for live stock.</P>
    <P>The land we want for forestry is land which has a certain agricultural value, even though it may be a low one, and we would be encroaching on the livelihood of at least 800 farmers per annum in order to get our annual requirements of land for afforestation. That would be such a serious position that any Government which would delegate authority in that matter would scarcely be worthy of the name of Government.  There would be no control.</P>
    <P>I, as Minister, have to come in here now and answer questions dealing with the Land Commission.  Sometimes Deputies abuse me or, through me, the Land Commission, because a certain farm is taken over; others abuse me because a farm is not taken over.  My attitude is well known; this is a judicial function handed over to the Land Commission and the Land Commission does not acquire land for its own benefit or the benefit of the State; it acquires land to give it to those people who have not sufficient at the present time to make a living.</P>
    <P>Were we to adopt the suggestion of a board we would be handing over to that board sweeping compulsory <Col N="1621" /> powers of acquisition.  That board would not be responsible to the House. It would merely ask the House for a sum of money each year and the responsible Minister would be obliged to come in here to get that money and merely give an account of what was happening; he would have no control because in order that such a board could do its work, he would have to relinquish all control.</P>
    <P>The forestry machine&mdash;that is, the acquisition of land, the planting of the nursery, the raising of something like 40,000,000 transplants every year to the third year of growth, ready for planting out, the fencing, the preparation and the ploughing of the ground&mdash;is an enormous machine and the work of the Forestry Division in that regard is not fully appreciated.  Perhaps some of the fault for that lies with the Minister in that he does not publicise the work properly.  Perhaps the fault lies elsewhere. Anyone who visits our forests will see that the Forestry Division has done and is doing a magnificent job. I fully appreciate that.  I am sure other Ministers who went before me, such as Deputy Derrig, appreciate the work that is done.  It is only in five or ten years hence, when the full benefit of what is being done now becomes apparent, that the work of the Forestry Division will be fully appreciated. They are doing a magnificent job and this Government will never hand over the acquisition of land to anybody but a responsible Minister; if he outsteps his duty then and his enthusiasm and if, in his enthusiasm, he interferes with the rights of the farmers, by taking over their land, he can be called to account here.  That is the proper way to do it, and any suggestion that better work would be done by any body other than the present Forestry Division has no foundation in fact.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>When the debate adjourned, last night, I was dealing with some matters which seemed to me <Col N="1622" /> to be of more than ordinary importance in relation to this Bill.  I was asking whether it was not necessary to include in the interpretation section a more precise definition as to what was meant by certain expressions which appear in the Bill.  I wish to refer to that matter for a moment now before I go on to deal with other points, which, I think, are worthy of the attention of the House.</P>
      <P>One of the questions which I raised is: What is the definition of an affiliated coursing club?  What conditions must a coursing club fulfil in order to be entitled to affiliation?  I think that is very important because any person who reads the report of the advisory committee must certainly be unfavourably impressed by the stratagems to which the standing committee of the Irish Coursing Club resorted in order to retain control of the affairs of that body.  As these gentlemen are, apparently, under the Bill, going to be entrenched by law in the control of the greyhound industry it is surely of particular importance that we should ensure that they will not be able to adopt similar methods in the future to those which have enabled them to retain a grip on this industry during the past few years.</P>
      <P>I have read the Bill carefully and it seems to me that the question of the right to affiliation is a matter which is going to be determined arbitrarily by the board.  That is important, too, from another point of view.  The membership of the club will comprise one representative member appointed by each affiliated coursing club entitled to hold coursing meetings authorised by the Irish Coursing Club.  What is the basis of entitlement?  The representative member must be appointed by a club which is entitled to hold coursing meetings.  It seems to me that there should be some provision in this Bill stating what the basis of entitlement is.  It is not set out in Section 36 nor, so far as I can recollect, anywhere in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter which I think is of importance is, even assuming that conditions are laid down which will ensure that all clubs properly entitled to be affiliated are affiliated and will <Col N="1623" /> receive a permit to hold coursing meetings, what assurance have we that the members representing the coursing clubs will have any real power to influence the policy of the executive committee and the policy of the board? I refer to that matter because I was refreshing myself by reading the report of the advisory committee which the Minister himself appointed, and I have been astounded by some of the strictures which were passed on the gentlemen who have been in control of this industry for so long.</P>
    <P>Surely, having regard to the manner in which the meetings of the standing committee were conducted in the past and the manner in which the rules relating to the summoning of meetings have been wilfully ignored, it would seem in relation to the meetings of the executive committee, that there should be something in the Bill fixing a quorum in the absence of which meetings cannot be legally conducted.  I have read through, as carefully as I could, Article 4 which deals with the composition of the executive committee of the club and I can see no reference in it to the fixing of a minimum attendance at a meeting as the quorum required to make a legally constituted meeting.</P>
    <P>In view of the references in the report of the advisory committee as to the manner in which the meetings of the standing committee of the Irish Coursing Club were conducted in former years, it would seem of the utmost importance that we should have something in the Bill that would ensure that the same sort of hole and corner methods should not be continued in future in order to retain control of this industry.  It is the control of the industry which is here involved.</P>
    <P>When the debate adjourned, I was in course of referring to many references which had been made to the position of the licensed bookmakers and the apprehensions with which they are filled as to the future developments, unfavourably affecting their position, which are likely to take place.  These gentlemen do not speak without considerable experience.  There were in 1931 or 1932, efforts made here <Col N="1624" /> to set up totalisators as monopolies attaching to certain greyhound racing tracks.  In anticipation that the licences to do so, which had been previously granted would become effective, certain of the greyhound racing tracks at that time initiated very drastic measures to prevent bookmakers from carrying on their legitimate business inside their premises.</P>
    <P>The fears which the bookmakers entertain as to the future position under the control of a board constituted as proposed under this Bill are therefore not entirely groundless.  I am sure the Minister would not wish, any more than I would wish, that people who have been carrying on a legitimate business over a great number of years should be detrimentally affected in any undue way by reason of the Minister's attempts to reform the controlling body in charge of greyhound racing and greyhound coursing.  The bookmakers, as we all know, are unpaid collectors of revenue, zealous collectors of revenue.  They have to be, because if they do not they are subject to very severe penalties which may even involve them in imprisonment. The great majority of the bookmakers, in fact 99.99 per cent. of them, do their duty by the revenue.  They have become very profitable licensees of the Minister for Finance.  I think it would be true to say that they collect something approaching £2,000,000 per annum on his behalf.</P>
    <P>I think they are entitled to be sympathetically considered by the Minister and that to allay their fears he will prescribe in the Bill some safeguards which will ensure that their right to earn their livelihood and carry on their occupation will not be unduly and unnecessarily interfered with.</P>
    <P>Deputy Finlay, when dealing with the proposals in the Bill, said it was proposed to establish a monopoly which would be far reaching in its effect.  I doubt, indeed, whether ever before any legislation was introduced into this House which was so comprehensive in the extent of the monopoly powers which are conferred upon a body already in existence. Let us remember what the origin of the Irish Coursing <Col N="1625" /> Club was.  It was set up, not by any Act of the Legislature, not I think by virtue of any plebiscitary authority which it might have derived from the assent of those who were interested in coursing or racing.  By its own fiat, it set itself up to control greyhound coursing and greyhound racing in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It has become a business and it is because of the extent to which the commercial interests have undermined the sporting instincts among our Irish people that we have now to bring in legislation to remedy the abuses which have sprung up because there have been so many opportunities for exploiting the powers which were assumed by a private voluntary body.  These were assumptive; I have said they were taken by the individuals themselves who were able, by reason of the fact that they controlled the tracks, to impose their will and their wishes upon the great body of greyhound owners and greyhound breeders in this country.</P>
      <P>Now we go further.  The powers they assumed had no validity in law&mdash;they could have been upset by a strike or concerted action on the part of the greyhound owners and breeders at any time&mdash;but now the powers which these gentlemen assumed, we are going to confer on them by law.  We are going to create a monopoly, and as Deputy Finlay warned us we should be very careful, when we create a monopoly of this sort, to ensure that we shall fully safeguard the public interest and, of course, the interests of all those particular individuals who will be affected by our action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill, as I said, is practically all-embracing in the extent of the monopoly which it proposes to confer. It does not merely confine itself to the better management and regulation of the sport.  It does not merely concern itself with the supervision of coursing matches or greyhound racing meetings. It goes much further.  For instance, in Section 39 it is going to control certain aspects and certain methods <Col N="1626" /> of breeding.  Under Section 37 it will control training.  Under Section 38 it will control sales and anybody who has any association with the industry knows one of the most serious complaints was on the manner in which certain salesmen attempted to monopolise the selling of dogs which were suitable for export.  Under Section 41, it is going to subsidies and co-operate in the export of greyhounds.  But it is going to go even further, under Section 41.  This section, which is going to confer extraordinary powers on the board, proposes that:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(1) The board may co-operate with and assist any person in connection with activities for the promotion and development of the export trade in greyhounds, including activities for the maintenance, training, racing, coursing and sale abroad of greyhounds which have been exported.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think they are most extraordinary powers to give to any body of individuals. The Racing Board has not got these powers.  The Racing Board, so far as I know, does not control sales except&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <P>Yes, &ldquo;in connection with activities for the promotion and development of the export trade in greyhounds, including activities for the maintenance, training, racing, coursing and sale abroad of greyhounds which have been exported.&rdquo;  That is to say, the board can say to Tom, Dick or Harry: &ldquo;Here is a Tanist or Ataxy&mdash;<Col N="1627" /> or perhaps some other well-known animal&mdash;take him and race him; we will pay all his expenses, take all the losses and you keep all the winnings.&rdquo; There is a lot of &ldquo;heads I win, tails you lose,&rdquo; in this greyhound business. There is every possibility it may continue under Section 41 in view of the manner in which this board will be constituted.</P>
      <P>This Bill has not come out of the blue.  It is introduced into this House because of certain complaints which were made in relation to the greyhound racing industry.  The Minister set up a committee to investigate these complaints.  I am glad he did; it was an excellent thing to have done.  As a result of it, we have these proposals under which the Minister proposes to put the whole greyhound industry under the control of the board which, in view of what I have said, is very properly to be styled as the Greyhound Industry Board.  That board will control sales; it will control artificial insemination; it will control training, and it will engage in export activities; it will co-operate or assist in racing; it will in fact engage in all the business in which a private individual who owned a greyhound might engage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, the key to the whole of this business is the board, its personnel, its constitution, its powers. Why, to revert to a question which I put last night but did not answer, has it become necessary to bring in this legislation?  The Minister himself answered it in his opening speech.  He said there were rather serious abuses.  Any person who reads the report will agree with me that the phrase &ldquo;rather serious abuses&rdquo; is an understatement. There were very serious, very gross abuses, disclosed in the evidence and referred to in the report of the advisory committee.  What were the results of the investigation which was conducted under the aegis of the Minister?  I think that practically all the charges which were made were found to have been proven, charges of laxity in administration, allegations that malpractices had been tolerated because people prominent in control were not above suspicion.  There were <Col N="1628" /> allegations touching the good faith and propriety of persons who virtually controlled the assets of the Irish Coursing Club and I should say that, having regard to the nature of the strictures which the report passed upon the conduct of those who were in control of the Irish Coursing Club, having regard to the allegations which the members of the advisory committee found to have substance, the report of the advisory committee itself was a very mild document.</P>
    <P>In view of the seriousness of this situation and in view of the fact that we shall have to discuss these matters at greater length on the Committee Stage, it is not inadvisable that some of the statements made by the advisory committee should be put on the records of the House to be available to members to re-read.  I assume most people have read them, that those who were members at the time the report was published have read them; but there have been changes in the composition of the Dáil since and these facts may not be in the minds of those who have since been elected to it.</P>
    <P>Let me turn to page 40.  I quote from paragraph 100, which refers to the conduct of meetings.  In relation to that the committee said this:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We have little doubt that votes were recorded at some of these meetings by persons who, if the constitution were enforced, were not entitled to be present, i.e., representatives of coursing clubs which had ceased to hold coursing meetings and &lsquo;elected members&rsquo; who had consistently absented themselves from general meetings, or who had failed to pay their subscriptions.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The comment of the advisory committee on that finding is:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The failure of the Irish Coursing Club to enforce the rules regarding attendances and the consequent participation of unqualified delegates in the business of meetings would, of course, affect the validity of decisions arrived at during those meetings.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Later, in paragraph 101, the committee states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1629" />&ldquo;Other witnesses went further, in alleging that no criticism of the system of administration, however genuine, would be tolerated.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As proof of the frame of mind, the general attitude and mentality of the people who constituted the standing committee at that time, the committee stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Correspondence placed before the committee showed that officials of the Irish Coursing Club took severe exception to the formation of the owners' association and went so far as to propose the introduction of a special article to the constitution in the following terms:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Any person bound by these rules who publishes or causes to be published in the public Press any matter which could fairly be regarded as propaganda hostile to the Irish Coursing Club shall be guilty of the offence of disloyalty to the constitution.... Any person who shall be guilty of an offence under this rule shall be liable to be warned-off or suspended.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These are the little greyhound Hitlers to whom the Minister proposes to hand over the control of the greyhound industry in this country under this Bill.</P>
    <P>In relation to the possible composition of the board, we have to remember that four of the six ordinary members, the six members other than the chairman, who is to be appointed by the Minister&mdash;four of the six ordinary members who under this Bill will be appointed must be members of the club.  There, of course, the old question arises&mdash;I raised it in my opening remarks&mdash;as to the extent to which the representatives of the affiliated coursing clubs will in fact be able to influence the conduct of what will now be styled the executive committee of the club.</P>
    <P>In relation to this matter I think it is relevant to quote what the advisory committee did find in regard to this matter.  I am quoting now from paragraph 105 of the report.  It said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It was asserted that the representatives of racing tracks exercise an influence in the standing committee <Col N="1630" /> out of all proportion to their numbers.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then, having examined this, the advisory committee's report goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The present position, however, is that of the 21 members comprising the committee, not less than 13, including <i>ex officio</i> members, are directly connected with racing tracks and have financial interests therein.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Later, in paragraph 106, the committee reports:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Some witnesses were emphatic in expressing the view that the administrative officials who are members of the standing committee exercise more than a normal influence on proceedings at meetings of the committee and on decisions reached thereat.  We are inclined to agree with this view....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Later, in paragraph 107, the committee reported:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...Many witnesses alleged that no action whatever was taken on a number of serious complaints made by them.  Others stated that grave irregularities often went unreported, because insufficient supervisory stewards were employed.  Indeed, representatives of the Irish Coursing Club stated that they were not satisfied with the performance of a number of their stewards, and asserted that the club was not in a position financially to offer the higher salaries necessary to command the services of more reliable officials, or to employ them in sufficient numbers...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The committee later examined the question of the financial resources of the Irish Coursing Club and certainly they did not find that the excuses offered to them had any substance in fact.  Indeed the committee, in this same paragraph, goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is apparent from references to the finances of the club in the succeeding section that the club, plus its subsidiary companies, is in reality a wealthy organisation and <Col N="1631" /> that it could readily have afforded the necessary outlay on the employment of sufficient supervisory staff.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Before I turn to the Schedule I want to point to a few further passages. There are so many of these passages that it is very difficult to restrict one's quotations from the report.  I should like to point to one passage referring to the <i>Greyhound and Sporting Press.</i> The passage is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The <i>Greyhound and Sporting Press,</i> Limited, appears to have been remarkably successful from the outset, and the value of its assets, including buildings and equipment, is estimated by the Irish Coursing Club to be at present at least £60,000. This estimate includes buildings which were erected in recent years at a cost of approximately £14,000, and includes also plant and equipment said to have cost £18,000.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There are references to Powerstown Park, Limited, and in this connection the report says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Powerstown Park, Limited, is a private company with a paid up capital of £10,000.  The company was formed in 1932 by the Irish Coursing Club, mainly to establish a permanent national coursing ground, and to that end, to purchase the property known as Powerstown Park Racecourse.  Previous to the formation of the company the Irish Coursing Club had held coursing meetings on this property and had paid rent therefor.  The company carries on the business of horse-racing and other activities related thereto.  The shareholders of the company, who are nominees of the Irish Coursing Club, executed in April, 1932, a deed of trust, under which they acknowledged that they held their shares in trust for the Irish Coursing Club and were prepared to act in all respects under the direction of the club, as expressed or contained in resolutions from time to time passed by the standing committee.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>How did the club direct these trustees to act in its interests?  Here is what <Col N="1632" /> the committee have to say on the subject:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;As in the case of the <i>Greyhound and Sporting Press,</i> Limited, and although Powerstown Park, Limited, appears to be a prosperous undertaking, no contribution whatever appears to have been made by it to the funds of the Irish Coursing Club. Indeed the Irish Coursing Club actually pays £100 per annum for the right to hold coursing meetings on its own lands at Powerstown Park. Profits made by Powerstown Park, Limited, have been utilised to increase the company's assets.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>But they were not employed for the purpose of developing the greyhound industry in Ireland.</P>

      <P>I am quoting from paragraph 114 of the report.  I do not wish to weary the House by reading from the report, but I do think it is one of the most revealing documents I have ever seen.  It only shows how really astute these gentlemen were, not babes in the kindergarten, as Deputy A. Barry led us to believe in his speech.  These really very astute gentlemen utilised these assets, which they held under deed of trust for the Irish Coursing Club, for their own advantage.  I do not want to say any more on that subject.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite clear the reason I am saying it is that I see among other things that there have been references here to the officials of the Irish Coursing Club.  There are references to the fact that the Irish Coursing Club had to pay to the Powerstown Park Company £100 a year for the right to hold coursing meetings on their own ground.  What do we find in paragraph 113?  We find, according to the report, that:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The senior joint secretary of the Irish Coursing Club acts as salaried manager of Powerstown Park, Limited, and in consideration of payment of an agreed annual sum, is <Col N="1633" /> entitled, while acting in this capacity, to reside in Powerstown House and to use the lands of Powerstown Demesne, comprising about 130 acres, except at such times as portion of them is required for coursing or racing.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Further back, if the Minister wants to refresh his memory, we find in paragraph 109 that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In 1924, the Irish Coursing Club decided to promote, jointly with the secretary of the club, a publication to be known as <i>The Coursing Calendar</i> which was to become the official organ of the Irish Coursing Club. By 1928, this paper was firmly established. The club then decided by resolution to take complete responsibility for the paper and for this purpose incorporated a company known as the <i>Greyhound and Sporting Press,</i> Limited, of which the share capital of £5,000 was subscribed from the funds of the Irish Coursing Club.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Later on, in paragraph 110 we are told:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;<i>The Greyhound and Sporting Press</i> Limited appears to have been remarkably successful from the outset, and the value of its assets, including buildings and equipment, is estimated by the Irish Coursing Club to be at present at least £60,000.  This estimate includes buildings which were erected in recent years at a cost of approximately £14,000 and includes who also plant and equipment said to have cost £18,000.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not want to go into all these matters at length.  The only reason why I am raising them is because of the proposal in the Bill to establish a finance committee.  In Article 8 of the Schedule we find the following provision:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There shall be a sub-committee of the executive committee (in this constitution referred to as the finance sub-committee) with responsibility for keeping under review the financial affairs of the club and its subsidiary interests (including Powerstown Park, Limited, and the <Col N="1634" /><i>Greyhound and Sporting Press</i>, Limited), and for making reports and recommendations thereon to the executive committee.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I want to know what is going to be the position of the several officers of the subsidiary companies who are referred to in this report?  What is their position going to be in relation to the finance committee of the reformed, reconstituted Irish Coursing Club?  Does not the Minister think it is rather important we should make certain in this legislation that not merely will the active executives of the subsidiary companies be debarred and disqualified from membership of the finance committee and the executive committee of the new Irish Coursing Club, but that also in the accounts presented to this House in the future there would be a clear statement as to the remuneration and emoluments which are received by the officials of the Irish Coursing Club.</P>
    <P>I shall not go any further than to say that members of the old Irish Coursing Club and the standing committee have shown themselves to be particularly astute gentlemen when they have been handling the affairs of the club and dealing with the club's assets.  They have not, perhaps, done anything which would make them amenable to the law but certainly there is a rather unsavoury appearance to the whole set-up, and, as the Minister is now going to the trouble to seek to provide legislation to give the club legal existence, I think we should take particular pains to ensure that everything will be clean and above-board.  It would be quite wrong for the Minister to give to this body a monopoly so wide as to embrace the breeding, racing, export and sale by auction of greyhounds unless he is going to make sure that the whole of the existing situation will be properly cleared up&mdash;I think I might use the word &ldquo;cleaned&rdquo; up.</P>
    <P>There is quite a number of other points which will arise on this Bill. I am not opposed to it: I welcome the attempt which the Minister is making to put the industry on a sound foundation, but it must be a sound foundation, <Col N="1635" /> and I cannot conceive that it will be sound so long as the representatives of the existing Irish Coursing Club&mdash;and it will not be the reformed club&mdash;are there.  The Minister is giving these gentlemen three years more to dig themselves in.  They are expert manipulators; everybody who has any knowledge of this problem knows that, and if the Minister is going to allow them to have a majority of two to one over the ordinary members, then dig themselves in they will.</P>
    <P>I think there is a good deal of substance in what the Minister has said to the effect that they should have some representation on the board, that you cannot throw out the dirty water until you have got in the clean, and that you should not change horses while crossing the stream, but still the Minister need not go as far as he has done in the Bill.  It will be quite sufficient, and I think most people who are interested both in sport and in the industry in this country, would welcome it, if the Minister were to say, having heard the views expressed in this House: &ldquo;I am not going to give the Irish Coursing Club representation <i>per se</i>, but I will, as a gentleman's arrangement, agree that two members of the board will represent what might possibly be described as the old-established vested interest here in the industry, but that the other four members will be members who will be more truly representative of the people who are the backbone of the greyhound-breeding industry and sport in this country; that at least two of these people will represent the breeders and coursing clubs and that one other, perhaps, will represent the bookmakers&mdash; perhaps two, but at least one.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That will give the bookmakers the same assurance as they have enjoyed in relation to the Irish Racing Board. I know it has not wholly satisfied the bookmakers in regard to the Irish Racing Board, but at least it has given them the comfort of having some spokesman, some representation on the board which controls their whole livelihood, so far as those who confine themselves to racecourse bookmaking are concerned.  I think it would not <Col N="1636" /> be a bad idea if the Minister were to do that in regard to this board.  I only hope that when we come to the Committee Stage, we will do something to remove the difficulty I see in regard to the board which I regard as the key of the whole Bill and, of course, the factor which will determine for good or ill what is to be the future of the greyhound-breeding industry in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to welcome the Bill now before the House.  There is only one point that I wish to raise with the Minister on it.  I am sure, although I have not been present for the debate so far for any length of time this point has already been raised by some other speaker but I would like to have it on record that I mentioned it during the course of the discussion.</P>
      <P>The Minister, I am sure, is serious in his efforts to put the greyhound industry on an honest and satisfactory basis and I feel sure he has no desire while trying to achieve that to do harm or to be hurtful to any of the interests concerned in that industry. In this Bill there is one particular section, Section 22, which struck me as being rather drastic.  It is in connection with the powers about to be given to this board, the powers that will be conferred under this Bill when it becomes law.  I feel it is going a bit too far to give these powers to that particular body.  It means that the livelihood, the life and death of all concerned in the industry, will be in the hands of the people who compose or comprise this board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many Deputies have expressed their views on a number of occasions with regard to the powers given to State and semi-State bodies and most of us desire that these powers should come to a greater extent under the control of the House.  I think the members of the present Government when in office during the first inter-Party régime were actually inquiring into the possibilities of preparing machinery which would bring State or semi-State bodies more directly under the control of the House.  In other words, the feeling was that State bodies were too independent altogether.  There may be a different argument put up with regard <Col N="1637" /> to this particular board but I do suggest it is going too far to say that there will be no appeal from the decisions made by this board.  Human nature being what it is, we have no guarantee that certain members of this board may not be prejudiced against particular individuals who may come before it in any aspect of their duties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I am concerned, I was not in this House in 1945 when the Racing Board was set up.  Apart from that, I am merely speaking on this question of the greyhound industry.  The position is that this board may make whatever conditions it likes and can attach any conditions it likes to the issue of permits, licences and anything else.  It may be difficult to get over that point but I presume the Minister's argument will be to the effect that if the board does not do its duties the members can be replaced at the end of 12 months or at the end of their period of office.  But meantime the damage may have been done and a man may lose his livelihood or a group of people may lose their livelihoods, and it would be no satisfaction to them to know that at the end of the period of office of the members of the board the Minister will say to them: &ldquo;Gentlemen, I no longer require your services: you have not been satisfactory.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I believe there should be some machinery available whereby appeals made to the board can receive just and sympathetic consideration.  As it stands, if a man gets notice from the board that his rights are terminated or his permit withdrawn, he has power to appeal within seven days and that appeal may be considered&mdash;these are the words&mdash;but there is no suggestion that there will be a favourable decision and no suggestion that the rights of the individual will be safeguarded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think too much power has been conferred on the board in the Bill. Personally I cannot offer an alternative <Col N="1638" /> but I am sure the Minister in his wisdom, and with the advice available to him in his Department, will be able to relieve the fears of many people especially in view of what has been said about the probable membership of this board in its first three-year period.  If it should be possible that a right of appeal could exist to our courts, I think it would be very desirable that that aspect of the matter should be considered.  It may be that the Minister has a sound argument that there should be no right of appeal to himself.  I can well picture the Minister's position with regard to that; he would need a special staff to look after the complaints that would be made.</P>
    <P>I think he is right in not having any machinery available whereby an appeal can be made to him or to anybody else, but I see no reason in the world why there should not be the right of appeal by a person who feels an injustice has been done to him.  I see no reason why a right of appeal could not be given to such a person to go to, say, the Circuit Court and have his case examined by a neutral judicial authority.  I ask the Minister to give very serious consideration to that point before the Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to comment briefly on one or two points.  I appeal to the Minister to give greater representation to the bookmakers on this proposed board.  The question of the right of private enterprise also arises inasmuch as a bookmaker may have a known pitch and I appeal to the Minister to ensure that that pitch will not be taken for the erection of a tote. On the question of admission charges to bookmakers, I suggest they should be on the same basis as heretofore. The bookmakers feel that to a certain extent they may be made &ldquo;hares&rdquo; of where these admission fees are concerned and put off the track altogether. These are the points I wish to bring to the attention of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. MacCarthy Mr. MacCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not a great deal to say because I speak as one who has not been three times on a racetrack in my life but one who has followed open coursing since his <Col N="1639" /> earliest days and who occasionally enjoys that sport still.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of this Bill is to organise the industry on a democratic basis.  Instead of starting at the board we ought to start at the foundation, at the parish or local end, where the humblest man in the most modest home can rear and train a greyhound and be in or out of the local coursing club of his own volition.  If he wants to co-operate with others and have the sport organised locally on a sound basis it is desirable that he should be a member of such a club and the only obstacle would be that the fee might be too high and he might not in consequence elect to join the local club.</P>
      <P>The whole strength of the industry is based on its growth down the years in the open coursing and on the track, and in the attractive prizes offered and the ultimate successful sale of the dogs.</P>
      <P>Success in coursing or on the track was the passport to a better sale. When the industry became big business, so to speak, the tracks were established and we had people manoeuvring, singly and in combines through the purchase of shares, to control the interests of these tracks.  It is in the selection of dogs for particular races that suspicions can arise as a result of that manoeuvring.  In open coursing and in park coursing there is, as the Minister knows, an open draw held in public of the dogs entered in the ordinary normal way in these events; everybody is entitled to be present and can see for himself that the draw is fairly made.  In the track events, however, trials are held and that is another matter.  I cannot speak about it really because I know nothing about it, and I want to know nothing about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am, on the other hand, very interested in the greyhound industry because it is a sport which has grown up amongst the rural community.  It is a sport which can be enjoyed in spring and winter and autumn, going around beating for a hare and having a few courses.  It is outdoor exercise.  In the track meetings there is very little cause for complaint.  If the organisation <Col N="1640" /> is built up on the parish or local unit, with representatives being elected in the ordinary way and regular meetings held for the control of these coursing matches, and the whole thing is on a provincial basis, the matter can be dealt with very easily because those who are interested in the ownership, the breeding and training of the dogs will have their say.  If there are any mistakes the fault will be their own.</P>
    <P>I saw some people here last night who were very interested in the debate. Some of them control tracks themselves at the moment.  I suppose one cannot find fault with them for looking after their own interests.  I can support in great measure the suggestion made by Deputy Briscoe that a period of 12 months should be allowed during which the industry could organise itself and put its house in order.  At the end of that period we could come then to the constitution of the board which will exercise a certain control over the sport in relation to the running of tracks, their number, finances and all the rest.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Briscoe, too, in relation to representation by the bookmakers. They form an important part of this sport and they should have a say at the highest level where their interests are affected.  Furthermore, if they have such a say, they will not be able subsequently to wash their hands clean of what may be happening. I do not wish to go into detail at this stage, but I think this Bill will have to be examined section by section very closely in Committee.  I appeal to the Minister to remember that what must be kept to the forefront is the fact that the ordinary man will not be exploited and that the public will neither be exploited nor deceived by the unfair selection of greyhounds for particular races and the putting in of certain dogs on certain occasions in order to bring off a coup. Such has happened in the past.  We have heard these things mentioned in the course of this debate.  It is not easy to achieve perfection and I am not prepared to call the people who have been in this racing business over the years any names, good or bad, because I do not know sufficient about <Col N="1641" /> them to assess either their merits or their demerits.</P>
    <P>The only remark I should like to make is, that by their blundering progress, an industry has grown up. It has now come to the stage when more control over activities is necessary. This Bill proposes to do that. I think we ought to examine it very carefully, stage by stage, so that when we are finished with it, the board which will have such a big say in the control of the industry will be set up in a democratic way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFlynn" hpid="Mr. J. Flynn Mr. J. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy MacCarthy I have very little experience of coursing and the greyhound industry but I have received representations from people in my own county who are the backbone of the industry in this country.  They have asked me to make representations to the Minister in regard to various aspects of this proposed legislation. They informed me that the people down the country who are in the industry have no confidence in the existing arrangements or in the Irish Coursing Club.  I am not in a position to dispute that or to say whether it is right or wrong but we know the position that has existed over the years.</P>
      <P>It would appear that the coursing clubs referred to by Deputy MacCarthy receive very little financial assistance from the Irish Coursing Club from time to time.  They make the point that the Minister should, in regard to the formation of this board, limit the number of nominees from the Irish Coursing Club.  I have listened to the Minister here when he stated that we should utilise this Irish Coursing Club as the basis for our approach to this matter and that we should utilise the machinery that is there to enable him to form the board and to set up proper machinery.  Judging from what has been said here, what we have been told, and what has been proved from evidence submitted at the inquiry that club was not satisfactory in the past and I would ask the Minister to establish a more even balance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am an outsider as far as the <Col N="1642" /> industry is concerned but, from what the Minister, other Deputies and people down the country have said, I think the best way to deal with the matter would be to give representation to all the interests concerned, the breeders, the bookmakers, the track owners and so on and to limit the number from the Irish Coursing Club. I am sure that the Minister is anxious to see the industry flourishing in the country and to have the best possible personnel in charge of it.  I think the best possible way out would be to have two nominees from the Irish Coursing Club, and one each from the other organisations.  I submit to the Minister that that would be a fair basis to go on in his efforts to stabilise this industry and to permit it to flourish in a proper way.</P>
    <P>A point was made by Deputy McQuillan with regard to the powers of the proposed board and I would ask the Minister if he would receive amendments to Section 22.  I was very much impressed by the appeal made by Deputy Collins yesterday evening when he asked the Minister to give an opportunity to a Committee of this House to examine the matter before he finally puts this measure through the House.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the Minister will be impressed by what has been said by every Deputy that I have heard speak on this matter.  They are all anxious to see the best possible approach to this legislation.  I have no knowledge of these people in the Irish Coursing Club.  I am not acquainted with any of them but I was impressed by the representations made to me by men from my own county who are the backbone of the coursing industry in the country and who know what they are speaking about.  As their representative I have no option but to accept their views on the matter and I am confident that the Minister will be impressed by the manner in which they have put up their case.</P>
    <P>I am not blaming the Irish Coursing Club in any way because even with the best intentions in the world there will be discrepancies and evasions of regulations but, in order to have the matter on a proper democratic basis, <Col N="1643" /> my appeal to the Minister is that a proper balance should be maintained between the different interests.  There is a danger that if one party gets control of the board and has a monopoly the initiative, energy and interest of the small man down the country will disappear.  The clubs in the country will slowly but surely lose interest in the industry because they will have no confidence in the people in control.</P>
    <P>We have had sorry experiences of State-controlled bodies in this country, bodies which were set up and given extraordinary powers.  At the time they were set up, it may have been essential to give them these powers but in later years it was found difficult to reconcile the activities of the State-sponsored bodies with democratic principles.  Too much power has been allotted to these people and in my opinion there is a danger if you do not preserve a proper balance between the members of the organisation who had a monopoly in the past.  If you nominate them and put them back in control again, the last stage will be worse then the first.  I am certain the Minister is anxious to find the best possible way out of these difficulties and to have the best proposals put forward.  I hope he will accept my suggestion in regard to these matters, that if we submit amendments later he will consider them favourably.</P>

      <P>I do not think I am unreasonable if I express some impatience with the observations of Deputy MacEntee.  Deputy MacEntee purports to draw a terrible picture of terrible things that were happening under the administration of the Irish Coursing Club during the past 20 years.  Of that 20 years, Deputy MacEntee was a member of the Government for 16.  Did he or any of his colleagues in any part of that 16 years raise a finger to attempt the reform of what he now alleges were notorious scandals, and if he did not, why did he not?  After the 16 years in which Fianna Fáil were in office, we came into office in 1948 and I then appointed a commission.</P>

      <P>I came into office again and produced a Bill, a poor thing but mine own.  Of course, immediately everybody in Fianna Fáil stands up and says: &ldquo;It is a grand thing to bring in this Bill but here are a number of things you ought not to do.&rdquo; Let me say to the House that you cannot will the end if you are not prepared to will the means.  I do not expect that any Bill that I bring in will please everybody.  In fact, it is inevitable that if it is a good Bill it will not please anybody 100 per cent. I think, however, everybody will say: &ldquo;Parliament has gone as far as they can go to avoid interfering with our legitimate interests while serving the overriding interests of putting the whole of this industry on a satisfactory basis.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am introducing a Bill here, not for <Col N="1645" /> the purpose of conferring on the Minister for Agriculture powers to run the greyhound industry but to confer on the greyhound industry itself powers which, if properly used, will preserve the prosperity and stability of their own industry.  But am I not right in saying that if the members of the greyhound industry themselves are not prepared to make the exertions necessary effectively to use these powers there is nothing Dáil Éireann can do about it?</P>
    <P>One of the conditions precedent to introducing this legislation was that there should be incorporated in the Schedule to the Bill and submitted to Dáil Éireann a new constitution for the Irish Coursing Club which placed upon them the obligation for a period of two and a half years to secure an executive for the Irish Coursing Club, every single member of which would be democratically elected by the coursing clubs and racetracks in a fair proportion. Is there any other better way in which you can secure democratic control?</P>

      <P>Then we are brought down to this point.  When you go to appoint the first board, do not give the undertaking that you will choose four of the seven members from the executive committee of the Irish Coursing Club.  I want to remind the Deputies that Oireachtas Éireann passed the Horse Racing Bill in 1945 and this Oireachtas unanimously accepted the principle that we should give to the Turf Club and the Irish National Hunt Club an absolute majority on the Racing Board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I may be an old-fashioned person but what I think is strange is that these two bodies were constituted almost exclusively from what used to be called the ascendancy in this country and I am asked now, having personally and vicariously for a century sought to take the hands of the ascendancy off the throats of our people, to lay down this principle in Oireachtas Éireann that if you have the Turf Club and the Irish National Hunt Club exclusively manned by the representatives of the ascendancy, who are not our kind of people, the Oireachtas should say: &ldquo;Certainly. When you are setting up a statutory racing board they must have a majority&rdquo; while when you are dealing with the Irish Coursing Club, which is constituted by and large, and will be constituted by and large, by our own kind of people, that Oireachtas Éireann should say &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Hear me out.  &ldquo;We cannot allow these common people to have the same kind of control we reserve for the gentry.  These are common people and we must view them with suspicion and distrust.&rdquo; These are the words that Arthur Balfour would have used.  This is the attitude that Arthur Balfour confidently upheld.  Is that not true?  The only offence we have against these people is that they are our kind of people.  Are we to take up the position that because they are our kind of people we cannot trust them?  Mark this&mdash;I appoint four of the existing Irish Coursing Club executive.  In six months' time after the passing of this Bill, seven members of the 21 members of the executive must by lot retire from the executive and go for election. Suppose three of the four that I have chosen for the committee of management happen to come out of the hat to retire from the executive of the Irish Coursing Club and go for election and they do not get re-elected they must all retire from the board of management immediately.  Therefore, unless they are elected, chosen democratically, by the clubs and racetracks under the scheme envisaged in the Bill they go out of office at once.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1647" /> I think you can abuse people, belittle people and deride them but is it not the fact that the Irish Coursing Club started in 1916 as a body of coursing men to control coursing and there then came upon them what was in those days the phenomenon of greyhound track racing, in 1923 or 1924? There was nobody to control greyhound track racing.  Personally, with the benefit of hind-sight, I think they would have been well advised to say: &ldquo;We will have nothing to do with it. Let them set up some other body to control that.&rdquo;  But people are not always as wise in anticipation as we can be in retrospect.</P>

      <P>It is probably true that in 1924, when they made that decision, they bit off more than they could chew and they undertook to control something that they were not equipped to control and had not the resources to build up the machine to control.  We all know that abuses did develop.  It was because these abuses were in existence that I thought it expedient to set up that commission so that we could find a way of putting right what was wrong.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>My obligation is not to appoint four persons proposed to me by the executive of the Irish Coursing <Col N="1648" /> Club.  My undertaking is that I will pick four out of the 21 members of the executive.  They have no power to say to me: &ldquo;Here are the four that you must appoint.&rdquo;  All I am undertaking to do is that I will choose four from their number and that is subject to this proviso that seven of the 21&mdash;and it may contain the whole four or three of the four or two of the four&mdash;must go for election in six months at the hands of the clubs and racetracks and if they are not elected they will cease to be members of the control board. Then, 12 months later, another seven must go and if any one of them happens to be on the board of control and does not get elected, he must go and, finally, the last seven must go and they become elected members or cease to be eligible for membership of the board of control.</P>
      <P>I can see that many Deputies may say: &ldquo;Why do you not hold an election?  Is not that the simple thing to do, and have a new start?&rdquo;  As the debate has gone on, I think more and more Deputies have come around to my point of view, that it is not a good thing; it is not a good way to get continuity and to avoid quite unnecessary upheaval.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  It would be disastrous if you tried to set up Government every now and again with nobody in it with any experience of Government.  We were very fortunate in the early stages of the State that we were able to get away with that without serious injury to the State.  I see there are two points of view about it and I think the argument for continuity should prevail.</P>
      <P>I am particularly anxious that we should not accept the proposition that what was done in respect of the Turf Club and the Irish National Hunt Club was perfectly proper but that, when we are taking a similar measure in regard to our own kind of people, we should turn our backs upon that procedure and say that it will not do. I do not agree with that view.  It is true that the Turf Club and the Irish National Hunt Club have never been asked to move over on to a democratic electoral basis.  The Irish Coursing Club is being required to do that and the continued holding of office of people chosen by me as members of the board of management depends on their success in being freely chosen through the democratic electoral process either in six months, 18 months or 30 months after the passage of this Bill.</P>
      <P>Deputy McQuillan mentioned the power in Section 22 to license racetracks. The power as to race courses is vested in the National Hunt Club. There is no appeal at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree but then, in addition to that, one has to bear in mind that very often what is theoretically eminently desirable, in practice proves to be wholly unnecessary.  It is not a matter of principle with me. I would not feel very exercised about <Col N="1650" /> it but it appears to have worked in regard to horse-racing to leave this matter to the horse-racing authority itself and no difficulty has presented itself so far but, if somebody pressed on me very strongly that there ought to be some appeal to a Circuit Court judge or some authority of that kind, it is not a matter of principle with me. However I am not sure if it is necessary and I do not think we ought to put into legislation elaborate Health Robinson devices if circumstances do not warrant their creation.</P>

I said that under no circumstances would I act as a pressure agent for them, but each group that I spoke to, or that spoke to me, felt that the question of some right of appeal was one of the most important grievances they had.</P>

Anybody who ever applied for a licence and complied with the requisite terms seems to have had no difficulty and I have never heard of anyone seeking a tribunal to which they could appeal from the Irish National Hunt Club.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>All of us who read the report are entitled to form our own judgment but I am not going to be a party to the proposition that what was good enough for the Turf Club and the National Hunt Committee is not good enough for the commonality to which I belong.  That is Deputy Walsh's view but surely I am entitled to my view.  That is the plain fact.  May be we cannot reach agreement but at least we can agree to differ.  I hope I have made my position clear.  It would have been very easy for me to have misled Dáil Éireann and to say I would not bind myself and then to go behind the backs of Dáil Éireann and appoint my four men from the 21, having reassured Dáil Éireann that I was under no obligation to do so.  I think that would have been dishonest. If I am going to do that, I think it is my duty to tell Dáil Éireann and then to do it with their knowledge and consent.</P>
      <P>I feel sure we will all agree that after three elections have taken place, in which the whole 21 members of the executive have been chosen by election, it is a good thing thereafter that the four should be drawn from that elected body but I do ask Deputies to bear in mind that if, for the purpose of avoiding opposition, I will say now I will drop that obligation, that would leave me perfectly free to choose the same four men.  But I think that would be a devious way of doing things when I had the obligation to be perfectly frank with the Dáil.</P>

      <P>Is is not a fact that when this Bill becomes an Act and the board is set up, the board will have additional duties over and above what the Irish Coursing Club has had previously and that additional interests and responsibilities will be brought under their control?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, this board will have much wider duties because the whole purpose of the Bill is to build up the greyhound industry in this country.  The reason why we have to impose levies and taxation on totalisator and on the bookmakers is to enable this board to do for greyhound racing what the Turf Club and the National Hunt Committee did for horse-racing.  The horse-racing industry was largely built up here by the fact that the Racing Board was able to provide the revenue out of taxation on the totalisator and on the bookmakers. They were able to provide increased State moneys, and to provide owners with facilities for the transport of their animals to race meetings.  They were able to give improved amenities to the bookmakers as well.  When the proposal which enables all these things to occur was introduced bookmakers were greatly alarmed and distressed and thought they were to be wiped out.  I could agree with the Deputies that this board will have much wider powers, but it will also have much wider duties and responsibilities, and so we propose to have an independent chairman and we propose to have this board of management appointed by the Minister for Agriculture for the time being.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The other topic about which Deputies appeared to be particularly concerned was the bookmakers. I have tried to make it as clear as I could that one of the many reasons for the delay in bringing this Bill before the House was that I got leave from the House at the end of the summer session to print the Bill and yet I did not circulate it until some weeks after the House reassembled.  What was the reason?  It was because I searched every plan I could to see if I could not meet the wishes of the smaller bookmakers to be free from a levy and when it became abundantly clear to me that I could not do it I felt I was not morally entitled to bring the Bill before the House without sending for them again.  I did this and I told them that I had tried my best to meet their wishes because they seemed to be so desperately apprehensive that it would gravely injure them in their livelihood. I said: &ldquo;I have done the best I can and now I am advised that without a levy on bookmakers' bets I cannot finance the work that has to be done,&rdquo; but I also said to them: &ldquo;If it will help to restrict that levy to one-and-a-quarter I would be glad to give that at least a trial.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At first glance, it seemed that it ought to be a help to the bookmakers to bring down the level of the levy, but I am not sure on investigation that it is going to help at all.  In fact, from the point of view of the small bookmakers, it might be better to leave the levy at 2½ per cent. and attach to all bookmakers' licences an obligation to collect it from the betters because it now appears that if the levy is too <Col N="1656" /> low it may be an economic possibility for the relatively big bookmaker to charge it against his profit.  He would be able to bear it whereas the small fellow might not be able to do that and would so lose his patronage.  But if you make it 2½ per cent., the big fellow will not want to bear that himself and will more readily comply with the compulsory direction that he should collect it from the betters.  I believe the practice in regard to bookmakers&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>With the indulgence of the Chair, would the Minister, just for argument's sake, tell us what is 1½ per cent. of 2/6?  How is it to be collected?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that difficulty exists, but do not forget what Deputy O'Malley said in this debate&mdash;I am not saying it to the Deputy but merely reminding him what Deputy O'Malley said&mdash;that any fool can get up and tell me what I ought not to do but that it takes a good man to get up and tell me what I ought to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I did make a suggestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That was about the only part of Deputy O'Malley's speech with which I found myself in entire agreement. I want to find a way, if I can, to help the small bookmakers.  I know of no way in which this thing can be financed&mdash;although I will consider Deputy Briscoe's suggestion&mdash;without a levy on bookmakers and the tote.  I do think it is possible, after the thing has got under way, that the tote might yield revenue sufficient to permit of the levy being dropped, and that possibility is envisaged in the report and provision for that possibility is incorporated in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some people have voiced apprehension on behalf of the bookmakers, that they will be deprived of their pitches and that the tote would be planted on the ground where they were in the habit of standing to the grave detriment of their profitable employment but I think that apprehension is founded on an illusion arising from the practice in Great Britain, because in Great Britain&mdash;I think I am right in saying&mdash;the tote was operated for <Col N="1657" /> the private benefit of the track owners and it therefore became a real aim of the track owners to elbow the bookmaker off the tracks and force everybody on to the tote.  That is not the case in Ireland.  The entire profit of the tote in Ireland is going to the board for the development of greyhound racing whereas the bookmaker paying his entry fee, whatever it may be, is a source of benefits to the track owner and, far from the track owners in Ireland wishing to shoulder the bookmaker out of the way in favour of the tote, I think the bookmaker would be a very much more welcome visitor to the track here than the tote. The exact opposite is the case in Great Britain but when it comes to asking me to fix a maximum of five times the admission price for a bookmaker entering a greyhound track because that is the maximum fixed on the racehorse tracks I want to remind the House that when we talk of greyhound tracks we should not think only of Harold's Cross and Shelbourne Park.  There may be tracks down the of Harold's Cross and Shelbourne Park.  There may be tracks down the country where, in order to draw a crowd, the proprietors may charge only 1/- or 2/-.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. T. Walsh Mr. T. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not one in Ireland that I know where the entrance fee is 1/-.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know.  I do not suppose the Deputy is a frequenter of these tracks much more than I am myself and I do not know what the practice is, but my advice from a variety of sources is that it may be that some of these country tracks have to charge very low entrance fees and that it is not impossible that the time could come when these tracks would find it requisite to have a modest entrance fee for the inside ring, and virtually no charge at all for the outside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not saying that that is a likely development but that it is possible. Let us face the fact that we cannot undertake to put in a Bill something which is manifestly unworkable and we must have some regard to realities. I did take occasion in introducing this Bill to say expressly that I thought one of the clear duties of the board of <Col N="1658" /> control would be to protect the legitimate interests of the bookmaker whom I regarded as an integral part of this industry and who was entitled to his livelihood.  Most people here seem to forget that at the present time bookmakers are paying ten or 12 times the entrance fee&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another answer to that.  The bookmaker will not be represented on the board as it is at present constituted.  If he were, there might be some merit in what the Minister says.  But the Minister should know that the present high levels of prices to bookmakers are of recent occurrence and are based on the expectancy of this Bill.  The Minister knows that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In any case, the fact remains that in all the preliminary discussions I have had about this Bill I have met a greater number of bookmakers&mdash;and showed a great deal more solicitude for their welfare and the welfare of their employees&mdash;than I have track proprietors.  I am not sure if I met the track proprietors.  I think I did once.</P>

I am much flattered by the constant inclination of Deputies on both sides of the House to urge on me the obligation of seeking that this does not happen and that does not happen.

If anybody can suggest to me any further safeguard than the fact that whatever Minister appoints this board will have to answer to Dáil Éireann in the last analysis for its performance I will be glad to hear it.</P>

But I think, if we do, the whole greyhound racing business will collapse, and that at no far distant date.  If that should come to pass the bookmakers who are now getting their living on the greyhound tracks will have no living to get unless we establish a board which will have the resources and the powers, first, to raise the whole standard of conduct associated with greyhound racing and, secondly, to improve the <Col N="1661" /> stakes and the amenities available on greyhound tracks for owners and patrons.  If we do not do that, the greyhound racing industry will disappear.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the board impose penal charges for the purpose of keeping out small bookmakers?  Not with my consent, and, if that were done, I would come back to Dáil Éireann to seek powers to dismiss the board that did it.  I would regard it as a grave betrayal of its responsibilities if it did anything of the kind.  On the contrary, just as Deputy Briscoe and Deputy Walsh said, track owners and so forth are well able to look after their own interests and I would regard it as one of the primary duties of the board to concern itself with the protection of the smaller bookmakers who might not have the influence or the resources to defend themselves that more well-to-do men have.  I would regard the care and scrupulousness of the board in attending to matters of that kind as one of the criteria on which to judge their efficiency and their excellence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not quite follow the question as to penalties imposed.  I cannot imagine the board proposing any penalties which would not be uniform for all.  I imagine that if there are to be bookmakers' licences the same bookmakers' licences will be available to all on terms possible for all.  I would expect any breach of the regulations to be dealt with on the same basis, irrespective of whether it was a large and wealthy bookmaker or a small and <Col N="1662" /> relatively insignificant one.  I certainly am proceeding on the assumption that no question of discrimination between the powerful and the weak could be contemplated even for one moment.  I think bookmakers are inclined to forget that we are fighting for their living just as much as we are fighting for everybody else.  That is the end at which we aim.  I know of no other means by which we can attain that end except by having some levy on bookmakers' bets for some period of time; and on the tote, if the board discovers the revenue derived from the tote is sufficient, I certainly will be in favour of suspending the levy altogether. In the meantime I do not think we can avail of the machinery unless we have the necessary means and that is the only reason why the board is authorised under this Bill to fix a levy on bookmakers' bets.</P>

I have no reason to believe that the Bill will receive approval in principle from Dáil Éireann.  It is written into the Bill that the Minister shall make the appointments and that is the principle in which the Dáil is interested.

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. O'Donnell) Patrick O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. O'Donnell)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two main grounds for superannuation, the <Col N="1664" /> humanitarian and the practical.  Even where a man holds a life tenure of his office increasing years or ill-health force him either to give up work, or continue working beyond his physical capacity to do so.  It is right and proper that such a man should be able to avail himself of a pension.</P>
      <P>Beyond a certain age few officers are in a position to give a full return for their salaries.  For that reason it is normal practice that a retiring age around the age of 65 be fixed for pensionable officers.  A retiring age is a most important step towards making an efficient public service and a superannuation scheme makes it practicable to enforce it.</P>
      <P>Superannuation schemes for the local service date from 1865, when the Union Officers Superannuation (Ireland) Act was passed.  In the following 20 years, six separate Superannuation Acts were passed for various classes of local officers, medical officers, asylum officers and county surveyors, as well as certain miscellaneous officers.  Under the Local Government (Ireland) Act, 1919, a single superannuation code for all officers of local authorities was attempted.  That Act was superseded by the Local Government Act, 1925.  This Act, apart from embracing all classes of officers (apart from mental hospital officers) had a notable feature.  Under the previous Superannuation Acts, an officer could reckon service only under the local authority that employed him at the time he came to be pensioned.  The Act of 1925 made what was, in its way, a revolutionary departure in that it allowed continuous service under all local authorities to be aggregated. This was crucial in bringing about the circumstances in which a real local government service could be established. It became possible for the gifted officer, without loss, to make a career in the local government service as a whole.  That has had its drawbacks from time to time, but the present efficiency of the local government service is due to a great extent to that change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Act of 1925 provided for a pension up to two-thirds of remuneration, or a gratuity where an office was <Col N="1665" /> abolished and an officer had less than ten years of service, or a marriage gratuity for women officers of one month's pay for each year of service. The pension was the same as had been available under previous Superannuation Acts.  It had two features: the Act laid down no scale on which it was to be granted, and it could be granted only with the sanction of the Minister. In practice, one-sixtieths, up to a maximum of forty-sixtieths, of pay was reckoned for each year of pensionable service, with added years in certain circumstances; but the vagueness of the provision left the calculation of some superannuation allowances somewhat arbitrary.  The other main feature of the Act of 1925 was that the service of an officer must be continuous to be reckoned.  A striking defect of the superannuation scheme was that no provision was made for the dependent of an officer who died prematurely.</P>
    <P>These three features were remedied in the Local Government (Superannuation) Act, 1948.  A precise scale for granting a pension was set out in that Act and necessity for the sanction of the Minister to each grant of superannuation was dispensed with. Secondly, the requirement that service be continuous was not for the future insisted upon.  Thirdly, the Civil Service practice of granting a gratuity to the dependent of an officer should he die in office was adopted.  The former idea of a pension based on sixtieths of retiring pay was superseded by a pension based on eightieths.  In return for this reduction in the size of the pension the officer was guaranteed either a lump sum of up to one and a half times his retiring pay, should he live to retirement, or a death gratuity to his dependent.</P>
    <P>These provisions are retained in the present Bill, except that some further provisions are made for a widow of an officer.  These I shall refer to later.</P>
    <P>So far as the law relating to the superannuation of officers generally is concerned, the Bill proposes to make four main changes.</P>
    <P>First, it proposes that all existing officers of local authorities will henceforth be dealt with under a single comprehensive <Col N="1666" /> measure, the present Bill, and not under any of the previous Acts.  I should mention here that this does not refer to officers of mental hospital authorities who have always had an entirely separate code of superannuation law.  The Act of 1948 gave a free option to existing officers to come within its terms or to stay under their own Act.  The present Bill gives such officers a free option between the benefits they could have had under the Act of 1925 and the new benefits, but brings them all under this single comprehensive code of superannuation law.</P>
    <P>Secondly, &ldquo;a pensionable officer&rdquo; henceforth will be only an officer whose name is entered on the register of pensionable officers kept under the Bill; and his name will not be entered on that register until he is clearly a permanent officer.  Under the Act of 1925 the question of whether an officer was pensionable or not was usually determined only when he came to retire from his office.  This was an unhappy position both for officer and local authority.  The Act of 1948 dealt with this problem by providing that officers who came under its terms should be entered on a register of established officers, but it did not exclude the possibility of there being pensionable officers who were not entered under the register.  When staffs are being recruited for the future their status must be properly declared.  If they are permanent whole-time officers, or permanent medical officers, their names will be entered on the register of pensionable officers. That entry will be their title to a pension.  It is proposed in the Bill that all existing officers entitled to pension will be entered on this new register of pensionable officers.</P>
    <P>The third difference from the Act of 1948 is a small one, but of some interest.  We have seen that under the Act of 1925 no scale for the calculation of a pension based on years of service was laid down, but that every pension had to be sanctioned by the Minister.  The Act of 1948 remedied that for the normal pension where no question of added years arose.  There was a fixed scale under the Act, of <Col N="1667" /> one-eightieth for each year of service up to 40, and a pension so calculated did not require sanction.  Where, however, in certain specified circumstances or where the local authority were of opinion that &ldquo;special reasons existed&rdquo; they could add years under the Act of 1948 up to a maximum of ten.  The Act did not specify these &ldquo;special reasons&rdquo;, but practice has for a good while determined what they are and what scale of years should be taken in calculating them.</P>
    <P>In Section 13 of the present Bill all the headings under which years might be added are specified.  The section proposes to give the Minister power to make regulations governing the precise additions that may be made in each circumstance.  In this way the practice governing added years will, both for local authorities and for local officials, be made explicit and each officer will know, when his pension is being calculated, what he might reasonably expect to get in the circumstances of his case.  This permits the sanction of the Minister to be dispensed with entirely in the awarding of superannuation benefits to officers. However, ample provision is made in the Bill for appeal to the Minister when an officer is aggrieved in relation to his superannuation.</P>
    <P>The fourth main difference for officers is that in Section 50 of the Bill. Under that section an officer may give up part of his lump sum or death gratuity in return for the assurance of a pension for his widow should he die in office or should he die on pension. The general idea is that regulations to be made under the section will provide that two-thirds of the lump sum or death gratuity will be given up in return for a pension of one-third of what the officer either would have drawn should he have retired on grounds of ill health instead of dying before the normal pensionable age, or one-third of his pension should he die on pension.  It is intended that the contribution by the officer from his lump sum or death gratuity will in general pay for the cost of the benefit. Should that cost change new regulations will have to be made under the section.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1668" /> A further improvement in the Bill (it applies to both officers and servants) is the provision to link up various branches of the public service for pension purposes.  The Act of 1948 linked up service in the Civil Service, harbour authorities and teaching service with service under local authorities, but the present Bill goes a good deal further in that respect.  It is thus a considerable step towards the achieving of a single public service for all public authorities just as a single local service for local authorities was achieved after the Act of 1925.</P>
    <P>A matter that gave a good deal of trouble under the Act of 1948 was how to calculate the remuneration on which a benefit under the Act could be based. The Act of 1925 provided that it should be the average of pay during the three years preceding cesser of office. The Act of 1948 said that it should normally be the pay on cesser of office, but in any exceptional case the average of the three preceding years. The Act did not give precise effect to its intentions, and some exceptional cases (e.g., officers paid wholly by fee or poundage) seem to have been overlooked. Section 27 of the Bill endeavours to deal with the problem on the general lines of the intentions of the Act of 1948.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill relates to pensions for servants of local authorities. Apart from a private Act of the Dublin Corporation, and the Dublin, Limerick and Waterford City Management Acts, there was no specific statutory power to give servants of local authorities pensions before the Act of 1948.  Part III of the Act of 1948, which will be wholly superseded by Part III of the present Bill, attempted to provide a comprehensive superannuation scheme not only for servants of urban bodies, the bulk of whom have permanent and constant employment, but also for servants of county councils, a high proportion of whom have no proper permanent status and who do not get full-time employment each year.</P>
    <P>The normal criteria for accruing pensionable service is that it be whole-time and permanent.  If a superannuation <Col N="1669" /> scheme insisted that county council road workers be whole-time, that is, be employed for the whole of each year by the county council, very few of them would benefit under the scheme.  The Act of 1948 accordingly provided that service of 200 days and more in a year could be regarded as pensionable service.  There are about 300 working days in a year, so that a person who devoted at least 200 days of them to the county council could be held to be deriving his main livelihood from the local authority and if he did this year after year, as very many of them do, he could reasonably be regarded as coming within the scope of full-time employee.</P>
    <P>Once one departs from the concept of complete whole-timeness in a matter of this kind it is difficult to know where exactly the line should be drawn; but it is clear that it should be drawn in such a way that only those who devote the greater part of their time to the service of the local authority should be included.  For example, a man who is a small farmer and devotes only a few months each year to the service of the local authority has no claim on the ratepayers for a pension when he ceases to be able to work for them.  If that is accepted, it is clear that the most liberal line it is possible to take, while still meeting the genuine needs of the great mass of road workers, is the requirement that they should devote at least two-thirds of their time to the service of the local authority in respect of any year which they can reckon for pension purposes.  Hence the figure of 200 days in the Act of 1948, which is repeated in the present Bill.  There is a slight modification in that the Act of 1948 required that the days be working days, whereas the present Bill includes other days such as paid leave, service with Defence Forces, days (up to a year) while on workmen's compensation and whole-time concurrent service with two or more local authorities.</P>
    <P>The other big concept for pensionable status is that a person be permanent. This is normally regarded as crucial under any superannuation scheme.  Most of the trouble under Part III of the Act of 1948 arose because <Col N="1670" /> of this.  To distinguish between the really permanent type of servant and the other types it laid down a number of conditions that must be satisfied by a permanent servant.  He must be deemed by the local authority to be a permanent servant; he must not have been absent in any of three consecutive years after he is so deemed unless involuntarily and then for not more than 60 days in each year; he must then be under 60 years of age; he must come within the overriding figure of pensionable servants fixed by the council each five years; he must work for at least 200 days in each of the eight consecutive years after becoming, technically, a permanent servant (failure at that stage would put him back to the beginning again); and, if he happened to be a servant at the adoption of the Act of 1948 he had, in addition, to opt for it within six months (failure to opt barred him permanently from pensionable status); or, if he happened then to be over 60 years of age, to have had continuous service.</P>
    <P>A high proportion of persons regularly employed by local authorities fall at these hurdles.  The present Bill proposes to remove all these hurdles and to replace them by a single, simple objective test, namely, had he 200 days that could be reckoned as service days under the local authority in a local financial year?  If he had, his name is put on the register of pensionable servants for the following year, unless he specifically says, during any month of April, that he does not wish to have his name entered for that year.  Thus all attempt to distinguish formally between permanent and other servants has been abandoned and is replaced by this simple test.  It is believed that in the normal course the really permanent servants and the others will separate themselves.  The really permanent ones will stay and the others will go.  Hence the local authorities will be incurring no appreciable additional responsibilities. Those who do not wish to keep on with the local authority for their lives can take the contributions they have paid and go.</P>
    <P>Apart from the difficulty of getting pensionable status under the Act of 1948, a servant also encountered, under <Col N="1671" /> the Act, difficulty in acquiring or retaining his pensionable service.  He could not, for example, reckon the following periods:&mdash;(1) the three years qualifying period, if that should be after the commencement of the Act in relation to him; (2) any period before the age of 18; (3) any period in his first five years of service as a permanent servant if he lost that status at any time; (4) any period of service forfeited by certain kinds of strike, unless on appeal the period is reinstated by the Minister; (5) possibly all service if he were not working (e.g. because of illness) when he made his actual claim for superannuation; (6) service before he ceased to be a permanent servant even when he subsequently resumes; and (7) all, or not less than half, of his service if the local authority when his pension is being fixed considered he gave unsatisfactory service.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to wipe out all these restrictions except the last and to allow him to reckon every period of 200 days or more in a local financial year on which his name appeared on the register, unless he gets his contributions back from the local authority and does not repay them.</P>
    <P>The basic scheme under the Act of 1948 was that where a servant worked at least 200 days he could reckon that period of the year for superannuation. For a contribution of 4 per cent. (½d. in 1/-) the benefits were:&mdash; (1) a pension of one-sixtieth of pay for each year of pensionable service, or (2) a short service, or death, gratuity, or (3) a marriage gratuity for women. The present Bill does not in effect change that basic scheme.  The benefits for servants remain unchanged.</P>
    <P>There were a lot of practical difficulties in adjusting the new arrangements to those of the old.  The general idea has been so to draft the Bill that so far as existing servants are concerned they will get all the benefits of the present Bill as if it, instead of the Act of 1948, had from the beginning applied to them.  So far as those who are now on pension are concerned we have tried, in Section 54 of the Bill, to permit local authorities to deal with them for the future as they can deal with existing servants.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1672" /> A difficulty under the Act of 1948 was in arriving at a year in which a servant could be held to have worked. For each servant a different year had to be taken.  This led to a good deal of trouble in administration and servants had difficulty in verifying their service to their satisfaction.  As the normal employment year on the roads is the local financial year that has been taken as a standard period in respect of which service will be reckoned.  For that reason, it is important that the Bill be passed before 1st April next; otherwise its main benefits for servants could not come into operation for a further 12 months.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Act of 1948 was a very liberal measure, but its practical effects were severely limited because of a number of the difficulties I have outlined. I hope that the improvements I am now putting before the Dáil will enable the principles of the Act of 1948 to be operated in the spirit in which it was conceived and to the satisfaction of local authorities and their employees.</P>
    <P>Part III of the present Bill also deals with a certain number of other practical snags that arose in administration. I hope that the experience that has been gained of the practical operation of the Act of 1948 has enabled us to provide a really workable measure.</P>
    <P>I have already touched to some extent on Part IV of the Bill.  Section 50 enables an officer of a local authority to give up part of his lump sum in return for a pension for his widow.  It does not apply to servants partly because they have not lump sums to give up, and partly because they are normally insured for pensions for widows and orphans under the Social Welfare Acts.</P>
    <P>Section 51 of the Bill also relates to widows.  In this case a person, whether officer or servant, going on pension may give up an amount not exceeding one-third of his pension in return for a pension for his widow or for a single dependent.  The widow or the dependent will be granted a pension the actuarial equivalent of the amount yielded up by the pensioner.</P>
    <P>The other new provision, in Part IV, <Col N="1673" /> apart from those mentioned, is that in Section 53 which permits a part-time officer, who is not a pensionable officer, to be granted a gratuity if his office is abolished or if for some reason, apart from his own misconduct, he has to be asked to resign from it.  This remedies a small, but decided, defect in the existing law.  Sometimes, as when a small urban district, with a part-time town clerk, is being deurbanised there is no comparable employment that he can be offered by that local authority or another local authority.  Thus if he cannot continue on as town clerk to the new town commissioners he would lose his job without compensation. This section is intended to remedy that defect.</P>
    <P>Part V of the Bill contains a number of machinery sections to deal with financial arrangements between various authorities concerned with awarding pensions.  There is nothing new about the provisions except in sub-section (7) of Section 57, and in Section 58.  These provide that two or more of the various authorities concerned can enter into an agreement to abandon claims on one another in relation to pensions and contributions.  This will enable some rather elaborate accounting procedures to be dropped and to make for some economy of administration. Obviously, payments of this kind taken as a whole cancel each other out and are, also as a whole, largely a waste of time; but from the standpoint of a single local authority there may be some difficulties.  The entering into an agreement is, accordingly, left on a voluntary basis.</P>
    <P>The provisions of Part VI of the Bill call, I think, for little comment.  They are almost all, subject to relatively minor modifications, re-enactments of the provisions of the Act of 1948.  Section 69, however, is new.  This relates to a peculiar situation that arose in Cork City.  The servants of all the county boroughs, except Cork, had statutory superannuation schemes and in Cork City a sort of superannuation scheme had grown up in practice.  The general idea under the Act of 1948 was to exempt from the contribution to be paid under that Act any person who had a superannuation scheme free of contributions before that Act came into <Col N="1674" /> operation.  It was provided in the transitional provision (Section 63 of the Act of 1948) that where a person's name was entered in a register of permanent employees when Part III of the Act of 1948 was adopted he would be exempt from contributions.  It so happened that no such register was maintained in Cork and accordingly the servants of the Cork Corporation became liable for contributions under the Act.  The representatives of the workers concerned took the issue to court and it was eventually decided against them by the Supreme Court. It was not the intention under the Act that these servants should pay contributions and they are accordingly exempted from this liability under paragraph (c) of sub-section (5) of Section 48 of the Bill.  These contributions have, however, been collected since 1948 from these servants and the problem arises of returning them to them.  The total amount involved is very considerable and Section 69 proposes to deal with the problem by arranging that servants who have retired before the passing of the Bill will have any contributions that they paid returned to them at once, and servants still in employment following the passing of the Bill will have the contributions returned to them when they come to draw a benefit under the Bill.  In this way the men concerned will get their money back, but the incidence of the repayment will be staggered so that its effect on the ratepayers will be mitigated.</P>
    <P>So much for the provisions of the Bill.  I think I should say a few words about a provision that is not in the Bill.  I refer to the question of existing pensioners of local authorities.  I am well aware of the representations that have been made for giving these pensioners compensation for changes in the value of money.  I know that in the Act of 1948 (Section 79) some provision of this kind was made for certain pensioners.  However, this is not a question that can be considered in isolation.  Just two-thirds of the Ministers in the Government have direct concern with the superannuation of staffs.  Quite obviously if any change is to be made that will have to be extended <Col N="1675" /> to all of these pensioners generally the change itself must be general. I have on a number of occasions told Deputies who have raised the matter by way of parliamentary question that I was having the whole question examined. I did have the matter examined very carefully indeed with a view to seeing whether it was practicable for me to deal with this question in isolation.  I was conscious of the fact that the Act of 1948 did deal with it to some extent; but the position is that that Act only applied, to some pensioners, a concession that had already been generally approved of for some civil service pensioners in the Superannuation Act, 1947.  The Minister for Finance has already said that he will consider the whole question&mdash; the Exchequer is, of course, mainly involved&mdash;in connection with next year's Budget.  It is not practicable for me, therefore, to include any proposal in this Bill in advance of that consideration. In 1950 when, under the Pensions (Increase) Act of that year pension increases were given generally a comprehensive Bill, dealing with all kinds of pensioners, was introduced.  In the circumstances it would be quite impracticable for me to deal with local pensioners in isolation in this particular Bill.</P>
    <P>I have on previous occasions told the Dáil that I personally believed that Bills should avoid the device of legislation by reference wherever that is possible.  This is what we have tried to do in the present Bill.  So far as is possible with a single Bill, it stands on its own feet, and can be read with only the minimum reference to other legislation.  However, it is not possible to produce a Bill in a complete vacuum and although strenuous efforts have been made to produce a single comprehensive Bill dealing with the superannuation of officers and servants of local authorities a certain minimum degree of reference to other legislation has been absolutely unavoidable.</P>
    <P>The fact that the Bill is self-contained to a very great extent does not, however, mean that it is necessarily clear and simple in all respects. Superannuation is a complex question, <Col N="1676" /> and it is not possible to deal with such a subject as simply as would be possible were the problems more straightforward. Moreover, the separate parts of the Bill are composed of sections that are very largely interdependent and must be read together, and there is a large degree of interdependence between a number of the parts themselves. Thus the Bill, notwithstanding the efforts that have been made to keep it lucid, is by no means a simple measure.  I have tried, in the explanatory memorandum I have had circulated with the Bill, to have most of the detailed points explained as clearly as possible, but if any obscurity still exists no doubt it can be resolved in the debate.</P>

The new proposal is that the calculation of the quantity of wheat milled shall be on the basis of total output of flour and wheatenmeal and other products, including wheat offals. This arrangement overcomes the difficulty of fixing a relationship between artificially dried wheat and green wheat.  If the proposed amendment is accepted the question of the fixing of a relationship between artificially dried wheat and green wheat for the purpose of millers' records would arise only in respect of calculations associated with the Purchase Percentage Orders made under Section 10 of the Agricultural Produce (Cereals) Act, 1935, as amended by Section 14 of the Agricultural Produce (Cereals) Act, 1936.</P>
      <P>It is accordingly proposed to dispense with Section 4 of the Bill and to repeal Section 14 (2) of the Agricultural Produce (Cereals) Act, 1936, which restricts the manner in which calculations may be made in connection with the Purchase Percentage Orders to actual purchases of wheat. If the amendment is accepted it will be open to the Minister for Agriculture to take account of the relationship between artificially dried wheat and green wheat in calculating millers' compliance with the Purchase Percentage Orders.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Final Stage, there is a matter which I would like to raise which may not arise under the Bill at all.  The Minister may remember that yesterday I put down a question asking the Minister for Industry and Commerce for details regarding the amount of subsidy payable to farmers on wheat so that the price of flour and bread to the consumer would be reduced.  While I think I heard the Minister for Agriculture give an estimated figure about a year ago which was much greater than the one the Minister for Industry and Commerce had, I think it is time that the matter was cleared up once and for all.  The <Col N="1681" /> Minister for Industry and Commerce has sufficient machinery at his disposal to do this&mdash;in fact, I am sure every day of the week a calculation is made of the cost of drying, transporting and storing wheat and there should be no serious difficulty about that.</P>
      <P>I raise the matter on this Bill because it is not entirely out of order and it will not delay the Minister very long and because a deliberate campaign is being carried on to suggest that the total subsidy is going into the pockets of the farmers.  Something must be done to get a figure that cannot be challenged as to what portion of the subsidy may be going to the farmers and what portion is going to reduce the price of bread.  I think it is only fair to the farming community and to the wheat growers that an authoritative figure should be given so as to prevent this campaign from succeeding. It is being used in different directions.  Those who are opposed to growing wheat in this country&mdash;I suppose they are not all inside the House &mdash;are waging that campaign and deliberately misrepresenting what is the true position.  I hope the Minister will turn to his officials and get a calculation made that we can stand over, whether it be for or against the farmer. But, in any case, the farmers should not be charged with getting a subsidy they are not, in fact, getting.  The rest of the communuity see it from that aspect and I think it is most unfair to the agricultural community that that should be so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be of assistance to Deputy Allen if I take this occasion to say here and now that far the greater part of the subsidy payable on flour at the present time is payable for the benefit of consumers of bread as part of this Government's policy of trying, in so far as its resources permit, to keep down the cost of living by subsidising essential articles of food which the majority of our people must consume.  That is one fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a well-known fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The second fact is this. It is hard to determine with precision an accurate basis of comparison which would enable anybody precisely to determine the element of subsidy paid on home-grown wheat as compared with wheat of similar quality obtainable elsewhere, but I think it is fair to say that the element of subsidy received by the growers of home-grown wheat may be fairly computed to lie between 13/- and 15/- per barrel.  I would not care to go closer to it than that, but I believe that that spread would cover the highest and the lowest reliable estimate that has been made of the subsidy element in the prices for home-grown wheat.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
