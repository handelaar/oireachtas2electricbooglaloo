      <P>I was speaking on the Adjournment last night and I think I have covered the main objections to the series of amendments which were moved by Deputy Dockrell and the only thing necessary to do now is to underline the fact that the safety committee is a piece of mechanism which commended itself to the Special Committee. In my view, it is a reasonable piece of mechanism that properly worked should operate to the advantage of not only the factory owners but also to the advantage of the staffs employed in factories and which will tend to create health and safety consciousness to the benefit of the factory owner.  If it is possible, as I think it is, to inculcate into the safety committee a feeling that their main task is to work for the well-being and the health and safety of the staffs a very useful medium will be created which must in the course of time redound to the benefit of the production activities of a particular factory.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>If nobody else wishes to speak on the matter, I would like to say that I appreciate the attitude of the Minister and the spirit in which this amendment is put forward and undoubtedly, if this new provision is worked by all parties in the spirit in which the Minister hopes it will be, well then it will help to contribute to the safety of workers in a factory.  But what I am nervous about and what caused Deputy Belton and myself to put down these amendments which are really only tentative is that we feel that the occupier has a great deal to do with the safety.  He has to provide the safety devices, and he has to bear a large share of the burden if an accident occurs.</P>
      <P>Of course, a man or woman working a machine has to bear the physical burden of an accident, but on the other side the occupier has to bear the financial burden, and the responsibility for that.  It seems to us that this committee is very lopsided in that way, and that there could be more cooperation put into this section so that it would be to the ultimate benefit and the smoother running of a factory, and to the safety and health of those concerned with it.</P>
      <P>Take, for instance, under sub-section (g), where in the ministerial amendment it says:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1168" />&ldquo;An inspector shall be entitled, should he so wish, to have the safety delegate accompany him on his tour of inspection of the factory or any part of such tour.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I would like to be certain that it does not prevent, in any way, the occupier or his representative being present when such a tour takes place, because it would certainly lead to a great deal of circumlocution if recommendations made during such tour only reached the occupier from the committee.  I think it would be better if all three parties, namely, the occupier, the safety delegate and the inspector, went round together.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I need not give, in this Bill, an employer the right to go round with the inspector; he already has that right.  It is his factory and he can go round it.  He can go with the safety delegate and the inspector if he so wishes.  I would have to introduce a Bill to prevent the employer from doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceEDockrell" hpid="Mr. M.E. Dockrell Mr. M.E. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied as long as there is no idea that he should not be represented on it, because that would only lead to a very foolish situation.  I would like the Minister to look into this further, and perhaps recommit the section in the light of the amendment.  The effect of one of the amendments we have moved is that the safety committee or safety delegate should inform the occupier and the inspector of any failure of which they become aware.  I think the Minister thought that it might look as if it were turning the committee into something which would be telling on their fellow workers.  That is not the idea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy look at sub-section (a) in my amendment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceEDockrell" hpid="Mr. M.E. Dockrell Mr. M.E. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>In other words, it is the job of the safety committee to endeavour to secure compliance, by the occupier and by the workers, with the provisions of the Act, and of the Orders and regulations made under the Act.  This particular section is the <Col N="1169" /> exact point of principle on which we compromised with the Special Committee. That puts the responsibility for compliance on the employer and the workers, and no less on the one than on the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceEDockrell" hpid="Mr. M.E. Dockrell Mr. M.E. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see the Minister's point.  That is where there is compliance with an existing regulation, but the idea underlying the amendment in the names of Deputy Belton and myself is to make sure that a new regulation in the factory will be made.  The Minister is securing compliance, and that seems to lead one to think that it is securing compliance with an existing regulation.  The other is where, in the opinion of the safety committee and the delegate, they will press forward with ideas for safety and health, and will inform the occupier at the same time.  Is the Minister prepared to accept&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that they all run counter to this amendment which I have introduced as a result of detailed discussions at the Special Committee.  If the Deputy looks at the amendment he will see clearly that it is aimed at making the safety committee nothing more than a body for ascertaining the transgressions of the workers, and reporting these to the occupier or the inspector. I think it is all conceived in a one-sided way.  My amendment has balance; it gives the safety committee functions to ensure compliance by the workers and by the employer.  As I say, sub-section (a) of my amendment, which, by the way, the Deputy wants to delete, sets out precisely that balance.  I think it is a basically different approach.  Either you take the approach in the final amendment here or, by putting these whole series of amendments which give this safety committee quite a different line of functions, approach the whole problem from an angle which I think is rather one-sided.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's explanation.  Some people have felt that the exact opposite might be sought in the ministerial amendments. I think it does depend <Col N="1170" /> entirely on the spirit in which this committee works.  If it is found out in practice that the committee has a tendency to become concerned with petty details which are not really of sufficient importance to warrant the time and trouble of the people concerned, I would ask the Minister to look into the matter with a view to amending such committee, and constitute it so that it would work to the benefit of the employees concerned, and to the benefit of the occupier of the factory in the smooth running of the safety regulations, which would be really maintained and used to the fullest extent by the occupier and employees.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>If the committee turns out to be a nagging, knocking committee, if I may so describe it, and more a source of irritation than of the promotion of better health and safety, the employer need not participate in its functions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as the employer is concerned, he can put man for man on the committee with the workers, if he wants to do it.  I explained last night that I do not think it desirable to have this thing contested on the basis of a football match, with one man marking another.  I think it better that there should be the impact of reason on reason.  Nothing would be decided here by heads.  The whole success of this depends on the spirit behind it. If the committee is a nagging committee, the employer need not participate, and in that case the committee will still function, but no more than if it were a branch of a trade union which, when the inspector called, would complain to the inspector.  A committee of that kind, if it turns out to <Col N="1171" /> be such a committee, is worthless from the point of view I have in mind.  I want a committee which will be a co-operative committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 18:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 55, to insert the following paragraph before paragraph (b) of sub-section (1) of Section 84:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(b)  the provisions of Part II with respect to sanitary conveniences, to such extent as may be specified, and subject to such adaptations and modifications as may be made, by regulations of the Minister.</P>
      <P>The effect of this amendment is to give power to provide by regulations for the application to docks of the sanitary conveniences provision of Section 16. I undertook in the Special Committee to provide for such power.  As I explained to the Special Committee, it is not possible to make a straight application of this to docks because of the many different interests concerned in the operation of facilities at docks. For example, there is the port authority, the local authority and there are also the ship owners concerned, and that is why in framing the amendment reference has been made to applying Section 16 with such adaptations and modifications as may be necessary in order to make the arrangement work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 20:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 56, to add the following sub-section to Section 85:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(4)  Such of the provisions of this Act as require general registers to be kept and copies of the prescribed abstract of this Act and of special regulations or the prescribed extract of such regulations to be kept posted up on the premises shall be deemed to be complied with as respects work carried out in a harbour or wet dock, to which this section applies, if the general register is kept at an office of the person undertaking the work and copies of the abstract of this Act and of the regulations or abstract thereof are kept posted up at each office yard or shop of the person undertaking the work at which persons employed by him on the work attend and in a position where they can easily be read by such persons.</P>
      <P>I am not quite clear why a provision of this kind was not considered necessary in Section 85 which deals with the repairing of ships in harbours or wet docks.  The following sections which deal with building operations provide that the posting of the abstract of the Act and regulations may be done at the office of the builder, or in some place normally frequented by the workers, instead of on the actual building operations, and it would seem to me to be necessary to have some similar provision in relation to the type of work contemplated in Section 85. Surely it would be more convenient to have the abstract posted in the office of the employer, or in some place normally frequented by the workers, than on the ship itself, as the Bill appears to require at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a rather complicated arrangement, but the position, as I understand it, from having examined the provisions of the Bill, is that the amendment speaks of the place where the person operating ships in the harbour or wet dock should keep the register, the prescribed abstract of the Act or copies of the regulations or prescribed extract of such regulations. Section 85 does not prescribe any obligation, <Col N="1173" /> save in respect of the keeping of a general register.  It does not require the other documents referred to to be kept.  It refers only to the keeping of the general register.  As the obligations imposed in paragraph (g) sub-section (1) of Section 85 relate only to the keeping of the general register, the amendment is really not necessary, because Section 120, which refers to the keeping of the general register, provides that the register may be kept at a place outside the factory with the approval of an inspector.  Possibly the Deputy was not aware of that when drafting the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 21:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 57, to insert the following paragraph before paragraph (g) of sub-section (1) of Section 86:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(g) the provisions of Part VII, subject to such adaptations and modifications as may be made by regulations of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was agreed in the Special Committee that Part VII of the Bill, which relates to the medical examination of young persons, should be applied to building operations and this amendment gives effect to the agreement then made.  It provides that the obligation shall be subject to such adaptations and modifications as may be made by regulations.  It may be necessary in the regulations, for example, to make provision for giving continuing effect to a doctor's certificate in respect of a boy who may change frequently from one builder to another, instead of requiring him to be certificated every time he gets a <Col N="1174" /> fresh job with another builder.  In factories proper, of course, a new certificate must be obtained at any time a young person changes his employment. This is something which was agreed on at the committee and the amendment gives effect to the agreement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has said that &ldquo;it may be necessary to make these regulations so as to obviate the necessity for a new medical certificate every time a young person changes his employer.&rdquo;  I think the Minister should say that that is what the regulations will provide for and should say definitely that it will not under any circumstances be necessary for a boy to be medically examined every time he changes his employer within the year.  The objection to this suggestion that Part VII should apply to young persons employed in building operations is the fact that the young person may change his employment frequently during the year, and, as the Bill stands, he would have to be medically examined and certificated every time he entered a new employment. The Minister said it may be necessary to make these regulations in such a way as to avoid that necessity.  I think he should say definitely &ldquo;will&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 22:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 57, to add the following sub-section to Section 86:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(4)  Any persons undertaking any building operations to which this Act applies shall, not later than seven days after the beginning thereof, serve on the Minister a written notice stating the name and postal address of the person so undertaking the operations, the <Col N="1175" /> place and nature of the operations, and whether any mechanical power is or is to be used and, if so, its nature, but&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  this sub-section shall not apply to any operations which the person undertaking them has reasonable grounds for believing will be completed in a period of less than six weeks, and</P>
    <P>(b)  where a person undertakes any building operations in a place where such operations are in progress, he shall not be required to give such a notice as aforesaid if a notice was given in respect of the operations in progress.</P>
    <P>This amendment deals with a matter which was the subject of some discussion in the Special Committee.  It was agreed there that notice of the commencement of substantial building operations should be served.  The amendment which I have tabled provides for notice to be given of any operation which takes longer than six weeks to complete.  Considerable difficulties arise in trying to define what is a substantial building operation.  I did consider suggesting that it might be in reference to the amount of equipment on the site but this is such a very variable factor during building operations that I did not think it would serve our purpose.  Neither would a long-time factor because a relatively dangerous repair job might not take too long to complete but it is, nevertheless, the type of operation which the inspector would like to visit.  I suggest that the six-week measure which is provided for in the amendment is probably the best compromise in all the circumstances.</P>

    <P>With regard to the suggestion at the end of the Minister's statement, I suppose it is necessary notwithstanding the practical difficulties involved in requiring notification in regard to the <Col N="1176" /> commencement of building operations. Now that the Factories Acts have been extended to building operations, we do not want to impose unnecessarily upon the public the obligation of filling in and posting to Government Departments statutory forms.  There is a number of building operations of a small type never likely to be inspected by a factory inspector or to be subject of ministerial concern under this legislation. The Minister recognises that, by proposing that the obligation to notify the commencement of operations will not operate except the operations are themselves reasonably expected to continue for about six weeks, or rather that the operations will not be completed within a period of six weeks. There is another special phraseology which, perhaps, directs attention to the need for the further amendment I suggest.</P>
    <P>I think it is necessary to have the other provision also, that is, the number of workers employed.  As it stands, it seems to me that if a farmer decides to employ men during the winter to do some work on his outbuildings, as opportunity offers, even though the work may take six weeks to complete he would still have to notify the commencement of building operations.  Even a private householder employing a man to do spare-time work in the building of a garage or in the repairing of his house would have to notify the Department if the work was not expected to be completed within six weeks.  The phraseology in the Minister's amendment is not that the building operations would reasonably take six weeks to complete.  It is that it is not expected that they will be completed in six weeks.</P>
    <P>My suggestion is&mdash;I do not think it is the perfect answer but it is part of the answer&mdash;that this obligation to notify the commencement of building operations should only apply if at least six workers are employed.  We should exclude all types of work on farms and in parts of the country where the knowledge of the obligation to send in the statutory form will not exist and where people will be breaking the law every day.  It is undesirable to have a law of that kind.  It is not likely <Col N="1177" /> that these minor operations will ever be inspected.</P>

      <P>On the last occasion, I suggested to the Minister that it would be far more profitable if he reexamined the possibility of the transatlantic airlines in view of the circumstances which exist to-day.  I would like to point out to the Minister that we appear to be the only country in Europe at the present time which is not taking the necessary steps to engage in the transatlantic airline service.  We have Belgian airlines, Sabena, and the Dutch K.L.M.  We have Italian airlines, Swissair, Air France and now even Germany are about to embark on what appears to be a very profitable engagement.  I would ask the Minister to bear it in mind.  He may still think that there is no future in the project, but I would suggest to him that no great harm could be done by having the matter re-examined.  I feel that the tendency nowadays is towards air travel as against travel by sea, so I would appeal to the Minister to take the necessary steps to present this House with a report on the feasibility of such a project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the last occasion I also mentioned the question of the oil refinery.  I was reading again this morning the Minister's speech on this Estimate.  He stated there was a possibility that aviation spirit may not be catered for. Taking everything into consideration, I would request the Minister to make <Col N="1181" /> representations to the companies who propose to erect the refinery to bear in mind the necessity for the production of aviation spirit.  I notice in one of the technical journals which dealt in detail with the setting up in England of the oil refinery there, that ample aviation spirits are available for the needs of Britain.  It would be a great thing for this country, because if in a time of war the shipping space were curtailed there is every possibility that necessary supplies could be brought in by air.</P>
    <P>I also mentioned the question of the cement factories in Drogheda and Limerick and I was very pleased to hear that they are now going into the export trade.  From what I understand, unless further extensions take place in Limerick and Drogheda the export market will be limited.  Therefore, I would ask the Minister to request Cement, Limited to furnish him with a report as to the steps which would have to be taken in order that the full requirements of this very great export market may be catered for.  It appears that the cement which is manufactured in this country far exceeds in quality for some reason or other any comparable cement manufactured elsewhere.  It is certainly a superior cement to the British Portland cement, which is a very major industry in Britain to-day.  I foresee a great future in the export end of the cement industry, but until such time as further extensions take place in the two existing factories, Drogheda and Limerick, this export will be very limited.  The reason I urged the Minister to put special inquiries afoot is that these extension plans and proposals would take some considerable time, possibly some years.</P>
    <P>It has recently been announced in the Press that some new bacon factories are proposed.  Whether that is a matter for the Minister for Agriculture or the Minister for Industry and Commerce I am not sure, but I would say to the Minister that he should think very seriously before any further licences are issued in this country, anywhere, for new bacon factories.  He should consider the position of the workers employed in the <Col N="1182" /> existing factories.  Those workers have had hard times from time to time and if now the output of those factories has increased considerably it does not necessarily mean that that happy position will obtain for a long period. We can only hope it will.  The Minister might be perfectly right in erecting extra bacon factories throughout the country, I do not know; I simply suggest to him that he should take the long-term view and ensure that the workers in the existing factories are protected.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned recently the number of proposals which were before his Department in connection with proposed new industries in the country generally.  That was very encouraging, but I know of no new industry&mdash;unless the Minister can set our mind at ease &mdash;with regard to Limerick City.  The employment position is far from satisfactory there, the rates are 41/- in the £, and&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to prevent the Deputy from demonstrating to his constituents that he has their interests deeply at heart by reason of these questions; but I have no statutory functions to locate factories at Limerick, to warrant that the Deputy should go up one side of the coast and down the other side and ask why I was not locating them in these places. I have no statutory functions in that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>In this connection, a Cheann Comhairle, I was going to suggest something to the Minister.  First of all, he says he has no statutory functions.  I agree, but there are certain proposals by the State from time to time.  Take, for instance, the proposed nitrogenous fertiliser factory; the State has interested itself in that and the Shannonbridge area was mentioned. While I agree that the Minister has no power where a private concern is functioning or proposes to erect a factory and that he can only make suggestions in such cases, I say that he could use a very powerful weapon in the Trade Loans Guarantee Act where that is availed of.  If the Minister has no function, is it not about <Col N="1183" /> time he took upon himself some powers in order to solve the question&mdash; which all Parties are agreed on&mdash;of decentralisation?</P>
      <P>On the question of these new industries, I feel that the man who is neglected in this country to-day is the small man and that the industries which are getting all the breaks are those requiring very substantial capital.  I call a sum of £50,000 to £100,000 a very substantial amount of capital.  The smaller man who might require £5,000 or maybe even only £2,500 to £3,000 for the extension of his existing building has not been catered for by any Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Why does the Deputy say he has not been catered for?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Because he has not been.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>He can apply for a trade loan just the same as the bigger man.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask Deputies to refer to the particulars of trade loans which have been issued.  They will see that the small man of whom I speak&mdash;the £2,500 to £3,000 mark man &mdash;forms only a very small percentage of the total and that most of the trade loans are, indeed, very substantial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On several occasions in this House, both as an Opposition Deputy and as Minister, the Minister has said that one of the drawbacks to the proper development of industry is lack of capital.  Surely, as in other countries, an easier method of obtaining a loan by a small man&mdash;particularly in the smaller cities and towns&mdash;could be encouraged.  I agree with the Minister that a resolution passed by people such as the Limerick Corporation or other urban district councils, or such bodies, can carry very little weight.  Quite a large section of our community appear to think that if they send up a deputation to the Minister for Industry and Commerce or pass a resolution to the effect that a factory is required in such and such a place the Minister has all the necessary powers in that connection. <Col N="1184" /> The time has now arrived when they are beginning to realise that the onus is on themselves to do the ground work locally.  I think they also realise that, in certain specific cases, capital is not the drawback, even if the project should require a substantial amount, so long as the officials in the Department of Industry and Commerce and the people who give the trade loans guarantee are satisfied that the project would have a reasonable chance of success.</P>
    <P>In this connection, I might say that one of the most successful possibilities in cities and towns is an industrial development association.  We have had such associations in the past.  I am not generalising now, but the difficulty in this country to-day is that a certain percentage of people who have money often think of themselves only and classify themselves as merchant princes and they are nothing but a burden on the community as a whole.  It would appear that the future industrial development of the country can be achieved only by closer relations between the Department of Industry and Commerce and these industrial development associations in cities and towns.</P>
    <P>Under the Tourist Act the Minister is empowered to make a grant to a company setting itself up for local tourist development of, I think, a sum up to a maximum of £200.  In my view, if the Minister would consider such a step with regard to local industrial development associations he would be going very far towards advancing our industrial position.  The initial expenses of such an industrial development body are high and, as I say, the people who should interest themselves in the development of their city or locality are the last to do so.  In fact, if the truth were known, some of these gentlemen have a very small percentage of the capital they earned in this country invested here: a large amount is invested far away from these shores. However, that is a horse of a different colour.</P>
    <P>In his speech, the Minister said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We must rely to a large extent on industrial progress to help to <Col N="1185" /> reduce the amount of unemployment in the country.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In 1951, the figure in the census of production in industry and services was 226,000.  In 1954, that figure rose to 228,000.  The index figure for the volume of production in industry in relation to transportable goods was 174 in 1951 and it rose to 192 in 1954. That shows that, no matter how slowly the rate may be, we are progressing.</P>
    <P>I think also that there should be some correlation between the Department of Industry and Commerce, the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Finance.  No doubt there is that correlation when the Budget comes to be framed or when a Minister seeks further moneys, and so forth.  It has been stated from all sides of this House for many years that agriculture is the backbone of our economy and there is a growing tendency throughout the country to-day for the urban dweller to realise that, ultimately, his lot depends on the happy lot of our farmers.</P>
    <P>Hitherto there was a movement which set up the city dweller as against the rural dweller.  Possibly as a result of enlightened articles in the newspapers with less of a political taint and possibly through Macra na Feirme and a general revival movement which, I feel, is taking place amongst our younger people to-day, the stage has now been reached when these closer ties I speak of between the Department of Industry and Commerce, the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Finance should take place.</P>
    <P>Most of the matters discussed in this House deal with large projects such as oil refineries, airlines and so on.  I do not think there is a Deputy on either side of the House who will deny that the smaller town or village&mdash;in each of our constituencies we can point to three or four&mdash;could do with a small industry based on agriculture.  I do not see the point in setting up industries for the sake of setting them up, but the matter could be studied in a far more serious light and in a more detailed manner.</P>
    <P>The whole matter is covered in detail in the Report on the Commission on <Col N="1186" /> Emigration.  The time is not opportune to go into details but, not alone would the Minister be catering for these small towns, but he would be taking a great deal of weight off the officials in his Department if he did what I suggest, namely, make facilities available to the local industrial development association in the same way as has been done under the Tourist Act whereby the board is empowered to grant up to a maximum of £200 to cover the formation of the company&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I was dealing the last day with the proposed line to join the cement factory to the railway in Limerick and I mentioned the necessity for an overhead bridge.  I neglected to mention the most important aspect of the matter.  The Minister is, no doubt, aware that a grant has been given by his Department of £400,000 for the development of the Port of Limerick.  For some extraordinary reason, down through the years, the Port of Limerick has never been joined to the railway station. That has been to the detriment of the city and surrounding area.  I would point out to the Minister that an opportunity has arisen to connect the harbour to the railway in the construction of the link line from the cement factory to the railway station. I mention it for the Minister's consideration because C.I.E. are interested only in their own section of the work, namely, to get the cement into the railway station.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the harbour board do not evince sufficient interest&mdash;and apparently there are some gentlemen on that body who are more concerned with trivial matters in the City of Limerick than with the industrial development of the city&mdash;in this link line and the possibility of having a connection <Col N="1187" /> between the harbour and the railway, I appeal to the Minister to take the necessary steps to see that the opportunity is availed of.</P>
    <P>There is only a single line proposed at present between the cement factory and the railway station.  This line is a couple of hundred yards from the regional hospital and we hear quite a lot of protests from the local residents about the noise the trains will make, that it will keep them awake at night and all that kind of thing.  That can be easily got over. The present proposal is to run two trains at about 2 a.m.  That may be all right.  If the harbour is joined to the railway station a double line will be necessary and C.I.E. should take cognisance of the fact that there is a possibility that an application may come from the harbour board to have the harbour joined to the railway station via this link line.  If, under the application made under Section 14 of the 1950 Transport Act, C.I.E. construct this single line, a great deal of money will be wasted if at some future date, in one year or five years, the harbour board decide to carry out their responsibility and to have the harbour connected with the railhead. It is necessary that the Minister should step in at this stage because C.I.E. are only concerned with their own end of the work.</P>
    <P>The Minister might find in the records of his Department that on a previous occasion, when my Party were in power, it was intimated to the harbour commissioners in Limerick that the then Minister for Industry and Commerce would be prepared to consider a grant for the cost of this work.  Therefore, if the commissioners are not evincing any interest, I would appeal to the Minister to communicate with them again, ask them what their intentions are and then, if they are not facing up to their obligations, the Minister has the necessary powers to do something about it.</P>
    <P>We did not get any news about the dredger down there yet about which we came up three or four months ago. I hope the Minister will expedite the <Col N="1188" /> matter.  That is of interest to Sligo also.  I do not know the cause of all the delay.  Perhaps the Minister will set our minds at ease.  I put down parliamentary questions in connection with this matter.  The first time I got a reply that the Minister was not yet prepared to give his decision.  In reply to further questions I was told I would not get an answer because I was already answered.  I would like the Minister to give an answer now.</P>
    <P>These may appear to be parish pump politics and parochial matters to discuss in the National Assembly but, while some of the gentlemen in Limerick will not carry out their duties as they should, something will have to be done about it: it will have to be mentioned here.  As a matter of fact the people I speak about are doing more damage to my native city by the statements they are making in the public Press&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Despite the criticisms that have come from the Opposition Benches, I think the Minister gave a very full and fair statement when introducing his Estimate.  He did, in fact, cover everything it was conceivably possible to cover.  It is quite reasonable that Deputies opposite should state their opinion in relation to industry, but I think some of the criticisms levelled from the Opposition Benches, touching on this matter and that, are quite unjustifiable.  The Minister in fact gave as full a statement as it was possible for any Minister to give.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all concerned with industry, and I think we have certain advantages here in the setting up of industries as compared with industries across the water in that we have a lower rate of taxation and a greater employment potential.  We are all <Col N="1189" /> anxious that as many industries as possible should be established so that we may be in a position to produce all our own industrial ingredients for domestic consumption.  One thing militating against the establishment of industries here is the rate of relief allowable for depreciation of industrial equipment. The allowances granted here are not as big as the allowances granted in corresponding industries across the water.  That may not be a matter entirely within the Minister's own power; probably his colleague, the Minister for Finance, is also concerned.</P>
    <P>In this more or less supersonic and atomic age there are rapid improvements in machinery and the apparatus necessary for manufacturing goods; so much so, that highly industrialised countries such as the United States of America, with their modern equipment, are able to produce and market goods for consumption here much cheaper than we ourselves can produce those goods.  The only way in which we can bring ourselves into a parallel position here, I suggest, is by the relief given for depreciation of machinery and equipment.</P>
    <P>It is well known that up-to-date production in industry depends on up-to-date machinery and it has been put to me by factory proprietors in my own constituency, and elsewhere throughout the country, that they would be able to produce goods at a more economic rate and replace their out-of-date machinery more frequently if they were given better facilities.</P>
    <P>The other point I would like to stress with regard to industry, and here I am pushing an open door, is that there should be a certain amount of decentralisation in so far as that is possible. Very often such decentralisation is difficult because it is only natural that industrialists should want to get as close as possible to Dublin and the bigger centres of population since such a situation is more economic in the long run from the point of view of transport and so forth.  However, I would like to stress the other angle. Labour facilities exist in the country and it is better for the economy of the country as a whole that these industries <Col N="1190" /> should be established in different areas throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Transport is a very vexed and difficult question inasmuch as C.I.E. has found itself more or less in a state of semi-insolvency over the past few years and, for the purpose of maintaining it in existence, it has been the policy of successive Governments to give that company all the available transport facilities.  We are glad to note that conditions are improving and that C.I.E. in the forseeable future will strike, we hope, an even balance.  Possibly that position has been brought about by the dieselisation of the railways. But the heaviest loss has been sustained on railway traffic as a whole.</P>
    <P>I have always felt that much of our difficulty here, not only from the point of view of passenger traffic but also from the point of view of goods traffic, on the railway has been due to the fact that C.I.E. are running two sets of transport in opposition to each other.  In the main we have the buses travelling parallel with our trains and scheduled at the same time.  A good deal could be done to help the railways from the point of view of passenger traffic if better and more frequent bus services were run from areas that have no railway traffic.  It is a curious thing that it is very hard to get a bus from an outlying district that has no railway connection to bring one to a railway.  It is much harder to get a bus for that purpose than it is to get a bus which will transport one parallel with the existing railway service.  I think the Minister might be able to bring it home to C.I.E. that this situation is worthy of examination.</P>
    <P>The same is true of transport generally. It is very often difficult to get transport in certain areas where people are limited by the transport regulations.  Where C.I.E. lorries are not always available to transport goods it is very often difficult to find alternative transport.  I asked the Minister a question some time ago about merchandise licences.  The purpose of the question was really to ask the Minister if it was possible to bring into alignment here similar facilities to those which exist in other countries <Col N="1191" /> for the transport of agricultural goods.</P>
    <P>We are, as every one realises, an agricultural country.  Agriculture is our main industry.  Years ago, in the days of horse traffic, it was quite usual for farmers and labourers to help each other in relation to transport facilities. Now that we have mechanised transport, it is very often difficult for farmers to transport goods, or to help each other; indeed, they are precluded by the Transport Act from doing so.</P>
    <P>I want to put one or two hypothetical cases before the Minister to illustrate my point.  It was, in other days, quite usual for people to transport manure for each other in a friendly way and without any charge. That was done by horse traffic.  If you take two farmers alongside one another, one having a tractor and the other having no form of mechanical transport, and if the man with the mechanical equipment wants to do two or three days' work for the other, he is precluded from doing so unless he does it for nothing.  He has, in other words, to be a philanthropist.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit the Minister could issue licences under existing legislation, so that no new legislation is necessary.  The Minister might, by licence, allow people to haul agricultural produce for their neighbours.  If these people have a licence they will be able to charge the neighbour but they are precluded at the moment because of lack of a licence to do so. The Minister should create a parallel state of affairs to that which exists in other countries.  I shall take another instance.  There are several farmers who wish to sell a load of turnips. Say a farmer wishes to send a load of turnips to the Dublin market.  Under <Col N="1192" /> the present regulations he is precluded from doing that if he has not got a licence.  If he wants to send a lorry load of turnips, and he wants to get his neighbour to take them there for him, he is precluded and he has to go to all the trouble of arranging with C.I.E. to provide a lorry.</P>
      <P>I know it is a complicated problem and I know that the Minister has inherited the difficulty from his predecessor, but I do not think it requires any legislation to solve it.  I think it is just a question that could be solved if the Minister, or whoever is responsible, would decide to issue these licences to farmers in certain cases for the purpose of transporting for a neighbour agricultural produce.  I think the issue of such licences would ease the difficult problem that exists with regard to the transport of agricultural produce.</P>
      <P>I should also like to refer to tourism, I think Bord Fáilte are doing very good work, but I fear that trouble exists because a lot of people do not appreciate the number of facilities that are available to them from Bord Fáilte.  Quite a lot of local tourist associations throughout the country&mdash; and I attended a meeting of one of them in my own constituency quite recently&mdash;do not know of these facilities which are available, facilities such as the setting up of companies.  They do not know that the board can come to their assistance in these matters.</P>
      <P>I believe that in such cases Bord Fáilte will not only guarantee an overdraft, but that in their generosity they will even go so far as paying the interest on the overdraft provided, of course, that any local tourist development association is providing something which in the long run will be of remunerative benefit to the district. The Minister should indicate these facts to Bord Fáilte so that they would be made known more widely to the public as a whole because it has been my experience that people do not know these things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another thing I should like to point out in relation to tourist business is that there are grants available in certain cases for hotel owners who do up <Col N="1193" /> their premises.  I understand that scheme has been in existence for a couple of years, but I also know that there are certain regulations which must be complied with.  One of these is that in the event of a hotel being owned by a board of directors or a company, in order that it might qualify for the grant the Minister has the right to appoint a director and to nominate the fees that such a director must be paid.  It has been represented to me that there has been a good deal of objection to this and the proof of that is that so few of these grants have been sought.</P>
    <P>I think that the percentage is so very small because hotel companies, who would otherwise look for the grants, object to the director being foisted on them by the Minister and they do not like the situation where the Minister, having nominated the director, also has the function of nominating the fees payable to that director.  They do not like that the private affairs of a private company should be made known to the Department.  I think that is very reasonable.  I think there should be a change in some way so that it would not be necessary to have a director foisted on to a private company and I think a good many more of these grants would be utilised if such a change were made.  I think it would be to the benefit of tourism in the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>I now want to say a few words about the factories in my own constituency. Every Deputy is entitled to bring to the notice of the House the troubles of his own constituency, and I should like to say something about conditions in the principal town in my constituency in Wexford.  There we have two factories which manufacture agricultural machinery and, as everybody knows, they are very important factories.  They work without any protective tariffs whatsoever.  Neither are they protected by any quota restrictions, and they are exporting as well as producing machinery for the home market.  They have to buy their raw materials&mdash;they are forced to do so&mdash; from Irish Steel Holders.  They have to pay a great deal more for their raw materials than the other firms with <Col N="1194" /> which they compete in the export market.</P>
    <P>The Cork Deputies may have something to say on this, but Irish Steel Holders supply materials to the factories that are protected as well as to these two factories which are unprotected. I say that two important factories like these, producing farm machinery for export on a free market, are entitled to buy their raw materials where they want and at a cheaper rate. Were they in a position to do that they could vastly increase their manpower. At the moment they employ a good many men, but they could step up their production by from 25 to 50 per cent. and, as I said, increase their manpower, if they were not subject to these restrictions.  I think that is a reasonable request and I would ask the Minister to look into it.</P>
    <P>I should like to make a brief reference to the E.S.B.  It was once called a white elephant by the Deputies on the opposite side but it has proved one of the most successful undertakings in the country&mdash;a well-run and a well-conducted firm.  We are now within sight of the end of rural electrification and within the next few years a lot of the big technical staff which the E.S.B. has employed will become redundant. Now that we have increased our electrical production in this country it is a matter of concern that these redundancies should occur among such highly trained personnel.  I understand that most of our domestic heating comes from fires and so forth and according to the O.E.E.C. Report we could increase our facilities in this regard in the neighbourhood of 12 per cent.  One thing that has been very much neglected in this country is central heating.  I think it is an economic proposition.  One has only got to look at the obituary lists in our leading dailies over the three cold, damp months of winter&mdash;January, February and March&mdash;to realise how necessary some form of electrical central heating is.</P>
    <P>The point I want to make is that when the E.S.B. come to the end of rural electrification they should sponsor a nation-wide campaign in favour of central heating.  They could in that way maintain in their employment the <Col N="1195" /> members of their staff who would otherwise become redundant and whom it would become necessary for them to discharge.  Practically every country in Europe, even those with better climates than ours, lead us in the field of central heating.  You will see central heating here only in establishments such as this House, Government offices and local authority offices.  As well as contributing to the better health of the people of the country it would provide a lot of employment and, as I say, would render unnecessary the redundancies which would occur among the personnel of the E.S.B.  It would help in the industrial world inasmuch as if this country became interested in central heating for the purpose of boilers, radiators, and so on, there would be an opportunity for setting up a factory somewhere in Ireland.  If so, I hope it would be set up somewhere in rural Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="Mr. Breslin Mr. Breslin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Breslin</NameTxt>
      <P>My sole reason for intervening in this debate is to bring to the attention of the Minister for Industry and Commerce the general dissatisfaction that exists with the very poor passenger service provided by the G.N.R. between Dublin, Omagh, Strabane, and Derry and, incidentally, Donegal.  Some months ago I addressed a question to the Minister in this House asking him if he would not make representations to the board in order to provide that part of the country with a better service, the service that it certainly deserves.  On that occasion the Minister pointed out to me that he was loath to interfere in matters which he termed the everyday running affairs of the railway company.  I feel, however, that the question is one of extreme importance especially to the northern part of the Twenty-Six Counties and to a good deal of the Six Counties as well.  In view of the fact that the taxpayers of the Twenty-Six Counties are now subsidising the G.N.R., I think it should be his duty to point out to the board that this dissatisfaction exists and that the board should take every step to deal with the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister might be surprised to <Col N="1196" /> know that 20 years ago it was possible to travel from Strabane to Dublin in around four-and-a-half hours, a journey that to-day takes at least five to five-and-a-half hours and, when one takes into consideration the progress that has been made in every form of transport, it certainly does not speak very well for the businessmen who are running the G.N.R. that they should allow such a state of affairs to continue.</P>
    <P>I have often discussed this question with members of the board and they pointed out that the passenger traffic has been dwindling over the years and that there is not sufficient passenger traffic to enable them to put on a fast service to Strabane, Donegal and Derry.  I would point out to these gentlemen that the reason why passenger figures have been dwindling over the years is just because of the poor service that has been provided. If the G.N.R. provided a fast, efficient service on the lines I have indicated, I feel sure that in a very short time the passenger figures would increase and so would the receipts, something that we have a direct interest in since we agreed to pay them a subsidy in order to keep this line going.</P>
    <P>So far as the service between Dublin and Belfast is concerned, the G.N.R. Board deserve every congratulation. That is a fast, up-to-date, efficient service, one that any railway can be proud of.  But the unfortunate passengers who have to leave that train at Portadown and head northwards to Omagh, Dungannon, Strabane, Derry and into the various towns in Donegal, get into a train that stops at every railway station and nobody ever knows the reason why these stops should occur.  It is the opposite kind of service to that provided for the lucky people who travel between Dublin and Belfast.  Perhaps the members of the G.N.R. Board imagine that that service is good enough for the people of Donegal and for the people of Derry and Omagh, but I think otherwise and so do thousands of the travelling public.  It is about time the G.N.R. faced up to its responsibility and gave the people a service that has been given on other parts of their railway system.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1197" /> I must say that the board does for a few months in the summer give a fast service to the Bundoran end of the county, a service to Lough Derg, Ballyshannon and Bundoran, and that certainly is appreciated and is used extensively by the travelling public. That, however, is in existence for about three months at the most and for the rest of the year the unfortunate travellers have to take the slow local trains that operate between those points and Dublin.  We in Donegal, as the Minister is already aware, have a very important industry, namely, the tourist industry.  We are one of the premier tourist counties if not the premier tourist county.  In the expansion of that industry I feel the G.N.R. are not playing the part they should play.  This, as everybody admits, is one of our main industries in the country and the transport company should be alive to the possibilities of that industry and should realise that with the expansion of the tourist industry their receipts will expand as well.  So far they have not shown any great interest in the expansion of the industry in regard to Donegal and we feel that the time is overripe when they should do something about this important question.</P>
    <P>It has been stated at times that the delays in the G.N.R. trains to Derry and Strabane are due to the customs delay, but I would like to take this opportunity of paying a tribute to both the Irish customs and Her Majesty's customs for the efficient way in which they manage to examine all the trains and dispatch them with as little delay as possible.  I am afraid the blame cannot be left on the shoulders of either the northern or the southern customs.  At any rate, the customs do their own part and I feel it should be in the interests of the G.N.R. to try to give us a much better service than they have been giving us for many years.</P>
    <P>There is just one other point to which I would like to refer before I conclude.  We have in West Donegal the ever-pressing problem of emigration. Year after year thousands of our young men unable to get work at home cross the Channel to the farms and the public works in Great Britain, in both <Col N="1198" /> England and Scotland.  Once they leave our shores I am afraid we lose all interest in them.  It has been most noticeable for a considerable time now that the accident rate in public works in Great Britain has increased.  I noticed even in Donegal that there has been a greater number of Donegal men injured in public works in England and Scotland during the last three or four years than perhaps in the previous 20 years.  We have come to the conclusion that the conditions in those works are not what they should be.</P>
    <P>I realise this may be a difficult problem for the Minister to inquire into but, nevertheless, I feel that we owe a responsibility to those young men who have unfortunately to leave our shores to earn a livelihood abroad.  I remember some years ago the Department of Industry and Commerce had a liaison officer who travelled regularly through Great Britain to the places in which thousands of Irish workers were employed in Scotland and England and the officer was able to bring to the notice of the employers that the conditions were not what they should be and improvements took place in many cases.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable to say that the rate of mortality in public works so far as our citizens are concerned is increasing and that there have been more fatal accidents&mdash;even in Donegal, and I am sure that applies to the other western counties also.  I have spoken to migratory workers on many occasions in West Donegal, when they have approached me on this question, and they feel our Government should take some steps to deal with it.</P>
    <P>The complaint is also made by our migratory workers that conditions in the public camps are not what they should be; that these have deteriorated even since the war years in Great Britain; that there does not seem to be any system of inspection and that if the authorities there refuse to take any action, at least our Government here should in the interest of our migratory workers take some action in order to improve the living conditions in the camps and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I would then seriously suggest the Minister that he should consider <Col N="1199" /> the appointment of a liaison officer who would travel to these various places in Great Britain, confer with the workers and hear their complaints and bring those complaints to the notice of the authorities on the other side of the water.  I think if that were done it would be of great assistance to our workers, and I am sure it would cut down the heavy rate of mortality that exists for the last three or four years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Estimate for Industry and Commerce, when the discussion travels over such a wide field, I think that every speaker mentions unemployment because industry does bring to mind employment and unemployment and I feel that the one great failure of successive Governments in this country is the failure to use the natural resources for the purpose of having industries established which would go a long way towards solving the unemployment problem.  We know that great strides have been made over the years The E.S.B., by virtue of the fact that they have supplied power to rural districts in particular at a reasonably cheap rate, have done a lot to encourage industries in rural districts, but I am afraid that nobody so far has had the courage to tackle the problem in the way in which I think it should be tackled.</P>
      <P>For instance, we have the spectacle of an agricultural country, a country that can grow certain types of agricultural produce better than can be grown in any other country in the world, actually importing agricultural produce.  We find that no attempt has ever been made to establish factories for processing the raw materials in the country districts.  These raw materials are on hand there and the growing of them would give much-needed employment, and they are needed in the country, in the towns and in the cities. Yet, nobody seems to be interested in trying to produce at home what could be produced here and what must now be imported.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have, in the area in which I am living, a fine fruit-growing district.  In that district there was a very slight <Col N="1200" /> attempt made a few years ago to process some fruits, apples and soft fruits.  We know that during the harvest season Irish fruit can be bought for practically nothing and yet in a few months' time, particularly around Christmas and from that to the following spring, we can get only foreign fruit and we must pay fancy prices for it.  I cannot see any good reason why we should not encourage the processing of fruit, the handling of it in a proper way to have it put on the market&mdash;all Irish fruit, which could be sold all the year round at reasonable prices.</P>
    <P>We also have this question of minerals.  Many people smile when minerals are mentioned and ask: What minerals have we in this country? I think it has been established that the people who smiled at the suggestion that there was copper in Wicklow have had the smile wiped off, and I think in a similar way the smiles which we can find when lead or coal or anything else is mentioned can also be wiped off if the Government gives a lead in the matter.  We have a Geological Survey Office and I am not satisfied that the Government is doing what it should do about the survey of minerals in this country.  I know that up to the year 1798 lead mines were worked in County Monaghan, and apparently worked with a profit, and were even able to export lead.  Possibly due to the insurrection at that time the mines closed down quickly because they even left ladders and a barrow and materials they were using after them in the mines.  These were recently dug up by Gypsum Industries when they inspected the mines with a view to carrying out some further work.</P>
    <P>Despite the fact that there is evidence that there is lead and zinc which almost certainly would be a paying proposition, the Geological Survey Office have stated that they think it would not be a paying proposition. Despite the fact that certificates have been produced from eminent geologists from England and other parts of the world to prove that the Monaghan mines are worth working, the Irish Government apparently has decided to turn a blind eye to the whole affair. <Col N="1201" /> Similarly, in County Meath, which is normally referred to as a cattle-raising county, there are several old mines, and those mines were worked profitably when power such as we know it now was unheard of and when the machinery for mining was primitive.  If mines could be worked then with a profit, is there any good reason now why we should not at least try to work them and to find out if there is anything in them?</P>
    <P>I also heard recently of an engineer who was interested in having established here an industry, the raw material for which would be marble, and in order to find out if the project would be worth going on with&mdash;he was prepared to sink a considerable amount of money in it&mdash;he called to the Geological Survey Office.  He first found that the door was locked and he had some trouble in getting in even in the middle of the day.  When he did get in, he found he had to sign the register and go through a lot of trouble before he could get any farther.  When he asked if the marble which he had could be compared with the marble which had been produced in this country, he found there was not a sample of Irish marble in the Geological Survey Office.  They could show him Italian marble and American marble but they could not show him Irish marble.  I think that is a slur on the Government&mdash;not on the officials but on the Government&mdash;not to see to it that these things are handled in the proper way.</P>
    <P>We know, too, that when it was suggested that gypsum could be found on the borders of Meath, Cavan and Monaghan, many people thought it was nonsense and said that even if it was found there would not be a sufficient quantity there to prove worthy of either the time or money which would be spent on it.  We know that the gypsum industry is world-renowned and famous, and is giving very much-needed employment in that area.  I feel sure that if our country was properly surveyed, if the Government would consider having the matter fully investigated, as well as these old mines, new mines could be found which would give further employment.  We could <Col N="1202" /> then get at home raw materials which we are importing at a very high price.</P>
    <P>Some time ago, there was a lot of talk about uranium in this country. Many people said it was all nonsense that uranium could be found here.  I am not a mining expert, but I have been speaking to a number of mining experts, and there is no doubt at all that uranium can be found in various parts of the country.  That the amount of uranium found in the samples produced was very small, there is no doubt.  Many experts claim that if the matter were fully investigated, uranium could be found, and could be profitably worked.  As I said, I am not a mining expert, and I do not know whether that is correct, but I have it from good authority that it is.</P>
    <P>In County Meath we have a number of industries, some of which have been established for generations&mdash;woollen mills and the furniture industry.  Possibly, it can be said that they were established by private enterprise, and that some local hard-headed business man established them, and that they are able to carry on without State intervention.  That may be so, but we know that in Navan town, in particular, industries could be established and maintained which could compete with similar industries anywhere in the world.</P>
    <P>The furniture industry was discussed some time ago, because there was a report that furniture for a State establishment was bought abroad, and not from a native factory.  If that were so&mdash;I do not know whether it is or not&mdash;I think it is something which we all must condemn.  If Irish factories can produce&mdash;and I believe they can&mdash; materials which are similar to those produced in foreign countries, I can see no good reason why we should import these materials.</P>
    <P>An industry could be established in Kells in order to keep men in employment. In that town, a few years ago, some people with the right idea, in my opinion, decided that they could establish a lager brewery.  As my pin shows I am a Pioneer and I am not a judge of lager.  I believe, nevertheless, that it was comparable to that which was being imported.  Despite <Col N="1203" /> the fact that a very good attempt was made to establish a native lager industry, the Government of the day, in its wisdom or otherwise, decided that it would give no help.  For two or three years the industry was practically extinct.  I am glad to say that it is now being revived.  I hope that, if the present Government is asked for assistance, it will not turn a deaf ear, and that the industry will be able to compete with anybody else.</P>
    <P>Many years ago, in County Meath, a great tobacco industry was being built up.  With the encouragement of the previous Government that industry seemed to be going ahead.  Then, for no apparent reason, it was suddenly frowned on, and bit by bit the hard work that was put into the building of that industry was broken down, until now we have two or three people growing an acre or a half acre of tobacco.  If this industry got a little encouragement, it could get on its feet again.  I think the Government would be very wise in investigating the possibilities of re-establishing it.  It is a mystery to me that, during the war years when tobacco could not be procured, there was no attempt to revive the industry.</P>
    <P>We had, many years ago, long before my time, flax mills and a flax industry particularly in the northern end of the county.  I believe that if the Government would consider again the possibilities of establishing flax mills in the county, and encourage the growing of flax, we might possibly be able to give a lot of employment, which is much needed, and which is not available at present.</P>
    <P>When we talk of industries the question of port facilities arises.  We have a very fine port at Drogheda on the Meath-Louth border.  For many years, the Drogheda Harbour Board have been attempting to improve that port, and have asked successive Governments to give them some assistance to do so.  For some unknown reason, that assistance has been refused. They claim, rightly or wrongly, that financial assistance was given to ports which could not claim to handle anything <Col N="1204" /> like the volume of traffic it handled, and which could not hope to expand nearly so much, if money were given to develop it properly.  Again, I hope that the present Government, when this matter is brought to its notice, will take steps to make money available for this very necessary project.</P>
    <P>In this debate we have had tourism discussed.  In such a discussion we find a lot of people talking about tourism as if the only thing that mattered was to bring half a dozen American millionaires into the country, and then tourism would be established, and everything would be all right.  I believe that if the tourist industry is to be put on a proper footing we must advertise the ordinary tourist attractions of the country, not to the American millionaire, but to our own people and our own type of people throughout the towns and cities of England and America.  I think I would be right in saying that, as far as spending money is concerned, the man who is earning £10 a week in England will spend more money freely in Ireland, when he comes on a holiday, than a man who is earning £100 a week.</P>
    <P>One matter about which I have very often heard criticism by tourists is that no attempt has ever been made to take from a group of people the monopoly they at present hold in regard to the inland fishing industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>He might have if he were interested in bringing tourists to the country, in that that added attraction would possibly increase the numbers.  We have also the problem of the seaside resorts where money could usefully be spent, but apparently these seaside resorts are frowned on because they are too far away from the cities. I have in mind seaside resorts in east Meath.  On a stretch of coast not more than five miles long, we have a lovely safe beach and yet there are none of the amenities which are offered by sea-lo <Col N="1205" /> side resorts on similar stretches of beach across the water.  Apparently the Government do not believe&mdash;they must have good reason for it, though I cannot see it&mdash;in having what is considered to be one of the most essential things around the seaside.  In summer, literally thousands of people come out by bus from Drogheda town to Mornington, Bettystown and Laytown, and, except for two small public conveniences &mdash; one in Laytown and one in Bettystown &mdash; there is absolutely no toilet accommodation on the beach. That is a disgrace and something which should be looked into by those responsible for tourism in this country.</P>
      <P>Again, we have in that area stretches of coast which could be developed and which would compare very favourably with anything to be found in any other country in the world, if the money was spent there.  That the people can be brought to these resorts and encouraged to spend their time and money there is proved by the fact that the holiday camp established a few miles further along the coast can get an average of 2,500 people for 14 weeks in the summer.  If anybody says here or anywhere else that bringing those people there is not benefiting the Irish people, I can assure them they are wrong, because, living as I do very close to that holiday camp, I know that, apart from the fact that employment is found there for almost 600 people during the summer season, a tremendous amount of money passes into the hands of the local shopkeepers and others in the district from the influx of visitors to that holiday camp.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this whole question of tourism is to be put on a proper footing, there must be some better way of attracting people to the country than sending somebody with a caubeen on his head and a clay pipe stuck in it to America to parade the streets of some of the towns and cities there and to tell them to come back to Ireland.  The tourist industry is far more important than many people are prepared to agree it is.  I believe that if we can get people to come to this country and not alone spend money here but eat the surplus food we have, particularly in the cattle trade&mdash;the steaks which were the great <Col N="1206" /> attraction some years ago may not be such an attraction now&mdash;and if we could get it established that any visitor from foreign lands or people from Ireland who come to a seaside resort here will be assured of a decent meal at a reasonable price, we would be doing a good job for Irish tourism.</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to refer to the system of advertising carried on by some of the tourist bodies.  I found recently that a very elaborate book setting forth the tourist attractions of the country was published, as I understand, at colossal cost and sent to tourist agencies around the world.  I was lucky enough to get a copy of it and I was amazed to find that County Meath was completely ignored.  It may be said that that is a parochial outlook and it may be asked why I should be annoyed simply because County Meath was ignored, but I was annoyed because County Meath is a county where we have Slane Hill, on which St. Patrick lit the Paschal Fire and &mdash;I nearly said &ldquo;Drogheda, where he landed,&rdquo; although he could have&mdash;Tara Hill, the seat of the High Kings of Ireland, and the Boyne Valley, not to talk of the ancient monuments around Trim and Kells.</P>

If other Deputies have examined that book, they will have found similar omissions.  I want to stress, in conclusion, that if we are serious about bringing tourists to this country, we should ensure that all the main tourist attractions are brought to their notice and not simply those that interest the people compiling these books.</P>

      <P>It is a matter for regret that, after so many years of self-government, Deputies representing Cork City, the second city in the State, should still have to rise here to remind the Minister that the second city in the State is without an airport.  The benefits which such an airport would bring to the commercial and business <Col N="1207" /> life of the city are obvious.  In view of the fact that Cork is so near Cork Harbour where Americans land after a transatlantic voyage, it is obvious, too, that an airport would be of immense value to the tourist trade in general.</P>
      <P>I intervene mainly to correct an impresion which Deputy McGrath gave here last week and which I think would be damaging to the airport project in Cork.  Deputy McGrath seemed to give the impression that the only way in which we can get an airport in Cork is by the expenditure of £1,000,000 and he seemed to suggest that because the Cork Deputies on the Government side felt that an expenditure of £1,000,000 was not necessary, they were <i>ipso facto</i> against the airport project.  The situation really is this, and I want to point it out to the Minister, that, for the past ten years, without the expenditure of one penny of Government money, private enterprise has been ready, willing and anxious to operate scheduled air services between Cork City and cross-Channel airports.</P>
      <P>I feel that that is a practical approach to what is a very burning question in our constituency&mdash;that private enterprise should be encouraged and told that they can operate the scheduled services which they have assured the Minister time and again would be safe and expeditious and just as cheap as any other service operated with the aid of State money.  I say, as I have said before&mdash;and I think I represent the views of other Government Deputies&mdash; that we do not feel in Cork City that the expenditure of £1,000,000 is necessary before an airport can be built.  If the airport is to be built, I am informed by a number of experts that an airport quite adequate to the needs of Cork City and surrounding districts would not cost more than £200,000, and I do not see why Deputy McGrath or any other Deputy should object, if fellow Deputies are ready and willing to point out where a saving of £800,000 in State expenditure can be realised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For these reasons I would impress <Col N="1208" /> upon the Minister to do away with the embargo which has been placed on the operations of private enterprise.  That is all he need do in the morning to ensure that the Cork airport problem would no longer be a problem.  It would be necessary as time goes on to have something more ambitious than scheduled services.  The airport problem generally has been considered for the past ten years.  It is still being considered.  Scheduled services could start in the morning if the Minister would give the word &ldquo;go&rdquo; to those worthy private enterprises which are very anxious to give Cork an air service.</P>

      <P>We all admire and recognise the steady progressive industrial drive which has gone on for a good number of years.  We know it has been of great benefit to the country.  It certainly was required. When the industrial drive started a good bit of leeway had to be made up but we are fortunate that the drive was initiated and that steady progress had been made since and is continuing.</P>
      <P>There is one aspect of that industrial drive, however, which I want to bring to the Minister's notice.  Having studied the matter, I can say that the industrial drive in the main has been confined to an area which lies south of a line between Dublin and Galway. Great progress has been made in that half of the country, but we find that in the other part of the Twenty-Six Counties, especially the areas along the Border, such as Donegal, Leitrim, Sligo, Cavan and Monaghan&mdash;Louth came in for a good deal of development&mdash;they lag very far behind and are very little better to-day in the industrial field than they were when the State was established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is every reason why that problem should be tackled.  It is not a good thing that we should have along the Border a number of counties which are underdeveloped industrially.  Our aim is to make it clear to all our people, and especially the people on the other side of the Border, that this country is a progressive one into which they can come without any loss and <Col N="1209" /> in which they can find room for their talents.  It is, therefore, important that a Government here should not neglect the industrial development of the northern counties.  That is exactly what has been done.  We have very little industrial development there.  That is one thing which cannot be allowed to continue.  The people there have associations with their neighbours right across the Border to whom they would like to be able to point out that we are industrially progressive, that our Government in Dublin has helped to foster industries in these areas.</P>
    <P>That is one reason I regret to notice that the subsidy is being withdrawn from the E.S.B. along the Border counties.  The fact that we had made great strides in rural electrification showed us up in a very good light. We have along the Border towns, villages and country districts all of which have been supplied with electricity under the rural electrification scheme.  In that respect our position compares very favourably&mdash; indeed, more than very favourably&mdash; with the position on the other side of the Border.  We hope that making the E.S.B. pay their own way and taking away this subsidy will not interfere with any work that has been done. Furthermore, we hope it will not interfere with future rural electrification progress.  Due to the smaller amount of money that will be made available and due to the fact that the E.S.B. are being asked by the Government to pay back, there is a danger that the charges may be increased. The E.S.B. will have to find some method of getting money.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">

      <P>In the Estimate the E.S.B. are asked to pay back a <Col N="1210" /> sum, I think, of £250,000.  Anything that would interfere with the rural electrification of our countryside, the supply of electricity to farmers of all classes and to small towns, would be a very bad thing.  If the need for increased charges does arise and if it causes a slowing up or causes fewer people to take the current, we hope that the Government will take remedial steps.</P>
      <P>Some time ago I brought to the Minister's notice a serious fuel problem in our county.  He told me he had no function in the matter, that it must be arranged between the fuel merchants and others.  That was in regard to the supply and the price of coal.  During the winter the poorer sections of our people were asked to pay fantastic prices for American coal.  It was American coal that was being sold here ex-dump.  According to a reply given to me by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, that coal was being sold here for £5 11s. per ton.  Yet the poor people and everyone who bought it in Donegal, especially the people who bought it in small quantities, had to pay up to 17/6 a bag for that coal.</P>
      <P>The Minister said he had no function in the matter but, nevertheless, he should not have allowed that situation to continue.  The declared aim of the Government was to reduce the cost of living.  Yet the Minister stands idly by and watches the price of fuel going up for no good reason.  There might have been some excuse for allowing Bord na Móna to increase the cost of machine-won turf in Donegal.  There may have been need to increase charges, I do not know; but machine-won turf has increased in cost by a few shillings per ton.  That may have been necessary and, of course, the money went to our own workers.  To stand idly by and watch the price of American coal soar to almost double the price for it delivered ex-dump here was something no Minister should have been guilty of and the present Minister is guilty of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yesterday I had answered here by the Minister a question relating to freight and fare charges by the Lough Swilly Railway Company.  He indicated <Col N="1211" /> that there was a maximum laid down. Where a company such as this has its offices, headquarters staff and clerical staff across the Border in Derry and where during the year it showed a substantial profit and as a result took a decision to pay its shareholders an extra 1 per cent., the Minister should step in and amend the regulations if necessary.  The regulations are now a few years old and if they allow a transport company, under the conditions which apply in this case, to increase its fares and freight by 5 to 10 per cent, then those regulations are due for overhaul and should be overhauled.</P>
    <P>Since many workers use this form of transport, those going to the factories in the city or going to work elsewhere will find their pay packet at the end of the week less than it should be&mdash; and it is less because the Minister did not curb the company in any way and did not take steps to amend the regulations. Furthermore, if the merchant finds his transport cost on goods goes up, he will pass that on to the consumer and that will mean an increase in the cost of consumer goods.  There is every good reason why this question should be examined, and I would urge the Minister to bear it in mind, now that he is considering the whole question of Donegal transport.</P>
    <P>I would urge that some effort be made to get this matter of Donegal transport pushed forward.  It has been under consideration by two Ministers and it has been on the carpet for the last two and a half years.  At the moment there are three transport companies operating in County Donegal with very little co-operation between them and the travelling and business public are not served as well as they might be.  Up to last year we had C.I.E. operating extensively in Donegal in the delivery of ground limestone. Thanks to the last Minister for Agriculture, that situation was remedied, but we still have the G.N.R. Company, the County Donegal Railway Company and the Derry and Lough Swilly Railway Company.  The sooner some arrangement is made to set up one body for Donegal or to <Col N="1212" /> transfer the Donegal transport problem to an existing body such as the G.N.R. or C.I.E. the better.  Donegal is a difficult county with scattered areas divided by hills.  At the moment these companies naturally take the plums and forget about the rest.  However, the matter is being studied and all I want to do now is to urge the Minister to have it brought to finality as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Some time ago a survey was made of some bogs in Inis Eoghain with a view to their development for machine-won turf purposes.  It transpired from some investigations made during the emergency that they were not exactly suitable.  I think those investigations were haphazard and were not as extensive as they could be or as detailed as they should be.  If a more detailed survey, were carried out, it would be found that there are, in the Inis Eoghain area of Donegal, bogs suitable for development.  It must be remembered that that area has all the characteristics of a Gaeltacht area but it is not a Gaeltacht area.  It does not get any of the benefits a Gaeltacht area, which has the same sort of economic and social conditions, gets. Therefore, I submit we have ground to urge that bog development should take place there.</P>
    <P>There is an alcohol factory in that area which was not converted to any other use last year.  The decision was taken that the alcohol factory should be continued as such until it could be turned to another use.  There the situation remains.  I would urge that the Minister keep his eye out for an alternative use.  As a county, Donegal uses quite a lot of fertiliser.  We are the premier seed potato and ware potato producing county.  In addition, we produce a very large quantity of oats.  A lot of artificial fertiliser must, therefore, be used in our county. I am aware that negotiations are afoot to establish a fertiliser industry in this country.</P>
    <P>I recommend that consideration be given to the establishment of a branch of that industry in Carndonagh.  There is a factory there already which, I am <Col N="1213" /> informed, is suitable for the purpose. Furthermore, it is centrally located from the point of view of supplying the potato and oat-growing farmers of County Donegal, Sligo and elsewhere. It would also help to relieve unemployment in that area.</P>
    <P>I want to bring to the Minister's notice the fact that unemployment is on the increase in that area.  While it is true that we have some thousands fewer unemployed throughout the whole country now than at this time last year, the position in that area is that, whereas in February of last year the unemployment figure was 1,200, in February of this year the unemployment figure was 1,500, according to a reply given to me a few weeks ago. Some of the suggestions I have made, if put into operation by the Minister, would remedy that situation.</P>
    <P>One point which was raised by Deputy Esmonde would have my wholehearted backing and it concerns the use of tractors and small lorries by farmers to help one another.  In my county, in particular, it need not go even as far as that.  Farmers find they are prohibited from using their own tractors to bring their own potatoes to the alcohol factory some three, four or five miles away: they have to employ a lorry to do the work.  Of course, they are allowed to cart the potatoes from the pits out to the main road, because the lorry cannot get in, but they are not allowed bring them to the factory.</P>

    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>As a new Deputy, I was rather amazed at the tone of the first two speeches on this Estimate. The Minister for Industry and Commerce is a man who is very careful in his statements.  He struck a note of optimism and of hope that, with great effort, industrialisation in this country could be advanced, and advanced quite quickly, during the next few years. Deputy Lemass is the former Minister for Industry and Commerce.  In many places he is regarded as the doyen of the industrial effort.  He got to his feet and, amazing to relate, he was very pessimistic.  I began to wonder not long afterwards if this was the result of a very astute political effort on the part of the Opposition to convince a certain section of the community that the leopard had changed his spots and that they are now friendly to the rural and the agricultural population. Whether or not that be so, I found myself obliged to take grave exception to some of Deputy Lemass's remarks, particularly in regard to affairs which are very important to my constituency, and, before I proceed any further with my speech, I should like to deal with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the outset, I should like to say with regard to the recent restrictions on the importation of synthetic substitutes for soling leather imposed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce that I have the gravest sense of trepidation as to whether or not he was wise to impose such restrictions.  The intention of the Minister was to help the tanneries.  The number of people employed in tanneries in this country is approximately 600.  The number of people employed in my own town in the boot and shoe industry is greater than 600 and the number of people employed in the whole country in the boot and shoe industry is more than 6,700. It is impossible to make an omelette without breaking eggs.  It is a fact that the largest tannery in the world is working half time notwithstanding its reputation as a tannery which produces <Col N="1215" /> absolutely the finest grade sole leather in the world.</P>
    <P>While I have the greatest sense of trepidation that the Minister for Industry and Commerce may have been ill-advised and may not have proceeded in the best interests of all the people in the leather industry in this State, I must take grave exception to some of Deputy Lemass's remarks.  As reported in the Official Report of the 23rd March, 1955, Volume 149, No. 4, columns 552 and 553, Deputy Lemass said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There is no justification in economic theory, or in fact for the assertion frequently made here by the present Minister for Agriculture and others, that the effect of restricting the export of hides and regulating the price of hides is to lower the price which the producer of cattle gets.  Having regard to the present price of cattle&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;here is where it really becomes serious&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;&ldquo;it would not worry him very much, anyway, even if it were.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The reference is Dáil Debates, Volume 149, No. 4, Wednesday, 23rd March, 1955, columns 551, 552 and 553.  Deputy Lemass here displays a complete disregard of the profits which can be and are the legitimate property of the cattle producer in this country.  If it were a case that Deputy Lemass felt that one other industry&mdash; should I say one other important industry&mdash;of necessity must derive benefit at the expense of the cattle-producing industry, well, he might at least have been a little sympathetic, but one must remember that the industry to which Deputy Lemass devotes his interest is an industry which at the present moment employs 600 persons in this State, and is at the present moment getting an absolutely new protection, about which every one must have perturbation, from the Minister for Industry and Commerce at the expense of another industry which employs exactly ten times as many people.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I would be delighted to do so:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We can avoid any such loss to the producer of the cattle or the person handling the hide if we will reopen the question of the elimination of the warble fly.  We had a compulsory scheme for its elimination in operation before the war. That scheme was attacked vigorously at the time by Fine Gael.  It had to be dropped when the war started as the officers and organisations responsible for the operation of the Warble Fly Order were required for other work.  We did not take it up again after the war.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The warble fly is introduced there as a red herring across the trail because neither Deputy Lemass nor any other Deputy on the Opposition Benches can say that any benefit was derived by the boot factory workers and boot factories of this country as a result of the fact that farmers were completely robbed of their legitimate opportunity to sell their hides at a higher price than obtained.  The export of hides was prohibited absolutely. The Irish tanneries, which consist of four or five or six firms, could buy those hides at their price.  The question of the quality of the hides did not arise.  If they had warble fly holes in them they were worth what they were worth abroad and worth what they were worth at home.  In the production of hides it is, of course, eminently desirable that there should not be warble fly holes in them but that has absolutely no relation to the penal prohibition on the export of hides which was maintained by the Fianna Fáil Government for many years.  If the hides were worth less abroad because they had holes in them, they were worth less at home if they had holes in them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, I appeal to the Minister for Industry and Commerce to reconsider whether or not he has been well advised in his action in prohibiting the import of synthetic soles because many boot factories in this country that could import synthetic soling could reexport <Col N="1217" /> it in shoes, at a profit, and could keep our people working.  The protection is afforded to an industry which, unfortunately&mdash;and I have the greatest sympathy for those people engaged in it&mdash;looks as if it is a dying industry.  Six hundred people in the Republic of Ireland in relation to 600 people in my home town and in relation to 6,700 people in the Republic is a very small percentage.</P>
    <P>I was very glad to hear my very good friend on the opposite benches, Deputy O'Malley, refer to the possibilities of the export of cement.  Deputy Lemass said that for our consumer industries at home the utmost increase in employment which the industry could afford was 25,000 new jobs and that it would be a most wonderful achievement if that were reached in ten to 15 years. Therefore, if his figures are correct, and I believe they are, our hope for the expansion of industry lies in the expansion of industries which cater for the export market.  The export market in all commodities is such that we must tread very warily because it is a fact that on the Continents of Europe and America there are huge cartels of many firms or one huge firm which control the entire market and can afford to spend vast sums on technical development.</P>
    <P>If we are to compete with these people we must have technical competency.  There is a small factory in the town of Dunleer, A.E.T., which produces electric fires and appliances. The improvement in employment and in general in this factory since it became allied with a British factory has been absolutely phenomenal.  The reason, of course, is that the British company have the necessary money to provide the producers with technical information.  That technical knowledge is the result of a technical set-up which cost probably as much as the wages bill of the entire factory in Dunleer. Technical competency must be allied with foreign capital.  No foreign cartel will give us the information we require and give us the technicians we require if we do not give them some say in the business.  The cement factories are a perfect example of that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1218" /> It is wise, however, at this stage to proceed with great caution because, in addition to technical competency and finance, there is the matter of the agreed rate of remuneration which the investors receive.  The workers in the factory must be protected against a large amount of money leaving the factory annually because if the factory is to compete on the export market the profit margins must necessarily be low and if the profit margins are further decreased by very heavy guarantees to investors, we are in serious trouble.  If we do expand our cement industry and kindred industries to the export stage of production, we could hinder and possibly injure the opportunity of those people who now work in these industries to earn a livelihood.</P>
    <P>I have in mind the position that developed some years ago when an extension to the Drogheda Cement Factory was mooted and where the last inter-Party Government were very heavily blamed for delaying its construction.  The facts are that the foreign investors wished to have a guaranteed 10 per cent. for their investment. An investment in Cement Limited is an absolutely gilt-edged investment.  If that is so, is it not true that if you give these people&mdash;and they want a share in proportion to every share they hold&mdash;a gilt-edged investment on which there is a return of 10 per cent. and they invest £20,000 therein, they can go to the Dublin Stock Market the following morning and sell the amount of their investment, not for £20,000, but for £40,000 because the rate of interest on a gilt-edged investment is 5 per cent, on the average?  Therefore, it is necessary that we proceed with the greatest caution in this regard.</P>
    <P>I would indicate to the Minister for Industry and Commerce that I have had representations, from persons who should know, that the Companies Act is completely behind the times.  I am told that there has been no change since approximately 1908-1910 and that a person outside this country who desired to inject capital into an enterprise here cannot get information as readily as it is obtainable in Britain. <Col N="1219" /> That has proved a very grave hindrance to the investment of foreign capital here, an investment which we all desire very much.</P>
    <P>I was pleased to learn from the Minister that a new company is about to be formed for the export of a suitably blended whiskey for the American market.  I wish him well in that project. In the recent debate here on the motion tabled by Deputy McQuillan I took the view that in so far as whiskey exports are concerned we should place our confidence in the existing distillers and in the old traditional potstill whiskey.  Perhaps I was wrong in that. I would, however, ask the Minister to ensure that this new blended whiskey does not react unfavourably on the present exporters of whiskey.  It is possible in London to go into a public-house and see there a bottle of so-called Irish whiskey, covered with shamrocks and harps, and bearing an altogether unfamiliar name.  Therefore, the company which produces this proposed new whiskey for the export market will have to offer absolute proof that their whiskey is as good as, if not better than, Scotch whiskey.  Their job will be a difficult one.  Not only will they have to market the whiskey, but they will have to convince everyone who drinks it that it is better than the Scotch they have been drinking hitherto.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to see a surplus of £24,000 in Aer Lingus.  Aer Lingus is worthy of every commendation, not only because of the financial improvement over the last few years but also because of the services they offer.  It is acknowledged that nowhere does the traveller receive the same service and friendliness that he does in Dublin Airport.  I have not travelled very much, but I think the people who run Dublin Airport are to be congratulated; in my opinion, they are travelling a route in which, not very many years from now, they will show a very, very substantial profit.</P>
    <P>Deputy James Tully referred to the Drogheda Harbour Board and the possible improvement of the port.  It is a fact that the port of Drogheda is at <Col N="1220" /> the moment in grave need of improvement. Ships have to lie outside the bar because they cannot enter the port until such time as the tide is at its fullest.  Indeed, we would like to see much bigger vessels entering Drogheda. On many occasions I have seen small coasters tied up outside the Drogheda Manure Company having transhipped their cargoes from larger vessels in the port of Dublin.</P>
    <P>Now, in the decentralisation of industry a sensible outlook must be directed towards establishing industry at the most suitable points.  In Drogheda there is an industrial opportunity which is unparalleled elsewhere in the country.  We have in Drogheda the Drogheda Manure Company, Irish Oil and Cake Mills, Cement Limited and two boot factories, not to mention many kindred industries.  All these industries at the moment are compelled to use the port of Dublin.  Coming in from Drogheda this morning I passed seven Drogheda lorries coming to the port of Dublin. If any proposals are made to the Department of Industry and Commerce by the Drogheda Harbour Board for the improvement of the port, those proposals should command a very high degree of consideration.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cunningham referred to the use of fertilisers.  I honestly believe that we spill more fertilisers in the season in Louth than would ever be used in Donegal.  No one has any conception of the amount of fertilisers used in Louth, Carlow, Wexford and Tipperary.  These are the grain-producing counties.  These are the counties which grow more grain than the farmer can use for his own purposes.  The farmers in these counties are specialists.  They do not walk the grain off the land in the best tradition of: &ldquo;One more cow, one more sow, and one more acre under the plough&rdquo;.  They are the specialists who make it possible for those not so favourably placed to walk grain off the land.</P>
    <P>I trust that in the near future we will make as many fertilisers as we possibly can.  The opportunities for the production of a nitrogen fertiliser are unlimited.  The ex-Minister for Industry and Commerce referred to the <Col N="1221" /> fact that we should use 100,000 tons. I agree with him in that; and I hope that when this proposed new factory is started, if it is started, it will be situated in one of the counties I have mentioned.  I will not be so parochial as to say Louth; considering our policy in relation to decentralisation and the fact that the counties I have mentioned are those which produce vast quantities of grain, I think these are the counties which should be considered first as a possible site for a nitrogen factory.</P>
    <P>Deputy Coburn will deal with the points made by Deputy Lemass in relation to the G.N.R. Works.  I would merely like to say that, judging by the very few representations I have had to make to the Department of Industry and Commerce on this matter, I know that the present Government will do its very utmost to ensure that all the employment that can be created in the G.N.R. Works on this side of the Border will be created and that all the work that has to be done in connection with rolling stock, etc., will be done in Dundalk.  I regard that works as one of the premier industries in the country.  The standard of work done there is unparalleled.  There, they can do lathe and turning work which cannot be done anywhere else in the country.  I think Deputy Lemass can rest assured that this Government will do its utmost to keep that works in full production, giving full employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasOHara" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to the Minister's opening speech, to Deputy Lemass and to other Deputies and right away I want to say that we have been treated to what is becoming the usual practice in this House.  We are offered a mass of figures by one side and another mass of figures by the other side.  On the one hand, we have the Minister justifying his Estimate, and I will give him credit for the fact that I, at any rate, am quite satisfied that he is doing everything humanly possible in his Department; and, on the other hand then, we have Deputy Lemass trying to pick holes in every statement made by the Minister, trying to pick holes in everything the Minister does, and trying to prove that <Col N="1222" /> since the present Minister took office he has made a very bad job of his Department.  I do not agree with that at all.  I quite appreciate that when a Minister takes office it requires a little time to get the machinery into working order and show some progress.</P>
      <P>That being so, I shall be quite reasonable in my demands upon the Minister.  I look forward to his giving us a better deal in the West than we have experienced at the hands of the Fianna Fáil Government.  The greatest mistake the previous Minister made was in aiming at establishing more and more industries in Dublin and the adjoining counties.  I think that was very bad policy.  I do not, of course, say it was bad policy to establish industries, but to encourage industries here in the City of Dublin which, as we all know, is already top heavy, was very bad policy.  Now we must give credit to the former Minister for Industry and Commerce for what he did, and I am prepared to do that any day, but I must say that in doing what he did in encouraging industries here in Dublin, he was making a very, very bad move indeed.</P>
      <P>Despite the fact that we now have a change of Government, one wonders if the present Minister for Industry and Commerce will be able to pull the fat out of the fire quickly enough.  I can tell the Minister for Industry and Commerce that it is my experience in my locality that homes are being closed down and locks are being put on the doors.  That went on under the Fianna Fáil Government and it is still going on to such an alarming extent that it was necessary for our bishop, and in fact for other bishops throughout the country, to refer to it in their pastoral letters.  You still have this drain on the life-blood of the nation.  The youth of our country are fleeing the land and the people from the small holdings are just getting out.  They have lost all confidence in native Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the reasons is that the Fianna Fáil Government and the then Minister for Industry and Commerce failed in their duty to provide industries for the areas where they were really most needed&mdash;the congested areas where thousands and thousands <Col N="1223" /> of small uneconomic holdings are situated and where there are no industries and where the people are unable to provide a livelihood from the land.  As I have already stated these holdings are much too small.  The people who live on them are traditionally hard-working people.  Their forefathers had to reclaim the mountainsides of Ireland to try and make a livelihood.  I remember that many years ago they were promised that if Fianna Fáil got into power they would provide industries for these people and put an end to emigration.</P>
    <P>The people have been left for such a long period now, they have been listening to promises and they have seen practically nothing done.  They have become disgusted with the whole thing and I should like to tell the Minister for Industry and Commerce here and now that if there were a plague in the West of Ireland at the present time the people would not be getting out any more quickly than they are.  That does not apply just since the present Government took over.  It applied also in the period during which the previous Government was in power but no matter what Government is responsible it is time to wake up and to treat this thing as the emergency it is.  I should like to say, therefore, to the present Minister for Industry and Commerce that I am prepared to be reasonable with him and to give him sufficient time to put the house in order in the West of Ireland but I would ask him in a special way to direct renewed attention to the counties in the West.</P>
    <P>I feel quite sure that the Minister would find in Deputy Cunningham's area the same conditions as I have described in mine.  I am sure Deputy Cunningham has the same experience, but they have occurred in Fianna Fáil's time and they are happening now.  No matter who is Minister for Industry and Commerce, something should be done and done quickly to stop the alarming way in which the people are getting out by their thousands. In trying to advance the need for industry in the West generally, I <Col N="1224" /> should like particularly to draw the Minister's attention to the need for industry in towns like Ballina.  I do not want to take up what happened in an election campaign some time ago when a certain industry was promised there and when the people were sadly disappointed.  Perhaps there was a certain desire to do something to establish an industry in the town but, as I said, the people were sadly disappointed in the promise that was given them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should know that that was not a political problem but a question of making the money available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasOHara" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to concede to Deputy Lynch that that was one of the contributing factors.  Money is always a big factor in the failure to provide industries for such towns. In many of those towns like Ballina you have a dozen or maybe two dozen wealthy people who give employment to the people who need it and many of these people would like to create a situation or maintain a situation where they would have scores of people coming up every day of the week seeking employment so that they would be in a position to pay lower rates of wages than they would pay if there was a scarcity of labour.  You have the position that Deputy Lynch has described in many of our rural areas where you have, in the first instance, sufficient people with money but who are not prepared to invest it in Irish industry through which they made it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is one of the things the Minister for Industry and Commerce should go into seriously with a view to increasing the amount of aid for the establishment of industries in areas like those I have mentioned.  We appreciate that in the establishment of an industry many difficulties can arise but we cannot get away from the fact that precious little has been done for the western counties in this regard and that that is one of the greatest mistakes any Government can make.  Here in the eastern counties you have good land and quite a lot of employment in the ordinary way but you have our people from the west coming in and <Col N="1225" /> going into competition with the Dublin workers in their own job&mdash;going into competition with people in the city who should get preference in employment in the city.  I would much prefer to think that our people could be held in the environment to which they are accustomed and in which they were reared.  I suggest that the Minister would attack these serious problems in a serious way because they have existed for a very considerable time and nothing, so far as I can see, has been done so far to correct the situation.</P>
    <P>We have been told by the Tánaiste about an oil refinery.  I appreciate that Caltex and Irish Shell and the other companies concerned in this matter will have the big say in where this oil refinery is to be established, but I think at the same time that if the Minister approached these people, and he would have certain contact with them, the Minister could recommend that this refinery would be established somewhere in the West of Ireland where employment is so necessary.  I would suggest to him that it should be established in Blacksod Bay.  In that district you have the Achill and Erris areas from which thousands of people emigrate every year.  As well as that it is one of the finest deep sea ports in Ireland.  It has been recognised as being safe for any kind of shipping and this being a sea port project surely we are entitled to worthwhile consideration.</P>
    <P>Other counties have been putting in claims for this industry and it is amusing sometimes to hear the inland counties looking for it.  Another place that has been mentioned is Foynes but I think Foynes is not the most suitable place at all because you have not got the same number emigrating from it as you have from the Blacksod Bay area. I would accordingly ask the Minister to recommend that if any place is entitled to the refinery it is Blacksod Bay and I hope my words will not fall on deaf ears and that something will be done about it.</P>
    <P>In mentioning the oil refinery I feel bound to refer also to the neglect of some of our western ports, particularly <Col N="1226" /> the one I am mainly concerned with&mdash; Ballina.  There again you would have an opportunity of providing employment for people if these ports were kept in proper order.  Some difficulties such as sand banks arise from time to time at the Ballina port.  Shipping companies are naturally reluctant to come in there while that state of affairs exists.  While this matter has been brought to the notice of the previous Government and the present Government&mdash;I have spoken on it on a previous occasion here during the lifetime of the present Government&mdash; nothing has been done.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass, when he was Minister for Industry and Commerce, said at a Chamber of Commerce meeting in Ballina that nothing was going to be done in respect of that port.  I think it is quite wrong that that should be so and I would ask the present Minister to take serious steps and at the earliest possible date to improve conditions at the Ballina port.  Anybody who goes down to the North Wall will see the congested conditions that prevail there.  Lorries are queued up in the streets and you have to wait hours and hours to get the lorries loaded.  Yet for the expenditure of about £30,000 some of the other ports could be put in proper order and could be used for shipping.  This would have the effect of reducing the cost of living of our people because freight charges and other costs would naturally be reduced and it would help our unemployed people very considerably.</P>
    <P>There is another matter to which I would like to refer and that is the price of offal which I think is relevant to this debate.  It is worthy of note that offal has increased in price in recent times and has been increasing in price for quite a long time.  I think that offals such as bran and pollard and other things of that kind, even if it were necessary to subsidise them, should be made available cheaper to our farmers.  I heard Deputy Donegan speak a few moments ago about good grain growing areas.  There are many such in the country but we in our area are in the unfortunate position that, due to the poor quality of our land, we cannot grow grain to the same extent as other counties.  We have to rely to <Col N="1227" /> an appreciable degree on stuffs such as pollard, bran and other offals and, as anybody knows, many farmers cannot afford the very high prices that are ruling for these commodities at the present time.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister seriously to consider the position regarding the price of these offals.  It has a direct bearing on the price of pigs, bacon and eggs and on the cost of egg production. We all know that at the present time the bacon industry and the egg industry are far from being in the happy position we would like to see them in. I do not blame the present Minister for that because we are up against foreign competition.  At the same time, if he can subsidise tea, butter and other commodities, I fail to see why he cannot, during a difficult period like this, subsidise bran, pollard and other offals.</P>
    <P>With regard to Bord na Móna, it is true that they are operating in rather a small way at the present time in my constituency, particularly in the Erris area.  I think we must be fair to them and pay them the compliment that they are driving ahead at a reasonably good speed.  There is, however, quite a lot of criticism of the rates of wages paid in many cases to Bord na Móna workers, and you find that although you have these small schemes in existence there is a reluctance on the part of our workers to remain on bog work due to the fact that the rates of pay here in Ireland on these schemes are not as high as they should be.  Those workers are not inclined to remain at home to receive only £5 or so a week on Bord na Móna schemes when they can go on piece rates in England without working any harder and be paid £10, £12 or £15 a week.</P>
    <P>I believe if the rates of wages of Bord na Móna workers were increased, in the long run it would tend towards greater efficiency and greater output on the part of our workers.  As things are a great many of the people employed by Bord na Móna are what you might describe as casual labourers, a type of people who work for two or three months on these schemes because there is nothing else in the way of <Col N="1228" /> employment being offered to them. You have transport facilities for some of these workers going a distance of ten to 15 miles and bringing back on some occasions two or three workmen. I would suggest that it would be far better policy to increase the workers wages by £1 or £2 per week and have these men regular rather than be sending out lorries and other transport to collect workers and finding when they go out expecting to get 15 or 20 they are only able to get two or three; the rest are probably gone over to England or elsewhere.</P>
    <P>We all know that in any industry unless you have some idea of the number of men you can employ, unless you know you can employ all these people, it upsets the whole running of the industry and it is impossible to keep things on an even keel.  I would urge on the Minister not to deal with this matter in a haphazard way, to treat our workers properly.  They get that type of treatment across the water and they expect it here in our own country.</P>
    <P>I will refer again to a potential industry I have in mind.  Some steps were taken by the previous Minister in connection with deposits of clay at a place called Ballymanagh, Ballina. It seems there is a very considerable deposit of clay suitable for the manufacture of pipes and brick.  I have discussed this matter with people who are qualified and have actually carried out tests on this clay.  They told me, firstly, that the deposit of clay there was very considerable and, secondly, was ideal from the point of view of the manufacture of bricks and pipes. It can be used in land project work and other schemes.  Naturally when you talk about industry you are always up against the question of raw material.  As I say, I have it on good authority that there is a good prospect in respect of this deposit.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that he should take serious steps to have something done in this connection.  In the lifetime of the last Government experiments were carried out but there the matter lies again; nothing of a practical nature has been done.  I have been told reliably also that it is possible to <Col N="1229" /> export the finished article from Ballina port to any part of England and sell it there at an economic price in competition even with home produced brick in England.  I have that from an expert, an Englishman, incidentally, who tested the stuff in his own laboratories. It seems also that it has one peculiar characteristic.  It does not take the amount of heat or as high a temperature as this type of fireclay usually does.  It has been pointed out to me, and stressed, ten or 15 miles away in Bangor Erris you have turf being produced in abundance by Bord na Móna and that this turf could be utilised in a brick factory in Ballina.</P>
    <P>It would be a great advantage from the point of view of employment if something could be done about that because there is a very serious need for employment in that area and the amount of capital outlay in the first instance, I understand, is very low.  I think on the basis of one kiln you could start with something around £10,000. I do not suggest it would be advisable&mdash;it would be a matter for experts&mdash;to plunge in headlong and start off by putting up a half-dozen kilns and find out later that there was some little hitch.  I would suggest it should be started on the basis of one kiln.  I have the figure here and it would cost about £10,000.  After that you could increase the number of kilns and you could, perhaps, produce drainage pipes and bricks in the vicinity of Ballina.</P>
    <P>Why is it that the previous Government had knowledge of this deposit of clay and was aware of its suitability and did not do something about it is something I cannot understand.  I feel it is my duty to bring it to the notice of the present Minister.  As Deputy Lynch has pointed out if local capital is not forthcoming in a matter of this kind, I would strongly urge upon the Government that they should take the bull by the horns, so to speak, and proceed to have the factory erected no matter where they get the capital.  We are told a good deal of encouragement is now being afforded to induce foreign capitalists to come here to invest in industries.  I would say if our own people are not prepared to invest in industry here encouragement should be <Col N="1230" /> given to foreigners to invest their money here because of the benefits in employment for our people, and the provision of employment is a crying need, particularly in the West.</P>
    <P>I say, in conclusion, that the present Minister for Industry and Commerce should seriously consider the plight of the people who live in the congested areas.  When it is necessary in a Catholic country that the bishops here in Ireland should refer to these things in the terms in which they have referred to them, I think it is hardly necessary for me to emphasise them. These conditions have continued all down through the years and if the Government does something seriously &mdash;and I suggest again they should treat this as an emergency because it is an emergency&mdash;it will be to their credit.  After all, it is a terrible thing to think we rear our people up to 15, 16 and 17 years of age and then there is nothing for them after all that from a native Government except to take the emigrant ship.  It is a regrettable state of affairs.</P>
    <P>Nobody expected in the present year that the Minister for Industry and Commerce could press a button and establish industries all over the place. We deplore the conduct of the previous Minister for Industry and Commerce in establishing all the industries in the eastern countries because this encouraged industries there and encouraged people to move from the congested areas into the City of Dublin. Many people are now alarmed that Dublin has grown so big and it is up to this Government to realise that if they wish to stop emigration they must turn their attention seriously to the West with no humbug or claptrap about it.  The people have had too much of that and the people there are in the main an intelligent people. They may not have travelled themselves, but their fathers have travelled and they know the difference and they have seen conditions in other countries and they will not be codded any longer by a native Government that goes around talking about things and does not show practical proof of its sincerity.</P>
    <P>If the present Minister does turn <Col N="1231" /> attention to the West it will redound to his credit for all time.  I think it is generally appreciated or recognised that conditions in the West are as I have described them, and having regard to the fact that the eastern counties are pretty well fixed up with industry I think there is a great opportunity now for the Minister to turn his whole attention to the congested areas in the West.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>To some extent I have been rather amazed by Deputy O'Hara's speech.  I thought his references to the industrialisation of the West and to decentralisation generally could be of a more practical nature, and certainly his remarks in reference to the industries that he says were established by the previous Minister for Industry and Commerce in or around Dublin, appear on the surface at any rate, to be rather ill-informed. I am sure Deputy O'Hara knows that the Minister for Industry and Commerce, whether the present or the previous Minister, is not the one who establishes industries anywhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasOHara" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>If an industry is established anywhere in Dublin it is because of economic circumstances, and it is established by those who have money or technical knowledge to initiate it. In many cases&mdash;in practically every case&mdash;persons who have money to invest will go to the area where they get the greatest market and see the greatest possible return for their money.  It is only natural that the industrial expansion which took place in the last quarter of a century concentrated largely around Dublin and other large centres of population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is important from the point of view of the Government and the Minister for Industry and Commerce is to try and encourage those people who are interested in industrialisation to invest their money in factories and projects outside Dublin and, if possible in the remote areas of the West of Ireland.  But if industrialists or a group of investors come together and seek <Col N="1232" /> whatever facilities are required for establishing an industry to manufacture or process certain types of commodity and if it is desirable that that commodity should be manufactured here or processed in this country, and if these people say they wish to establish the industry in a certain place or not at all, it is very difficult in these circumstances for a Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Government to tell them to be off with their money and that they are not wanted unless the industry is placed where the Government wants it to be established.</P>
    <P>It is only natural under these circumstances that the most practical way of establishing industries outside Dublin and of achieving decentralisation of industry is for the Government itself to do so, or by way of inducement or encouragement to get private enterprise to do it outside.  That has been done to some extent by the Act setting up Foras Tionscal, the Undeveloped Areas Act.  If Deputy O'Hara has confidence in the present Minister that the trend will be altered I am afraid his confidence is not supported by the facts if we can take them from this Estimate on which a reduction of £25,000 towards the grant for Foras Tionscal is indicative of some slackening of effort in that respect.</P>
    <P>It is only natural thát, in the early months, and possibly the first two years of the establishment of Foras Tionscal, projects would be submitted which were impracticable, as they were incapable of economic development, and that, naturally, much of their preliminary investigations would be taken up in examining projects which were not really worth while. Now that the machinery has been more or less run in, we would imagine that the flow of grants towards the establishment of industries and factories in the West of Ireland should be rather accelerated.  It is rather disheartening to know that the Minister, and Foras Tionscal itself, has given some indication that that amount of money is to be reduced, in the present year, at any rate.</P>
    <P>I have some other general remarks to make and, in view of the fact that <Col N="1233" /> other speakers have tried to get in, I will make them as concisely as possible.  Deputy Donegan spoke with a knowledge of the boot and shoe industry that seemed out of the ordinary, inasmuch as he was able to quote figures of the number of people who were employed in the different aspects of the leather industry.  Apparently, in the interests of his few factories in Louth in which boots and shoes are manufactured, he is prepared to jettison the future employment of those people engaged in the tanning industry throughout the country.  He quoted Deputy Lemass as saying that, in view of the prices to be paid for cattle, even if a slight reduction were made in respect of the hides, the producers of cattle would not, as a result, object.</P>
    <P>The Deputy tried to make it appear that Deputy Lemass had no regard whatever for the reasonable profits of the farmers.  Deputy Lemass qualified that in a very material way when he referred to the damage done to cattle hides by the warble fly.  He said&mdash;and I am sure he did not say so without knowledge of what the real circumstances were&mdash;that, if the warble fly pest were properly and seriously tackled, at any rate, the value of those hides to the producers would be considerably increased.  But, apart altogether from that, I am given to understand by people who presume to be experts that the warble fly damages not only the hides of the cattle but the physical structure of the beast, the milk output and the quality of the meat.</P>
    <P>In that respect, apart altogether from the value of the hides, the return to the farming community as a result of the efficient extermination of the warble fly, would be considerable.  For many years we have been hearing of the low milk output of Irish cattle, and I believe, in this, the warble fly has played a considerable part.</P>
    <P>The fact remains that the boot and shoe industry, not only in the constituency of Louth, but throughout the whole country, and to a considerable extent in Cork, has suffered by whatever policy is in operation with regard to the distribution of leather.  I suppose it is also affected by the demand <Col N="1234" /> for the manufactured commodity, but nevertheless an enlightened approach will have to be made to ensure continuity of employment of people engaged in that industry.  It is saddening to see young people who have left school at the age of 14, 15 or 16, work at that particular trade, and then, when they have set up homes and families, to find themselves working on short time, only one day a week, and often not more than three days a week.  It is unfortunately true in my constituency.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to adopt a vigorous and enlightened examination of this trade to ensure that all its branches would be put into as full a scale of production as possible, and not, as Deputy Donegan seems to imply, jettison the whole aspect of it, in favour of the others.  By a proper examination of the whole structure, I hope that, starting from the work on the beast itself, and the finishing of the shoe, there is considerable opportunity for increased employment, which would add considerably to the economy of the country.</P>
    <P>There is one aspect of the tourist industry to which I would like to refer. While I have knowledge of particular cases, I will speak on this subject generally.  A couple of years ago the Tourist Board was given power by this House to provide grants to people who owned hotels in order to improve their amenities, attract visitors, and thereby add to the value of the industry generally.  A system for the giving of grants was envisaged in that Bill, and was ultimately evolved, to some extent, under the guidance of the Tourist Board.  When such a measure is brought before the House and passed, one expects that the persons whom it is going to benefit might be persons who would otherwise not be in a position to get the grant facilities offered.  It would be interesting to know how many hotel proprietors have successfully applied for grants under this legislation.</P>
    <P>If the obstruction&mdash;or rather I would prefer to say obligation&mdash;imposed by the Tourist Board for those grants, is so onerous as to force people to obtain their money direct from the commercial <Col N="1235" /> banks, then that legislation would not be worth while, and whatever administrative structure is there for its carrying out should be abandoned.  The position is that people who have made applications are being asked to forward all kinds of accounts, and to provide all kinds of securities far beyond, in my opinion, what any commercial bank would demand from applicants.  I am only making very general remarks, because I do not want to refer in particular to any one case, but I would ask the Minister and the officers of his Department who are responsible, to look into this particular problem, because I know it exists.  In many cases people are getting tired of the terms and obligations imposed on them for getting these grants.</P>
    <P>Reference was made by Deputy Barrett to Cork Airport.  I would say at this stage that the Cork Airport is not going to upset the political life of all the Cork Deputies in future.  There are many other problems, but it is time that we knew and were told where we stand in regard to this.  My knowledge is that there is a private company prepared to operate scheduled services from the airport outside Cork.  The Department of Industry and Commerce whose responsibility it is to regulate such matters, are not satisfied that the facilities offered by this organisation, or company, are sufficient, from the point of view of ordinary safety.  The company claims that many aeroplanes have landed there without a hitch.</P>
    <P>The view of the Department of Industry and Commerce is that the future of air services in this country might be impaired if facilities were given for the operation of air services on an airfield which was not up to international standard.  The object is, and it was so agreed by the last Government, to establish under the auspices of Aer Lingus, or whatever public company there is, an efficient and properly constructed airport in Cork.  I wonder would it bring this matter to a head, with regard to the claims of private enterprise and the financial precautions which must <Col N="1236" /> be taken to ensure human safety, to demand to have, at this stage, a full survey of what is required for an air port there, and get a fairly close estimate of what it would cost to construct and run it, and then put it up to this company which claims that they are prepared to operate a service.  If they are not prepared to do so, it is time for the Government to act.</P>
    <P>With private enterprise claiming they can do it, and the Department of Industry and Commerce saying that the size and the quality of the services required are incapable of being operated by this particular company, we are getting nowhere fast in solving the problem.  But sooner or later public demand will increase, and at that time, possibly, a case for the airport will have increased over and above what it would cost at the present time.  There is no doubt that such a project is desirable, having regard to the returns from Dublin Airport about which we have read recently.  It would be profitable, and apart altogether from the benefit that would accrue to the area, considerable benefit would accrue generally to the economy of the country, in that it would give facilities to business people for carrying out their business expeditiously and efficiently.</P>
    <P>There is one important matter to which I would like to refer also in a general way.  It is something to which I have referred to already in a recent debate in this House, that is, the hire-purchase facilities offered in the country at present.  That is bound up in the manner in which big stores in this country are being hired by foreign capital.  I am not opposed to hire-purchase, in fact I am in favour of it.  I agree that, with the increasing standard of living in this country, the ordinary amenities of life which at one time were regarded as luxuries, should be available as soon as possible to a young couple setting up a home.  They should be enable to get electric fires, electric cookers, vacuum cleaners, and all the other amenities that go to make life more pleasant for the average household.  Recently we saw that the British Chancellor of the Exchequer saw fit to impose restrictions on hire-purchase <Col N="1237" /> facilities in England because of their inflationary tendencies.  In this country many old established stores are being sold out to these people, not only in Dublin, but outside it.  Such people are in a very big way in this hire-purchase business in Great Britain.  Nobody can object very strenuously to shareholders of business houses and other firms in this country who seek an opportunity for getting good value for their investments.</P>
    <P>An extension of the hire-purchase facilities in this country to too great an extent would have serious economic and domestic repercussions.  Many young people are buying houses on the basis of long-term and reasonably cheap loans advanced by lending companies. They are taking advantage of the remission of rates which is offered under present legislation&mdash;two-thirds remission for the first seven years.  It is very easy for a young married couple to buy furniture, wireless sets, electric fires and other things on the hire-purchase system, because they find that they have so much to pay in repayment of their loan, so much only to be paid in rates per annum, and very little to pay in the maintenance and upkeep of the house.  But after a time their demands become greater; a family begins to come along, their remission of rates has come to an end, and the house is in need of certain repairs. They find it means a return to hire-purchase agreements, and at this stage serious damage is being done to many honest and genuine people in this country.</P>
    <P>The tendency now is for big stores who have done what might be described as repectable business&mdash;I am not saying hire-purchase is not respectable&mdash;to sell out to these combines. I would submit that the Minister should watch carefully in order to ensure that this problem will not engulf the country.  It is something which should be watched fairly and impartially, but effectively, so as not to cause damage, not alone to the domestic end, but to the whole economic structure.</P>
    <P>Fuel has been mentioned on a couple of occasions, and that reminds me that recently in Cork we had a coal crisis. As a result of co-operation between <Col N="1238" /> Deputies of all Parties, the merchants, and the Minister, the running out of supplies was avoided.  Nevertheless, the position is unsatisfactory.  Deputy Lemass in his statement on this particular debate suggested that some kind of a public company or some organisation should be set up to ensure that the flow of coal into the country and its internal distribution should be as smoothly and as evenly done as possible. We heard Deputies from Donegal complaining about the shortages of coal there and the difference in price between the price there and elsewhere throughout the country.</P>
    <P>We in Cork had experience of shortages which could have created a run and a scarcity price.  That was averted by co-operation on all sides. If those things are going to recur it will not redound to the general economic progress of the country and the enjoyment of the life of the people in centres outside of Dublin area.  Now that the amount of coal for export in England is becoming diminished, it is high time some practical steps would be taken to ensure that in so far as coal supplies are necessary in this country they should be made available and distributed throughout the country as evenly and as fairly as possible.</P>
    <P>This brings me to another problem. It is not so much a problem as a desirable development.  Bord na Móna have been manufacturing for some time at Lullymore what are now known as Lullymore briquettes.  I have on occasions bought sufficient of them as would fit into a hand-grip and brought them to Cork.  They are not procurable in Cork or in any part of the country south of the Midlands because they are not economic having regard to the cost of distribution.</P>
    <P>Their calorific content, I believe, although I have not tested it, must be near that of coal.  That briquette would be a very desirable and adequate substitute for coal if it were available more generally.  I would suggest that the Minister should take up the matter with Bord na Móna. Now that they are operating in an increasing manner outside of the Midland bogs, that particular development should be introduced in bogs other <Col N="1239" /> than the Lullymore bog.  One which is operating, I believe, to a considerable extent is Littleton.  If Littleton briquettes were made like the Lullymore briquettes, perhaps, they could be distributed to centres to which it would be uneconomic to send the Lullymore briquettes.</P>
    <P>For some months there has been a bakery dispute in Cork and, largely because the average housewife is not suffering to any extent, little is being done about its solution.  Efforts were made by the clergy and by some public representatives to interest themselves in it, but so far without any result. Early on in the dispute the Labour Court sat and made certain pronouncements. There is a certain difficulty&mdash; and one can readily see it&mdash;on the part of the operatives with regard to limitations of output; it is a serious thing for them and to give in too readily might, in their opinion&mdash;and possibly with some justification they hold that opinion&mdash;affect their continuity of employment. That matter having been referred to the Labour Court and the court having made its recommendation, I suggest that the court should not just sit back and do nothing.</P>
    <P>I do not want to do or say anything that might prejudice the effectiveness of the Labour Court, but it should be something more of a conciliatory body than a judicial body and when it sees some points in its recommendation that are unacceptable to one side or the other, it should have some conciliation officer who will continue to try to bring the parties together and so avoid prolonging disputes such as this.  Unfortunately, there are scores of bakery operatives in Cork now dependent on whatever social welfare benefits they are entitled to&mdash;which are entirely inadequate to maintain themselves and their families on a proper scale.  I would ask the Minister to make sure that there is some conciliation machinery established, as an extension of the Labour Court, to prevent such disputes becoming prolonged.</P>
    <P>People in public life, particularly Dáil Deputies, are often asked what they are doing about such disputes.  I <Col N="1240" /> have a theory of my own, whether I am right or wrong, that no politician should intervene in these disputes except at the invitation of both sides&mdash; not merely one side, but both sides.  It often happens that when a person in public life intervenes the effect is to prolong the particular dispute.  Therefore, I would ask the Minister to have some regard to my suggestion of a conciliation side as well as an arbitration side of the Labour Court.</P>
    <P>We have been agitating in Cork for some time past for the establishment of a bus depôt.  We do not want one on the lines of Store Street.  We realise that Store Street is a monument to Irish architecture and is a great credit to those who envisaged it, devised it, constructed it and are now operating it.  In Cork we have only a series of sheds, converted lean-to's, to house those who travel by long-distance bus services.  While they are waiting for the buses they at least get shelter from the rain but certainly not from draughts and other vagaries of the weather.  The facilities offered are almost primitive.</P>
    <P>The corporation has been concerned with the problem for many months and has passed resolutions, but in my humble submission we are getting scant respect or attention from C.I.E. We are told that a site is being procured or being examined but we are given no indication as to where it is. We do not want to know where it is until the time comes to erect it, but we are not satisfied that everything that can be done is being done.  We are asked to stay quiet and not to prejudice the situation, not to prejudice the acquisition of a site or create a stampede with regard to the purchase of property in the immediate vicinity.  We are prepared to cooperate in that, but our patience is not unlimited and the patience of the public has begun to be strained almost to breaking point.  Unless this matter is attended to soon and unless some evidence is given of the intention of C.I.E. to commence this work, that breaking point will soon be reached.</P>
    <P>I have been asked by a number of people to refer to the Fair Trade <Col N="1241" /> Commission.  The machinery envisaged under the Act that set it up apparently was that, when the commission discovered some matter that required the attention of the Minister, separate legislation would be introduced for that matter here.  The impression has gone abroad that once they examine a particular complaint concerning the supply and distribution of a commodity, once the manufacturers and distributors have been put through the mill and questioned before the commission, nothing more is done about it.  I would ask the Minister to give an indication of the investigations which have been carried out by the commission that have called for action on his part, whether any action has been taken or whether the position has been found to be all that could be desired.  People are asking if the commission is there without having any effect other than the public examination of a particular industry or trade.  Something further should be done to ensure its effectiveness.</P>
    <P>Lastly, I am not going to follow Deputy O'Hara on the claims of Blacksod for the establishment of the oil refinery.  We know the decision is largely one for the companies who are putting up the capital themselves.  The only pity is&mdash;and I am not saying this with any disrespect or in judgment of the Minister's attitude&mdash;that he appears, having regard to the agitation that we have seen since, to have made the pronouncement rather prematurely. I am sure that, as a responsible Minister in the Government, which has regard to the general national good, he would try to ensure that this refinery would be established in the place where it would do most good and which would be most suited for it; but I feel that if this clamour by every port in the country is prolonged it might seriously prejudice the establishment of any oil refinery.  The Minister should have withheld his pronouncement until the question had been further advanced, so as to avoid this clamour which is unbecoming of public representatives in this country.  I feel that wherever it is established it will be established with the approval of the Minister and the Government and <Col N="1242" /> largely on the technical considerations that those who are responsible for its erection will have to have regard to.</P>
    <P>I want to revert to the subject of buses and bus depots.  In Cork for a number of years we seem to be getting the hand-me-downs and the casts-off of the Dublin transport services in the matter of buses.  When Deputy Morrissey was Minister for Industry and Commerce I asked whether he intended to do anything about it.  I asked him that question the first week I came into this Dáil and, as far as I remember, he said that such was not the case.  He said there was no question of taking buses that had been in service in Dublin for a considerable number of years and, after painting and polishing and dressing them up, sending them down to Cork.  I think that such was and still continues to be the case.</P>
    <P>It is grossly unfair that we should get the hand-me-downs of the Dublin City buses.  It is not uncommon in Cork to see a bus drawn up by the side of the road because it has broken down.  The stranded passengers have to wait to be taken off by another bus and, after maybe half an hour or longer, a repair gang comes along to try and repair the broken-down bus.  If C.I.E. are bringing new buses into service I suggest they should do so according to the complement in each particular centre.  I do not assert that Cork alone should get new buses because the same applies to other towns and cities which have local bus services.</P>
    <P>Apropos my reference to the Cork Airport, the Minister announced his intention of asking somebody&mdash;I suppose Irish Shipping Limited&mdash;to examine the possibility of a transatlantic liner service.  If Deputy Lemass is right in saying that it would cost about £200 per ton to supply an adequate vessel for this purpose I think that, even at this stage, the cost would be exorbitant having regard to the national advantage that would ensue.  In this respect, I think the Minister is only trying to create a mirage in his Department as regards the shipping side of his responsibilities.  It would be better if he devoted his attention <Col N="1243" /> and whatever money he may have at his disposal to a more practical line such as the supplying of more merchant vessels and more tankers.  I consider a transatlantic liner service an unnecessary luxury.</P>

      <P>I regret I shall have to shorten my remarks a good deal, but I will not tell the House that I am going to shorten them so much that I am not lacking in consideration of anyone who may want to speak in this debate &mdash; because I am not going to have consideration for anybody.  For three days I have sat here and heard the expression &ldquo;something must be done&rdquo; repeated time and time again. It is just like a game of passing the buck to the Minister.  If Deputies have a complaint to make as regards their constituencies I submit they should be able to make some suggestion also.</P>
      <P>I have something to say about tourism. When I last spoke in this House on this subject I called the attention of the Minister to the importance of tourists who brought their cars with them and I also mentioned the very high rates charged in respect of the journey from Britain to Ireland.  I pointed out that the matter should be investigated and that, if possible, we should do as other countries such as Norway and Sweden have done and, either by subsidisation of the rates or by negotiation with British Railways, endeavour to have them reduced.  I welcome the news that that has been done for the month of May.  At the same time, I am of the opinion that it should be tried in April, May, June and in the off-season when the hotels can cater for guests and when they would welcome tourists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe there is a movement afoot to have the cars brought in through Dún Laoghaire and Dublin.  That is another stroke for centralisation.  They seem to want a situation in Dublin where, even though the people are pushing one another into the docks in their endeavour to get on the boats, they want to have so many cars there that the people will not be able to get on to the ships.  This traffic was well handled by the ports of Rosslare, <Col N="1244" /> Waterford and Cork.  Only last week I asked a question of the Minister about representatives of some tourist traffic agency who came over here from Great Britain.  They were brought to Kerry&mdash;from Dublin, of course; they were brought to Killarney, Cork and Limerick.  There are enough Deputies in the House to speak for Donegal. I must speak for the South-East.  We have much beauty in the South-East but we are a conservative and a quiet people down there and we do not like to brag about it.  We have good roads and good hotels.  We have the beautiful Blackwater.  We have the Suir, the Nore and the Barrow and we have two entry ports&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I must thank Deputy Briscoe for reminding me.  Sometimes we have empty boats there while the people are being pushed into the docks at Dún Laoghaire.  That is due to the draw of Dublin and, I would say, to the promotion that Dublin gets from the traffic agents and often from An Bord Fáilte.  Representatives of An Bord Fáilte met these people and if these people had said they only wanted to go to Dublin and Killarney, having heard someone sing <i>Killarney</i>&mdash;it is a wonder they did not hear <i>Galway Bay</i>&mdash;representatives of An Bórd Fáilte should have suggested to them that there are other places in Ireland that might be worth a visit too.  It is necessary to point that fact out to English agents and to English people in general because they are not enlightened about the geography of this country any more than if it were part of the planet of Mars.  All they know is that Dublin is the capital city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want it to be understood that I am not running down Dublin.  I am proud of the capital of my country and of the things that have been done here from the national point of view.  I am proud of Dublin's patriots and writers and of its background of the past 30 <Col N="1245" /> or 40 years.  My only objection is in the matter of centralisation.  A group of American newspaper men are due to arrive in this country on Saturday next.  It is our hope that they will not be herded around in one group of 29 or 30 persons and shown merely one or two places in the country.  I would respectfully suggest to the Minister that they should break this large group into small groups and send them to various areas under the escort of people who know their way and what they are talking about.  That is very important.</P>
    <P>One of the principal reasons why the South-East does not get its share of tourists is demonstrated in the current issue of <i>Irish Travel</i> which gives a tour starting in Dublin, going to Killarney, around the Ring of Kerry, into Limerick and maybe a bit of Connemara and then out either through Cork or Dublin.  That is typical.  That seems to be the policy also when travel agents or newspaper men or publicity people visit this country.  These people should be given the opportunity of seeing other places.</P>
    <P>Nine ships are under construction by Irish Shipping, four of 9,500 tons each, two of 9,000 tons and three of 2,000 tons.  Only three of these ships can visit the majority of the ports in this State.  In reply to a parliamentary question that was put down to the Minister, I was informed that ships such as the 9,500 tons and 9,000 tons, fully laden, can only be accommodated in the port of Dublin and maybe, lightened a little, in the port of Cork &mdash;they can be brought in with tugs&mdash; and maybe to Limerick, and we can have them lightened and brought into Waterford.  I am not satisfied with that.  If they were of a handier tonnage a great deal of money could be saved and heavy commodities such as artificial manure could be brought in large parcels into the West of Ireland, which would enable it to be sold more cheaply to the farmers.</P>
    <P>A recommendation should be made to Irish Shipping, as the main plank in our shipping policy, to establish a coasting fleet.  There are people who say that these things might not pay and that we should not have them. <Col N="1246" /> Irish Shipping was not established as a proposition that should pay.  It was established to ensure that the nation would never be caught short as it was in 1939-40 when war broke out and we found ourselves without a ship and had to send Deputy Frank Aiken to America to buy ships.  He, above all people, was sent to buy ships.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I come now, Sir, to decentralisation.  I would like to tell a story of Waterford.  There are Deputies who want factories or industries established in their various constituencies and they come to the Minister and say, &ldquo;Something must be done.&rdquo;  The difficulty in Waterford is to hold what we have.  Waterford has never been treated fairly, especially under Fianna Fáil.  Two Deputies referred to the cement industry, established in Drogheda and Limerick.  It is now forgotten by many people in this House that the cement industry was pioneered and promoted by a group of Waterford men in early 1930.  I have documentary evidence and copies of the survey they had made at their own expense and put before the Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash;Deputy Lemass&mdash;in his first year of office, 1932.  Irish Cement went to Drogheda and Limerick.  That was one loss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A factory was started in Drogheda for the production of oil cake.  I subscribed heavily to that factory, not to buy shares but to buy their oil cake when they started because I could not buy anything else and I would not have bought it only I had to buy it.  They then began to produce edible oils. <Col N="1247" /> There was a very old-established industry in Waterford, W.C. McDonald's margarine factory.  McDonald's factory had to go to Drogheda to follow the edible oil and we are left without it. H.M.V.&mdash;His Master's Voice&mdash;was started in Waterford.  They made radios and records.  It is a world famous firm.  They are now known as Electrical Musical Industries.  My information is that they are moving this industry to Dublin by stealth. They have moved some of the operatives already.  They have told the Minister they are not doing it but I say to the Minister that they are doing it. I want the Minister particularly to inquire into this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>He should do something about it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I will tell you what I think he should do about it.  If they do not leave their industry in Waterford and if they do not stop migrating the Waterford people to Dublin, where they are of no use to their fathers and mothers, he should withdraw their manufacturing licence and then the boyos who are running it could remain in Waterford and we could show them that there are as good golf clubs in Waterford as there are in Dublin, which is one of the principal reasons why they have the factory in Dublin. I will not tell the Minister to &ldquo;do something.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I asked the Minister a question about five or six weeks ago as to the number of factories established here in the years 1952 and 1953, the number established in Dublin as against the number established in the rest of the State. For every one factory established in the 25 counties&mdash;that is, excluding Dublin &mdash;41 factories are established in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will not merely say that something should be done about that position. I go so far as to say that in the new promotions coming to the Minister's Department, to the Irish Industrial Development Authority and to the Irish Industrial Credit Corporation, for loans, the people interested should be directed to establish a certain proportion of these new promotions down the <Col N="1248" /> country.  I do not want to take them all down the country in the same way as Dublin is taking them all now.</P>
    <P>I mentioned on a farmer occasion the somewhat paradoxical situation of &ldquo;emigration&rdquo; inside the country.  Boys and girls who come to Dublin are not lost to the nation.  They are moving away from their own homes, however, and it would be a good thing if small industries were established in the smaller towns throughout the rural areas.  I have listened to a good deal here about the need for helping the small farmers and to the fact that they must get this, that and the other; but the greatest help the small farmer can get is to have his son and his daughter working in a local factory and bringing him home money every week.  It does not help the small farmer to have his son up here in Dublin sending him an odd £ or, maybe, writing home for an odd £.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cunningham a few weeks ago made great play here with tea on tick and the fact that the Minister was subsidising it.  To-day he brazenly comes into this House and states that they are short of coal in Donegal and that they have to pay so much for their coal there.  He put it to the Minister that something should be done again to subsidise coal for Donegal.  So we have tea on tick and coal on credit.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to tourism.  I stressed the value of cross-channel tourists to the Irish tourist industry. We should concentrate also in that connection in ensuring that our own people can get to the various seaside resorts and holiday centres.  There should be cheap fares issued for the benefit of our own people.  We are supposed to have control over C.I.E.  Down in Waterford we have a Waterford and Tramore railway.  When that was run by a private company its biggest intake in cash was during the period in which it offered reduced fares.  That company was swallowed in one of the various amalgamations and since then we have been tied down by rules and regulations, and what not, in connection with transporting our own people.  It seems to be impossible to get C.I.E. to see the light.  They have done a very good job certainly by putting diesel trains on this route.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1249" /> Traffic has increased, but the ordinary working-class people in Waterford have no other way of getting to Tramore except by train.  They have no private motor cars.  Now the Minister says that C.I.E. is a statutory body. Nevertheless I am sure that the Government must have some influence over C.I.E.  I am sure the Government could influence the policy of that body with regard to making available excursion rates from the denser areas of population to the various seaside resorts.  When I say excursion rates, I do not mean merely taking 3d. off a 2/6 fare.  I say that fares should be reduced by at least 50 per cent.  That would treble the takings.</P>
    <P>With regard to tourist advertising, I think that An Bord Fáilte should examine the possibilities of taking time on Radio Éireann and broadcasting suitable programmes to attract tourists here.  Occasionally those broadcasts should be bilingual.  Special programmes should be broadcast to the continent.  That would be a very good way of bringing the ordinary people here because I know from my own observation that it is the ordinary people who sit at home and listen to the radio.  It is not the wealthy people who come here; they go to Istanbul or somewhere further east. In these programmes An Bord Fáilte should concentrate on the fact that travel rates are low in the month of May and that there is more sunshine in Ireland in April, May and June, and that has been proved by the records made by the Meteorological Office over the last 45 years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>In moving his estimates the Minister referred to the financial position of C.I.E. and its prospects for the next few years.  It was refreshing to know that in the gradual change over from steam to diesel the financial position of the board has improved considerably and that prospects for the future are rosier than many of us could have hoped they would be during the last five or six years.  The Minister pointed out that it was hoped that within a few years C.I.E. would be able to meet from its own resources all revenue charges, <Col N="1250" /> other than interest, on its transport stock.</P>

      <P>The index numbers of weekly rates of wages in the Dublin district for January, 1955 (base January, 1939=100) were: Industrial, 209.0; Services, 210.2; Transport, 218.7; All Groups (weighted average), 211.1.  I regret that it has not yet been found possible to assemble the material for the production of the general index number of wage rates per hour in 23 industrial occupations. This index number should be ready in about a fortnight.  The general index of transport earnings is not prepared until later in the year.</P>

      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to circulate in the Official Report a statement giving the prices of different cuts of meat at mid-February, 1954, and mid-February, 1955.  The effect on the consumer price index (base mid-August, 1947=100) of the changes in prices of meat between mid-February, 1954, and mid-February, 1955, was to increase the index by 0.44 of a point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. Blowick) Joseph Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Blowick)</NameTxt>
      <P>A statement has been prepared showing all the more valuable estates and holdings on hands in Roscommon together with the dates on which they came into the possession of the Land Commission and I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to have this statement circulated with the Official Report.</P>
      <P>There are other lands on hands not included in the statement but these consist of small holdings, some remnants of old estates and large areas of low-quality land which have proved almost unsaleable.  In some of these cases the lands are let in grazing at small rents to persons to whom they will probably be finally sold and it would therefore be misleading to include them in the list.</P>
      <P>It would be a most tedious affair to extract particulars of all money collected in respect of lettings of these lands since the Land Commission took them over and I would ask the Deputy to be satisfied with the statement that the gross amount collectible for 1954 in respect of the listed lands was approximately £7,400 from which must, of course, be deducted the amount of rates and other outgoings which would exceed £5,000.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to say when each of the parcels on hands will be allotted but the Deputy may take it that lands on hands will be disposed of as speedily as possible.</P>
      <P>Occasionally one or two estates may be held on hands deliberately while other lands in the same locality are acquired so that a composite scheme may be prepared for the settlement of a whole district.  Normally, however, lands are only held on hands for such time as is necessary to prepare a sound scheme and carry out preparatory improvements work.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that this matter was brought to the attention of his Department over 18 months ago and does he consider that it should be necessary at this time to go into the matter again?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>An area of 68 acres of bog or turbary was dealt with in 1932 and 12 plots comprising 14 acres were refused.  The remaining 39 were allotted and a short time later 33 of the 39 went back into the bog.  The question the Deputy has raised concerns the changing of four of the existing tenants and the inspector is working on that at the moment and I think it will be all right.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Those who take contract work from the Forestry Department include carters, tractor men, plough men and all that.  There is very little contract work given by the Forestry Department except in the case of plough men.  There is not so much work given to carters.  The biggest bill is for ploughing&mdash;for tillage and nursery work and so forth.  There are certain provisions in the 1952 Social Welfare Act which may apply to all these and this is under microscopic examination at the present time to see what can be done.</P>

In the case of the District Court, the requisite scales have yet to be prescribed for reasons which I explained when replying to a similar question on the 3rd March.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture whether, in view of the growing demand for top quality beef and the marked increase in the value of the Aberdeen Angus bull over other breeds, he will consider the advisability of giving a greater allocation of premium and special term Aberdeen Angus bulls to applicants in non-dairying counties.</P>

      <P>The allocation of premiums for bulls under my Department's cattle breeding scheme rests with the county committees of agriculture. While the scheme provides that not less than a specified proportion of the new premiums each year shall be reserved for dairy shorthorn bulls, it is for each committee itself to decide what proportion of the balance of the premiums shall be allocated for bulls of the Aberdeen-angus breed.</P>
      <P>As regards my Department's special term bull scheme in the congested districts, everything possible, consistent with safeguarding the supply of dual purpose shorthorn foundation stock, is being done to locate good quality beef bulls, particularly Aberdeen-Angus, with applicants in non-dairying areas.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the case mentioned by the Deputy.  Where, as in this case, a vehicle is admitted temporarily without payment of customs duty under a triptyque, duty becomes chargeable if the vehicle is not finally re-exported within the period of validity of the triptyque.  In this case, as there was no evidence that the car left the State, duty was duly assessed and collected thereon.

We have in Galway 2,484 people registered as unemployed and 340 insured, and surely 35 out of those would certainly be deserving of employment rather than some of the farmers working on the scheme who have no dependents in the world and who have comfortable farms and valuations of roughly £80.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that the scale of means adopted by Limerick Corporation for purposes of the administration of the maternity cash grant scheme has caused the rejection of many deserving cases.  I <Col N="1266" /> have been informed that the Limerick City Manager, when examining applications for this grant, is always prepared to take into consideration any special circumstances.</P>
      <P>As regards (a) and (b) of the Deputy's question, I had a circular issued to all city and county managers on the 26th February last in reference to the eligibility for services (including maternity cash grants) under the Health Acts.  The circular adverted to complaints received in regard to hardship caused by the automatic and rigid application of scales of means for which there was no statutory authority and stated:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;From a reading of the Health Act, 1953, it will be clear that it was the intention of the Oireachtas that apart from the single income limit specified (£600 a year, farmers £50 valuation) determination of eligibility would follow a full assessment of the circumstances of the applicant. If the Oireachtas had wished otherwise, scales would have been prescribed in the Act or provision would have been made for the fixing of scales, applicable generally or to particular areas, by regulation.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, while the Minister appreciates that the application of scales on the lines of some of those already in existence may be useful as a ready means of determining the entitlement of certain persons, he would urge strongly on health authorities to arrange that before each application for a service, grant or allowance is determined, the health authority should have a full report on the circumstances of the applicant and that the decision on the application should be taken in the light of all these circumstances.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In view of the foregoing, I do not consider it necessary to request the Limerick Corporation to take the action suggested by the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>When progress was reported, I was referring generally to the financial position of C.I.E. with particular <Col N="1267" /> reference to the statement made by the Minister in moving the Estimate in which he outlined the prospects of the board of C.I.E. for the next five or six or seven years.  The Minister stated that the present financial trend of C.I.E. seemed to indicate to him that in a very few years the board of C.I.E. would be able to meet out of its own resources all the normal charges, other than interest, on transport stock and that in yet a few years after that, the board would find itself in a completely solvent state.</P>
      <P>I think that that situation is very encouraging and very refreshing particularly to those of us who had not visualised that happy state of affairs some five or six years ago.  An examination of the statement of accounts of the board over the past three years shows us, indeed, that there is a substantial improvement.  In 1952, C.I.E. registered a loss of £2,091,000.  This was improved somewhat in 1953 when the loss was recorded as £2,017,000 and in the figures in the latest balance sheet available to us, for the year ending 31st March, 1954, that loss is recorded as £1,021,000.  But, actually, those of us who are rather close to that industry and who take an interest in its affairs seem to think that the position is even rosier than one might gather from an examination of the net losses recorded over those years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I leave aside, for the moment, the amount put down as depreciation.  In passing, I may say that over the past three years there have been rather startling variations in the amount allowed for depreciation in the accounts of C.I.E.  I am not suggesting that depreciation is not properly chargeable against revenue, but leaving it aside in an effort to find out how the operating costs are going for the board, the position is something like this.  Outside depreciation in 1952, there was a loss of £461,000, an operating loss.  The position improved somewhat in 1953 when the operating loss was reduced down to £42,700, and in the year ending March, 1954, for the first time, the board of C.I.E. had an operating surplus of £1,095,000 and they did that in a year when their salaries <Col N="1268" /> and wages bill was increased by £339,000.</P>
    <P>It is evident from these figures, that if the figures for depreciation had remained more or less uniform, the real operating improvement for the year ending March, 1954, as against the previous year was an amount of £1,140,000.  I am simply referring to this to have it on record that the improvement that is being shown by C.I.E. in operating the transport system of this country is even rosier than the Minister indicated and rosier than a superficial glance at the statements of accounts of C.I.E. would seem to indicate.</P>
    <P>I am personally very confident that when we get the next statement of accounts and annual report from C.I.E., the position will be much better than we had hoped.  In passing, I want to say that the financial year for C.I.E. is ending to-day, the 31st March, and I do hope we will not have to wait 11 months for the statement of accounts and annual report as we had to do last year.  The annual report and statement of accounts by the board of C.I.E. for the year ending 31st March last year was not published or made available to us until February, 1955. I do not know the cause of that but it is something that would not be tolerated in private enterprise.  I see no reason at all why we have to wait for 11 months to get this report and statement of account from C.I.E.  I hope the Minister will take steps to make available to this House the financial statement of the board for this year at the earliest possible moment.</P>
    <P>Referring to the financial prospects of C.I.E., they do seem to be rosy, and in view of that I hope the Minister will take some steps to see that the board will live up to the responsibilities which it has not faced in the past. It gave the excuse of financial embarrassment to retired members of the wages grade staff of that concern when these people went along and sought some alleviation of the utter distress under which they were labouring.  There are 1,800 superannuated members of the wages grade staff of the C.I.E. and almost 800 of them&mdash;between 750 and 800&mdash;on a pension of 6/- a week.  These are people who served on the railway <Col N="1269" /> service of C.I.E. and its predecessors for some 40 or 50 years.  I know personal friends of my own who have put down 50 years' service on the railways and who are now on a pension of 6/- a week. The excuse always made to them was that the financial state of the board did not permit any advance on the scales operating at the moment. The indications now are that the financial state of the board is improving, and I hope the board will realise its obligations to these people and that this problem of their pensions will be grappled with straight away.</P>
    <P>I also have to refer to what other Cork Deputies said about Cork bus station.  Most people in this House probably were not in the Cork bus station at all.  To my mind it is just a large barn.  I have seen barns and outhouses on good farms far and away better than the Cork bus station.  The Lord Mayor of Cork, Deputy McGrath, said he spent an hour or two there last summer&mdash;I would advise him to stay out of it this year unless he wants to put us to the trouble of having a by-election in Cork. The station there is totally inadequate for the citizens of Cork and for visitors to the city.  One cannot keep out of draughts; there is no proper waiting room, and when your bus eventually comes you have to dash out through the rain to get it.  It is a hopeless place and quite unsuitable as a bus depot in a city like Cork.</P>
    <P>I hope the chairman of the board of C.I.E. will change his attitude from what it is when he says: &ldquo;You have too much shouting about it anyway.&rdquo; We are going to continue shouting until we get a proper bus station.  We do not want a Store Street, or shops or cinemas.  We want only a comfortable bus station, where people will be able to go and have the ordinary facilities that they would expect.  That is all we want and that is what we are entitled to get, and what we are going to harp on until we get it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lynch of Waterford referred to the difficulty of getting cheap transport made available to citizens of Waterford who want to get to Tramore. We are aware that there are difficulties to a greater extent in Cork.  The main <Col N="1270" /> seaside resort, Youghal, is 30 miles from the city.  The position is at the moment that, with current fares, the ordinary family man finds it difficult to take his wife and children on excursions during the summer.  If it costs the family man from £1 to 25/-on a Sunday, he is not going to go very often.  I would agree with the suggestion of Deputy Lynch that cheap fares should be made available in the larger centres like Cork, in the summer months, so as to give the ordinary man and his family an opportunity of spending a day at the seaside.  The position is that, if an ordinary man wishes to take his family away to the seaside on a Sunday in August, he just cannot do it.  Youghal is the only seaside resort near Cork, or if you like, Crosshaven, but there is only a bus service available there, and he cannot do it on the charges prevailing at the moment.</P>
    <P>I do not want to bore the House any further by speaking of Cork, but I think the Minister realises the need for an airport adjacent to it.  It was first mooted, I believe, in 1939, and we seem to be no nearer to an airport than we were then.  Deputy McGrath referred to it the other night, and he appeared to be at some pains to try to give the impression that the present Minister for Industry and Commerce was at fault.  It is all humbug to make such a suggestion, because Deputy McGrath knows as well as I do, that Cork has been shabbily treated by every Government since the thing was first mooted.  Some attention has been given to Cork, but I certainly think that Deputy McGrath should not have come here and endeavoured to insinuate that the Minister, who has only been in office for the past nine months, is the culprit of the whole piece.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Minister will give the matter prompt attention, and that he will take effective action, when there is a local company available, which is prepared to go a long way towards setting up an airport.  We do not want the Government to sink £1,000,000 to provide something that cannot properly be supplied by private enterprise.  I hope that the Minister will take into account the local finances <Col N="1271" /> available, that he will make a prompt decision, and let the people who have the money available know exactly where they stand.</P>
    <P>I do not want to refer at length to the oil refinery except to say that Cork, as many other places, seeks to have it established there.  In his statement the Minister pointed out that imports of oil were costing something like £12,500,000 per annum, and that the other by-products, tar and bitumen, were costing almost £1,000,000.  Taking these figures, I think that a refinery is desirable.  Deputy MacCarthy will agree with me that there is such merit in our case that we do not have to press it too hard.</P>
    <P>I was very pleased to note that the Minister, in his statement, referred to the steps he was taking to impose a check on the dumping of low-priced goods from the Far East into this country.  There are woollen and worsted mills in Cork, and I am sure that industrialists and employees will welcome generally the words of the Minister in saying that he was prepared to see that all reasonable steps would be taken to ensure that low-priced goods from the Far East would not be dumped into this country to the detriment of our woollen and worsted mills.  I think it can be said that, in fair competition, our industries are in no way inferior to competing industries in this country, or outside it.  We cannot hope to compete fairly with low-priced goods in this country from the Far East, and I am glad to see that the Minister is taking all necessary steps to avoid such a situation.</P>
    <P>The Factories Bill passed its Report Stage to-day and will become law in a very short time.  It appears to me that the only large class of workers who are still unprotected are the office workers. The Minister made reference to them also in his opening remarks.  He said he proposed to do something about them.  I want to impress upon him the urgency of having some protective legislation for office workers.  I think all of us had experience of people working in places that were called offices and which were completely unhealthy and unhygienic.  I myself <Col N="1272" /> worked in such offices and I know what I am talking about.  I think that very many of the T.B. cases would not have arisen were it not for the fact that these people were compelled to spend seven or eight hours per day in these dumps called offices.  I do not mind saying also that private firms and private individuals are not the greatest offenders in this respect.  We had some of our national concerns providing office accommodation that was simply an insult to the people who were accommodated in them.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated&mdash;and it was a very welcome announcement&mdash;that he intends to amend the Holidays Employment Act.  I am only sorry that he had not an opportunity of doing so before now.  It appears that we will now have another Easter in which Good Friday will not be a Bank Holiday.  I think it is a shocking reflection on a Christian country and Catholic country that Good Friday cannot be observed in the way all of us would like it to be observed.  As a matter of fact, the situation at the moment leads to hypocrisy of the highest order.</P>
    <P>I know of firms and factories which in a fit of religious fervour close their concerns on Good Friday and everybody says they are very good Catholic firms.  The fact is, of course, that they do not pay their employees for that day.  They close the factory but they do not pay their employees for the day they lock the doors against them. I do not see anything particularly religious in such an action.  I know of other places where the doors are closed and the shutters put up but work goes on as usual behind the closed doors.  I am very sorry to see that apparently we will have to pass through another Easter in which this will happen.  I know that when the Bill comes to be amended the Minister will deal with this particular problem and make Good Friday a bank holiday.</P>
    <P>Deputy Jack Lynch referred to the Cork bakery strike&mdash;it would be more correct to term it a lock-out&mdash;which has lasted for the past 16 or 17 weeks. I do not know what object Deputy Lynch had in mind when he raised the <Col N="1273" /> matter here, but I am sure he did it in all good faith.  I think it is wrong to give the employees or the employers the impression that something is being done about it here.  Deputy Lynch knows that the Minister can do nothing about the situation that exists in Cork at the moment.  I think it is wrong to raise hopes in the minds of people who have gone through a lot of hardship during the past 16 or 17 weeks by saying that the matter was raised in the Dáil.  I am quite sure that Deputy Lynch did not do that to raise false hopes.  The position is that the Minister for Industry and Commerce cannot deal with the situation that exists in Cork at the moment.</P>
    <P>I want to say that the general impression I get in the country is that the Minister for Industry and Commerce is doing a real good job.  There is a feeling of security and stability amongst industrialists and amongst workers generally.  I do not blame the Opposition at all for striving to indicate that all is not well.  That is their particular job, but if a neutral person examined the situation he would come to the conclusion that things are looking bright, that there is still much work to be done and that in the present Minister for Industry and Commerce we have a man who is prepared to tackle problems as they arise. Before this Government goes out of office the position will generally be much better than it was before they came in.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. MacCarthy Mr. MacCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that most of the sources of our economic and mineral wealth are still underdeveloped and, in many instances, lying dormant and neglected, is one which could appropriately be utilised to open a debate on the Estimate for the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Perhaps, it is due to the operation of democracy in a general way that things are so.  If you had a dictatorship you could make people do this, that and the other thing.  But we prefer things to move normally, though perhaps faster and to better effect.  The one great fault that I have to find with the operation of democracy and a change of Government is that very often a <Col N="1274" /> change of Government means a change of policy and a change of plan or in certain programmes that have gone so far that the change will do great damage to our national economy generally.  We had examples in the past, no doubt, but there is no use in reiterating these things now if we are to serve any purpose.  Discussion must be directed towards the problems facing us and while certain things may be considered platitudes, that should not divert our minds from discussing remedies for very old problems.</P>
      <P>We are mainly dependent in this country on what is in the soil and what it produces but we must not neglect the fact&mdash;very many members from all sides of the House made reference to it &mdash;that our mineral wealth in particular has not been sufficiently explored.  Certainly it has been developed in a very niggardly way.  Let us go back over surveys made in this country.  I think the Lewis survey was made about 100 years ago.  Mines of copper, lead and coal were operated at that particular period and good employment was given. Lead in particular was mined in the constituency I now represent at a place near Crosshaven mentioned by Deputy Casey, Ringabella.  The lead mines there employed 400 people but the mines were abandoned about the time of the famine.  I do not know if anybody has even taken an interest since in whether such a mine was there or whether the mine could be worked in an economic way.</P>
      <P>You have the copper mines at Allihies in West Cork.  They were closed owing to some labour or other trouble. Nobody ever worried about them. Places like Silvermines in the County Tipperary did not get their names without good reason.  The topography of the places, the geological surveys and the history of past events show us that there are mineral resources in this country that have not got the attention that would be appropriate when we consider our national needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These various sources of wealth would need to be examined very minutely because we know that during Grattan's Parliament this country made such progress that the people representing it had to be bribed to get <Col N="1275" /> rid of their own Parliament.  We now have our own Parliament and we should undo much of the bad work that was done during the previous 120 years from the passing of the Act of Union.</P>
    <P>There is a section of the Department of Industry and Commerce which looks after these matters but I do not think their personnel is sufficiently wide or their resources sufficiently adequate to deal with the situation.  When we were under the control of another Government, we know that they bought over very many of our industries, especially if they interfered with theirs.  Then they closed them down and they were left forgotten and neglected.  The operations which the Minister told us would be continued in Wicklow should be extended.  If some development is made every year and if we get the result, then we will know that every effort is being made to use whatever mineral wealth or deposits may be there to our national advantage.</P>
    <P>Apart from the question of supplying our own needs, the matter of developing our export market is very much under consideration by the Minister and his Department as it was during the term of office of his predecessor. We can see that it is mainly in specialised things&mdash;things that are characteristically Irish&mdash;that most progress is likely to be made.  Not alone should we provide for the openings which arise for the supply of the day to day commodities which we produce here in such fine quality for all our needs but we should remember the specialised markets available which can be developed by those who can put more money into things of that kind which would open up for us a new field of effort and enterprise at home.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Seán Casey has said, we have to protect our native industries and to encourage new ones.  Comment has been made that more has not been done for the outlying districts.  Those establishing industries do not want to go there and it would take more than an effort from the Minister to get them to do so.  Unless local people are interested and show initiative, the Department is unlikely to be able to <Col N="1276" /> do anything under existing laws and regulations.  The sad point for the people concerned is that those who most need money and industry are so depressed locally that they have neither the money nor the initiative. Take, for example, a town like Kinsale, which was brought to the notice of the Minister and which is somewhat isolated from the general course of transport and effort.  An industry would keep the people there occupied and I would suggest to the Minister that, by order or regulation, if at all possible, he extend the operation of the Undeveloped Areas Act to that town.  If he goes in there at present, he will find that two-thirds of the men are in England and the women are at home&mdash;just because they have no local industry.</P>
    <P>Another point is that of transport. Instead of considering a liner for world passenger traffic, if a coastal trade were developed, the ships of medium size would come into these ports and these ships would be built in our own dockyards and subsequently they could be repaired there.  Apart from opening up trade in some of the neglected towns and outlying ports around our coast, it would give some encouragement to the people to see a ship with coal or some other commodity coming in and discharging in their own ports. I would ask the Minister to get Irish Shipping, Ltd., to examine that side of the problem and to do something about it.  Many ports around our coasts, and many of the towns near them, give opportunities for trade which might be developed with advantage locally.</P>
    <P>We are all glad to see C.I.E. developing as it has done over the past few years.  We are glad that the modernisation of transport is bringing back to the railway traffic that it was rapidly losing and that people are going in for rail travel more than they were some years ago.  C.I.E. can run these passenger trains now in small units, as the Minister knows, but at the present moment they are running all these towards the cities so that people can get to a city and back the same day.  There are numbers of country towns which in my young days and the days of the Minister depended <Col N="1277" /> largely on the local rural community coming in on market days.  There is no case now where, instead of going to the cities, you can go into these towns by rail instead and get back by rail on the same day.  That applies to my constituency and I am sure it applies elsewhere also.</P>
    <P>Take the town of Bandon&mdash;from my native place you could go in there and do your marketing and come back by train.  At present, if you want to travel by train you must go to Cork 15 miles away and you can get back the same evening.  There are no buses, as the nearby road is not sufficiently wide to carry them.  These are local problems, but I am sure such problems apply generally around the country.  The Minister should call the attention of C.I.E. to this point, so that in their transport regulations they will not neglect the services to market towns.</P>
    <P>Deputy Esmonde said to-day that buses and trains were running parallel and at the same hours.  That is so. On that main road to Bandon&mdash;about three miles away&mdash;there is an hourly service of buses in each direction, whilst the railway is neglected.  There would not be so much wear and tear on the roads if there were a few diesel trains in each direction to allow people to get to Bandon, Clonakilty, Skibbereen, Bantry and other towns and get back the same day.  One may say you would not get a big crowd from Cork going out there, but the people going to each of these market towns would board a train at the local station and even though the train may not be filled all the way it would become a paying service in that way.</P>
    <P>In regard to the much discussed question of Cork Airport, I am sure the Minister will consider this point irrespective of who is for and who is against it.  I am certain he will consider it on its merits.  Some local people started an improvised airfield&mdash; it cannot be called an airport, as there is no building there and it is not sufficiently developed&mdash;where chartered planes land now and again in favourable weather.  The people who started it deserve every credit for their enterprise and, in the development of the new airport, that area might be taken in; I do not know, I have no skilled <Col N="1278" /> knowledge on that point.  There was a meteorological survey there lasting over three years and the people skilled in these matters will ultimately decide on the location of the airport, as I am sure the Minister is satisfied that a city with a population of about 130,000 in these days needs such a port.  If an airport is put there, the desire is that it should be a modern one.</P>
    <P>In these days no one could expect passengers to come across-Channel or from distant lands&mdash;or even our own people&mdash;to go into second-class small aircraft.  They are not going to risk that or do it.  A few adventurous people may do it.  However, if you are going to have a scheduled service, that service must be run with modern planes of good size and quality and they must take off from a good airport.  We all know that more disasters have occurred in the taking-off and the landing of aircraft than occur in flight except where there is a fog or something like that and the aircraft strikes a mountain.  The important things are the starting and the landing.  It is there that most of the accidents occur and one or two serious accidents would, as everybody knows, blight forever the prospects of an airport becoming anyway popular.</P>
    <P>Sometimes we have fog at Dublin and at Shannon.  If there were a third airport at Cork&mdash;an airport of modern size and quality&mdash;it would provide another alternative for landing whereas, at present, aircraft must in such circumstances overfly our airports and our country and go on to Prestwick, London or elsewhere.  I know the men who put up the original enterprise and I am willing to give them all the credit for it.  If they are incorporated in this, well and good.  They would serve my purpose quite well provided we get a modern airport.  What is the use of saying that we will have a scheduled air service by a company operating from Wales?  Aer Lingus having got control of our services here, why should we start off in that way now with companies over which we have no control whatsoever except that their planes would be allowed to fly from and to land in Cork?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1279" /> Do we not remember what happened in other such cases?  Did C.I.E.&mdash;in order to give their workers good conditions, to give the public good service, and so forth&mdash;not have to buy out a whole lot of these private enterprises? Did the E.S.B., when it started, not buy out the plants that were in many of the towns of this country and close them down?  Are we now to have a situation where we will have the same thing again&mdash;a situation where two, three or perhaps four charter companies on a scheduled service will use Cork airport and, when development comes, Aer Lingus will have to compensate them in order to take over the service themselves?  Surely we must consider these things from the practical point of view.  I am sure the Minister will do so.  I am sure that, regardless of what Party or what company or what people are for or against the project, the matter will be decided entirely on its merits, on what the country needs and on what the city near it requires.</P>
    <P>I would point out to the Minister that this airport is only five miles from the City of Cork.  We have a good many unemployed there.  We talk a lot about rising prices, the cost of commodities, and so forth.  To my mind, the first essential is to provide the worker with the means of purchasing the commodities.  It is very little good to a worker to learn that the price of butter has been reduced 3d. or 4d. a lb. if he has nothing but the dole. However, if he had £5, £6 or £7 a week working out there he would be able to go home to his family as a working man rather than as a man who has no work and no opportunity of finding it and has nothing to keep him and his family but the dole.  Even if £1,000,000 were spent on the project, I submit that that money would be circulated to the general benefit of the community.  Most of the work is semi-skilled in nature and the ordinary men would be employed on it.</P>
    <P>The money these men would earn would be spent on the purchase of essential commodities and it would thus circulate through the shops to different parts of the country, to the general benefit of the community.  Furthermore, <Col N="1280" /> our country would have what other small nations now have, that is, an alternative airport within easy distance of the city.  The men with hackney cars and the buses would do more business.  The people would get the service and could be linked up with the existing airports at Shannon and Dublin if they wanted to go further afield.  All that would help to provide against local unemployment.</P>
    <P>We often hear talk about industries and about people looking for industries. I would direct the attention of the Minister to this point.  I happen to be Chairman of Cork County Library Committee.  For the past five years we have been trying to get books that are out of circulation rebound but without success.  We might get 1,000 done in a year.  At the moment, we have 15,000 books that cannot be put into circulation because we cannot get people in Ireland to bind them. The Eagle Company started about two years ago.  They do about 2,000 books a year for us but that does not represent a fifth of what we require.  We got an offer from Scotland to rebind the whole 15,000 books and send them back to us in four months, carriage paid each way, and they offered to do it at a lower figure than we could get it done elsewhere.  People are looking for industries.  There is one.  This matter became public property when, eventually, we published it.  Then we found that there are bookbinders in Dublin and elsewhere who have been idle for years.  That is an example of a small industry which needs very little capital.  It might need a paper cutter and a press of some kind and a few other commodities and one or two skilled men.  Nevertheless, we have these things going to waste, so to speak, and nobody has the initiative to take them up, for some reason or another.</P>
    <P>I was sorry to see the other day that the Minister for Agriculture stated that the flight from the land was in many ways hypercritical.  If we had local industries in the towns they would attract people and give employment to the surplus population on the land.  No doubt this is really not a matter for the Minister's Department <Col N="1281" /> and perhaps I should not go into it now but I feel I should refer to the surplus on the land.  The land is slow.  They put in crops in the spring and wait until the autumn to harvest them.  Then they have to pay the man from whom they bought the seed, and so forth.  The young man of to-day wants to handle a certain amount of ready money.  Really, the only way he can get ready money is by the establishment of subsidiary industries in the various towns throughout the country. We should all help and give our ideas: we should stimulate local initiative.  In that way, we might perhaps help the Minister and his Department.  The one thing that I feel sore about sometimes is the change of policy, the delay in policy, and so forth.  When Governments change, these fundamental things should be carried on and should remain the same.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister some questions about the E.S.B. on topics which are 100 per cent. controversial. I appeal to the Minister to see to it that if they have big built-up areas, as they have&mdash;these areas have extended considerably in recent years and are almost like new townships&mdash;it should balance against what they are doing in the rural areas and that they should not cut out people in remote rural districts who are living in little pockets of land just because it is uneconomic to connect them.  The people in those remote districts need the electricity just as much as the people elsewhere and, if we are going to stop the flight from the land, will it not be done by giving these people in the remote districts the amenities which other people enjoy?</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to ensure that there will be no falling down in that regard and that these pockets will not be left without being linked up.  I want to mention also the charges&mdash;charges which the people cannot afford to pay.  As I say, these things should be balanced by the facility with which the E.S.B. can serve numerous houses in the townships and their environments.  The advantage they get in that way should, in part, be devoted towards subsidising from their own funds the linking <Col N="1282" /> up of the system in the more remote areas.</P>
    <P>I do not think I should delay the House by saying anything more at this stage.  The Minister will pick out from the discussion the things he considers most practicable and most easily put into effect.  In that way we all hope that progress will be made, that the country will get from industry the national wealth which will improve employment and that the people will get the services they urgently need.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Esmonde summed up the situation very well when he complimented the Minister on the exhaustive report he gave when he presented the Estimate to the House. The Minister covered a very wide field and left very little out.  It is very important that new industries should be established but it is more important still that existing industries should be maintained and encouraged.</P>
      <P>I am deeply interested in the railway industry and would like to get an assurance from the Minister that no danger will threaten the relative prosperity of the Dundalk railway works. I was glad to hear a Deputy on the opposite side of the House refer to this point.  He also asked the Minister for an assurance to that effect.</P>
      <P>With the present dieselisation of the railway system, it is only natural that great economies will be effected on the part of the management but there is a danger attached to these economies. The constant employment of the employees may be jeopardised.  As an exrailway employee and as a Dundalk man I would impress upon the Minister the necessity of securing that the prosperity of the railway works will not be endangered.  I am sure everyone appreciates the great interest the Minister is taking in this very important industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another part of my county which is undergoing hardships at the moment&mdash;Greenore.  The Minister knows it very well and I am sure he has done everything possible to expedite the initiation of an industry that is supposed to start there.  About 12 months ago a well-known firm expressed its intention to extend its field <Col N="1283" /> of operations to Greenore but, so far, there is no sign of its coming.  Even though it is a private concern, the Minister would do well to use his good offices and influence in getting this industry established.  There is great unemployment in the area which at one time was very prosperous.  Ships plied across the Channel and the railway operated from Dundalk and gave great employment.  I hope the Minister will do all he possibly can to relieve the acute unemployment that at present exists in the area.  Greenore has become of late a deserted village owing to unemployment and emigration.</P>
    <P>I would also like to refer to the recent announcement with regard to tanneries.  I sympathise with the people who are affected by the threatened close down of Portlaw tannery but I would remind the Minister that it is important that any restrictions he intends to place on the importation of raw material for the manufacture of boots and shoes should not adversely affect the boot factories.  Taking the overall picture, the number employed in the boot factories vastly outweighs the number employed in the tanneries. Of course, that is poor consolation for the people who are affected by the close down of the tanneries.  There is a happy medium.  I do not envy the Minister his task in trying to solve the difficulty but I would remind him that, as Deputy Jack Lynch said, very often during the year the workers in these boot factories are on short time.  As there are many thousands of people employed in these factories that is regrettable.  A great deal of thought must be concentrated on this problem before a definite decision is made.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of the oil refinery, I do not want to refer to it unduly but I would like to bring to the Minister's notice the facilities that exist in Greenore for an oil refinery. I know the Minister will say that it is a matter for the three oil companies concerned but I would remind the Minister that Greenore is the only deep-water port between Dublin and Belfast, which is a very important consideration.</P>
    <P>Very often there are questions on the <Col N="1284" /> Order Paper relating to the E.S.B. and to the problems of electrification.  Very often the Minister is asked to use his influence with the E.S.B. in the solving of some problem, for instance, the problem of having a certain area served.  The answer invariably is that the Minister has no function in the matter and therefore cannot do anything. I fail to understand how the Minister has no function in the matter in view of the fact that public moneys are advanced to this semi-State body to enable them to carry out their work. I would ask the Minister to do all he can to resolve such difficulties because many hardships exist as a result of areas being by-passed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>When a speaker indicates some of the difficulties that beset the Minister for Industry and Commerce in his attempt to find some solution to the closing down of the Portlaw tannery, I think it is only right that that speaker should, at the same time, indicate to the Minister that he must consider not only the Portlaw tannery in my constituency of Waterford, or in any other constituency, but the overall employment position and the keeping alive of industry generally throughout the country.  Notwithstanding that, I would urge on the Minister in connection with the situation that exists in Portlaw that he and his Department should make every effort they possibly can to ensure that the 300 workers there get every chance of being taken back into the industry for which they trained at the earliest possible moment.</P>
      <P>It is not necessary here to ventilate the history of the Portlaw tannery and its gradual closing down.  As late as last Thursday evening my fellow-Deputy, Deputy Ormonde, gave the House an idea of the position.  While he gave the position as he saw it, I would like to indicate how a divergence of views can exist, not between Deputy Ormonde and myself, as to the reasons for the closing down, but between Deputy Ormonde and the ex-Minister for Industry and Commerce, a member of Deputy Ormonde's own Party, Deputy Seán Lemass.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lemass, speaking on Wednesday, 23rd March, is reported at <Col N="1285" /> column 552 of the Official Report as saying:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Minister has announced that he is placing restrictions on the importation of substitute soling.  That is all right as far as it goes, but so far as I know there is no power in the Minister to prevent anybody in this country from manufacturing this synthetic soling&mdash;and I do not think there is any difficulty in doing it.  Any effect of the restrictions on the importation of substitute soling can only be very short-lived.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>At columns 553 and 554 on the same day, in the same debate, Deputy Lemass said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is wrong to think that the problem of our tanners and boot factories is due entirely to the emergence of this synthetic soling material.  There have been synthetic soling materials on the market for many years.  The real problem has been the loss of the competitive advantages they had during the period when that control over hide exports was in operation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is Deputy Seán Lemass's view. Deputy Ormonde's view is, and I quote from the Official Report of 24th March, column 814:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If the Minister approves of the importation of these materials in such quantities as to put a one-time flourishing home industry completely out of action, he should say so and give his reasons therefor, and he should be further prepared to arrange for the utilisation of part of the premises, the plant and equipment, and the employees of Irish Tanners, Limited, in the production of these imported materials which are being brought in in such large quantities by our boot factories, the majority of which are under the control of English directors and English managers.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>At the same column, Deputy Ormonde states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Why, then, he has taken no action, and not only has taken no action but has sanctioned the establishment of an industry in another southern town, thereby killing all <Col N="1286" /> hope of recovery for the Portlaw concern, is inexplicable.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It seems very strange that Deputy Ormonde should believe, for whatever reason, that it is the Minister's failure to restrict imports of synthetic soling material that is causing the close down of Portlaw while the ex-Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Lemass, says that that has no connection with it at all.  In fact, he goes further, as I will show, and gives his reasons for that statement.  Is it that an effort is being made to hang on the present Minister responsibility for causing the close down?  If that is so, then I would like to say here and now that as far back as October, 1953, I attended a meeting of the workers in that tannery.  At that time they were under threat of being put on short time.  We were told&mdash;I, as a Deputy and their trade union organiser, and also Deputy Ormonde who attended the meeting with me&mdash;that the difficulty was being caused because synthetic soling materials were being allowed into the country.  We suggested a deputation to the then Minister; but the Minister of the day, Deputy Seán Lemass, had just shortly prior to that actually invited Dunlops of Cork to go into the production of synthetic soling materials.  Dunlops have gone into production and are at the moment weekly increasing their output of foam rubber.</P>
    <P>I think Deputy Lemass's action was quite right.  If the boot and shoe industry needs synthetic soling materials in order to compete, it is preferable that that material should be manufactured in the country rather than imported from elsewhere under licence.  That is my opinion, even though such manufacture affects my constituency.  Taking the overall situation, it is good policy.  But I do not believe that the production of synthetic soling materials or its importation has in any way affected Portlaw.  It is a well-known fact that for the past ten or 15 years over three quarters of the production of Portlaw has gone to the British market.  It went there, not because of any particular advantage in relation to Portlaw as compared with any other tannery but <Col N="1287" /> because of the fact that British leather could not be produced at the same price at which Irish leather was produced.  The price of hides in Britain was double what it was here.  The price of hides has altered since here and has increased by a couple of pence per lb.  It is a fact that there is at the moment a surplus of British hides and prices there have dropped 50 per cent.  That is what is causing the upset.  These factors were not within the control of Deputy Lemass when he was Minister for Industry and Commerce. Neither are they within the control of the present Minister.</P>
    <P>This is a regrettable fact, but it is a fact we must face: the manufacture of heavy sole leather is on its way out. After all, leather has been used for boots and shoes and other things since the middle of the last century.  It has had a good innings.  The day of rubber is at hand.  Indeed, there are some who think that even it is on its way out. Plastics will be the material of the future.  Plastics are with us at the moment and they will be more so in the years to come.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the people in Portlaw that they should cut their losses, take time by the forelock and endeavour to get into plastics in order to meet the demand.  It is ridiculous to talk of stop-gap remedies for such a big industry.  It is quite true we could put pressure on the Government, perhaps, to secure a limited amount of employment for three or four or five weeks by means of various grants from various Departments This is an old industry and it would be a worthwhile move if the Industrial Development Authority, or the Minister, through the Industrial Development Authority, had a consultation with the Portlaw people and see if any alternative industry could be set up in that very fine factory on which so much money has been spent within a short time.</P>

      <P>I shall read the part I have underlined, but it might not be the portion Deputy Briscoe would choose to have read.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce is replying as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In October, 1952, Dunlop's factory here was supplied with a list of imported materials, synthetic materials, and told by the Fianna Fáil Government that they should try to manufacture those commodities here.  For what?  I suggest only for use.  Deputy Ormonde says that I sanctioned the establishment of an industry in another town to do harm to Portlaw.  What I am going to say now will be embarrassing to Deputy Ormonde, but let the Deputy not forget to tell the truth when he is next in Portlaw, and when he is there let him not forget to tell the people, especially those who voted for him, that on the 16th January, 1953, a manufacturing licence was issued to Dunlop's authorising that firm to manufacture rubber sheeting, including soling, and that new manufacture licence to make rubber soling was issued to Dunlop's in 1953 by the Fianna Fáil Government.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>It will be of use when I go to Portlaw.  As far as I am concerned as a Labour Deputy the unemployment position continues to be one of the main problems which should have the especial attention of the Government, and it is probably due to the present Minister for Industry and Commerce that any improvements have been obtained.  If we can quote from the sheets, the latest one says that there were 70,879 on the total live register on the 12th March last, that is 6,000 better than this time 12 months ago, but, as I said before on the Supplies and Services Bill, is that an indication of progress?  It certainly is not looked upon by me as being a very happy state of affairs in this country. These figures do not present the whole picture.  Any of us who are men of the world and who know world conditions as they are realise that there are thousands and thousands of boys and girls of 17, 18 and 19 years of age of middle-class parents who do not register at the unemployment exchanges even though they are idle at home, waiting for and seeking work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel quite sure that if the overall picture were taken there would be another five or six or up to ten thousand added to the register.  It is our job to try and have as many as possible absorbed in employment.  The only vent or escape for these boys and girls appears to be emigration because not all of them can be taken up in the services&mdash;the Civil Service and the service of the local authorities and the various other places in which these people ordinarily seek employment. Instead they have to emigrate to Britain and endeavour to become employed <Col N="1290" /> as nurses and clerks.  The loss of these young people must be a cause for grave anxiety.  It is bound to tell against this country because if such a trend is not checked we will have a preponderance of the weak, the sickly and the old in this country with our youth going to other lands.  That would be a very serious situation.</P>
    <P>Private enterprise does not seem to have dealt with the problem.  Much has been done by successive Governments, and in saying that I should like to give credit to the Fianna Fáil Government. In the early days they did encourage and stimulate industries; they did cause to be erected many factories throughout the country which are doing very good work.  In my town of Dungarvan, we have benefited considerably from the factories built there during the Fianna Fáil régime.  I never like to take away their due from any people.  As the saying goes, successive native Governments have been discredited one by the other.  Each Government in its own way did something and we went on bit by bit.  It is not right that one Government should try to take away from what the other Government did when in office.</P>
    <P>I think it is safe to say that private enterprise seems to have tapped all the sources they are likely to tap in the main.  We have had 30 years of native Government and whether it is because the interest rate is not big enough or the risk of losing money in the remaining untapped sources is too great, there appears to be a falling off or a slowing up of private investment in industry in this country.  I welcome the Tánaiste's statement that he is thinking on the lines of encouraging foreign capital.  If he could induce foreign capital to come in here without being detrimental to Irish capital investment I think it would be a good line to follow.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be from the frying pan into the fire.  There was a Socialist Government in England not so long ago and it is going back again soon.  The Minister should instruct the Industrial Development Authority to investigate the position as to what factories could be established here even though the interest on the money might be small and the risk of loss great but which might actually break even.  I am aware that private enterprise, whether foreign or Irish, is not anxious to put money into industry where the risk is big and return small but we should not judge industry in that way only.  The Industrial Development Authority should put to the Minister and he in turn to the House information about industries which we are capable of sustaining, and leave it to the House whether or not Government money might be invested in them.  If we only got employment for 100 people, and the likelihood is that we would get employment for many more, Government money so invested would be well spent.  I think Dáil Éireann is the institution which would be able to judge properly whether it should be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last speaker, Deputy Coburn, I think it was, spoke of the oil refinery. I do not want to speak on behalf of Waterford or anywhere else.  When most Deputies stand up to speak of the oil refinery they seem to make some special claim as to where that should be.  I do not think any of us in Waterford want to make any claim for the oil refinery because I think it would <Col N="1292" /> be a waste of time.  The oil refinery will be put where the people financing it decide is to their best advantage and nowhere else.</P>
    <P>Any comment or suggestion I would make would be a waste of time.  However, I would say this, time is passing and if the oil companies cannot make up their mind within a reasonable time, the Government might take into consideration dealing with one company and securing their technical knowledge and co-operation.  If the companies cannot unite to set up the oil refinery the Government and one company might find it a good investment to set it up and to give us the consequent good results which the Tánaiste indicated when he announced that as a practical step, that the oil companies were to get together and establish a refinery.</P>
    <P>There is just one other comment I would like to make before I conclude. It is in regard to the oft-repeated cry in connection with the difficulties between labour and management.  We get from the management the statement: &ldquo;If the workers would co-operate, if they would produce more, we would be able to advance in the export market, we would be able to get people employed.&rdquo;  But we on the labour side, speaking from the trade union point of view, always reply by saying: &ldquo;Why should we produce more?  If we produce more that only means that some of us are going to be let go quicker than we were before.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Give us a say in the management, explain your difficulties to us, let our representatives see why these difficulties are there and we will give full co-operation.  Then if we produce more let us get not a bonus share but take our rightful share in the increased profits that will come because we produced them.  If any industry were prepared to tackle their problem on those lines you would get much more co-operation from the workers.  Very often it is just a fear, a fear not perhaps even justified but while that fear is there it is going to be difficult to convince workers that increased output will give them anything but unemployment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1293" /> If the management set up a system of taking into their confidence the leaders elected by the workers and of taking them into management, they in turn would let the information they got percolate through the industry and the workers would see the position as it really was.  If they had a knowledge as to how the position would alter, worsen or improve, and knew that if dividends increased they would get their share, you would find all the co-operation which has been asked for and been received in the British factories since war-time.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the employers that they should try that for a change.  I am quite sure that Irish industrial magazines will attack and oppose anybody who makes such a suggestion but there are good employers in this country and very often well-intentioned employers who have been induced to distrust their employees.  I would say to those employers that a little more confidence, a little more understanding and a little more plain talk between both sides could lead to an improvement for both.</P>
    <P>There is just one final point and that is the cost of living.  I, in common with the rest of the people, regret that we have not been able to reduce the cost of living to any appreciable extent within the past six months.</P>

      <P>The Prices Advisory Body is one of the means of preventing profiteering or racketeering if anything like that is tried.  It is, to my mind, a body that could do very useful work, but I still think it has not got sufficient powers.  The Minister should seriously investigate the position <i>vis-à-vis</i> the powers of the Prices Advisory Body. One of the things that happens to my own information is that on a recommendation being made to the Minister to declare the price of a certain commodity, almost within days of the price being fixed that commodity is altered by name and for quite a while escapes any action.  Something very definite should be done to ensure that simply an alteration of name or just a slight alteration in the formation of the commodity to justify an altered name will not be sufficient to escape the fixing of the price.</P>
      <P>Another factor is that the Prices Advisory Body have to act on balance sheets handed in by the employers or producers of the commodity.  All of us know that balance sheets are funny things to say the least of them.  I do not believe that all balance sheets of industrial companies and manufacturers show a true picture.  I think an auditor is employed more with a view to beating the income-tax rather than showing how the position of the firm is at the moment.  If he does his job well he will be able to prove very often a loss where a gain has taken place. If the Prices Advisory Body are not armed with sufficient technical assistance to be able to break down these balance sheets they will make a recommendation to the Minister on things that are not actually fact although they appear to be so.  Very often where a recommendation for an increase was agreed to reluctantly perhaps by the Prices Advisory Body they would, if they had known the facts, probably have refused to make that recommendation to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the things I am told is that the Prices Section of the Minister's Department appears not to be functioning very well.  A number of cases have been cited to me where increases have taken place within a short period without any request being made to the <Col N="1295" /> Prices Advisory Body.  It has been suggested that the Prices Advisory Body are not aware of these increases but surely the Prices Section of our Department of Industry and Commerce should be in a position to inform the Prices Advisory Body, the Minister himself or his Department of this change of price.  To my mind one of the most efficient ways of dealing with alterations of price without permission would be to empower, say, the police, as in the case of the food and drug inspectors, to report on variations of prices charged where fixed charges have been announced by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I have found the police the most efficient portion of the Civil Service. You give a policeman a job to do and he will do it without fear or favour.  I would therefore suggest that the Minister might seriously consider asking the Department of Justice to co-operate with the food and drugs inspectors in sending in reports either weekly, monthly or whatever way might be thought necessary to the Prices Section drawing attention to variations of prices charged on fixed-price commodities.</P>
    <P>I think that is all I have to say on Industry and Commerce.  We had quite a long session on Supplies and Services, but I would like to appeal to the Minister in my final words to give any help he possibly can to the tanning industry at Portlaw.  I am quite satisfied that if possible he will do that.  I can say that the fate of a village which has been very happy for the people who lived there for the past 20 years in full employment is tied up with the tannery industry.  Whether it is the tannery industry or some other industry it is absolutely essential, if we are not to have mass emigration from Portlaw, to have some industry set up there and operating within a very sort time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>When we come to speak of industrial development in this country we cannot get away from the fact that we are primarily an agricultural country and that our whole economy is based on our agricultural output.  We can only develop our industrial potential in relation to agricultural <Col N="1296" /> development.  When we realise that something over 80 per cent. of our total export trade comes from agriculture, when we realise the very small proportion of industrial goods which we manufacture, and when we realise the small proportion which are exported, we cannot but be convinced that industrial development here must bear some relationship to our agricultural development.  We know, no matter whether we like to admit it or not, that the pattern of Irish agriculture&mdash;the mechanics may have changed &mdash;when measured from the production end of it, has changed very little. Every one of the rural Deputies has time and again had the taunt thrown out to us that Dublin is Ireland and one cannot come into this city or leave it without being impressed that there are some grounds for this taunt which is being thrown out in regard to industrial development here.</P>
      <P>No matter by what road one approaches this City of Dublin, one finds continually factories being raised and factories completed, and while it may be argued that certain industries should be located in the capital or near the seaport there are industries based here in Dublin which, when we realise that their products have to be transported out of the city, north and south, from one end of the country to another, might be better placed elsewhere.  I think if we give certain protection and encouragement here to industrialists who want to come in here and manufacture certain goods that we should have some say in the diversion of those industries into the larger provincial towns.  There is a tendency that industrialisation here is inclined to mean the urbanisation of rural populations. I can see no advantage whatever if we absorb 10,000 people into industry and if those 10,000 people, for one reason or another, have to be ferried into the City of Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, it makes many other problems which do not meet the eye. When you have a movement of population from a rural area you have to provide for their housing, their hospitalisation, even for the erection of their churches and schools, and in many instances this movement of population <Col N="1297" /> could be to a considerable degree a rescue if we could devise some means by which we could decentralise industry and push it out of the capital City of Dublin.</P>
    <P>I began coming to Dublin 25 years ago, and I am utterly amazed when I think of the then city limits and now realise that a huge perimeter has grown up on what was once open farms and open country.  In many instances, we notice even in rural areas where we have industries that some of those industries are placed&mdash;fortunately for the towns that got them&mdash;in rather sparsely populated rural areas and you have this movement into the towns. You have the rural schools empty; you have a demand for increased school accommodation, increased housing with all the additions such as increased water and sewerage schemes.  I think there should be some definite plan and that the Department of Industry and Commerce should address itself to this all-important question of seeing that when some industrialist approaches that particular department and when a proposal is made for the promotion of a certain industry here and when certain facilities are demanded and certain concessions given, I think, taking into consideration the particular type of industry indicated, that the Minister and his Department should have some control in diverting that particular industry to a particular area.</P>
    <P>We have seen and we have read many causes put forward for the flight from the land, but I have always maintained that in industrial development in this country the emphasis should be placed more on the point that industry here should be used to absorb our surplus population from the land and to find employment for that surplus population in the towns and villages.  I notice in my constituency there has been a certain development, the erection of village schemes in certain towns which possibly at one time might get an industry, but now hopes have receded and we have the rather ridiculous and ambiguous position there of rural workers living in serviced houses in the town and forced <Col N="1298" /> to go out into the hinterland to find employment.</P>
    <P>Again, there are certain towns&mdash;and I have mentioned this many times before I became a member of this House&mdash;which were old military towns and whose whole economy was based on the army of occupation.  Then there were certain developments here, and when we did get rid of that army of occupation one of the things we have to admit is that we smashed the economy not alone of the town but also of a considerable area around it. I move to report progress.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; the Committee to sit again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave notice this morning that, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I would raise the subject-matter of the future of St. Patrick's Regional Chest Hospital in Castlerea on the Adjournment debate. The Ceann Comhairle was good enough to give me that permission.</P>
      <P>I do not like to delay people from getting to their homes, and to make things awkward generally for those who are associated with this House, but I feel that this subject is one of the gravest importance to the staff and workers in this sanatorium.  Not only is it of importance to these people, but it is of importance to many people in the surrounding townlands in Castlerea area, and to many workers in the town of Castlerea as well.  A serious situation exists there to-day. As time goes on, that situation will become progressively worse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past six weeks or so a number of questions was asked in this House about the future of this sanatorium, and the Minister, in his various replies, pointed out that the future of this sanatorium was under consideration. He also pointed out that, if it was considered desirable, or if a decision was made, to restore this institution to its former status of mental hospital, the question of the security and employment of the workers would receive consideration.  I questioned the <Col N="1299" /> Minister in this House on the 10th February, 1955, and in the course of a supplementary question, column 180 of the Dáil Debates, of the 10th February, Volume 148, I asked:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. McQuillan: Could the Minister give any indication, in view of the anxiety felt all round the Castlerea area and the number of people who will lose their employment when the sanatorium is closed down whether it will revert back to use as a mental hospital or whether it will be utilised for some other health purpose?</P>
    <P>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins: It is a wise thing to meet trouble when it comes.</P>
    <P>Mr. McQuillan: The trouble is there now.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Trouble was there on that date with regard to employment, and the trouble is worse to-day, and will be worse as time goes on, until we get the final decision of the Minister.  The Minister, in the course of one of his replies, pointed out that when this institution was taken over from the mental hospital authorities, the take-over was purely on a temporary basis, until the regional sanatorium in Merlin Park would be erected.  That means that, in view of the fact that the sanatorium in Merlin Park is almost completed, within a very short space of time the transfer of patients from Castlerea Sanatorium to Merlin Park will have been completed.</P>
    <P>I am not personally concerned as to what actual use the Minister in his wisdom decides to put this institution in Castlerea.  We are all glad to see that the fight against the scourge of T.B. has met with such success that it has enabled, or will enable, the Minister to dispense with an institution such as Castlerea Sanatorium.  But we have to consider the fact that many people depend for their livelihood on the benefits given to them by the work in this institution, on the employment on farms in the surrounding area, and to workers in the shops in the town itself.  Although we are able to rejoice that the need for a sanatorium no longer exists in the area, yet I believe the responsibility is there on the Minister, <Col N="1300" /> or any Minister, to ensure that the large number of workers concerned do not become unemployed, and as a result have to leave, not alone that area, but the country, to join the other groups of emigrants who stream from it each year.  As I said, the Minister suggested that it was time enough to meet trouble when it came.</P>
    <P>I want to give some facts to the House with regard to the employment situation in the sanatorium at the moment.  On the 1st December, 1954, there were 281 people employed in the sanatorium.  On the 1st March, 1955, that number was reduced to 262, for the reason that a number of patients were being transferred from Castlerea Sanatorium to the institute in Merlin Park.  Now the weekly wage bill in December, 1954, was £1,325 per week and the weekly wage bill on the 1st March, 1955, was down to £1,238 odd per week.  The contracts to traders in Castlerea town for goods and services supplied to the sanatorium for the year 1954 were worth £21,100 odd. In the same year, the small farmers in the vicinity of Castlerea received £2,500 for the supply of hand-won turf to that institution.  In the same year, those farmers received approximately £400 for the supply of hay to the institution. These figures may not sound large to this House, which deals in terms of millions, but the figures represent the livelihood of many people in that district, which is poor as it stands at any time.</P>
    <P>The total consumption of fuel in that institution in 1948, when it was a mental hospital, was 2,000 tons of turf per year.  In 1954 the consumption had gone up to 7,000 tons per year.  I need not develop the employment that the cutting and the delivery of that turf has meant to a number of people in the area.  As the numbers dwindle in the institution, the need for that supply of turf dwindles.  As the number of the inmates dwindles and as the staff dwindles, so also does the need for the purchase of goods from the traders become less.  In turn, these traders find it necessary, as they have assured me, gradually to lay off their staffs.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that the employment question will be dealt with when <Col N="1301" /> the necessity arises for a change back from a T.B. sanatorium to a mental hospital institution but, while we are awaiting that decision, patients are being transferred weekly to Galway and each week that the transfer of patients takes place a number of people are losing their jobs in the sanatorium, so that by the time the decision is made to restore it as a mental institution there will be no problem there with regard to employment.  The staff will have gone.</P>
    <P>In his answer to me the Minister pointed out that a number of people who are at present on the staff at Castlerea will be eligible for transfer to Merlin Park in Galway.  I want the House to understand that at the present moment there are 262 people employed in the sanatorium, including doctors, nurses and staff of all description. Of that 262, only 38 are eligible for transfer to Merlin Park. If the Minister wishes to point out to the House, as he will, that if this reverts to a mental hospital institution that that will mean employment for many of the people there in extra staff on that new controlling body, I wish to point out that in 1948 the total number employed in Castlerea, when it was a mental hospital, was 53.  If it reverts, the maximum that can be held of the present group employed in the sanatorium is in the region of 80.  That means that there are approximately 200 people whose employment is at stake at the moment and whose services are gradually being dispensed with on a weekly basis.</P>
    <P>That is a most serious position at the moment.  There is a feeling of gloom and despondency amongst the staff in that sanatorium.  They do not know on whose neck the axe is going to fall next.  The first light shower of dismissal notices has descended on the staff like the first few flakes of snow in winter.  I want action taken before there is a shower of dismissal notices on these people in the sanatorium.</P>
    <P>To-day, in order, if possible, to get the Minister to let us know his mind, I asked him whether he considered the possibility of utilising St. Patrick's Regional Chest Hospital, Castlerea, for the purpose of treating mental <Col N="1302" /> patients who suffer from T.B..  The Minister assured me that this matter was under consideration.  On numerous occasions in this House suggestions have been made as to the future use of this sanatorium.  I find that all these suggestions are being considered.  I want the Minister to understand that I am raising this matter, not in a spirit of controversy, but in order to relieve the anxiety of the workers about their future.</P>
    <P>Many of these workers have families and dependents and they do not know from day to day when they will be told by the responsible authorities: &ldquo;We regret very much but your services are terminated.&rdquo;  If within the next three or four months there is another 60 or 70 people laid off, then, when the Minister makes known his decision with regard to the future use of this institution, all these people will have scattered to the four winds in the meantime.  It is to ensure right now that these people's future will be safeguarded that I want the Minister, when he is replying, to hold out some hope to them that his decision with regard to this burning question will be known within the shortest possible space of time.</P>
    <P>I want to repeat to the Minister that there is no suggestion of pressure being brought to bear on him so far as I am concerned to have this institute held as a T.B. hospital.  Let the Minister utilise it for whatever purpose he and his Department consider best but let them in making the fresh arrangements for the use of this institute take into consideration the fact that of the total number who are now employed, 261, only 38 can be transferred to Merlin Park, that approximately another 40 of them can be employed if the institute reverts to a mental hospital establishment, and that that will leave approximately 200 people who will have to be alternatively accommodated.</P>
    <P>There are other aspects of this problem that I could deal with.  There is a number of small farmers with a valuation ranging from £3 to £8 within five or six miles of Castlerea.  Their sons work in the sanatorium to help <Col N="1303" /> their parents to rear families on uneconomic holdings in the Castlerea area.  Within the last four years, three of the best bogs in the West of Ireland in the Castlerea area were closed down by Bord na Móna with a consequent loss of good employment to hundreds of young people in the area.  The sole remaining means of employment in Castlerea at the moment is this institution.</P>
    <P>We are not&mdash;I want to repeat again &mdash;suggesting to the Minister that it should be held as a T.B. institute on the present lines if it is found that there is no further need for it as such but we want to make sure that the employment of these people in the sanatorium, the welfare of the small farmers in the locality and the security of the shopboys and others in Castlerea is preserved.  I want the Minister, when he is replying, to hold out immediate hope that a good alternative will be given to Castlerea if and when his decision is made with regard to the use of the institution.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I urge him to make this decision, if at all possible, within the next two or three weeks before further staff are laid off.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. T.F. O'Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I must confess that, although I have listened carefully to all Deputy McQuillan has said, I found it difficult to understand clearly what was troubling him.  He ended by saying he was not to be taken as suggesting that, if the stage should arrive when the institution in Castlerea is no longer needed as a sanatorium, its use for that purpose should not be continued. That is quite understandable and I am glad he said that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the present lines, I said.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad Deputy McQuillan said that, but I cannot follow him when he then goes on to say: &ldquo;But what about those employed and the people in the area who have come to depend on the sanatorium for certain purposes of their own?&rdquo;.  I would like to make this clear, however it may be misunderstood, <Col N="1304" /> that my concern as Minister for Health&mdash;and it would be the same concern of any of my predecessors&mdash;is for the sick and needy and for nothing else; and I rejoice when a stage may be reached when it is possible to dispense with any building for use as a hospital of any kind.</P>
      <P>I do not think that it is a correct approach, no matter how attractive it may be for short-term purposes, to suggest that it should be the concern of any hospital authority to maintain its use as a hospital when in fact its use is no longer required.  It is a good thing, though one cannot be definite at the moment, that we begin to see, even though it be only vaguely, the ending of the big social problem of T.B.  That is a welcome development and if, as a result, sanatoria, big and small, throughout the country are no longer required and have to be closed down, I rejoice that that will take place.</P>
      <P>It has been the policy of my predecessors, with which I completely agree, for some years back to provide for the construction of sanatoria on rational lines.  It was decided some years ago to build a number of regional sanatoria, not hospitals that would cater for patients in the immediate locality alone but large institutions that would cater for a particular region.  These regional sanatoria are now generally going into operation&mdash; some of them are already in operation. Merlin Park is the western regional sanatorium and it was the intention, when it was decided to build Merlin Park, that it should be the T.B. sanatorium for the entire western region&mdash;which, of course, includes the County of Roscommon.  It was intended that when Merlin Park went into full operation the smaller sanatoria in the West would be closed down and there would be this regional centre providing a centralised service for all T.B. cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When Castlerea was opened as a sanatorium in 1949, there was opposition from the mental hospital authority, in the first place, because they felt that the overcrowding conditions in the western mental region were very severe and that it was unreasonable to ask them to hand over, even for a <Col N="1305" /> good purpose such as the care of T.B. patients, an institution that was needed badly.  An undertaking was given that the transfer would be only a temporary transfer and that when the need had gone the institution would be handed back to the mental hospital authority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>And that the employment of all who were there was guaranteed, that no one would lose employment as a result of the changeover. There was a specific guarantee to that effect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want the Minister to elaborate on the guarantees.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>There was also considerable opposition from certain people in Castlerea, who felt that the then Minister was bringing the plague to Castlerea and that it was a terrible thing, that it was lowering the town of Castlerea to have them deprived of their mental hospital and given a sanatorium instead.  It just shows that public opinion changes and that the good work that has undoubtedly been done in our T.B. service over some years has been effective.  People no longer talk about T.B. in a whisper and no longer regard it as a blot on a family escutcheon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There still remains the problem of the proper function for this building if, as I hope, it is possible to provide for all the patients in Merlin Park in the future.  I want to make it clear to Deputy McQuillan and to the House that the primary function of the Minister for Health is to ensure that such building as are available to me and to health authorities will be used to the best possible advantage for the relief and care of the sick and needy. In doing that I do not mind how many corns may be trod upon.  That is not my concern: my concern is to see that the sick are cared for and that each building available to each health authority in the country is used to the best purpose for that end.  Naturally, if at the same time it is possible to provide a benefit for the people of any <Col N="1306" /> particular area, I would be the happiest person in the country to be able to do so.</P>
