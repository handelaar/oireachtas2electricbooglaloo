      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state, in detail, the basis on which the Prices Advisory Body calculates, in respect of bacon, the retail prices recommended by them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Norton) William Norton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Norton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in a position to add anything to the reply which I gave to the Deputy on the 25th May, when I explained that the maximum retail bacon prices recommended by the Prices Advisory Body and specified in the different columns of the schedule to the Bacon (Maximum Prices) Order were related to the ex-factory bacon prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaureenOCarroll" hpid="Mrs. O'Carroll Mrs. O'Carroll">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I have not made my question clear to the Minister. I asked him last week what it costs to cure and sell one cwt. of bacon and he said he had not got the figures.  I thought by putting down this question <Col N="530" /> I might get some information as to how these prices are arrived at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>While the activities of the Department of Industry and Commerce are widespread, my functions do not make me responsible for looking after the methods of killing pigs or the cost of killing them or the manner in which they are killed and that information is not compiled in the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaureenOCarroll" hpid="Mrs. O'Carroll Mrs. O'Carroll">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister say where I would get that information?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask if the Minister is responsible for fixing the prices of bacon?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The function of the Prices Advisory Body is to fix the profit margins on bacon after the bacon has been killed and cured, but inquiries as to how pigs are killed, when killed and how the bacon is cured or what is the cost of the killing and curing&mdash; these are not functions of the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>How can the prices of bacon be determined unless the cost of killing and curing is assessed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is cutting back further, and these are activities for which the Prices Advisory Body has no responsibility.  What the Prices Advisory Body does is to ascertain what is the ex-factory price of bacon; in other words, what price does the wholesaler pay for the bacon after it has been killed and cured.  When they ascertain what the ex-factory price of bacon is, in other words, at the point when it is delivered from the factory to the wholesaler, it is on that calculation <Col N="531" /> that the Prices Advisory Body fixes the prices.  Deputy Mrs. O'Carroll's question was what did it cost to kill pigs and what did it cost to cure the pigs.  These are activities outside the functions of the Department and I cannot answer the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there any method whereby the profits and costs of the pig-curing companies can be checked?</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Cosgrave) Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Cosgrave)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £260,700 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1956, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for External Affairs, and of certain Services administered by that Office (No. 16 of 1924), including a Grant-in-Aid.</P>
      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to take the Estimate for the Department of External Affairs, Vote 58, and the Estimate for International Co-operation, Vote 59, together, as has been the practice in previous years.  The Estimate for the Department of External Affairs for 1955-56 submitted at £391,000 shows a net decrease of £12,000 on the figure for 1954-55.  This decrease is attributable in the main to a reduction in the Irish News Agency subvention.</P>
      <P>The headquarters salary sub-head shows a decrease of £2,250 due chiefly to a reduction in the number of counsellor and third secretary posts.  The salary sub-head for representatives abroad is increased by £3,000.  The increase is due to the fact that provision is made for part of the year for the posting of a permanent official at counsellor level at the Council of Europe in Strasbourg.  The provision included for this item is £3,600 and includes estimated expenditure on office assistance.  A reduction of £900 is shown in sub-head B (3)&mdash;postage, stationery, telegrams, and telephones&mdash; in respect of offices abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish News Agency sub-head at £35,000 is lower by £10,000 than last year's figure.  This has been made possible by the fact that in 1954-55 an additional advance of £10,000 over the amount provided (£45,000) for that year was made to the agency for the specific purpose of liquidating liabilities carried from previous financial years.  This additional advance was met from savings on other sub-heads of the Vote. <Col N="539" /> Other sub-heads of the Vote are unchanged.</P>
    <P>I am sure I am reflecting the sentiment of the whole House in expressing deep satisfaction at the remarkable recovery of His Holiness, Pope Pius XII, from the serious illness which beset him last December.  At the same time, I think that all Deputies will join with me according to our custom in welcoming His Holiness's representative here, his Excellency the Most Reverend Monsignor Levame who has succeeded his Excellency the Most Reverend Monsignor O'Hara as Apostolic Nuncio in Ireland.</P>
    <P>One of the first matters of which we must take note, in any survey of the events in the outside world with which our people is concerned is a tragic fact: the fact that, despite a certain easing in world tensions, religious persecution continues to oppress mankind over great areas of the globe.  We deeply regret and deplore religious persecution wherever occurring and whatever form it takes.  Our history is evidence of our determination to secure religious and political liberty. In the past the generations fought for one as strenuously as the other and indeed the fight for freedom was also often a fight for the Faith.  It is, therefore, possible for our people to appreciate and sympathise with those in many lands who are forced to make heavy sacrifices for religious liberty and the freedom to practise the Christian religion without dictation.  I know that I speak for the House and the country when expressing the fervent prayer and hope that the sufferings of all those afflicted may be eased, and that the statesmen of the world who are so soon to meet to attempt to alleviate the causes of international tension, may attend in particular to the need for safeguarding religious freedom if a true and lasting peace is to be made.</P>
    <P>The apparent improvement in the relations between the great powers is a welcome advance on the situation which has existed since the beginning of the Cold War.  Those in a position to know consider that for some time <Col N="540" /> there has been a perceptible improvement in the relations between what is known as East and West and this change has been reflected in the circumstances which made it possible to arrange for the forthcoming conference at Geneva.  These &ldquo;at the summit&rdquo; talks offer a better prospect for a lessening of tension.  Peace-loving peoples can only hope that the deterrent effect of such an immeasurable catastrophe as war with modern weapons would entail will prevent the recurrence of another war.  We look to the great nations faithfully to discharge their duties as trustees for humanity and civilisation.  While Ireland has no great material strength or wealth we can make a contribution towards the cause of world peace.</P>
    <P>I shall have something to say in a moment about the problem of Partition in itself but at this stage I should like to refer to it in the context of our external relations generally.  There is no conflict whatever between the pursuit of Irish unity and a policy of co-operation with peoples who, like ourselves, have a Christian and democratic way of life.  A greater consciousness of our share in the common destiny of these peoples need not mean any abandonment of our claim to unity &mdash;for that we can never abandon. It is in reality the alternative&mdash; isolationism&mdash;which would mean the abandonment not perhaps of our formal claim to unity but of any hope whatever of achieving it.  This country cannot be united until its people are united.  Isolation or aggressive policies tend to divide us more and more fundamentally from the majority of our fellow-countrymen in the Six Counties.  On the other hand, the more we direct our activities towards playing a part suitable to our means and geographical position in the solution of the great problems that confront Western Europe as a whole, the more it will become apparent to the people of the Six Counties also that their destiny is one with ours just as ours is one with the peoples of Western Europe.</P>
    <P>Most of us in this House who have given serious consideration to the great problem of Partition will agree <Col N="541" /> that it is a problem for which there is no quick solution.  Spectacular actions and &ldquo;stunts&rdquo; of various kinds do not bring us nearer to a solution: they take us further away.  We who desire real unity in this country&mdash; which must in the long run be a unity of minds&mdash;know that we must work for it by methods which have nothing novel or spectacular about them.</P>
    <P>We must, in the phrase of an Ulster industrialist, promote &ldquo;more neighbourly relations&rdquo; between the two sections of our people.  That is a necessary step towards unity.  Neighbourly relations come by working together and we are already working together, as the House knows, on several joint undertakings or cooperative projects&mdash;the G.N.R., the Foyle Fisheries, the Erne hydroelectric scheme and, more recently, my colleague, the Minister for Education, announced a scheme whereby pictures will be loaned from the gallery in Dublin to the Belfast Art Gallery.  I should like to see more projects of that kind and also more joint projects of a social and cultural kind.  It is good, for example, that more and more Ulster Protestants are coming down here on holidays, meeting their co-religionists and seeing for themselves that this is a free country, and that the fears of &ldquo;Catholic persecution&rdquo; which have long been inculcated among them are groundless and absurd.  It is good that a non-political and non-sectarian body like the Irish Association should be doing its unobtrusive and valuable work encouraging contacts between Irishmen who may be politically divided but share a consciousness of being Irish.  I hope, by the way, that I will not damage this body by praising it here and that some Unionist spokesman may be moved to &ldquo;take the harm off&rdquo; my remarks by adding his approval!  We welcome also the signs in a certain section of the Unionist Press, and among some influential Unionist politicians, of a more broad-minded and enlightened spirit&mdash;a rejection, in the words of one of them, of the idea that the minority must be &ldquo;kept down&rdquo; while the majority remain &ldquo;top&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That, unfortunately, is not the whole <Col N="542" /> story.  There are still some very dark spots of bigotry and discrimination in the Six Counties.  One of the most useful things we can do at present, in the interest both of those who are suffering from this discrimination and also of that goodwill among Irishmen which must precede eventual unity, is to shed a clear but dispassionate light into these dark places.  This my Department is endeavouring to do, as a most important part of its general task of making the facts about Partition known abroad.  For example, we recently published, in our Bulletin, a résumé of the facts about the discrimination of which the Mater Hospital in Belfast has been a victim. This publication led to a condemnation of the Unionist actions in an influential London periodical.  The discrimination against the Mater Hospital has also been the subject of severe criticism by the leading Unionist newspaper in Belfast itself. Publicity of this kind does help those who, inside the Six Counties itself, would like to see injustice remedied and the foundation laid for happier relations among Irishmen.  Our task seems likely to be a long one but there is no need for us to despair about its outcome.</P>
    <P>Ireland took an active share, during the period under review, in the work of the Council of Europe, in accordance with her traditional policy of playing the largest possible part, which our situation allows, in fostering good relations between States, particularly in Western Europe.  As an earnest of this policy, and in compliance with the wishes of the Consultative Assembly, financial provision has been made under sub-head B (1) in the External Affairs Vote for the establishment in Strasbourg of a permanent representative to the Council of Europe during the current financial year.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware, the Council of Europe consists of two main organs; the Consultative Assembly which is the deliberative organ, and the Committee of Ministers (and their Deputies) which is the executive organ.</P>
    <P>It is not proposed at this time to review the debates and conclusions of <Col N="543" /> the Consultative Assembly's Sixth Ordinary Session in 1954 as these were the result of the independent initiative of the Assembly representative for which my Department can claim no credit apart from providing expenses and travel facilities for our representatives. I would like, however, to put on record my appreciation of the work done in the Consultative Assembly in 1954 by members of both Houses of the Oireachtas, of all political Parties, both in the Assembly itself and in the less publicised but no less important committees and working parties; and to stress the fact that resolutions and recommendations of the Consultative Assembly continue to constitute the mainspring of the activities of the Committee of Ministers, which I now propose to review briefly.</P>
    <P>These activities find their most concrete expression in the conventions and agreements which the member States of the Council have framed and signed. Since the foundation of the Council in 1949, seven such conventions and two agreements have been signed.  Two of these conventions were signed during the past year and others previously signed were ratified and came into force.</P>
    <P>Ireland was awarded two out of 16 Council of Europe Fellowships in 1954 of which one was given to a refugee resident here.</P>
    <P>A recent recommendation by the Committee of Cultural Experts will shortly lead to the meeting at Dublin of a working party of the Council of Europe Cultural Experts to examine the technical aspects of the microfilming of the unpublished and out-of-print catalogues and indexes of the manuscripts and records in the libraries and archives of member States.</P>
    <P>During the year Irish representatives participated in the work of the social and public health committees of governmental experts, whose reports are under consideration by the Committee of Ministers; and in a conference of civil aviation experts to prepare for a European civil aviation conference next November.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="544" /> As in previous years, the Irish contribution to the United Nations Children's Emergency Fund is given on condition that it will be expended by UNICEF on the purchase of Irish goods for distribution abroad.  To date the contributions have been spent mainly on purchases of condensed milk and margarine.</P>
    <P>As members of the O.E.E.C. we help to fashion an effective instrument for bringing the countries of Western Europe together and assisting in the solution of their economic problems. The aim of the O.E.E.C. is to achieve co-operation in all economic matters between its members and so improve their economies.  The progressive removal of quantitative restrictions on trade between its member countries continues to be one of the foremost objects of this organisation.  In February, 1951, the liberalisation target had been raised to 75 per cent. of all imports on private account for each member country, with a &ldquo;consolidation&rdquo; figure of 60 per cent. in each of the three main categories (agricultural products, raw materials and manufactured goods).</P>
    <P>On the 14th January, 1955, the council of the O.E.E.C. decided that the overall liberalisation figure should be raised to 90 per cent. with a figure of 75 per cent. at least for each of the three main categories. This decision was to come into effect as from the 1st April of this year, provided that France had by that date attained a level of 75 per cent. liberalisation of her total imports on private account, with 60 per cent. at least in each of the three categories.</P>
    <P>The decision also provided for the position of member countries which, owing to balance of payments difficulties or for reasons of national importance or equity, were unable for the time being to implement in full the new measures of liberalisation. Ireland's decision to accept this was conveyed to the organisation with an indication that the Government interpreted &ldquo;reasons of national importance&rdquo; as used in the decision in regard to non-fulfilment of the new measures to include reasons of economic stability.  The decision <Col N="545" /> entered into effect on the 1st April, 1955.</P>
    <P>It was decided at a meeting of the Council of Ministers of the O.E.E.C. held in Paris on the 13th and 14th January, 1955, to establish a ministerial committee for agriculture and food with the following functions: (a) to examine periodically the problems of member countries relating to agriculture and food; (b) to examine the effects upon agricultural and food problems of questions and proposals of general character under discussion in the O.E.E.C.; (c) to agree on measures to be taken by Ministers within the limits of their national competence and, whenever decisions binding on the Governments are necessary, to submit appropriate proposals to the council.  In this manner the &ldquo;Green Pool&rdquo; was associated with the O.E.E.C. and the Food and Agriculture Committee of that organisation was consequently abolished.</P>
    <P>At the same time it was arranged to enable Spain to participate in the work of the O.E.E.C. on questions relating to agriculture and food and an agreement to this effect was subsequently signed by the O.E.E.C. and the Spanish authorities.  The first meeting of the Ministerial Committee for Agriculture and Food was held in Paris on 9th March, 1955, and the Minister for Agriculture, representing Ireland at this meeting, was elected to the vice-chairmanship of the committee.</P>
    <P>The history and outcome of the negotiations with the Government of the United States concerning the disposal of the moneys in the Grant Counterpart Special Account was reviewed in the Dáil on the 16th December on the occasion of the introduction of a motion seeking Dáil approval for the agreement of 17th June, 1954, with the American authorities.  That agreement set out the general purposes for which the funds were to be used.  Separate sub-agreements were to be concluded for the implementation of the specific projects for which the American authorities had given their approval and three of these sub-agreements were brought to a successful conclusion in March.  These sub-agreements related <Col N="546" /> to (a) a scheme for the eradication of bovine T.B.; (b) a scheme for the pasteurisation of separated milk in creameries, and (c) a scheme for the subsidisation of the delivery costs of ground limestone to farmers.</P>
    <P>The other sub-agreements referred to in the Dáil on the 16th December last are in course of negotiation and it is hoped that some of them will be signed during the next few months.  Tribute must be paid to the unfailing help which the American Ambassador and his staff have given to us in the preparation and negotiation of these agreements.  During the year, trade negotiations took place with the following countries: Spain, France, Germany, Finland, Sweden, Norway and Belgium.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware, Ireland first applied for membership of the U.N.O. on the 2nd August, 1946, but in company with several other qualified states including Italy, Austria and Portugal the application has been repeatedly and effectively blocked by the Soviet veto in the Security Council. A special meeting of the organisations to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the signing of the charter was held last month in San Francisco and for the first time since its foundation an Irish observer was nominated to attend a meeting of the organisation.  I nominated an observer not only as a compliment to this special occasion in the lifetime of the organisation but also as an indication of our continuing desire to take our rightful place in the councils of the world.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like time to study in detail the rather extensive survey which the Minister has given of our external affairs and our relations with them.  The part that particularly struck me was his reference to isolation and that the existence of Partition did not carry with it the implication of isolation.  I do not think anybody was under any misapprehension in that regard.  Partition existed at the time of the League of Nations; Partition existed at the time in which application was made for entry into the U.N.O. I do not think there has been any difference in policy in regard to co-operation between other nations and between any of the Governments that <Col N="547" /> have been in office here.  We have always realised that we were one nation among many and that as far as physical resources were concerned our resources were not very great.</P>
      <P>We also realised that small as were our physical resources there were spiritual ones which were of great value and we never doubted that our nation, though a small one in the material sense, could play a very important part in international affairs. It was for that reason that from the very start, back even in 1919, we made it clear that we were willing to cooperate in a real League of Nations, and for that reason we did our best&mdash; various Governments did their best&mdash; at Geneva, and if there was failure of the League of Nations to achieve its fundamental purpose of maintaining world peace, certainly no one of the representatives from this country could be blamed for that in so far as they could do their part to warn nations of the dangers ahead and to lead nations on to the path of peace.</P>
      <P>It was with that view also that we wished to join the U.N.O.  We were prevented from becoming a member by, as the Minister pointed out, the veto of one power and those who were immediately under that power's influence. We did not at any time withdraw our application.  Neither did we renew it.  It remained there and it was for the organs of the United Nations to decide whether we should become members or not.  I must say that occasionally, when it was quite evident that the United Nations was not a group of nations having a common object in agreement, I often thought that had we been members we might have had seriously to consider whether we should continue as members.  The one argument for continuation was that it was better that they should have opportunities of talking to each other anyway and that no matter how acrimonious it might be from one side to the other, that nevertheless, as long as they had opportunities of discussions whether these were amicable or not, there was a possibility of finding understanding of some sort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Minister mentioned isolation, <Col N="548" /> therefore, I was wondering precisely what was in mind.  I do not think anybody here will deny that we were right when we preserved the neutrality of this country during the last war.  I think it would have been very foolish for our people to have entered into that war.  In every war fought, those who are fighting will always find good and moral reasons for the fight.  The fight against Germany was put on that basis and I am perfectly certain, that, if the world does not learn wisdom and if there are to be future wars, there will be no dearth of good causes which the war will be supposed to further.</P>
    <P>A small nation has to be extremely cautious when it enters into alliances which bring it, willy-nilly, into those wars.  As I said during the last war, the position was that we would not be consulted in how a war would be started &mdash;the great powers would do that&mdash;and when it was ended, no matter who won, suppose the side on which we were won, we would not be consulted as to the terms on which it should end.</P>
    <P>Isolation, then, or co-operation has to be distinguished as to whether we mean it on the non-military or on the military plane.  On the non-military plane there is always possibility of agreement except, I might point out, that, on the economic side, for instance, in the Council of Europe, it would have been most unwise for our people to enter into a political federation which would mean that you had a European Parliament deciding the economic circumstances, for example, of our life here.  For economic and other reasons we had refused to be satisfied with a representation of, say, one in six, as was our representation in the British Parliament. Our representation in the European Assembly was, I think, something like four out of 120 or some number of that magnitude.  That is, instead of being out-voted on matters that we would have regarded as of important interest to us by five or six to one, we would have been out-voted by 30 or 40 to one.  We did not strive to get out of that domination of our affairs by outside force or we did not get out of that position to get into a worse one.  But, there again, we were <Col N="549" /> anxious to co-operate to the fullest extent that was consistent with our liberty to look after the fundamental things that were necessary to our continued life as a nation.</P>
    <P>One of the things that made me unhappy at Strasbourg was that I saw that, at the first meeting, anyhow, of the Assembly, instead of trying to get co-operation and to provide organs for co-operation, there was an attempt to provide a full-blooded political constitution, that there were members there who were actually dividing themselves into socialist parties, and so on, as they might do in a national parliament. As far as we are concerned, whilst we wish well to all those who think that it is in their interest to do that, we certainly felt that we should not be committed as a nation to do it. A nation much more powerful, with her associated States, than we were was chary of that and I, for one, felt that we would not be wise as a nation in entering into a full-blooded political federation.</P>
    <P>But there are interests which we have in common with other countries. Of course, everybody will admit that peace is one of the outstanding interests and that everything that we can do to foster peace in the world we should do.  We have economic interests in common too and there is no reason in the world why we should not co-operate with any organs that are set up for economic co-operation provided that that economic co-operation is consistent with our own reasonable wellbeing.</P>
    <P>Partition was specifically mentioned by the Minister.  I agree&mdash;it is not the first time I have said it&mdash;that Partition will not be solved by force.  I agree also with the Minister that the best line to pursue is the line of co-operation to the utmost extent.</P>
    <P>I was interested in the Taoiseach's offer to meet the Prime Minister of the Six County area and I was hoping that something might come of that.  I realise, of course, that the Prime Minister in that area put up antecedent conditions which made it impossible for the Taoiseach to accept.  I did not see any reply from the Taoiseach in <Col N="550" /> that sense but that is how I interpreted the situation.  I think it a pity that there should be any antecedent conditions imposed by one side or the other.</P>
    <P>We had a situation like that to face back in 1921 and, no matter how we may differ as to their ultimate result, negotiations would not have been possible were it not that we finally got agreement that both parties should meet to explore all the possible avenues for a solution and that there should be no attempt by either side, at the start, the very beginning, to impose conditions. I was expecting, in fact, that the Taoiseach or the Minister for External Affairs on behalf of the Government&mdash;it would have been the Taoiseach, I suppose, under the circumstances, as it was a matter between the two leaders of the Governments&mdash; would have said that if there was to be a meeting it was clear that neither side could impose, as a condition precedent on the other, some condition which was clearly fundamental as far as the other side was concerned.</P>
    <P>I think it would be well if there was a meeting between representatives of the two Governments, as a first step, anyhow, to try to provide for greater co-operation.  I believe that it is on these lines that we can hope for success. I do not wish to dwell on the matter any further, but I agree with the Minister that there is no contradiction whatever between our maintaining our right to the unity of our country and the question of co-operation with other nations.</P>
    <P>As I have said, we have to be careful once there is a suggestion of entering into arrangements which involve military alliances.  I have lived through a certain number of these situations.  I remember that, in the First World War, numbers of Irishmen were induced to fight in that war, voluntarily to enter it, in the belief that by so doing they would establish closer relations with their brothers in the northern part of the country, and that, as a result of the war, the unity which was so desired by our people and the liberty which was so yearned for by our people would come.  Those of us who lived through it saw the failures on the part <Col N="551" /> of Britain to implement the pledges that were given, not merely the failures on the part of Britain, but the ultimate failures of those who were associated with Britain to fulfil the pledges with regard to self-determination, and so on.</P>
    <P>During the last war we were again asked to enter that war, so that, having entered it, by co-operation with Great Britain and with our fellow countrymen in the Six Counties, Partition would be ended.  It was a very important matter for the Government at the time and, both as Minister for External Affairs and as head of the Government, I particularly had to consider it.  To the representatives of Britain who came to see me on the matter, I pointed out that on a former occasion our people had been led to make tremendous sacrifices and that they were cheated in the end.  I indicated that there was always an easy way out for those who wanted to get an excuse for failure to implement any pledges, whether they were implicit or explicit, in the future&mdash;and that is the suggestion that, as it was put in these times, Ulster must not be coerced.</P>
    <P>That phrase always appeared to me to be a phrase which hid the fact that a large part of the people of that area which has been cut off are being coerced and if there were to be no coercion on anybody there might then be a principle which men could reasonably stand by and could appear to stand by as a matter of conviction. But it was quite a different thing when, on the plea of not being coerced, of liberty from coercion, these same people who demanded liberty for themselves were, in fact, coercing a considerable minority themselves&mdash;in fact, a bigger minority, relatively, than they themselves would be in the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>I pointed out that the majority of the people of Derry do not desire to be partitioned from the rest of the country.  I pointed out that the majority of the people in the County of Tyrone and the majority of the people in the County of Fermanagh did not wish to be separated.  I pointed out that these were areas immediately adjoining the Twenty-six County territory. <Col N="552" /> Not merely that, but I also pointed out that substantial portions, corresponding to the old parliamentary constituencies which were established without the special purpose of gerrymandering that you have now&mdash;the old constituencies of South Armagh, South Down and East Down&mdash;together constituted a majority in a very large portion of the Six Counties cut off.</P>
    <P>I pointed out that if we were to do what was done in separating the Six Counties from the remainder of the 32, if we were to be given the same basis that they were given, we could to-day, on the same basis, have four out of the six counties cut off because you could take a bloc of four of the six counties and in that bloc there would be a majority&mdash;it would be a slight one, I admit, but it would be a majority&mdash; in favour of association and union with the rest of the country.  In fact, the population around Belfast and its immediate neighbourhood for 20 to 30 miles has arrogated to itself the right to coerce the people who have a majority in a large portion of the area under their control.  However, the plea or the cry that Ulster must not be coerced would be used entirely in the future as it has been used in the past as an excuse for those who do not wish to honour any pledges that might be given as regards any return for Irish co-operation in military matters, in war.</P>
    <P>I do not know what precise significance has to be attached to the Minister's phrase, but if it simply means that it is not right to suggest that we wish a policy of isolation, a policy of keeping apart as if we alone existed on this planet, then, of course, that is common sense and everybody agrees with it.  However, if there is behind it a suggestion that we should enter into warlike combinations, then I think we would want to watch our steps very carefully indeed.  Our history is there with a warning finger to us as to what is likely to happen if we do it.  I know all the arguments that would be put forward, but we ought, at least, to learn something from our past and I hope that those warnings from the past will be borne in mind by the Government.</P>
    <P>With regard to the other activities <Col N="553" /> with which the Department have been engaged, I congratulate the Department on what appears to be a year of considerable activity.  I am also glad that they have established a permanent officer at Strasbourg.  I always thought one might go a little bit further. The cost of the maintenance of separate embassies in a number of European cities is heavy for small nations.  One of my hopes was that there might be some co-operation amongst the smaller States to considerably diminish these expenses by some form of co-operation through a centre such as Strasbourg.  I know it is easier to say that and think of it in general terms than it is to work it out in detail.  Circumstances and details might be very complex.  There are certain countries with which we have, and need to have, very direct contact and, with these, we should strive to have independent representation.  With regard to others, our immediate interests, if I might put it that way, are not so great and it should be possible to find other countries who are in a similar position with regard to some of these countries.  If that were so, then I think the small countries could come together and see whether, by some form of co-operation in Strasbourg, they could not diminish the expenditure on independent representation.</P>
    <P>Everybody realises that we need to have, in the first place, special representation at the Vatican.  That is equally true in the case of the United States.  It is true also, probably, in respect of Britain and France and, to a certain extent, it might work out that we would need it in Germany also.  The moment I begin to speak in this connection I see the difficulties, because it would be immediately pressed that we should have representation for Spain, Portugal, and so forth.  Notwithstanding that, and realising fully the difficulties there would be in securing any form of co-operation which would diminish expenses, I think the matter ought to be examined. However, the best way of examining it is to have a representative at Strasbourg. If it is to be regarded, in some sense, as a sort of capital for a Europe that desires some form of federation <Col N="554" /> or very close political co-operation, I think that is the place at which it would have to be worked out.</P>
    <P>I suggested previously that we should try to see whether we could not use Strasbourg to make contacts with some of the other countries, countries where we did not want immediate direct representation.  I am naturally not going to ask our Party to vote against this Estimate. I think the Minister was wise in giving us the survey he gave us, and, as I said in the beginning, I would like time to study it in detail, because I think that, from our experience in the past, we might be able to contribute some constructive criticism with regard to the details.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Minister for the survey he gave of the Department's activities in the course of the year and also for the brief review of departmental policy in regard to some matters.  I should like to join with him in paying a tribute to Most Reverend Dr. O'Hara, who was the Papal Nuncio here for some years, for the work he did here.  We all regretted his departure and it is only right that those views should be expressed in the House, and that we should also express our appreciation of the work now being done by the new representative of the Holy See, Monsignor Levame.</P>
      <P>There are very many things covering a wide field that I should like to discuss on this Estimate, but to do so at the end of the session is not readily feasible and I feel that we should, if possible, during the course of the year, try to arrange for an occasional debate on foreign affairs.  This is particularly essential because, by and large, we, as a nation, have not yet evolved a foreign policy.  A foreign policy can only be evolved over a long period of time and, so far, by reason of a number of different factors, we have not evolved a constant foreign policy and it would be well that in the next few years we should try to think more in terms of foreign policy for the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Modern developments in transport and means of communication, radio and so on, have reduced the distance which separates this island from the <Col N="555" /> rest of the world, and, even if it were desired to maintain a policy of complete isolation, this is no longer possible in the world of to-day.  It becomes, therefore, more and more important that our public generally, and particularly the members of this House, should take a wider interest in the foreign policy of this country. I should hope that if we had a number of discussions on foreign policy during the course of the year, it might be possible gradually to evolve a constant foreign policy, based on the constant requirements of this country, and that it would be possible to do so outside of the field of Party politics.</P>
    <P>I share generally the views expressed by the Leader of the Opposition in regard to military alliances.  I do not think the Minister's remarks with regard to isolationism were intended to suggest that he or the Government contemplated any military alliances.  I would find it hard to conceive of any military alliance in present circumstances which would not in some way involve a virtual guarantee of the territorial claims of Britain within our own island.  It would be, I think, next to impossible for this nation to enter into any military alliance or treaty obligation which would, in effect, guarantee to maintain the territorial <i>status quo</i>, whereby a portion of our nation has been split away from the rest and attached to Britain.  This does not mean in any way that we should adopt an isolationist policy in other respects, but I think it would be, shall I say, practically political suicide for the Government to consider an alliance which would in any way involve a guarantee of the existing territorial claims that Britain makes on Ireland. However, I do not think the Minister's words were intended to convey that such an alliance was contemplated.</P>
    <P>The Minister also dealt briefly with the question of Partition and I, too, welcome the work which the Irish Association has been doing.  I think that is valuable work.  I agree generally with the statements made by the Leader of the Opposition in regard to Partition, and I am glad that there is a virtually unanimous view in the House on that issue&mdash;at least, on that <Col N="556" /> issue in so far as it denies the right of Britain to occupy portion of our country against the wishes of the overwhelming majority of the Irish people.</P>
    <P>I propose to say very few words in regard to Partition on this occasion. The only matter of regret so far as I am concerned is that neither the present Government nor the previous Government have yet been prepared to consider any proposals whereby some opportunity would be afforded to the elected representatives of the people of the Six Counties to enable them to express their views and to participate in the discussions of this Parliament. I feel that, as an interim measure, steps should be taken to enable those who are elected by the people of the Six Counties and who wish to form part of this State to participate in our discussions here.  I do not propose to press the question any further to-day, as I think it is a matter for a separate discussion, but I should again like to appeal to the leaders of the Fine Gael Party and the Fianna Fáil Party to reconsider that possibility.  It is a step which would be the first gradual step towards the creation of an all-Ireland Parliament.</P>
    <P>There are many other things I would like to say in dealing with this Estimate here to-day.  To do so, however, would take time and might also detract from one other matter which, in my view, transcends all other matters in this moment of the world's history. The Minister referred to the fact that a conference was going to take place in a few days' time&mdash;on the 18th of this month&mdash;in Geneva, between the leaders of the four major parties in the Western World at least&mdash;the United States, France, Great Britain and Russia.</P>
    <P>We cannot, of course, influence the course of the discussions that will take place at this conference by a mere expression of opinion in our Parliament; yet we, as most small nations, are vitally interested in the outcome of the conference.  Upon its outcome may well depend the survival of our civilisation, if not the survival of humanity and the world.  If we cannot ourselves directly influence the outcome of these discussions, we can at least let our viewpoint be known, in <Col N="557" /> the hope that it may ultimately lead and join with the opinion of other nations who share our viewpoint.</P>
    <P>In this situation, we&mdash;perhaps better than most other nations&mdash;are in a position to voice views which go to the basis of the present world conflict. Our struggle for survival&mdash;for the survival of our nation and for the survival of our religion&mdash;coupled with our complete lack of any imperialistic ambitions, perhaps enables us to take a more fundamental view of the issues that confront the world to-day.  More important still, the universal belief of our people in Christianity and therefore in the ultimate function of mankind, should make it possible for us to make a contribution to the discussions which are now beginning, which may seep through the consciousness of mankind.  Nations and statesmen are inclined to discuss the present day problems on a day to day basis and are inclined to approach them on the basis of power politics and on the basis of materialism purely and simply.  That approach, in my view, is really a form of escapism.  It fails to take into account the real dangers of the present situation.</P>
    <P>I would like us to be able to send forth from this country a message of encouragement to the conference which is about to take place, a message of encouragement which would emphasise the essential moral and ethical basis of the problem which confronts the world. In my view, the problem arises because of the fact that while we have made tremendous progress in the course of this century, in scientific development and in material development of all kinds, progress which was undreamt of even at the beginning of this century, we have made that tremendous progress on a material plane and we have failed to realise that, unless progress of this nature is accompanied by an equivalent strengthening of the moral and ethical basis which binds society together, it is going to bring about a complete destruction of our civilisation.  We have reached the stage now when, if the views of people in the world who know or should know are to be accepted, not only is our civilisation <Col N="558" /> in danger but also the survival of mankind itself.</P>
    <P>To face that situation, unfortunately, the moral and ethical sense of responsibility of Governments and people is probably weaker than ever before.  It would be my hope that at some stage it should become possible for us, for our Government, to try to stress that viewpoint; and to join with other nations who share the same viewpoint, in trying to bring about a realisation of the immensity of the problem which now faces humanity.  At least some attempt would thus be made towards bringing about a realisation of the importance of developing among the people of the world that sense of moral and ethical responsibility without which apparently humanity is unlikely to survive.</P>
    <P>I am sure that many members of the House have read over the week-end the statement which was issued by a number of leading scientists from different quarters of the world.  It had apparently been signed by the late Professor Einstein before his death. The report suffers, of course, from one main defect&mdash;that it considers the problem of nuclear warfare purely from the materialistic concept.  It separates the question entirely from the spiritual and ethical basis of the problem, and to that extent it suffers from a vital defect, but, be that as it may, this is a report prepared by and containing the considered views of scientists who probably are not Christians or have little or no belief in Christianity, but nevertheless men of eminence in their own sphere.  These scientists do not mince words in this report, and I think are only expressing the views of other scientists in so far as the actual physical danger which faces the world in the event of another war.</P>
    <P>I have indicated that the report has many shortcomings because of its purely materialistic approach, but there are some passages in it which, I think, are worth quoting so that they may be available if required.  In the course of their statement they say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The general public, and even many men in positions of authority, have not realised what would be involved in a war with nuclear bombs.</P>
    <P>The general public still thinks <Col N="559" /> in terms of the obliteration of cities... No doubt in a H-bomb war great cities would be obliterated, but this is one of the minor disasters that would have to be faced.  If everybody in London, New York and Moscow were exterminated, the world might, in the course of a few centuries, recover from the blow. What we now know, especially since the Bikini test, that nuclear bombs can gradually spread destruction over a very much wider area than had been supposed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>They then go on to point out that the present H-bombs are 2,500 times more powerful than the bomb which was dropped on Hiroshima.  They say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Such a bomb, if exploded near the ground or under water, sends radio-active particles into the upper air.  They sink gradually and reach the surface of the earth in the form of a deadly dust or rain.  It was this dust which infected the Japanese fishermen and their catch of fish.</P>
    <P>No one knows how widely such lethal radio-active particles might be diffused, but the best authorities are unanimous in saying that a war with H-bombs might quite possibly put an end to the human race.  It is feared that if many H-bombs are used there will be universal death&mdash; sudden only for a minority, but for the majority a slow torture of disease and disintegration.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>They then deal with the views of different experts, and make this comment:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;They depend only, so far as our researches have revealed, upon the extent of the particular expert's knowledge.  We have found that the men who know most are the most gloomy.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As I have indicated, this statement was issued by a number of world famous scientists.  Lest it might be suggested in criticism of the views put forward by these particular scientists that they were influenced purely and simply by a materialistic approach to the problem, that they were possibly exaggerating the menace which faces the world, I should like to draw <Col N="560" /> the attention of the House to a statement recently made by the Commissioner of the United States Atomic Energy Commission who himself is a distinguished Irishman, a distinguished Irishman who has rendered many services to this country in the past&mdash; Thomas E. Murray.  His approach is a different one.  It is the approach of a man who, like ourselves, believes in the vital importance of Christianity, who believes that without that, without belief in Divine Providence, we can achieve nothing.</P>
    <P>In the course of this statement made recently by him he stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Prayer is the one and only force by which man will ever receive the inspiration, the courage and the strength to enable him to direct nuclear forces towards a better and more abundant life.  Human prudence is not enough to cope with the situation created by man's discovery of atomic power.  Even if the goodwill of every person on earth could be counted upon, the help and direction of the Divine Guidance is needed.</P>
    <P>Nothing in the history of the human race has prepared us to cope with this awesome situation.  The world has not only had no time to adjust, but hardly time enough to comprehend.  Yet time is running out.  Man must quickly recognise his atomic dilemma and make the superhuman effort to resolve it.  Before the testing of the forerunner of the present H-bomb, scientists had speculated on the possibility of world destruction through nuclear reactions.  After the test, they knew that the possibility could be triggered into actuality.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In conclusion he says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The essential ingredient to atomic survival is a broad base of informed and interested civilians.  It is the only way in which we can cope with the immoral fatalism that considers war &lsquo;inevitable&rsquo;&mdash;with the folly that professes unconcern over man's darkest threat.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I quote Mr. Murray's statement to the House because I regard him as one of the people in this world who probably has the most modern knowledge as to <Col N="561" /> the progress so far made in regard to nuclear power, and also because I would regard him as probably having a closer approach to our viewpoint than the approach held by the scientists who issued their report, from which I have quoted, over the week-end.</P>
    <P>Apart from the difference of approach, the conclusions are the same. Indeed, they are conclusions which to a large extent the present Holy Father, Pope Pius XII, prophesied nearly 12 years ago at the time the first atomic bomb was released.  On the 2nd June, 1943, Pope Pius XII in an allocution made on his own feast day, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We, who from the beginning, have done what was in our power to induce the belligerents to respect the laws of humanity in aerial warfare, consider it our duty for the good of all to plead once more for their observance.  At the moment when the spectre of still more horrible instruments of destruction and death rises to try the souls of men, it is not superfluous to warn the civilised world that it walks on the edge of an abyss of unspeakable misfortunes.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Six months later on Christmas Eve, 1943, the Holy Father said, when dealing with the same questions:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We see indeed only a conflict which degenerates into that form of warfare that excludes all restriction and restraint, as if it were the apocalyptic expression of a civilisation in which ever-growing technical progress is accompanied by an ever greater decline in the realm of the soul and morality... The most bloodstained pages of past history are pale in comparison... every human sentiment is being crushed and the light of reason eclipsed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have dealt with the question to-day because I feel that inevitably in the world there is a tendency to avoid facing these issues.  I think there is born in all of us a certain degree of escapism&mdash;a desire to avoid thinking of the unpleasant things in life, the unpleasant problems that face the world or one personally but, as Mr. Murray, United States Commissioner on Atomic Energy, pointed out the essential <Col N="562" /> necessity at the moment is a broad base of informed and interested public opinion.</P>
    <P>For these reasons I think it is well that we here should give some thought to these questions and seek in our own way to emphasise the essential moral problems involved in the present world situation.  We naturally all hope, as the Minister said, that the talks which are about to take place will lead to a situation in which all conflict will be eased but, unless the settlement arrived at is a settlement which recognises the importance of developing higher sets of moral and ethical responsibility, it will only be a short-lived settlement.  I found that there are divided views as to the present situation. Some believe that the present easing of the international situation is due to a genuine realisation by the Russian Government in particular that war would threaten the survival of humanity.  Others believe that the present <i>détente</i> is merely a technical one in order to prepare for some offers which would ultimately lead to a greater encroachment in Germany.</P>
    <P>I am not in a position to judge between these two conflicting sets of views.  All we can do is to hope and pray that the <i>détente</i> is a genuine one brought about by a realisation of the gigantic threat which now faces humanity. I would ask the Minister and the Taoiseach to consider the possibility of expressing more persuasively and more coherently than I have sought to express here to-day the feelings which we, in Ireland, have as to the need for the development of that sense of moral and ethical responsibility without which our civilisation cannot survive.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>There are but a few points which I wish to mention very briefly in this Estimate.  First of all, I am sure there is no need for any of us to dwell on the matter mentioned by Deputy de Valera in connection with this country's position in the matter of military commitments.  I believe there is no need for us to dwell on that.  I believe we are 100 per cent. united that such would never be the case.  Accordingly, I think, we can by-pass that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="563" /> My second point also concerns one mentioned by Deputy de Valera and on which I agree with him.  When speaking, Deputy de Valera mentioned the matter of a permanent appointment at Strasbourg and our connection with the various countries through our Ambassadors.  I remember a year or two ago when Deputy Aiken answered a question I put down in connection with these matters.  The lack of information available in connection with our membership of organisations such as U.N.O. was mentioned.  While we are still on the shelf in connection with our application for membership of that organisation&mdash;we do not know whether we will be admitted or not&mdash;it is most important at this stage that the Government should inform the general public as to what our possible commitments may be.  The tragedy of the matter a year or two ago was that Deputy Aiken, then Minister for External Affairs, said it would be too complicated to prepare that information by way of booklet; that it would be too awkward, too difficult and too expensive.  I and the Labour Party believe that the general public should know of any possible commitments instead of our spending our time here engaged in academic discussions as to what in our personal opinion may be right or wrong.  Surely it is only through the Government giving information on which the public can base its opinions that we will be able to come close to understanding the question as to whether or not it is wise for us to clamour for admission to some of these international organisations.</P>
    <P>As regards the suggestion in the statement of the Minister&mdash;with which Deputy de Valera and Deputy MacBride and I agree&mdash;in relation to the appointment at Strasbourg, I believe if we were to look up the Book of Estimates we would find that over a number of years back the amount of money spent in connection with our embassies would be completely out of proportion in relation to the countries in which we are represented.</P>
    <P>Even at this stage it is well for us, who are in the Labour Party, to know <Col N="564" /> that others who could not see our side a few years ago realise now there was a certain element of justice in the case we put up.  We must consider the enormous amount of money spent through the establishment of embassies and in particular&mdash;naturally I am not objecting to our association with them&mdash;in America as compared with what is spent in European countries.  Deputy MacBride has gone to great trouble to explain, in regard to the important discussions that may be taking place at Strasbourg in the next few days, what he believes and what many of us believe to be true.  The tragedy is that these discussions will be confined to a few nations whose interests will not be based on very high standards.  They will be based on international, materialistic and imperialistic viewpoints and unfortunately our connection with foreign countries through embassies is far greater and far more evident with these countries&mdash;in the West of course&mdash;than it is with some of the small but very old European countries.</P>
    <P>I believe it is essential, even at this stage, that when we are joining various associations with which we are making contact on the international plane we should try to get as closely as possible associated with the views of other small European nations.  If we do that, and establish a greater sense of understanding with the smaller nations, we may be doing a far better thing for the world as a whole than by following in the path of some of the larger nations who only want us because it suits them.  So long as we are associated with these large nations we shall not be able to change them from their materialistic international points of view.  I do not think there is any need to dwell further on this matter.</P>
    <P>There is one item to which I wish to draw attention.  It has been discussed here year in year out and it is of importance to our own country, and that is the possibility, through discussions that have been taking place through the Department and others, of the extension of our territorial waters.  If other nations can spread their nets, surely three miles is a bit small for us. I would ask the Minister to have this <Col N="565" /> matter pressed, if possible, to a satisfactory conclusion because, connected with it, is, perhaps, to a certain extent the economic survival of a small portion of our people, those who depend through fishing on a better field of activity and better protection.</P>
    <P>The other item&mdash;and I will try to discuss it as briefly as others, but I must mention it&mdash;is Partition.  Nobody can say but that each and every one of us here discussing this matter to-day is discussing it in as calm and as cool and as honest a manner as possible.  I wonder what is happening to-day in another part of the country on the 12th July?  I appreciate as much as anyone here&mdash;as I have said in public time and time again&mdash;and respect members on both sides of me here for all they did, but it is because of our everyday associations with the people and because of our own worry at times&mdash; because it is a worry&mdash;at the fact that 30 or 35 years have elapsed and we have got no further that I raise the matter here.  I am not saying for a moment that this is the fault of our statesmen here in the South, but when we are told about friendly association and all that, we must remember that that friendly association, as we know this evening, is probably forgotten on the 12th July in the North.</P>
    <P>I do not want to take the discussion any further nor make it awkward for the Minister or the Government or for the Government that was in office before us, but we are getting nowhere. It must be quite obvious to everyone that no matter how friendly we become we cannot take the political and bigoted spots off a bigoted leopard.  I believe Deputy MacBride is right in his view that we should open the doors to any of them who want to come down.  I am not saying for a moment that the doors of Leinster House should be open only to Nationalist or Labour members.  Let any of them who want to come, come.  If we believe in an Irish Parliament for Irish people, then surely we must be prepared to say: &ldquo;Here is your Parliament and its doors are open to you.&rdquo; Otherwise, we are only deceiving ourselves. We want no trouble here.  We know here that if there is an argument <Col N="566" /> in Egypt or trouble in Tunisia, the big nations will come with their bodyguards to protect the people, but we are here for 35 years and we never insulted any country&mdash;in fact we have gone out of our way to be friendly because our belief is based on true moral standards.  Is it because we are trying to be honest with everyone that the whole lot of them are laughing at us and saying we are fools?</P>
    <P>I do not want to expand any further on that or to delay any longer on this subject.  We have gone as far as we can go; we have tried to be friendly and tried to get co-operation from Britain and America, and we hear of the Irish in America during the election time but they are forgotten afterwards. I would say to the Minister and the Government as a whole that one step to take us further on our way would be, as Deputy MacBride mentioned, and as I now repeat, to open the doors and see if any of them are genuine enough to move towards this part of Ireland.  We may then get somewhere and we may be in a better position to discuss international affairs when we have put our own house in order.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, in my opinion, is to be congratulated on what seems to me to be one of the most realistic and courageous statements made in this House on the question of Partition for some years.  It is refreshing to see the near unanimity in the House on the use of force as a possible solution for the undoubted evil of Partition.  It is a healthy development in our affairs to find that we have in this House very near unanimity that the use of force is not the means by which, politically, our country can be united.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The imposition of Partition on our country was, of course, one of the greatest of the many evils which Great Britain imposed on us.  The fact that it is an evil, however, does not permit us to use evil means to end it.  Whatever about the morals of ending Partition by force, a subject on which I am not competent to judge, it must be obvious to everyone that politically Partition cannot be ended by coercion and until that fact is fully appreciated <Col N="567" /> the ending of Partition will not come about.  We have very nearly reached that position on this side of the Border and the near unanimity that we have is, in my view, a step forward towards the time when we may have this great evil remedied.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that such views may be difficult to bear on the part of Nationalists in the North who are suffering from undoubted injustices and it may be very difficult indeed for them to hear us preaching patience to them but that is all we can do.  Believing as we do that force is no solution, all we can do is to ask them to have the courage of patience until the time comes&mdash;and it must come&mdash;when the logic of the situation brings about the ending of this wrong.</P>
    <P>It is desirable that the Minister's Department use such means as are at its disposal to make known to the world the wrong of Partition and to make known to the Governments of the world, so that we can enlist their support, that we have a grievance here. It is right that we should use the means of propaganda to bring our case before the forum of world public opinion, but I would like to strike this note of warning, that propaganda like every other action must be subject to the virtue of prudence and that the law of diminishing returns sets in very early indeed when people are complaining about their wrongs.</P>
    <P>We must be wise and prudent, therefore, in the way in which we make use of our propaganda machinery towards bringing to the notice of world opinion the injustice of Partition.  Anybody who has had experience in the Department of External Affairs and in the political assemblies of which we are members will realise that the surest way of doing away with any sympathy that one can get and the surest way of hampering the progress towards enlisting support for your cause is by overdoing your case and by representing it too often and making yourself a nuisance.  With that warning in mind I think, nevertheless, the Minister's Department is perfectly correct in making legitimate use of such opportunities as may come of bringing to <Col N="568" /> the notice of Governments and to the notice of peoples of the world, by means of the public Press and radio, the injustice which we are suffering.</P>
    <P>I cannot see, as the Minister has stated, why we should not develop a policy of peaceful co-existence between the two Governments, north and south of the Border.  Again it seems to me to be a legitimate development of our position here.  I have full sympathy with the view expressed by Deputy Desmond.  It must be a very uncomfortable and galling thing indeed to be a Nationalist on the 12th July but if we are realistic and if we appreciate that force is no answer to the problem the logic of the situation inevitably leads us to the line of action whereby we endeavour to break down the prejudice of the people in Northern Ireland who are at present supporting the union between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  We must not be influenced in our policy by extremists on both sides of the Border.  We must not be influenced by anything that may be said by an extremist Orangeman on 12th July.  I believe that there are many hundreds of thousands of genuine Protestant and Presbyterian people in Northern Ireland who could be won to our point of view but it will take time. If we appreciate that the question of Partition can only be solved in time and by patience, by peaceful co-existence and co-operation between the two Governments, we can hasten the day when it will be ended.</P>
    <P>The Minister has pointed to a number of successful experiments in co-operation between North and South.  That co-operation has been welcomed by the most extreme spokesmen of the Northern Ireland Government.  I think it could be greatly extended in many spheres.  In one small sphere, the legal sphere, there are many examples of, perhaps, minor matters of procedure but none the less important in the ordinary day-to-day lives of many of our citizens both north and south of the Border, in which governmental co-operation could bring about coordination. On the question of economies, too, I feel sure that there must be many fields open for co-operation and above all in the cultural field.  We must all welcome, therefore, the recent <Col N="569" /> development announced by the Minister for Education.</P>
    <P>The time may easily come when another approach such as has been made some months ago towards a meeting of the heads of Government could be made.  It is indeed to be hoped that such a meeting between the heads of Government would have the support of the Opposition Party.  I feel that questions of verbiage have been got over before and they could be got over in this case and that if an effort was made the heads of Government, with, I am sure, some good results could meet to discuss common problems.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made in the course of this debate to Ireland's rôle in the Council of Europe.  There is a certain tendency in this country to underestimate the importance of the Council of Europe and in particular to underestimate the rôle that Ireland can play in the Council of Europe. While there is no doubt that the work of the Council, and especially of the Assembly, has been a great disappointment to many people, and while there is no doubt that there has been in recent months a certain air of lassitude about the work of the Assembly, it cannot be denied that the Council of Europe has done a tremendous amount of work towards bringing about a greater unity between the peoples of Western Europe.  In the debate in Strasbourg last week the French Foreign Minister pointed out that the solution to the Saar problem between the Governments of Western Germany and France was arrived at on recommendations of a rapporteur of a committee of the Assembly of the Council of Europe.  Similarly, the Western European unions of the coal and steel interests are now realities born out of the Assembly of the Council of Europe.</P>
    <P>We must appreciate that the Council of Europe is the only world political assembly in which we have representation. We are barred from U.N.O. by reason of the Russian veto and, apart from our membership of certain specialist organisations, the Council of Europe is the only political organisation <Col N="570" /> in which we, as a country, can express ourselves and gain influence and prestige for our nation.  The common burden of complaint from the members of the Assembly for the last couple of years has been that the Committee of Ministers has not met frequently enough.  It is generally and unanimously agreed by parliamentarians who go to Strasbourg that the work of the Assembly has been retarded because the Ministers have not co-operated; and it is generally known that the British Foreign Office view is certainly one of antagonism, or, if that is too strong a word, of indifference at any rate to the Council of Europe, and that has acted as a marked brake on the work of the Council.</P>
    <P>With the support of the unanimous Assembly and with the support of a number of the Member Governments of the Committee of Ministers, I think our Government could gain support, prestige and influence for our country by pressing for more frequent Ministers' meetings of the Council of Ministers.  The Council of Ministers has met, I think, only twice in the last year and, in the year before that, either once or twice.  For the immense amount of work that is there to be done and for the great number of recommendations that have been sent up from the Assembly to the Council of Ministers that is much too infrequent.  The Council of Europe was meant to be and could be the framework within which a common Western European policy could be worked out. It has not been used that way and foreign Ministers seem to prefer to go to any capital in the world and visit any town except Strasbourg when trying to settle the troubles of the world.</P>
    <P>As I say, I think the Minister would get co-operation not only from the Assembly but from many of the foreign Ministers of small countries like ours if he pressed for more frequent meetings of the Committee of Ministers.  I do not think we need fear what Deputy de Valera referred to, namely, the political federation of Europe.  I do not think we need fear that by co-operating in the Council of Europe, by playing a more active part in that Assembly any of our national sovereignty will be reduced.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="571" /> I know there are strong views held by federalists in the Council of Europe, but the brake is there, emanating from all sorts of sources, and it will be a long time before any significant reduction in national sovereignty will be achieved by the Council of Europe. Until that time comes, we, I think, can take a much more significant part in the affairs of the Council of Europe than we have been taking heretofore.</P>
    <P>Looking over the records of the Council of Europe one thing that has struck me is the number of times our representative has abstained from voting on matters which do not directly concern us.  I think that is a wrong attitude.  I think in many cases an abstention in Strasbourg is regarded as a polite way of saying &ldquo;No&rdquo; to a resolution and, although we are not vitally concerned with many matters which come up for discussion and which have to be voted on, I think we should show our general goodwill towards the work of the Assembly by voting for things which we believe are good but which may not vitally, or at all, affect us.</P>
    <P>I want to refer now to the question of our emigrants in Great Britain.  It seems to me that the Department of External Affairs could do much more for our emigrants in Great Britain than has been done heretofore.  Emigration is a political and an economic fact, which we may deplore but which we cannot ignore.  The figures show that thousands of people go to England every year and settle in the big industrial towns, creating huge centres of Irish population which are not catered for from our resources.  While we must welcome the work that is being done by the Hierarchy of the two countries in trying to help the spiritual and material needs of these emigrants that should not stop our Government taking steps on its own initiative.  I understand that a very large petition was signed by many thousands of persons in Birmingham a year or two ago requesting assistance from the Department of External Affairs for their plight.</P>
    <P>The Irish Embassy in London is not <Col N="572" /> capable of dealing with the problem, no matter how it may try, and it seems to me that we must now set up and organise centres in the big towns like Birmingham and Liverpool, as well as London, to which our emigrants can go and in which they can be informed of proper lodgings and will not find themselves at any rate lost in the great morass of British industrialism.  That is work which will require expenditure by the Department of External Affairs, but I do not think there is anybody here who would object to helping our emigrants who, through no fault of their own, have had to leave this country; and it seems to me we have an obligation to our citizens who have had to leave this country through no fault of their own.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, may I say that I agree whole-heartedly with what the Minister said in relation to isolationism. Neutrality does not mean isolationism. Yet, in many cases, it has been considered here that if we remain neutral we have no further obligations to Western Europe.  I think we have.  It is not correct to say that we can be ethically neutral in the present world struggle.  It is not correct to say that people can doctor up their wars by putting false ideas before the minds of the public in order to try and get support.  It is not correct in this struggle at any rate, whatever about the past.  We can have no doubt where right is and where wrong lies in the present world struggle and we have a duty to try and help in every way we can the forces of the West.  My own view has been that militarily and strategically our assistance to the West would be negligible and that as a small country our proper course is to remain neutral but that does not imply isolationism and it does not get away from the obligations which we have towards our fellow Christians throughout the world.  We have a lot to give them and a lot to learn from them and I think the Minister's speech has indicated that we are setting forth now in the right direction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Though I disagree with many of the things said by the last speaker, I want to say how pleased I am about his remarks regarding the <Col N="573" /> conditions of our emigrants and the problems affecting them in Britain.  It was one matter with which I expected the Minister for External Affairs to deal in a very comprehensive fashion in this House.  I do not intend to delay the House talking about the evils of emigration because the House and the country is nauseated by the talk that has gone on for years past about this very grievous problem while nothing whatever is being done to solve it.</P>
      <P>However, in view of the important pronouncements of the Irish Hierarchy and of other learned people in this country about the conditions of our emigrants and about the necessity of giving guidance and help to them, I think it is only right that the Department of External Affairs would cooperate with these voluntary bodies in an effort to improve conditions for our people who have to leave this country. The Hierarchy are going to do their part in the spiritual field but assistance in the spiritual field is, I think, not enough.  We in this House have a responsibility to these people, seeing that we have been charged with the task of providing employment for them in this country; in view of our failure in that regard it is our essential duty to see that whatever we can do to help them when they go across the water will be done and that the necessary action to do so will be taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe it is not too much to ask the Department of External Affairs and the Minister to carry out an investigation into the conditions under which our emigrants are living at the present time in many of the major industrial centres in Britain.  If that investigation is carried out immediately there will be no great need for an intensive investigation, because many facts are already known to the Department. I think it would be quite easy to set up in these major centres of population bureaux that will give advice on housing, on work and on where religious instruction can be given and received and on any other matters of importance to our people there.  Most of the young people who leave this country are between the ages of 17 and 25 years.  Many of them from rural Ireland had never been in the <Col N="574" /> City of Dublin even before they emigrated so it is easy to realise the feelings of fear which prevail among them when they go to work in large cities like Birmingham, Liverpool or London.</P>
    <P>If these young people come to Dublin they will have friends or relatives to meet them with whom they can stay.  Some Deputies may say that they have friends and relatives in the big cities across the water as well. Many of them have, but many also have not, and very often when they go there they depend on some bureau that has no connection with this country to advise them about employment. Very often that employment is anything but good in any sense of the word for those young people.</P>
    <P>The expense involved by the Department of External Affairs in extending help to these people should not be taken into consideration at all in view of the fact that we are not spending the money here in this country to provide the necessary employment and thus to keep these young people at home.  Surely we should have enough conscience left to do our part with regard to these people abroad.  We hear in this House, day in day out, prating about ethics and morals and we are advising other nations what they should do.  I think we should turn the spotlight on our own nation for a start and how we treat our people here and on the conditions under which they are expected to live.  There is an air of unreality about this debate.</P>
    <P>Listening to some of the speakers here one would get the impression that this country should have been invited to the parley at the summit which is about to take place.  During the debate I began to think that the influence wielded by this State was almost as great as that of any of the great powers.  I have listened here to-day to a long dissertation on morals and ethics and on the dangers of warfare by atomic means and by the H-bomb. I think we are like the Pharisee in the temple talking about these things.  I think it is just too bad that this small nation or portion of a nation has the audacity to turn around and give lectures to the nations of the world on morals and ethics.  There is <Col N="575" /> the well-known saying that people should mind their own business and look after their own business first before they begin poking their noses into their neighbours' affairs.</P>
    <P>When you poke your nose into your neighbour's affairs it is not often appreciated by the neighbour and I think that the less political preaching we do at our neighbours the more they will think of us in the future and the better we will be doing for ourselves. There has been some talk about isolation and I was very glad to hear the ex-Taoiseach picking on that particular point as of great importance as far as this nation is concerned.  The young speaker who has just finished, Deputy Declan Costello, more or less let the cat out of the bag as far as his outlook, and, apparently, the outlook of the members of his Party is concerned on this question of isolation or, shall we say, neutrality.  I do not know whether Deputy Costello was speaking on his own behalf or whether he was acting as spokesman for his Party when he took part in a recent debate down the country and when he made it quite clear that in his view this small nation should line up with one or other of the two major powers in this looming conflict.</P>
    <P>It is very hard to know from the statement of the Minister for External Affairs what he really means by his reference to isolation.  There are people in this country and elements in this State who make no bones about giving up our neutrality and who would have us line up with one side.  I think we have a lot to be thankful for that we did not do it in the last war.  I do not want to deal in any great detail with it but when I hear Deputies saying that there is no doubt on which side right is in this coming tussle I should like to say that I think there is an awful lot wrong on both sides.  I think there is an awful lot wrong in the mentality that allowed the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and other such deplorable actions to take place.</P>
    <P>I think that as far as Ireland is concerned she should keep her nose out of the business of other nations and <Col N="576" /> try and look after her own business first.  There is no question or doubt that we are not doing that and if we are able to put these brilliant minds, who are setting their brains to solve international problems, to solving the problems affecting the country here we would be doing much better and would be doing a very good day's work for the country from any viewpoint. Reference was made here to the work our representatives are doing in Strasbourg in the Council of Europe and the subsidiary bodies appointed by that Council.  I do not know what they are doing precisely.</P>
    <P>Now and again we get a word of information as to the work this Council and these committees are doing, but I do want to sound a word of warning, that I hope none of our representatives on any of these committees, through love of the West of Europe, will do harm to our industrial position or our industrial future in dealing with the problem of the liberalisation of trade. If we accept the viewpoint of many of these nations that there should be liberalisation of trade up to the extent of 90 per cent. what is the use of talking here about developing our resources in Ireland?  We are an undeveloped nation.  We must take the utmost precautions before allowing ourselves to take part in any agreement on those lines.  Were it not for the fact that our industries were heavily protected over the last 25 or 30 years, we would not see the industrial development that we have to-day, small and all as it is.  Any steps that might be taken by European countries to free trade should be very carefully considered before we allow ourselves to take part in any such agreements.</P>
    <P>I know for a fact that, as far as Germany and other countries are concerned, for every £1 worth of goods that we send to them, we import £3 worth.  If that is the type of liberalisation that we will get, I do not think it is of very great benefit to this country.</P>
    <P>We need to develop our natural resources.  We want to see an end to emigration.  We want to see full employment.  These things cannot be <Col N="577" /> achieved unless the utmost protection is given to the development of our resources.</P>
    <P>The main point with which I wish to deal in connection with this Estimate is the problem of Partition.  It is rather tragic that, while we are discussing Partition and External Affairs here to-day, many of our people in the North, the very best of our people in the North, are whacking the big drums and swearing undying loyalty to the Empire at the present moment.</P>
    <P>We have had talk here from time to time about co-operation between North and South.  To-day the Leader of the Opposition spoke about the desirability of a meeting between representatives of both Governments and suggested that it was desirable that there should be a meeting between the Premier of the Six Counties and our Taoiseach, to discuss matters of importance to both parts of our divided territory.  I shall not deal with this matter at any great length and I shall not reopen old sores but I will say that it is a bit late in the day for some people in this House to talk about that type of co-operation and to talk about meetings to be arranged on that level.  If we cast our minds back and trace Irish history, we will find that provision was made in the 1920 Act&mdash;whether we disliked that 1920 Act or not&mdash;for that type of co-operation which the present Taoiseach is now asking from his opposite number across the Border.</P>
    <P>Under the 1920 Act it was suggested that a council would be set up representative of people on both sides of the Border, that that council would discuss matters of the very greatest importance to our economy both North and South, that that council would deal with fisheries, transport and the rights of minorities.  It would be most desirable that we should have some such council to-day to protect the rights of minorities.  That right was there under the 1920 Act.  What happened?</P>
    <P>It is all very fine for Deputies, in this House and outside, to lay full blame on Britain for imposing Partition <Col N="578" /> on this country.  If Britain imposed Partition on this country, she got plenty of help from people in this House in order to have it nailed firmly on the country.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to rake the ashes of the Treaty but I will say that Michael Collins, Arthur Griffith and all the other signatories to the Treaty never for one moment visualised that Partition would exist to-day.  If they had, I am firmly convinced that the Treaty would never have been signed.  I am convinced that when these men signed that Treaty they did so in the belief that when the Boundary Commission would be set up, as a result of the findings of that commission, within a short space of time Partition would have disappeared in Ireland.  I do not believe for one moment that they could have been intimidated by anybody in Britain to sign that Treaty if they felt for one moment that Partition would be as permanent an establishment as it is in political life in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The great tragedy, of course, lay in the fact that these men were not there to guide developments in Irish politics for a further period.  Those great men died, men of lesser ability took their place and the tragedy can be seen in the boundary as it is to-day.</P>
    <P>We cannot deny that Partition was imposed on this country but we should examine the records that are available with regard to what took place after that Treaty.  The belief of Collins, Griffith and all the other patriots of that time was that when the Boundary Commission would be set up, as a result of their findings, at least two counties would opt back with the Twenty-Six, that portion of two others would do the same, that, on economic grounds alone, the remaining territory could not exist as a separate unit and that within the space of a few years the entire Six Counties would be back with the Twenty-Six.</P>
    <P>What happened?  We saw very little happening between 1921 and 1925, but in 1925 there was a very black page imposed on Irish politics.  I do not intend to deal with it in any detail here <Col N="579" /> to-day because I intend at a later stage to give the house an opportunity to discuss it in a longer debate.  I will say that those Deputies who here, to-day and on other occasions, bewail the injustice of Partition must have very short memories indeed.  They should remember that, although Britain imposed Partition, many of the Deputies of this House endorsed Partition and signed away, under the 1925 Agreement, for all time&mdash;in a legal fashion, at any rate&mdash;the Six Counties from this country.</P>
    <P>If we are going to be serious and take practical steps about ending Partition we will have to undo one wrong, at any rate, to start the ball rolling. I believe that, in international law as it stands, if this question of Partition were debated before any legal assembly we could be confronted with records showing that, as far as we were concerned, we had endorsed Partition and had signed away these counties and that it was done in this House by a majority of about 70 Deputies to 18. I want to say that the present Opposition were absent from this House at that particular stage.  I think it was illegal that the 1925 Boundary Agreement was ever allowed to go through &mdash;and the first thing that should be done here is to repudiate that 1925 Boundary Agreement.</P>
    <P>Having done that, the next move should be the one suggested to-day both by Deputy Desmond and Deputy MacBride, and that is that, after that has been done, the doors of Dáil Éireann should be opened to the elected representatives of the North. There is no use in our talking about ending Partition if we are going to close the door here on our neighbours and prevent them from airing their views about conditions as they exist up there.  I do not care who comes down here, whether it be Basil Brooke or anybody else: they are all welcome.  It would be a grand think if Basil Brooke came down here even to criticise.  At any rate, the first move lies with us. There is no use in asking the unfortunate people in the Six Counties to take <Col N="580" /> all the steps necessary to reunite them with us.</P>
    <P>I am mentioning all this because there are people outside this House who are looking for guidance and who want to see practical steps taken. There are people outside this House who dislike the idea of physical force but there are other people outside this House who do not put a tooth in it and who maintain that physical force is the only way by which that Border will go. If we are going to put an argument that will appeal to the public against that section, we shall have to show in this House that we are serious about ending Partition and that we are determined to take practical steps to do so.  Even though there might be a great deal of trouble in the official sense and in the red tape sense as regards the rights of northern representatives if they came in here, they would be much less trouble than the trouble that is liable to take place if that is not done.</P>
    <P>I appeal to this Government, as I appealed to them 12 months ago, to reconsider the application which was made to allow the Northern representatives to sit here.  If they reconsider that application in a favourable fashion then it will save me and it will save this House the embarrassment of having to discuss at great length the problem I have already mentioned, namely, the repudiation of the 1925 Boundary Agreement.</P>

      <P>I am intervening in this debate to make what I hope will be one of the shortest speeches I have ever made.  I may say that I only enter this debate because of the Minister's forthright and courageous reference to Partition.  Every one of us, I think, has been impressed by the progress that has been made in even the slight measure of co-operation that we have had with the people in the Six Counties.  I would ask the Government to consider three questions which, if considered favourably, would, I think, resolve a lot of the piety of some of our speeches on Partition:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1)  Would the Government consider the appointment of a trade commissioner <Col N="581" /> in Belfast and ask the Northern Government to appoint one here?</P>
    <P>(2)  Would the Government consider a special preference for goods of Six County origin?</P>
    <P>(3)  Would the Government insist that our ships be built only in Belfast shipyards?</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>If affirmative answers could be given to these three questions, we would have moved a very long distance on the road which we all desire to travel.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the last speaker, I intend to be brief in my remarks.  I just want to deal with a matter to which Deputy Desmond has referred. The matter to which I wish to refer is much nearer home than any of the subjects which have been discussed.  It is only, in fact, slightly external.  The question was referred to very briefly by Deputy Desmond and it is the new delimitation of our territorial waters.</P>
      <P>I am interested in the new delimitation of our territorial waters particularly from the point of view of the fisheries.  I had, on a few occasions, questions to the Minister on the matter. It seemed to me that, on the last occasion on which I put a question to him, the Minister thought I was a little too insistent on the matter.  If I did seem insistent it was because of the fact that before the change of Government, the fisheries end of the matter, so far as I could make out, had been adequately dealt with.  All that the Department of External Affairs had requested them to do had been done, the main job being the drawing of a new map in the closest conformity possible with the decision which had been given in the case of Norway <i>versus</i> Britain&mdash;the arbitration on the Norwegian claim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Desmond referred to the question of the extension of the three-mile limit.  Four miles are allowed to Norway but I do not think there is any great merit in the number of miles unless you are able to do, in fact, what the Russians have done and go to 12. I do not think that is possible at all. Some country in South America has made a claim for 200 miles for whale fishing.  However, the three-mile limit is the one commonly applied.  The important <Col N="582" /> thing about it, however, is not the number of miles but the base line from which you measure the miles.</P>
    <P>I understand that the four miles for Norway has been conceded internationally for a very long time.  The question that arose in Norway was also not the number of miles but the base lines. The one thing that has emerged from the hearing is that the British point of view about tangents connecting curves is now not necessarily the way you draw base lines and that, in fact, you can draw straight lines between all the points that are permanently over water or appear at low water. The main thing which I want to put before the Minister is not any one of these things.</P>
    <P>There are a few things in relation to our case in the matter which I think it inadvisable to refer to now, but what I would ask the Minister is this, that in whatever negotiations he sets up&mdash; and these negotiations will have to be with Britain, in the first instance&mdash;the talks that took place between officials 25 or 26 years ago will not be the basis of the new talks, that anything that transpired then will now be discarded by our spokesmen and that the new talks will begin on the new basis created by the decision of the International Court of Justice in the case between Britain and Norway.</P>
    <P>I do not think anybody in this House ought to encourage people to go out on the rampage about increasing the number of miles.  That is a wild goose chase, in my opinion, and will not achieve anything.  We know that, so far as Britain is concerned, she is not going to give us much trouble in the matter of fishery limits.  It is quite another consideration that will be present to her mind and, in fact, some of our fishery limits, as drawn by Britain and as still recognised by Britain, even though she has left this country for the past 30 years, do overrun our territorial limits.  That is the position along one stretch of the coast.</P>
    <P>These talks which took place 25 years ago did not take place between Ministers and I hope the Minister will say that he will regard concessions which may have been made at that time as <Col N="583" /> having been withdrawn, that our rights now rest on the principles of international law set up by the decision referred to and that we will claim our full rights under them.  If we can protect the new area of water which I believe we will get under that decision anyway adequately, I believe that a very important step will have been taken towards extending the exclusive waters of Irish fishermen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say that I appreciate the manner in which the Estimate has been approached and, in particular, the suggestions made from all sides of the House concerning a number of matters.  These suggestions I will have examined.  The reference I made at the beginning to isolationism was in some way or other interpreted as conflicting with our determination to remain free from any military alliances, but this I think is difficult to follow in view of the specific wording of my original statement.  I said, having referred to the fact that there was no conflict whatever between the pursuit of Irish unity and a policy of co-operation with peoples who, like ourselves, have a Christian and democratic way of life that a greater consciousness of our share in the common destiny of these peoples need not mean any abandonment of our claim to unity&mdash;for that we can never abandon.  It is in reality the alternative&mdash;isolationism&mdash; which would mean the abandonment not perhaps of our formal claim to unity but of any hope whatever of achieving it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as this Government is concerned, we are taking the view that we should play as full a part as is possible within our resources, either in European co-operation or in any world organisations of which we are members. I think Deputy de Valera considered that the remark I made in some way or other implied criticism of the policy of his Government.  I have no doubt that a great number of people are familiar with one of the taunts which is levelled against this country by critics outside&mdash;that we tend to sit in a backwater and refuse to take our appropriate place in international <Col N="584" /> affairs.  Deputy de Valera himself remarked that we had over the years, both in the League of Nations from the time we were admitted in 1923 and in various subsidiary bodies under that organisation, as well as since, played whatever part we considered appropriate wherever possible.</P>
    <P>The fact that we have representatives attending the Council of Europe and the O.E.E.C., which at present are the two main bodies of which we are members, is, I believe, a clear indication that we are prepared to play a part suited to our resources and our influence in world affairs.  We endeavoured to become members of the U.N.O., and our application still stands, but, because of the use of the veto, we have so far been refused admission.</P>
    <P>When people criticise the part Ireland is playing in world affairs, they might liken us to great powers and consider that we should play a greater part, or that we should attempt to adopt a rôle that we have not got the resources to carry out, or, alternatively, should adopt a rôle quite out of place for a small country.  On the other hand, it may be that a number of these critics expressed that view because they want to criticise and refuse to acknowledge that we are playing a not insignificant part in a number of these organisations.</P>
    <P>The only strictly political organisation we are members of is the Council of Europe&mdash;both the Consultative Assembly and the Committee of Ministers. We are a member of the O.E.E.C. which is mainly concerned with economic matters and we are members of various other technical bodies of one sort or another which fall to be dealt with by other Departments which are directly concerned, but, in all these bodies on many occasions, Irish representatives have played an appropriate part.  In the case of the International Labour Organisation, we have played a part which is probably far greater than might be expected on the basis of our resources and our population, and, in the case of this body, the Director-General on one occasion was an Irishman, Mr. Phelan.</P>
    <P>In various ways, therefore, it is obvious that we are playing as full a <Col N="585" /> part as it is possible to play.  At the same time, if we were to drift into any isolated position, we would weaken our effectiveness in these organisations and weaken our contacts with Western Europe, as well as with those countries with which we are associated who have a democratic way of life and who think along the same lines as we think.</P>
    <P>While we are not indifferent to the outcome of the forthcoming talks or to the conflict of ideas which exists between East and West, we at the same time appreciate that it is not possible for a small country to go beyond what may be reasonably expected of a country situated such as we are and with our resources.  As many Deputies have said here, this country has a great Christian heritage.  Our people can exert great influence through the spiritual strength of missionaries both in Europe and elsewhere and it is through their work that it is possible to exert an influence beyond any material strength which we have. Nowadays, as Deputy MacBride mentioned, great powers decide&mdash;as indeed they always did&mdash;on the basis of strength, possibly more at the present time than ever before.</P>
    <P>The significance of the power of nuclear weapons is borne in on us by statements similar to those which were made over the week-end by the scientists who expressed certain views. At the same time, it is appropriate that wherever possible we should indicate that while we regard material things as having a place we have, above all, a spiritual and a Christian heritage. We should endeavour, through our people abroad, to exert an influence on those who may be in a position to have an impact on affairs and guide world movement along lines which we consider are the right lines.  I believe it is quite obvious that we are playing a reasonable part in world affairs and that we will continue to exert an influence on them wherever possible.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond referred to the fact that we have a great number of embassies abroad and he felt that we were committed beyond our means and beyond our resources.  It is not possible to say offhand that we should be represented in some place and not represented <Col N="586" /> in some other place.  He appeared to suggest that because we have representatives in the United States and in Canada and in some of the more powerful countries we are in some way detaching ourselves from Europe and are not adequately represented among the smaller nations.  I think that with very few exceptions, we have a representative in every European country outside the Iron Curtain.</P>
    <P>As the Leader of the Opposition mentioned, it might be possible to consider some arrangement whereby double accredition or joint representation would be possible.  There are objections to that, because it entails two offices in any case and in some cases it means unnecessary travelling for the representative where he is a Minister or a Consul.  Also, most foreign governments dislike the idea of double accredition.  On the other hand, looking at the actual size of our trade or the strength of our Irish people in some of the smaller countries, we have, if anything, more representation in smaller European Countries than can be said to be the case in either Britain or America, where there are large numbers of people of Irish descent, where we have big trade interests and other interests as well.</P>
    <P>Deputy Declan Costello and Deputy McQuillan raised the question of emigrants in Britain.  This matter has been the subject of serious consideration over a long period.  It is easy to suggest that we should take some steps to assist our people in Britain, but when you examine the matter it is not possible always to see what can be done.  As the House is aware, we have an embassy in London and the Ambassador and his staff are at the disposal of the Irish people in Britain at all times, and they endeavour to assist wherever possible.  There is such a large Irish population in Britain at the moment&mdash;there are over 750,000 Irish-born people there&mdash;that it is not easy to see how assistance can be given effectively, while keeping the cost within reasonable limits.  It has never been the practice to assist directly people who are in poor circumstances, those who have become destitute in any country where there is a large Irish <Col N="587" /> population&mdash;in America or Britain.  It is true that we provide assistance for people found destitute in European countries where we have not a large Irish population.</P>
    <P>This is a difficult problem; in many respects, it is a social problem and in other respects probably even more a moral problem.  I know that I express the views of people on all sides of the House when I say that we appreciate very sincerely the co-operation which has been taking place over recent months and which has resulted in a pastoral by the Cardinal Archbishop of Westminster as well as the pastoral last Sunday by the Irish Hierarchy.  I believe that that co-operation between the two Hierarchies will go a considerable way towards easing the problems and providing enlightenment for Irish people who go to Britain, both as to the things to be avoided as well as where help and assistance and succour may be found.  Without very careful consideration of the other aspects involved, it would not be possible to take the steps which were suggested by Deputy Costello and Deputy McQuillan.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond and Deputy Bartley raised the question of territorial waters.  That matter has been under consideration for a considerable time, but it is not one which can be settled easily.  While discussions have taken place, there is no territorial limit agreed all round between different countries.  Some countries, by virtue of ancient rights or ancient claims, have wider territorial limits.  So far as most countries are concerned, the three mile limit is still the maximum.  It is true that there has been an alteration in the basis of measurement, but because of the complexities of the problem&mdash; because of the fact that in some cases, to adopt what has been generally agreed to as the new method of measurement would involve a reduced limit while in others it would secure an extension&mdash;the Government decided that it was better to wait until the international court had decided on a number of matters at present engaging <Col N="588" /> its attention before coming to a decision.</P>
    <P>There have been widely conflicting claims by a number of countries.  Some are claiming not only a three, four, five or six mile limit, but a 12 mile limit, while others are claiming what is described as the sea shelf.  We felt that, with all these complexities in the situation, it would be as well to await a decision by the International Court, at the same time realising that whatever decision is taken the important thing from our point of view and that of our fishermen is to see that we make the limits which are adopted effective. So far as most of our fishermen along the west coast or in the north in Donegal or in the south around Kerry and Cork are concerned the principal problem is to see that the existing fishery limit is adequately protected so as to meet their needs.  Therefore, we did not feel it desirable to exert a claim which it might not be possible to sustain on the one hand or, if made, to provide at the same time adequate protection for the fishermen.  Consequently, we thought it better to wait until the International Court had reported, and then to consider the matter in the light of its decision.</P>

      <P>When I moved to report progress on this Estimate on Friday last, I had come to matters relating to <Col N="589" /> the appointment of a paymaster on the Corrib drainage scheme.  I do not mind so much the change in appointment as the manner in which the whole thing was carried out.  I had come to the point when I had explained that in January, 1954, I had given instructions to the director of the Special Employment Schemes Office to retain the services of two paymasters until the 30th June.  I believed that work in the interval on the Corrib drainage scheme would have reached the stage when a sufficient gang would have been employed to have the man I had in mind, and whom I had recommended to the commissioners, appointed.  Had I been in office, I would have insisted on his appointment. I would have insisted that he would have been appointed, but the Corrib had not reached the stage whereby the appointment of a paymaster was warranted, according to the regulations.  There was a change of Government on the 2nd June.  Of course, a change was obvious following the result of the general election on the 18th May.</P>
      <P>I happened to meet at a funeral, a few days after the general election, the man whom I had promised to appoint. He asked me what I thought the position would be.  I said to him that, in my opinion, I thought the appointment was likely to stand, and I added: &ldquo;But as you have been acquainted with Deputy Donnellan for a considerable time, and as he was the person who appointed you in the first instance as a paymaster in the Special Employment Schemes Office and as I believe he is the person who is again likely to fill the position of Parliamentary Secretary, it might be no harm if you were to call on him or else to write to him.&rdquo; When we were parting the man said to me: &ldquo;Well, I will consider that if you think there will be any necessity for it.&rdquo;  I said to him: &ldquo;I do not think there will be any necessity because, knowing Deputy Donnellan as I do, and knowing his interest in you, I do not believe that he is going to make any change.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anyhow, according to my information, this particular gentleman visited the Parliamentary Secretary on the <Col N="590" /> 22nd May.  He stated what was the purpose of his visit and, according to his story to me which is verified by a statutory declaration made by the person who accompanied him, the Parliamentary Secretary promised him that he would appoint him as paymaster. He also told him that it was not necessary for him to call&mdash;that a simple note would have done.  Well, of course, that man went home quite satisfied.  After a while he got a letter notifying him to attend an interview in Galway.  He submitted himself for the interview and I believe, from replies to questions which were asked in this House, other people also submitted themselves for interview.  He felt that he had got on well at the interview, and he was quite satisfied that he would be appointed. I think the interview was held about mid-July.  After some time, about mid-August, he found that another man had been appointed.</P>
    <P>This man, as I mentioned before, was a 1916 man.  He had certified 1916 service. He also had certified I.R.A. service in the period 1919 to 1922 and 1923. When he told his colleagues, those in the I.R.A. Comrades' Association in County Galway&mdash;very few of whom are friendly to me&mdash;of what had happened, they called a meeting.  They discussed the position and they called a meeting for Loughrea on the 27th August which they invited the Parliamentary Secretary to attend.  According to the minutes, the Parliamentary Secretary did attend.  There were delegates from all over the country from the various battalions and brigade areas.  The Parliamentary Secretary stated to them that he was shocked that, as a result of the interview, this particular gentleman did not succeed; that, in fact, he was last on the list; that, consequently, he could not very well appoint him, and that so disgusted was he that he refrained from making the appointment himself and submitted the file to the Minister for Finance and that it was he actually who sanctioned the appointment of the person who was appointed paymaster.</P>
    <P>I believe the interview was carried out by two officials of the Office of Public Works in Galway and I find it very difficult to believe that the gentleman <Col N="591" /> whose case I am putting before the Dáil was placed last on the list in view of the fact that when he was notified his services as paymaster under the Special Employment Schemes Office would be terminated on the 26th July, he got a letter from the Director or at least somebody representing the Director the last paragraph of which states:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;On behalf of the Director of the Special Employments Schemes Office, I am to express his appreciation of your services while acting as paymaster for this office.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The interview boards are now a long time in existence and from what I have heard from people who have submitted themselves for interview a reference from your previous employer is taken into consideration very much indeed. Here was a reference from another section of the very same Department which in my opinion was a splendid reference that he carried out his duties in a satisfactory and efficient manner. In view of that, in view of the services he had rendered and in view of the fact that he handled thousands and thousands of pounds from the Special Employment Schemes Office, I find it very hard to believe how two officials out of the same Department would place a man like that last on the list.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary, according to the minutes of the Old I.R.A. which I can prove, stated that he had nothing whatsoever to do with the final appointment, that it was the Minister for Finance did that.  But then the Parliamentary Secretary went on, according to their minutes and according to their declarations, and said the best thing he could do now was to offer him a job which was much better than paymaster on the Corrib and that was the position of assistant storekeeper in the Galway offices at a salary of £7 10s. a week. He said that the commission out of the Corrib was only £3 per week plus travelling expenses.  He certainly said <Col N="592" /> that he would not offer such a menial job to a man with this man's record.</P>
      <P>The Old I.R.A. assembled at that meeting were exceedingly grateful. They thanked the Parliamentary Secretary and said it was a fine offer, but, of course, there was an implication as regards the £3 per week knowing that I had that man in for it, that I had told him, as I emphasised in the Dáil last week, that I would resign from the Fianna Fáil Party if the appointment was upset in any way.  The implication there, of course, was that I was prepared to offer anything to an Old I.R.A. man.  He did not get the job. When he was offered the alternative job at £7 10s. which was to come on in a very short time the Old I.R.A. were grateful.</P>
      <P>I have in my possession a letter dated 9th September from the Parliamentary Secretary himself to the Secretary of the Old I.R.A. Comrades' Association.  I will give the name if necessary.  The letter states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A chara, I have your letter of yesterday's date.  I have given instructions to the Commissioners of Public Works to offer employment as assistant storekeeper on the Corrib drainage scheme to Mr. Newell.  He should hear from the resident engineer in a day or two.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>And so he did, for by the very same post he got this communication:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Newcastle, Galway, 9th September. A chara, I can offer you employment as stores assistant in the Corrib Drainage Works, Newcastle, at a rate of 2/6 per hour.  Please state when you can report to take up duty.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There was a very big difference between assistant storekeeper and storekeeper's assistant.  We all know that the post of assistant storekeeper involves duties and responsibilities which are, at times, just as great as that of the storekeeper himself but we know very well also that a storekeeper's assistant is only, after all, the position of an ordinary unskilled labourer.</P>

The Old I.R.A. organisation took exception to this and they instructed their secretary to write again to the Parliamentary Secretary and invite him to another meeting.  He did not attend. They pointed out the difference between assistant storekeeper and storekeeper's assistant.  They got a reply to that on the 14th September:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A chara, I have your further letter about Mr. Martin Newell.  I would point out, in the first instance, that my statement in Loughrea was to the effect that I would arrange for Mr. Newell to be offered appointment as a stores assistant.  In fact, there is no such job as &lsquo;assistant storekeeper&rsquo;, and the reference to such in my letter of 9 Mean Foir, 1954, was a slip and should have read &lsquo;stores assistant&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Appointment to this post will leave Mr. Newell in a position to qualify for appointment, on promotion, when a vacancy arises, as a works clerk, and will render him, at a later stage, eligible for consideration on his merits for still further promotion to a post as storekeeper on the Corrib or any other of the arterial drainage schemes operated by the Commissioners of Public Works.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The point I am taking exception to is that with regard to the matter of the Old I.R.A., according to statutory declarations made by a number of them who are not supporters of mine&mdash;<Col N="594" /> they never were, but were bitterly hostile to Fianna Fáil&mdash;certainly their faculty of hearing was not so far gone that they did not understand what the Parliamentary Secretary promised on the 27th August when he promised appointment as assistant storekeeper and then emphasised that in a letter of the 9th September and then on the 14th September gives this very thin excuse that that was a slip in his office.  I wonder who does he expect would believe that?  Was it any wonder that the person concerned and the Old I.R.A. would feel very very disappointed at that?</P>

      <P>As a result of all this evasiveness they got their backs up and I understand that some gentlemen met the Minister for Finance in Tuam &mdash;his own supporters&mdash;because they felt so keenly about it, and they told him the story and he said: &ldquo;Well, that is the first I heard about it.&rdquo;  He was asked then if he would be prepared to receive a deputation and he said he would consider that.  He was then approached through a member of his own Party to receive that deputation and he agreed to receive the deputation, in the meantime all correspondence in connection with it to be submitted to him.  This was done and the deputation was received in the Minister's office some time around the end of October or early in November.  I have five declarations here.  I shall read one of them from the chairman of the deputation and the chairman of the Galway Old Comrades' Association. I think when his name is mentioned nobody in this House will say that he is a red-hot Fianna Fáil supporter or ever has been.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="595" /> The statutory declaration is:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I, Micheál Ó Droighneáin, of Furbough, Galway, in the County of Galway, aged 21 years and upwards, hereby solemnly and sincerely declare as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>I was a member of an Old I.R.A. deputation which was received by the Minister for Finance&mdash;Mr. Sweetman.</P>
    <P>The purpose of our visit was in connection with a recent appointment of pay clerk on the Clare-Corrib drainage scheme as the Old I.R.A. of the Galway brigades felt that one of their members&mdash;Mr. Martin Newell, should have been appointed to the said position.</P>
    <P>The arrangements for the deputation being received by the Minister for Finance were made by Mr. Brendan Glynn, T.D., who also accompanied the deputation.</P>
    <P>Our case with the Minister was opened by our chairman, Mr. Michael Draoideain, and in the discussion that followed with the Minister I very clearly remember the following:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Mr. Sweetman stated that he had checked Mr. Newell's and Mr. Flannery's military service with the Department of Defence and said that he had received a reply that both had service and that he could not consider any other information only the official information from the Department of Defence and further emphasised that not alone was Mr. Newell an Old I.R.A. man, but a 1916 man as well.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that he wished to make it quite clear that he had nothing whatever to do with the appointment of Mr. Flannery as pay clerk on the Clare-Corrib drainage scheme and while he was quite satisfied that Mr. Newell was 100 per cent. as regards bonds, honesty and ability, still as the job was only worth a maximum of £3 per payment he could not offer the job to Mr. Newell as he did not consider it good enough.</P>
    <P>The secretary, Mr. O'Regan, then asked Mr. Sweetman how often was <Col N="596" /> there a payment, to which the Minister replied: &lsquo;Once a week.&rsquo;  Mr. O'Regan then asked what did a payment consist of, to which the Minister replied: &lsquo;A full week's wages.&rsquo; Mr. O'Brien then asked the Minister: &lsquo;Does that mean that any paymaster appointed can never draw any more than £3 per week plus travelling expenses?&rsquo;  The Minister replied: &lsquo;That's quite right.&rsquo;  Mr. O'Brien then asked if the work on the scheme increased to such an extent that the paymaster would have to work on two or three days each week would he still only draw a maximum of only £3, to which the Minister replied: &lsquo;Yes, and that bears out my statement that the job could not be offered to Mr. Newell as his commission would only amount to travelling expenses to and from Tuam for one day and a second day would have to be worked at a loss by Mr. Newell.&rsquo;  The Minister also passed a document to the end of his desk showing the maximum rate of commission to be £3.  The minutes of the Old I.R.A. meeting held in Loughrea on the 27th August, ult., which was attended by Mr. Michael Donnellan, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, was read for the Minister who remarked: &lsquo;According to these the job of assistant storekeeper seems to solve this problem.&rsquo;  It was pointed out to the Minister that the job now offered was that of stores assistant. The Minister then stated that he was not in a position to say what difference, if any, was in the jobs of assistant storekeeper and stores assistant, but undertook to examine the scheme and get a job suited to Mr. Newell and admitted that being an Old I.R.A. man and a 1916 man he deserved every consideration the Government could give him.</P>
    <P>Mr. Sweetman also mentioned that the present Government would give special consideration to Old I.R.A. men always.</P>
    <P>A member of the deputation, Mr. Seamus O'Reilly, then made a suggestion that the matter be left in the hands of the Minister to do the best he could for Mr. Newell.  This was agreed to by the Minister and the <Col N="597" /> deputation then left the Minister's office accompanied by Mr. Brendan Glynn.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>We had all this talk about the £3 commission and a number of questions were put down. Deputy Killilea put down questions regarding the Corrib and a reply was given.  It is at column 640, Volume 147 of the 17th November, 1954, and in that reply, of course, the payments to the pay clerks for the period from the week ending 7th August, 1954, to the week ending the 25th September did not exceed £3.  We had a subsequent question, but that was as regards how the vacancy was filled and again the Parliamentary Secretary said that five of the ten candidates were selected for interview but only four presented themselves.  It was given to the man who got first place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had a few more, and Deputy Killilea on the 1st December, 1954, in Volume 147, column 1296 asked the Minister for Finance if he would state (1) if more than one payment was made in any one week by the paymaster appointed on the Corrib arterial drainage scheme since he was appointed on the 11th August, 1954, and (2) if payments are permitted to be made on a number of days in the same week, and if so, if it is possible for the paymaster <Col N="598" /> to be paid up to a maximum of £3 for each day's payment, and in addition receive travelling expenses in respect of each day's payment.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary replied:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The answer to the first part of the question is &lsquo;no&rsquo;.  As regards the second part a paymaster may spread a payment over more than one day if he cannot reasonably complete it in a single day, but he would not thereby be entitled to additional remuneration as each payment is treated as one unit, irrespective of the number of days taken to finish it. More than one unit payment in a week may become necessary as a work progresses.</P>
    <P>The necessity for this is not determined by the paymaster and has not so far arisen on the Corrib-Clare arterial drainage scheme.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There was great simplicity in that reply and innocence in expecting anyone to swallow it.  However, I myself put down a question on 3rd March, 1955, and I did not mention the Corrib.  I am quoting from column 1176, volume 148, of the Official Debates of that date. I asked the Minister for Finance:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If he will state in respect of the Glyde and Dee and the Feale arterial drainage schemes, respectively, the average weekly amount paid in wages to those employed (i) from 1st April, 1954, to 30th September, 1954, and (ii) from 1st October, 1954, to 31st January, 1955, and further in respect of these periods, the average weekly amount by way of commission or remuneration and the amount of travelling expenses, respectively, paid to the pay clerks employed on these schemes.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, Deputy Sweetman, stated in reply:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;As the reply is in the form of a tabular statement, I propose, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to have it circulated with the Official Report.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Here we have the particulars set out. As regards the Glyde and Dee scheme in the period from 1/4/'54 to 30/9/'54, the average weekly amount of wages <Col N="599" /> was £1,908.  The average weekly commission paid to the pay clerk was £5 11s. 3d.  That was above £3 surely. The average weekly travelling expenses of the pay clerk amounted to £4 10s. In the period from 1/10/'54 to 31/1/'55 the average weekly amount of wages paid was £1,418.  The average weekly commission paid to the pay clerk was £4 9s. 2d.  The average weekly travelling expenses of the pay clerk were £4 4s.  That, of course, was in the period of the year when it was difficult to carry on drainage and when it was quite obvious that a large number of men could not be employed.</P>
    <P>As regards the Feale scheme, in the period from 1/4/'54 to 30/9/'54, the average weekly amount of wages was £2,423.  The average weekly commission paid to the pay clerk was £5 17s. 11d.  The average weekly travelling expenses of the pay clerk amounted to £3 4s. 2d.  Again the commission was a considerable amount above £3.  In the period from 1/10/'54 to 31/1/'55 the average weekly amount of wages was £1,948.  The average weekly commission paid to the pay clerk was £5 11s. 5d., plus travelling expenses amounting to £4 18s. 6d.  Again, the commission there, not to mind the travelling expenses, was considerably greater than the menial £3 a week Deputy Beegan, of course, would think fit to offer to an Old I.R.A. man but with which neither the Minister for Finance nor the Parliamentary Secretary would insult him by making such a despicable offer.</P>

      <P>They denied him that. As regards the assistant storekeeper, why did they not say in the letter of the 9th September what they intended? The letter of the 14th September was the one where they had the excuse that it was a slip in the office.  It is this kind of thing that I detest, this kind of quibbling.  When Mr. Newell went down to him on 22nd May, why had he not the manners to say to him: &ldquo;I cannot give you that job.  That must be given to a north Galway man?&rdquo;  Why carry on in that way like a cat playing with a mouse?  The whole business is abominable.  Or was the Parliamentary Secretary at that particular time not quite certain that he was getting back the Parliamentary Secretaryship and if he did not get back he then could say: &ldquo;Well, if I were there, certainly you would be appointed and nobody else.&rdquo; But when he did get back he brought in the interview.</P>
      <P>Was there any interview for the appointment of paymaster on the Brosna?  Was there any interview for the paymaster on the Glyde and Dee? Was there any interview for the paymaster on the Feale?  The Parliamentary Secretary appointed two of them himself and I appointed one of them. I do not even know the man in question but I passed through Miltown and if he himself is as respectable as the premises he has he must be a respectable man.</P>

Nothing else will satisfy me until that report over the signatures shows that this man was placed last.  If the Parliamentary Secretary had done that in the first instance he would have avoided all this trouble, and this foul-smelling incident would never have come before the Dáil as far as I am concerned.  Why not be candid about the remuneration?  Why was there all this quibbling?  How can any Deputy or any person in the country, in view of all that, have any confidence in the administration of the Office of Public Works when that kind of thing is carried on?  This man was competent to discharge the duties of that office and he was diddled out of office in this particular fashion.  Why not put him out of it without all that carry-on?  Why not tell him straight out in the first instance?  The interview board had to be brought in as a coverup, and as nothing else.</P>

I have adduced sufficient proof to justify my moving that the Estimate be referred back and I will challenge the Estimate to a division, not merely in relation to that matter but in relation also to what I stated last Friday.  If there is one thing I detest it is quibbling and evasiveness.  I believe in a man standing up to his job, and even if that makes him unpopular with his own Party, so long as he does the right thing his conscience will always rest easy.  It has been demonstrated clearly that the pseudo-sympathy of the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister <Col N="603" /> for Finance for the Old I.R.A. and the 1916 men is merely a pretence.</P>

      <P>Deputies will be aware that up to a few years ago the Book of Estimates showed a very considerable amount of detail under subhead B of Vote 9.  The details then disappeared and the Committee of Public Accounts took the view that members of the Dáil were being deprived of useful information.  A considerable amount of discussion took place with the Department of Finance on the subject and I am glad to say that in the end, as Deputies will have seen, a way out of the difficulty presented itself.</P>
      <P>I understand the trouble was that there was difficulty in having these details in time for the printing of the Book of Estimates.  As well as that, they had grown up over a long period of time into a very elaborate statement, a great part of which was of very little interest.  The Parliamentary Secretary in his introductory statement referred to the list which has been circulated. I would like now to thank both the Office of Public Works and the Department of Finance for the arrangement they came to in order to meet the views of the Committee of Public Accounts and especially for the inclusion of the third column, which is actually the middle one, on the schedule showing the amount already expended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are one or two matters in this about which I would like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary.  There are several sums voted this year or proposed to be spent this year where no estimate has yet been made of the cost.  In some cases that is fair enough because it is readily understandable that the cost of a major fishery harbour survey, for instance, cannot possibly be estimated; that is No. 47 on the list.  No. 62 refers to the renewal of the defective stonework on the National Library and the National Museum; one can understand that it is not possible to make a firm <Col N="604" /> estimate in advance in relation to that type of work.  May I say, in passing, that I hope in renewing the defective stonework that the type of stone used will not deteriorate like the last did? Again, if freestone or sandstone is used it should be put into the building in the position it occupied in the quarry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It will last.  It is from County Meath.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a lot of things in County Meath that did not last.  Look at Tara!  I understand that if sandstone is put into a building in a different position from that which it had in the quarry it deteriorates rapidly.  In any event I hope every precaution will be taken to ensure that the new stonework will last.</P>
      <P>I find it hard to understand why no estimate has appeared where there has already been a certain expenditure and where further expenditure is proposed as, for instance, No. 25 which deals with Abbotstown Farm, the development and extension of farm buildings; £1,800 has already been spent and it is proposed to spend £10,000 this year. Yet there is no estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the same way No. 10 deals with the new premises for the Stamping Branch of the Revenue Commissioners. The proposed expenditure is £20,000. In the list that used to appear in the Estimate there were a great many items.  I presume these were proposed by Departments and the Office of Public Works had been asked to prepare an Estimate.  For years then nothing was done.  These items do not now appear and it is no longer possible for Deputies to know what Departments set out to do and subsequently did not do.  From recollection, I think there was a proposal at one time to erect houses for the customs staff of the Revenue Commissioners near Carrigans on the border of County Donegal.  These houses have not yet been built.  They no longer appear in this list and I presume there is therefore no intention of building them.  I think that is a very grave mistake.  It is certainly undesirable that our customs staff on the Border should be living under bad conditions as they <Col N="605" /> undoubtedly are in many places.  I think that is a matter the Department of Finance should pursue energetically.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>They expect the Border to go soon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be, but, on the other hand, there are quite a number of customs posts which are pretty substantial and look fairly permanent. There is one customs post which is very bad, and it is an important one; that is Carrigans.  The hut there is a disgrace.  It is most unfair to staff. It has been repaired repeatedly.  I do not know how much money has been spent on it in the way of repair but I think that no amount of repair could make it into a really usable office. From a staff point of view it is unfair and from the point of view of the public it is atrocious.  I do not know what tourists coming into the country from across the Border think when they see that dreadful hut on the side of the road.</P>
      <P>Anyone looking at the Estimate might be pardoned if they thought subhead B of Vote No. 9 represents the major efforts of the Office of Public Works.  It accounts for nearly half of the total moneys sought; in fact, I think it accounts for very much more than half of the amounts being sought for the two Votes.  The moneys under sub-head B represent the work done by the Office of Public Works as the agent for other Departments and by and large I think that was the history of the Office of Public Works&mdash;it was to do work for other Departments.  They have now, however, on their own hands the major work of arterial drainage.  I presume it was given to the Office of Public Works because they were already concerned in some drainage works which had been passed under special Acts, such as the Barrow and the Fergus drainage schemes.  I am not too sure that was a wise step as it turned out.  We may have been guilty of putting new wine into an old bottle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think some evidence lies in the direction of showing that the administrative side has not kept pace with the technical advances that are needed <Col N="606" /> to take on a job as big as arterial drainage.  Indeed I am inclined to think we may have made a greater error with regard to arterial drainage than that.  I think it is arguable whether or not arterial drainage may turn out in the end, if carried out to its logical conclusion and in the way in which we have been attempting to carry it out, a very mixed blessing.  It is late in the day to make any suggestions in the matter now when a great many learned people have examined the drainage question as Deputy Beegan told us last Friday in his discourse on the history of this and when he mentioned a number of distinguished men who had acted on the Drainage Commission.</P>
    <P>My own view is that it would be a good step to put all drainage under one authority and not to have arterial drainage done by the Office of Public Works, a great deal of drainage under the land project done by the Department of Agriculture, and then a lot of drainage done in a spasmodic way by local authorities under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  If we are going to tackle drainage as a problem we should have care taken of it by one authority.  As well as that a good step would be to take forestry away from the Department of Lands.  There is more than one reason for that suggestion.  I think forestry should be linked with arterial drainage.  I do not pretend to know a great deal about it but as far as I can gather we seem to be concerned with afforestation in this country only from the point of view of providing trees for timber and as shelter belts.  Trees come to a great extent into the question of soil conservation and of water conservation problems and could very well be linked from that point of view with arterial drainage.  I can quite easily foresee that we might overdrain certain areas where there is no cover by timber. That would lead to more problems in the end than the ones which we set out to solve.</P>
    <P>I want to draw the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance to a few instances dealing with arterial drainage, about the way it has been carried out and <Col N="607" /> the policy that apparently has been adopted.  As I have said, in spite of what appears on the face of the Estimate the really big job of the Department is arterial drainage.  The amounts that are sought in any particular year may not have been as impressive as in some of the other sub-heads, but if we examine what arterial drainage involves in the way of capital investment we shall realise that it is not only big business but very big business.  The amount invested in drainage machinery &mdash;engineering plant and machinery&mdash; is, I understand, somewhere over £1,100,000.  The amount invested in engineering stores, according to the Book of Estimates, was approximately £333,000 on the 31st March last.  The workshop plant in the central engineering workshop cost £120,000 and the workshop itself is held under a lease from C.I.E. for a term of 50 years beginning in April, 1951, and under second lease of April, 1955, the total amount being £15,250 a year.  You then have to add rates and maintenance.</P>
    <P>These figures show that arterial drainage is very big business and I think it is only fair to ask if it is being run as a big business.  Some of the engineering plant is very expensive. We have two excavators of the Marion 111M type costing £43,000 each. There are two Lima excavators which cost £30,000 each and a great many others which make up quite an impressive sum.  An investment of that kind requires maximum use if the State is to get real value for its investment. Are we getting maximum use?  Two things are obviously needed for maximum use.  One is first-class maintenance and repair, and the other is that when the machines are in use in the fields there will be close and expert supervision and that they will be used to the utmost.</P>
    <P>As far as the maintenance and repair system goes there is a main workshop in the central engineering workshop in Inchicore and, as Deputy Beegan mentioned, in October, 1953, the Public Accounts Committee visited that workshop.  Their visit came about as a result of some years of queries by the Comptroller and Auditor-General <Col N="608" /> and the committee into the fact that there were considerable delays in taking stock.  I should like to point out that the committee did not go there as a right.  They were invited there by the chairman of the commissioners, who thought they might get a clear view of the difficulties about stores accounting.</P>
    <P>The committee were naturally delighted to accept the invitation and I want to say we found it a most impressive workshop, very large, with a great deal of expensive and probably useful machinery in it.  However, an array of expensive machinery does not necessarily convey a great deal to the layman, and since that visit I have been puzzling in my mind what we saw and what it meant and recently I sought to find an answer to some questions which bothered me by way of parliamentary questions.</P>
    <P>A series of parliamentary questions is not the ideal way of getting information about anything that is a bit elaborate.  However, the Dáil itself is to blame for that.  I sought to get an estimates committee appointed which would be the ideal way of getting such information but the Dáil did not see eye to eye with me and so there is no estimates committee.  The only means left of getting such information are parliamentary questions and it is only when we come up against an elaborate system such as this, with a great deal of money involved, that we come up against very big difficulties. I am considerably handicapped in making inquiries as to what is happening to all this public money.  The questions I asked and the answers I got left me a bit disturbed in my mind on one or two points.</P>
    <P>When the Public Accounts Committee visited the workshop I was very much struck by the system of having kept a case history of every machine in use.  That, of course, is the sort of thing that obviously should be done. The system seemed to be very efficient on the face of it.  There was a graph and a diagram dealing with all the machines and there was a filing system in which were files supposed to contain the history of each machine.  I may have been wrong, but I assumed that <Col N="609" /> those histories would show a fairly considerable amount of detail.  After all, when you have expensive machinery you want to keep a fair amount of detail as to what has happened it.  You would not want a machine coming in for a major overhaul and then coming again in three or four months' time for something else and no one being quite sure when it had had the major overhaul.  That is a thing one would expect to find in the case history.</P>
    <P>I am surprised that in respect of some of the questions I asked, which I thought would be merely a matter of turning up these case histories and scribbling it down in the course of a couple of days, I was asked to repeat the question in a fortnight's time.  For instance, on the 21st June I had the following question:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To ask the Minister for Finance if he will state, in respect of each item of engineering plant and machinery being overhauled in the central engineering workshop in May, 1955, and which had been out of service for more than six months, the reasons for the time taken (i) to transfer to the workshop, (ii) to begin overhaul after receipt, and (iii) to complete the overhaul where any or all of these factors are material.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I was asked to repeat the question in a fortnight's time.</P>
    <P>I also asked about a particular type of excavator, the Lima 802.  I thought the amount of information I asked for was the sort of thing that would certainly have been on the cards but again I was asked to repeat the question in a fortnight's time.  That does not give one a very happy feeling about just what is going on.</P>
    <P>There was also another question I asked dealing with the type of repairs or what repairs had been made to engineering plant and machinery and I was told that it involved looking up thousands of dockets.  If the case histories of the machines were kept, I do not see how they would have to look up thousands of dockets.</P>
    <P>Another point that arose more or less out of this query of mine as to <Col N="610" /> what was happening was what was the organisation, what was the system that was used in the organisation of the central engineering workshop and a chart was produced showing the makeup. The chart was reasonably extensive in size but was, I think, a little bit misleading in some points.  There was an office described as that of superintendent which was, apparently, on a level with another office, the office of controller and also the office of the supplies manager and the office of chief inspector.  It turned out, in reply to further questioning in the matter, that it was not.</P>
    <P>Without at all knowing anything about the organisation or how it works myself, a glance at the chart does suggest that there is a lack of balance.  To find that a person who is a superintendent and not at all the same rank as a supplies manager or chief inspector has under him almost more men than the supplies manager and the chief inspector put together, while it does not necessarily follow that you can criticise that point, it does look as if the set-up and the number of people of higher grading who are in the central engineering workshop leave something to be desired.</P>
    <P>In the course of making some inquiries about that I came on a remarkable fact.  I would always have assumed that, where temporary staff was being recruited, one would be prepared possibly to waive some qualification but the Office of Public Works does not do things that way.  Where they were looking for a mechanical engineer grade II for temporary work, a university degree or other academic qualification was essential, but when they were advertising, through the Civil Service Commission of course, for permanent posts on this salary basis, a degree was desirable but not essential. Then we wonder why our university graduates leave the country.</P>
    <P>I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will look most seriously into this position because I know nothing about what goes on in the workshop or what the conditions there are about work, but I do think it is a most extraordinary position that there is already a <Col N="611" /> difficulty about getting technical staff and that the Office of Public Works deliberately makes it worse by practically telling graduates that they do not want them.  Why this country is spending thousands of pounds on university education if this is what is to happen at the end of it I do not know.</P>
    <P>Some of the difficulty, of course, arises because the word &ldquo;engineer&rdquo; is not registered.  I can call myself an engineer, as far as I know.  All I need are a few bits of machinery and I can call myself an engineer of some sort.  But, anyway, the office was clever enough when advertising, through the Civil Service Commission, for these permanent posts.  They did not use the word &ldquo;engineer&rdquo;; they only mentioned &ldquo;certain posts&rdquo;&mdash;without the use of the word &ldquo;engineer&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;in the mechanical engineering division&rdquo; but, in fact, the only position that meets the salary advertised is that of mechanical engineer grade II.</P>
    <P>If it is found in the running of a workshop that experience is of more importance than technical qualifications obtained through a university or association, I think the Department has a case but I do think that they ought to inform the Dáil as clearly as possible in the Book of Estimates as to what they are doing.  I do not think it is just good enough to tuck away under &ldquo;mechanical engineer grade II&rdquo; people who are not engineers in the sense that is accepted, whether it is legal or not.</P>
    <P>Most people when they see the description &ldquo;mechanical engineer,&rdquo; whether it is a legal description or not or a legal qualification or not, expect to find an engineer, a qualified engineer.  It is not that it is not possible to make the appendix to Vote 8 a bit more clear because the position of works manager is put down as &ldquo;works manager.&rdquo;  I do not know whether he is an engineer or not.  I beg pardon.  I think, in reply to a question, it was stated that he is, although I am not very sure on that. At any rate, he is described as &ldquo;works manager&rdquo; and I think it would have been better if these positions where the person is not an engineer in the <Col N="612" /> ordinary accepted sense of the word, were described in the appendix under the title of the office rather than tuck them away in this way as &ldquo;mechanical engineer&rdquo; and give people a wrong impression.</P>
    <P>In reply to a question about the workshop, I was informed that it was reasonably equipped.  Dealing with the equipment of a workshop, a layman is at an obvious disadvantage because most of the machines do not mean anything to him at all; they are just names; but I did get from the Minister for Finance a list of the more expensive machinery in the workshop and then I got curious as to what some of it was and what it was doing and what use was made of it.  One was called a crankshaft regrinder which cost £9,436.  That is a lot of money.  I had actually seen the machine and the workman on it had very kindly explained it to me.  Therefore, I took an interest in it.  I asked what work it had done in 12 months.  The reply was that it had reground and/or balanced in the 12 months 84 crankshafts of various sizes.  The descriptions are all given according to the number of cylinders in the engine&mdash; which does not necessarily mean very much because you could have a single cylinder engine with a crankshaft that would be much heavier than that in an eight-cylinder.  However, on the basis that you could add on two to the number of cylinders to get the number of journals on the crankshaft, which I think is the utmost that would be possible&mdash;in certain circumstances it might do rather less&mdash;I find that the machine worked 474 journals in 12 months.  Then I inquired from the trade as to what it cost to grind and polish a journal and I discovered that it cost, according to size, from 8/6 to £1 per journal.</P>
    <P>Therefore, giving the Office of Public Works and the engineering workshop all the credit I can, and assuming that every journal was of the biggest type and that it cost £1 to get it done in a workshop in town, that brings the work to £474.  The cost to get it done outside the workshop would lie somewhere between £250 to £474.  Even putting it at the figure of £474, it would <Col N="613" /> not pay the interest on the cost of the machine&mdash;£9,436.  When a thing like that appears to happen, one is forced to query it.  If there is a catch in it, I should be very pleased to hear it.  If there is some reason for it, nobody would be better pleased to hear of it than me.  However, on the basis that we have bought a machine which is not working to the value it should for the amount of money spent on it&mdash;because, naturally, as well as interest on the money invested you would have to write off depreciation which, I am informed, is done in the workshop at the rate of 12½ per cent.&mdash;we require some further information.  Then, again, there is the labour cost which must be fairly high because, I take it, a skilled workman uses this machine.</P>
    <P>When I try to find out what happened about the use of this machine it is not easy to get the information because apparently the turner who works this machine works another machine also and I do not understand the other machine: it is a universal cylindrical grinder.  It probably works part-time too.  It cost over £5,000.  The Minister was not able to tell me how many shafts were ground and polished by this machine.  I was informed that that would mean an analysis of a large number of works orders and that it would involve a disproportionate amount of staff time and cost.  I can agree that there is a limit to the amount of money that should be spent in answering a Deputy's question.</P>
    <P>I asked someone in the trade what a universal cylindrical grinder was. They could not understand how it worked on shafts: they thought it worked on hollow jobs.  I am speaking as a layman in this matter.  The impression I got from the trade was that it was something to work on cylinders or sleeves of cylinders rather than on shafts.  However, these two machines cost a lot of money and I am not satisfied that we are getting a return for the money which has been invested.  It is not sufficient to say that they have only turned up in the past couple of years.  There has been a good deal of expenditure for something that could be done by the trade here and at much less cost to the State.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="614" /> I have already referred to what I think is a shortage of professional staff in the workshop.  I know that the Department have had trouble recruiting professional staff.  It has been a bother for a long time&mdash;particularly, I think, in regard to mechanical engineers.  It was explained to the Public Accounts Committee that there was a particular difficulty there because there is no great employment in this country for mechanical engineers and it takes longer to get a degree in mechanical engineering.  It is natural, therefore, that students will go for something that has better prospects here.  However, having heard about the recruitment of mechanical engineers, I would not say that the office is going out to encourage anyone.</P>
    <P>There is also this angle: how far does this shortage cause serious delays in overhauls and major repairs?  With an investment of £1,000,000 in machinery, as I have already stated, it is essential that these machines should work every possible hour.  If there are long delays in getting overhauls done, not only are we wasting time on the drainage but we are delaying it and, as well, we are seriously affecting the use of the machines themselves.  I have mentioned already three or four of the very large ones but there is a considerable investment in some of the others. For instance, the eight &ldquo;Lima 802s&rdquo; cost over £113,000, and there are 28 &ldquo;Lima 34s&rdquo;.  And as far as I can see, their approximate value would be £240,000.  From what I can gather from figures given to me in reply to a question, quite a number of these machines have spent about half their time out of service since 1952.  I do not know whether or not that would come under capital disinvestment.</P>
    <P>It sounds serious that a lot of valuable machines should be out of service for a considerable time.  It is not that there is not enough work, because the Department have taken on various schemes at a fantastic rate.  I think that that, in fact, is one of the troubles the office is suffering from.  There is the political pressure which puts more and more drainage work on them. From a very small thing in 1947, drainage work has grown to be a very large thing and I think drainage works <Col N="615" /> are beginning to burst a bit at the seams.  Naturally, every Deputy, including myself, wants to see any drainage that requires to be done in his constituency carried out as soon as possible.  However, I am not sure that the Government should not have resisted a good deal of this and made sure that, when taking on schemes, they had behind them something that would really carry the work out expeditiously and cheaply.  If we have machines and are not able to service them then we have wasted money.</P>
    <P>Has the Parliamentary Secretary anything to say about the question of delays?  I can say for the Board of Works that I got figures for the Central Engineering Workshop for October, 1953, October, 1954, and May last.  It is evident that things have improved very greatly in that period of time.  I took October, 1953, because it was the date of the Public Accounts Committee's visit.  Perhaps I have deceived myself because, in picking out a month here and there, a lot might escape in a net with such a large mesh. However, I think it is reasonable to say that a good deal of the back log work in October, 1953, has now been caught up with.</P>
    <P>According to the last information which I received, the number of machines actually in for repairs was down very well in May, none were awaiting transfer to the Central Engineering Workshop at Inchicore and none were there awaiting repair. You would almost begin to wonder what is going to happen that workshop if that rate of progress is kept up and whether or not it will be needed in its present size.  I hope someone has a plan worked out as between the facilities made available in the workshop and the amount of plant to be served. I hope someone knows just where it is going, because it is not terribly clear at the moment to me from the details I have got.</P>
    <P>I do not find it possible to say much more about the Central Engineering Workshop, for the simple reason that I do not know anything more.  There are quite a number of machines there and I do not know much about them at all, but I do know that I do not like <Col N="616" /> the look of what I have learned about one of them, and naturally I am left wondering what sort of history is attached to all the others&mdash;whether they are working and what efficiency there is in the workshop at all.</P>
    <P>In the field, from the details in the Estimate of the number of technical staff, I think it is possible to worry about whether there is enough technical staff of high enough grade to take charge of all these expensive machines.  I have mentioned the two Marion IIIs and the two large Limas which cost £30,000 each.  Between them, these machines represent an investment of £146,000.  I tried to find out, just as a sort of spot check, what they had been doing.  I asked for some details and I suggested that a log of the two biggest should be put in the Library.  That was to give the least possible trouble to everybody concerned and I am informed that the Minister does not think it &ldquo;desirable&rdquo; that such a log book should be put in the Library.  The Minister could have thought of a lot of answers that would have been better than that one.</P>
    <P>Am I seriously expected to take it that Deputies are not supposed to be informed on what happens to an investment of State money of £146,000 and that it is not desirable they should know what the log of these machines is?  I think that is a very wrong answer.  It is clearly the duty of the Minister to inform the Dáil of anything as interesting as that.  There is a lot of money involved in it and it only tends to make a Deputy much more suspicious of what is going on, when he is told that it is not desirable that the log of a machine should be open to his inspection.  If it was said that there was not a proper log kept, it would have been bad enough.  I have been puzzling my mind to think of an answer that would have been worse than to say that it was not desirable that Deputies should know what use was being made of machines at that price and I hope that further consideration will be given to being much more generous with information about this sort of thing.</P>
    <P>One of the things that bothers me in all this is: how did anyone decide <Col N="617" /> how many of these particular machines should be got?  I tried to find out what happened to some particular machines and the position, as disclosed by replies to questions, is so lacking in clarity that I hesitate to say anything at all.  Mind you, I am not blaming the Department for that type of answer, because I admit that it is almost impossible to give a written answer, just as it was almost impossible for me to think of a written question to cover the points I wanted to make.  Again, the only sensible way in which Deputies will ever find out details of this type is through an Estimates Committee, where the officials can be present and can explain by word of mouth, which is very much better than attempting to find out in the only way open to me.</P>
    <P>These are about the only points I wanted to cover in the way of detail in regard to what I have got in reply to questions.  I admit that my criticism of the office is purely destructive, but it is not possible for a layman to be constructive.  The minute a layman starts talking to technical people about any constructive suggestion in relation to machinery&mdash;that is where he walks into trouble, because he will get a very short answer.</P>
    <P>All I am trying to establish is this, that the State has walked in on arterial drainage and has given it to the Office of Public Works&mdash;probably naturally enough, seeing that they were already doing some drainage&mdash;but I do not think it has worked out as well as it should.  Somewhere there is a bottle-neck, though I do not like the word.  We have a large amount of machinery and we have a very large workshop.  I am not satisfied that we are getting the best out of either of them and I should like to know why they are not working better.</P>
    <P>The history of delays on overhauls &mdash;the only answer I could get is that priority was given to other machinery. At the time I worked it out, I could not see what other work they were doing because everyone was put on one side to do something else.  There were 23 excavators in and, of these, 17 were not being worked on because of <Col N="618" /> priority given to other work, and it makes one wonder what they were working at, so many of them were put to one side because of priority given to other work in a workshop of this size. I am worried about whether there is enough brass&mdash;I will put it that way&mdash; in Inchicore and how far the place is starved for high-grade&mdash;in the Civil Service sense of &ldquo;grade&rdquo;&mdash;technical staff, and as to how far we have rushed into arterial drainage and a large expenditure and the Department of Finance, the Government or whoever is responsible has taken cold feet.</P>
    <P>Personally, I think it should have been done in a different way.  There should have been a different overall plan, but, taking it on the plan that has been adopted, we have rushed into a large investment&mdash;£1,000,000 worth of excavators and a large workshop&mdash;and, having set out on that, I think the Government has not had the courage to work it out to its logical conclusion.  They have spent a lot of money on ancillary machines in the workshop for servicing these machines and there does not seem to be quite enough for them to do to earn their pay.  Surely some consideration should be given to that.</P>
    <P>It also seems to me that we are being penny-wise and pound-foolish.  That is the sort of thing which the Department of Finance spends its time being. If we determined that this was going to be done by ourselves and that the whole thing was going to be self-supporting, we should have gone at it baldheaded and should have seen that there was enough supervisory staff to make a thorough-going job of it.  As it is, my impression would be that the technical staff are inclined to be overawed by the administrative side. Whether the administrative side are back-pedalling or not, I do not know &mdash;it may be the Department of Finance and maybe it is Government policy&mdash; but the whole place, without being able to put my finger on exact details, gives me the impression that there is a lack of belief in its future.</P>
    <P>What the technical people think, I do not know.  I do not know what anybody thinks about it, but if we really mean to go ahead with arterial <Col N="619" /> drainage in the way in which we have set out, if we really mean to have this enormous investment and really mean to do it by ourselves, within ourselves and not by work outside on contract, I think it wants far more supervisory staff than it has got.  Organisation, so far, is very bad, in my opinion.  The number of engineers could not possibly supervise all this expensive machinery in the way in which it should be supervised.  The delays that must take place on a drainage work because of minor things, so far as I can see, are more than expensive.</P>
    <P>I should like to hear from the Parliamentary Secretary just what happens when a large and expensive machine breaks down&mdash;how fast can it be got back to work; is there any avoidable delay; and does he need more staff?  Certainly, the general impression I have got is that someone is half-hearted somewhere.  I do not know who is the enthusiast and who the person who is back-pedalling, but the whole thing seems to me to have got a little out of shape.  We have given way in relation to the purchase of expensive machinery, on the one hand, and held back on the other, looking for the staff to work and supervise.  I hope that if the policy of doing arterial drainage within the Office of Public Works in the way in which we have set out is to be continued, someone will have the courage to go at it baldheaded and do it thoroughly.  Nothing could be worse than to see large and expensive machinery underworked.  That is about the most expensive thing you can do with expensive machinery.</P>
    <P>I know what happened, in another Department, to expensive machinery that was out under the land project. You had an expensive bulldozer working eight hours a day and the trained staff would not be allowed to work overtime, so they went to England where they were allowed to work overtime. That bulldozer was working five and a half eight-hour days in a week. I do not think that was the way to treat such an investment.  No contractor could make his living in that way. I think the same thing is happening <Col N="620" /> here; I do not think proper use is being made of the machines.  There seems to be no mention of any incentive to workmen to work overtime or get more out of the machines.  I have heard nothing about different crews to keep a machine in steady work&mdash;perhaps that is done and if so it is all to the good.</P>
    <P>There is a lack of information about the whole thing and a lack of interest, which should be got over as soon as possible.  I invite the Parliamentary Secretary to make a lengthy statement &mdash;if not in reply to this debate, at some other time&mdash;and to reassure the House and the country that the amount of money invested is giving a proper return and that the whole business is not being spoiled by someone's lack of faith in what the Department has set out to do.</P>

      <P>No, I referred to that casually as I passed through.  Questions have been asked here at various times about the drainage of the River Maine in County Kerry, which divides North and South Kerry.  We understood that when a scheme is laid down the order in which the rivers should be drained is laid down, according to their importance and because of the flooding they cause.  We understood the order was: the Brosna, the Glyde and Dee, the Feale, the Maine, the Corrib, the Moy and so on.  It was rather <Col N="621" /> unfortunate for us in Kerry that when this scheme of arterial drainage was being brought into operation there was a Parliamentary Secretary from Galway in charge of the Board of Works. Again, after he left office, another Parliamentary Secretary from much the same area succeeded him.  The drainage of the Maine was neglected and all the forces of the Board of Works were directed into Galway. Between the Parliamentary Secretary and the ex-Parliamentary Secretary, you had nothing but Galway.  I had to intervene at one stage to ask if this was a debate on the Estimate for Public Works or a debate about the drainage of the Corrib and about other schemes in Galway.</P>
      <P>The River Maine is a very important river and along its banks, north and south, we have some of the finest and most fertile land in the country.  It is the only river in this country or Europe, or perhaps in the world, for which at one time a drainage scheme was formulated and it was drained from the source.  Did anybody ever hear in any other country of a river being drained from the source?  Because of the peculiar arrangement, for some reason, whether political or otherwise, the people in the Maine valley have been flooded at various times in the past ten or 15 years.  There was a real scare in 1950, I think, when not only were their lands flooded but their very homes.  They lost hundreds of live stock and while the Government did its best to recoup them in some way these people on the River Maine are living always in terror of a repetition of that flooding, that they would be drowned in their homes or have to leave and let their live stock drown.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a committee there, the Maine Drainage Committee, made up of various Parties without regard to political affiliation.  We have asked the Board of Works and the Parliamentary Secretaries and we have sent up deputations which were received, but nothing has been done.  I looked over the opening statement of the present Parliamentary Secretary.  He mentions all the rivers that should be drained. I do not think I saw the Maine amongst <Col N="622" /> them, although it is one of the most important rivers that should be drained because the land in the catchment area is some of the best in this country.</P>

      <P>The Deputy who has spoken is from Galway, too, and no matter how they refer to it across the House they are interested only in Galway. I know all about them.  I am interested in my constituency in Kerry. Because of the peculiar method of drainage of the Maine&mdash;draining it from the source&mdash;and because nothing has been done for the past 20 years to rectify the error then made, I deem it my duty, as the single Deputy from South Kerry and as Chairman of the Kerry County Council, to say that unless the Parliamentary Secretary is prepared to state that, the survey of the Maine having been completed, machinery will be placed to enable the drainage of the Maine to begin, I shall get the people of South and North Kerry to come together and we shall refuse to pay rates or taxes or annuities until this work is carried out.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. A. Byrne Mr. A. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>My intervention in this debate will be brief.  I know that the Office of Public Works is engaged on a number of big projects relating to drainage in the country districts, and that these have prior claim on the Parliamentary Secretary.  At the same time I want to remind him of a promise that he made about five years ago, when he was first appointed as Parliamentary Secretary, to the late Deputy A. Byrne, Junior, who asked him a question in regard to the possibility of putting up shelters in the <Col N="623" /> Phoenix Park for our boys in the City of Dublin who go there on Saturday afternoons and Sunday mornings to play football and hurling.  We know that when children from the City of Dublin go out there to engage in their games that they take off their coats and waistcoats and use them as goalposts. Very often, the rain comes down while they are engaged in their game and we know what happens.  The children's clothes get wet and their bodies also get wet.  There is no shelter or accommodation of any kind for them and neither is there toilet accommodation.  That, I suggest, is a very big failure in these days of social services.</P>
      <P>It is true to say that the Phoenix Park is the biggest playground in Europe.  It is something that Dublin people are very proud of.  I want to again urge on the Parliamentary Secretary that shelters should be provided for our young children and for grownup boys and young men, shop assistants and others, who go out there on Sunday mornings to play hurling and to engage in other forms of sport such as football and cricket.  I think that the Government should be prepared to spend, say, £10,000 in putting up shelters for the accommodation of these people with a supply of drinking water and toilet accommodation.  I am not asking that hot water should be provided.  The school children who go out there to play are very often under the control of their schoolmasters, but in addition to them quite a number of other children from areas in the vicinity of the Park go there unattended. It is deplorable that shelters are not provided for their accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the playing pitches which are provided in the Phoenix Park I want to say that they are magnificently maintained by whoever is in charge of them.  I think it only right that a word of praise should be spoken here in that regard.  I do implore the Parliamentary Secretary, in the interests of the children who go there, to see that another ten or 20 shelters are provided and that they are <Col N="624" /> properly equipped.  I am of opinion that if my request is acceded to, it will be the means of saving a number of children and others from contracting T.B.  We all know that when children, and even grown up people get bad wettings, in the course of a week or two they have to obtain hospital treatment.  I should say that quite a big number of children contract it from getting wettings in public places like the Park, for the reasons that I have indicated.  I do not think it is necessary for me to spur the Parliamentary Secretary to do what I am asking.  I am sure that it is only necessary to remind him of the very kind promise he made exactly five years ago to see that shelters will be provided.  A number of sporting organisations have asked me to raise the matter here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one matter in connection with the Corrib drainage which I have been asked to raise, if in fact it has not been attended to, and is not included in the scheme that was prepared.  I wonder if the Parliamentary Secretary would consider if it is not yet too late to include it.  I refer to Menlo Creek which is the second outlet from the lake to the River Corrib as it approaches Galway City.  In fact I understand it was the original natural outlet, and that the Friars' Cut is an artificial outlet.</P>
      <P>I raised the matter of summer flooding here last week in the House.  The Parliamentary Secretary did not give me a great deal of satisfaction in the matter.  These lands, which are situate about four miles from Galway, are more subject to flooding than I think most of the other lands in the immediate vicinity of Galway.  I refer to the lands in the townland of Curraghmore, Coursefield and one or two other places between Galway and Headford.  Questions have been put down to ascertain if the Parliamentary Secretary would make representations to the Commissioners of Public Works to secure the opening of the sluice gates so as to relieve this unusually high summer flooding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The lands referred to in the question were not covered with water but they <Col N="625" /> were water-logged and cattle had to be removed from them.  There was a necessity, in some cases at all events, to sell cattle prematurely.  When I raised the question the Parliamentary Secretary replied by saying that to release the flood waters would damage the drainage works taking place in that part of the river which runs through Galway City.  I take it that the view of his advisers in that respect was based on experience which happened late last autumn when works they had constructed below O'Brien's Bridge were swept away by the high winter floods.  The question that has been put to me, and that I am now transmitting to the Parliamentary Secretary, is this: why were the comparatively dry months of March, April and May and particularly April let pass without resuming these works below O'Brien's Bridge?  April, as everyone knows, was the driest of the first six months of the year, and both March and May were considerably drier than June.  The question has been put: why were these months allowed to pass without recommencing work in the Corrib?</P>
    <P>The work was started again on the Corrib in the wettest month we had this year.  In fact, as far as my recollection goes, it was one of the wettest months for the past 12 months.  The Parliamentary Secretary claims he can make decisions of the first importance in relation to decisions arrived at by the Commissioners of Public Works about drainage, one of which was referred to by a Deputy behind his back &mdash;Deputy Palmer&mdash;a few moments ago. The question is, did he also interfere to keep this work back until the month of June?  If he did, it was a very unfortunate decision from the point of view of the weather and necessitated his giving me the reply to convey to the farmers whose cattle were flooded out that they could not open the floodgates at Galway to any extent to relieve the flooding two or three miles up the lake from Galway.</P>
    <P>The question was answered for me on an inquiry by me over the phone to the engineers in Galway.  They said that they had to proceed in accordance with an award made in the year 1859; that certain levels were prescribed by <Col N="626" /> that award and that they were powerless in the matter.  That reply was satisfactory from the engineers' point of view.  For my part, I had to accept what they told me.  I am quite satisfied they told me what they believed was the truth.  The question which arose out of that reply which I discussed with farmers the same day I got the information was this: how is it that these gates were often opened at Galway on occasions when the water was not quite so high as it was in this month of June?</P>
    <P>The engineers had pointed out to me that the level of 31.2 feet over the sea level was apparently the level to be reached before they could authorise the opening of the gates but the mark by which the engineers are now going is apparently one they erected recently and old marks which were visible on stonework near the sluice gates&mdash;marks applied in red paint&mdash;have either been effaced or worn away.  In any event, it is these red painted marks by which the officials of the Corrib Drainage Trustees used to regulate the opening of the gates to relieve summer flooding. The point made by the farmers is that the new level now followed by the engineers is not the same as the one heretofore followed.</P>
    <P>The level decided upon formerly was not any rule of thumb decision by a non-engineer.  A qualified engineer was acting as adviser to the Corrib Drainage Trustees and I take it that it was he who indicated the point to which the water should rise before the gates were opened.  There is a conflict, therefore, between the two levels in respect of this summer flooding and the opening of the gates.  I should like that to be taken note of by the Parliamentary Secretary.  These levels should be checked and, perhaps, the Parliamentary Secretary might investigate the complaint that the water was much higher this year and yet the gates were not opened than on many previous occasions when the gates were, in fact, opened.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is particularly helpful of the Parliamentary Secretary to make the sharp retort to me, when I was trying to seek some information from him last week, as to what we were doing for 30 years.  In fact, we were <Col N="627" /> not 30 years there anyway.  I do recall that at one period of that 30 years very big promises were made and not carried out.  It was we on this side of the House who gave legislative effect to the desire of the farmers to have this question of major drainage tackled on a proper basis and that was done in the 1945 Drainage Act.</P>
    <P>There is no use chiding us with what we failed to do in major development schemes and so on during the ten years of the war when, in spite of all sorts of difficulties, external and internal, we successfully tried to keep the nation's chin over water&mdash;different flood water from what I am dealing with now but, nevertheless, dangerous.  I do not think that kind of retort becomes either a Parliamentary Secretary or anybody else in this House.  When a Deputy stands up here to ask for some aid and assistance for farmers who, in the main, are living on very small holdings and are very hard workers to have something they had been getting before and cannot see why they are not getting now, I think they are entitled to more courtesy.  After all, the discourtesy was not to me but through me to the people who were making the appeal that they were entitled to a little more consideration than they got in the reply.</P>
    <P>I passed on the reply with a copy of the supplementaries which passed between the Parliamentary Secretary and myself and I want to tell him here and now that the comments of the farmers were anything but favourable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>To the Parliamentary Secretary.  The comments were more directed against the sharp irrelevant retort to which I have referred than, in fact, to the failure of the Parliamentary Secretary to do anything for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also want to refer to another lack of courtesy on the part of the Parliamentary Secretary in relation to another question which I put him about a fortnight ago.  It referred to the carrying out of an employment scheme for the improvement of a pier at a place called <Col N="628" /> Shruffaun in Carraroe, County Galway. I asked the Minister for Finance:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If he will state (a) the dates in 1952-53 and 1953-54 on which sanction was given for marine works at Shruffaun, County Galway, (b) the nature and extent of the works so sanctioned, (c) the estimated cost in each case, (d) the dates of commencement and completion of the works and, (e) if any of these works have not been commenced, the cause of the delay.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The reply I got was:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;One scheme for execution at Shruffaun was sanctioned on the 13th March, 1953, and consisted of the extension of the pier by 38 feet, the provision of concrete steps, rock removal in the vicinity of the nose of the pier and repairs to the surface of the pier.  These works which were estimated to cost £1,120 were commenced on the 15th April, 1953 and completed on 31st October, 1953.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, here is the gem of the reply:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;No other scheme was sanctioned in either of the years 1952-53 or 1953-54.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>When the Parliamentary Secretary gave me that reply on 16th June a second work was actually in operation and had commenced on the 6th June. I know very well that the Parliamentary Secretary in relation to this criticism will ask me why did I not specify the appropriate year, the year appropriate to this second scheme.  The Minister for Finance interpolated some remark to save the Parliamentary Secretary from embarrassment arising on that particular point.  I have since looked into the matter and even on that particular score I still find I was right and that the Parliamentary Secretary's information was, in fact, quite wrong and that it was not correct to say that no other scheme was sanctioned in either of the years 1952-53 or 1953-54.</P>
    <P>If the Parliamentary Secretary refers to the minutes of a meeting of the Inter-Departmental Committee, presided over by the then Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Jack Lynch, he <Col N="629" /> will find that a second scheme was sanctioned in the year 1953-54.</P>
    <P>I think that the years which I mentioned in my questions to the Parliamentary Secretary, in view of that minute, covered the two jobs of work which were sanctioned for this particular marine work, but even if it is not correct, even if there was a technical slip, again I want to charge the Parliamentary Secretary with discourtesy in giving me such a short reply by saying no other scheme was sanctioned in either of the years 1952-53 or 1953-54 when he might, in fact, if he were courteous, have said: &ldquo;You should have put in the year 1954-55, and I could then tell you a further job was sanctioned and that it is now in progress.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not think I would have pursued him if he had shown me that courtesy with the criticism that he deliberately held over this job until the 6th June, when we were in the middle of the local elections, just as seems to have happened in regard to the arterial drainage job below O'Brien's Bridge in Galway City.</P>
    <P>I have not a whole lot more to say on this particular Vote but I do think that the Parliamentary Secretary would do himself and the people he represents a much better service if he did not incorporate quibbles of this sort in his replies.  He must have known that I knew that a job of work had in fact begun on the 6th June.  I asked did he know that the job was on, did he know it had been sanctioned, but he preserved silence on that and left me in grave doubts that he knew anything about this particular job until I told him about it.  I would like him to correct that because that was the impression I got, that, in fact, a job of work went on that he knew nothing about.  I do not think that is the position, really.  I do not think his advisers would slip up so badly&mdash; in fact I am sure they did not.  But what sort of unintelligible fear was agitating his mind about the results of the local election or the effect of this job on the voters of Carraroe if they found out that it was we, before we left office, who had sanctioned both jobs?  That is the only conclusion I can come to in the matter.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="630" /> I must say I found the Office of Public Works and the Special Employment Schemes Office and their engineers most helpful in relation to this particular job at Shruffaun.  As is pointed out in the reply to the question the extension to the pier was sanctioned and certainly the local people welcomed such an extension, but, as very often happens, in these cases, when a job is actually under way a great many people seem to find faults in it that they could not visualise before it began.</P>
    <P>I received a number of letters from people complaining about the proposal in this case, that this jetty was going to cause inconvenience to boats pulling alongside and that in fact it would be more of a nuisance than anything else. That was a surprise to me.  However, I transmitted these complaints and I must say the Office of Public Works lost no time in sending down an engineer. They asked me if I would communicate with the people who were complaining and ask everybody interested to come on the spot so that we could talk the whole thing out with everybody concerned present.  I thought that was a very sensible suggestion on the part of the officers concerned. The engineers turned up there and the whole thing was discussed with a number of people who were present. The people locally got a chance to say everything they wanted to say about it.  They pointed out other defects in the structure which were not included in the first proposal.</P>
    <P>The engineers took note of all these things and the result was that in this very expeditious way the engineers themselves went back to their offices and reported.  They formulated the second proposal and it is they really who are responsible for the second job going on.  I want to tell the Parliamentary Secretary that I was not making any political capital out of it in any way.  I was surprised that the job was not going on.  I came to the conclusion that the Parliamentary Secretary again had exercised his authority during the last 12 months and that this job like others, had been stopped by him for good reasons of his own, possibly based on local representations. <Col N="631" /> I did not inquire further until the matter was brought to my notice a short time before I put down the question.  I was asked to make inquiries and I did so by way of parliamentary question.</P>
    <P>I am referring at length to these matters because I think the Parliamentary Secretary ought to mend his technique in dealing with Deputies here who want information.  It was nothing short of a quibble to treat my question in the way he treated it, to try to create the impression that, in fact, whatever was going on&mdash;and he did not seem to know&mdash;&ldquo;well, you had nothing to do with it anyway.&rdquo;  That was apparently the urge which made him answer me in the way in which he did.</P>
    <P>Deputy Beegan has referred to a matter which is agitating a very large number of people in County Galway.  I do not intend to go into it in any detail but I do want to say this.  The statutory declaration or affidavit which Deputy Beegan read out was signed by a gentleman in County Galway who cannot be accused, as Deputy Beegan pointed out, of being a supporter of Fianna Fáil at any time.  The fact that he signed it&mdash;and there are others who also cannot be accused of supporting us and who signed statutory declarations&mdash;should be proof to the Parliamentary Secretary that he has slipped up.  Would the Parliamentary Secretary, having this incontrovertible proof that he has slipped up&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I was putting the matter in a very simple and a very understandable way and it was by <Col N="633" /> means of a question: Would he not think that the people of the standing of those who made these statutory declarations, who are hostile to this Party politically and who have never been supporters of it, thought that the merits of the case were such as to warrant going to the extent of making statutory declarations, that that was <i>prima facie</i> evidence that there is some merit in the case which Deputy Beegan so ably put here this evening?</P>

      <P>If we are going to have this thing on the basis of <i>et tu quoque</i>, we will get nowhere.  If Deputy Beegan had treated this man more harshly than the present Parliamentary Secretary that is still no answer to the case that is now being put up.  They can be depended upon to pillory Deputy Beegan as well.  Is the Parliamentary Secretary going to hide behind his predecessor's back now?  Is he not going to stand up now to the charges made against him and defend himself on the basis of his own actions?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary hold his patience and give us all the information when he is concluding?  Assuming, for argument's <Col N="634" /> sake, that Deputy Beegan sacked the man unjustly, that he treated him more harshly than the Parliamentary Secretary has treated him, how does that meet the case contained in the statutory declarations and affidavits made by these people to whom I have referred? It is not Deputy Beegan they are dealing with; it is the present Parliamentary Secretary, and there is this difference, at any rate, between the two treatments meted out by the ex-Parliamentary Secretary and the present one.  Deputy Beegan was quite straight and above-board in the matter. Whatever he did, there was no tomfoolery. There was no deception. There was no quibbling.  There was no question of saying that I should have used the term &ldquo;stores assistant&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;assistant storekeeper&rdquo; That seems very like a wise afterthought and that is the impression it has created in the minds of the Old I.R.A. down there.</P>
      <P>The fact is that Deputy Beegan, when the rest of these people were let go, saw to it that this man was kept on because of the very special circumstances&mdash;first of all, because of his excellent merit and his suitability for the position plus the other exceptional circumstances.  Now I think the best thing the Parliamentary Secretary could do would be to go down, as he did on a former occasion, and meet these people in County Galway.  He can rest assured that Deputy Beegan will act as he acted on the occasion of previous meetings of this sort; he will keep away.</P>

      <P>He told me, when he got invitations to those meetings: &ldquo;I am not going to these meetings.  I am not going to embarrass Deputy Donnellan, who is now Parliamentary Secretary by my presence.  I think it would be taking a most unfair advantage and I will leave the matter to be dealt with by Deputy Donnellan in conclave with these people.&rdquo;  I think that was a very fair and decent and proper attitude on the part of Deputy Beegan and I want the Parliamentary Secretary now to go back again to meet these people, make a clean breast of <Col N="635" /> whatever mistakes he has made and, if a man makes a clean breast of his mistakes and there is any mitigation at all for them, he will find that the Old I.R.A., above and beyond all other sections of the community, will be the first to display a sense of justice, fair play and equity.</P>

      <P>My attitude in relation to this question of employment by the Board of Works is that such employment, or disemployment, is something which should not enter into the realms of politics at all.  I was positively amazed on Friday last to hear people who were responsible for appointing gangers or time-keepers on one particular job, recruited solely through the local Fianna Fáil club, talking here about political trickery in the appointment of men in the Board of Works.  Possibly the gentleman who was speaking was not aware of what was happening.  Possibly the strings were pulled by people far lower in the political sphere than he was; but that it was done can be proved very easily.</P>
      <P>It may be a coincidence, but it is stretching coincidence rather far when one finds five men who never held a position of authority being appointed; one of these men would not be able to read his own name if it was written in letters one foot high; yet, he was appointed as a time-keeper on an important job simply and solely because he was a member of the local Fianna Fáil club.  It is then one begins to worry and to wonder if there is something wrong.  I think it is entirely wrong for any politician to try to force people into employment for which they are not fit.  If men get employment solely on merit, then I agree it is quite right they should get that employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I said I am quite sure Deputy Beegan was not aware of what was happening, but someone much lower in the political scale must have appointed them because they had one qualification: they were all members of the local Fianna Fáil club.  One of those men never did a day's work in his life.  No one ever knew him to work for anyone.  He was appointed as a time-keeper.  That was not high enough, because he was the secretary of the club and he was appointed as a ganger.  It was not, however, too safe to make him a ganger locally, working with men who knew him, and he was, therefore, transferred down to the Nenagh scheme and he is now a ganger on the Nenagh scheme.  I will give his name and anyone who likes can check on what I have said.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>That is one of the reasons why I am absolving the ex-Parliamentary Secretary from blame. I think this House will have to take steps to ensure that politics do not enter into employment under the Board of Works.  I do not think it is right that they should.  No matter what political Party intervenes, they should be told to take their hands off such important work because they will do it no good.</P>
      <P>I would like now to ask the Parliamentary Secretary to try to push the River Boyne up a little higher on the list than it is at the present time.  I know every Deputy will make claims for his own particular areas.  Nevertheless I think the Boyne needs special attention because&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the 12th&mdash;a very appropriate date!</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The 12th was in the news before.  At least the Parliamentary Secretary will remember <Col N="637" /> the river to which I am referring because of the date.  The Boyne flows through excellent agricultural land.  It floods that land.  I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary now, because of the fact that I think the job could be carried out very quickly, to give the Boyne special attention.  This river has flooded the town of Navan extensively. It has flooded the town of Trim to a lesser extent on various occasions. Other Deputies may possibly have a greater claim to priority but if the Parliamentary Secretary would have work on the Boyne speeded up he would be doing a good job.</P>
      <P>There is one other very important matter I want to raise.  Reference has been made here to employment on these drainage schemes.  I cannot understand why labourers employed by the Office of Public Works, particularly those employed on arterial drainage schemes, should be the lowest paid workers in the country; possibly they are the lowest paid workers in Europe. These men have to work under very trying conditions.  The House may not be aware of the fact that they often work 12 to 14 hours per day in the summer time in order to try to make a decent week's wages.  Such conditions should not be forced on any workingman and I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to take steps to remedy them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before the last general election a member of the Opposition travelled the length of one of those rivers and assured the men working there that if Fianna Fáil were returned to power an increase of 12/6 per week was waiting round the corner.  Fianna Fáil were not returned to power but no increase of 12/6 was ever given.  I made very exhaustive inquiries and I can find no evidence that anybody had any idea of giving these men an increase of 12/6 per week.  I do not think those men should be misled like that.  I think they were entitled to that increase of 12/6, and to an even larger increase. At the moment there does not seem to be any idea that they should receive an increase despite the fact that trade unionists&mdash;I know that very many of these men are not trade unionists&mdash;are <Col N="638" /> seeking increases in wages in other walks of life.  I think these men should be properly looked after by the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>Not alone do they receive no increase but there is a very bad system in operation in so far as it applies to these men.  I do not know who started that system, but when a Church holyday occurs the labourers on these schemes lose a day's pay while everybody else attached to the schemes from the ganger up is paid.  I grant that the ganger has to go through the form of walking the stretch of river and for that he is paid a day's pay. But I do not think the system is fair at all.  We are supposed to be a Christian country and surely it is far from fair that men who have to depend for their livelihood on the work of their hands should suffer the loss of a day's pay because of the incidence of a Church holyday.  I have raised the matter with the Minister for Finance and they are now prepared to go a certain length; they are prepared to swop the ten Church holydays for the bank holidays.  That is not a satisfactory solution to the problem but it is a step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>County council employees in most areas receive pay for Church holydays along with certain bank holidays and since the pay is so low there is no reason why men working on these drainage schemes should have to go without their day's pay on Church holydays.  Reference was made during the debate to the question of State farms.  I should like to make reference to the conditions that exist on the Grange Farm in Dunsany, County Meath.  Quite elaborate stabling was erected on that farm not so very long ago, but no attempt was made to provide cooking facilities or lunch-time shelter for the 30 men who worked there.  Something should be done to remedy that problem.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter to which I should like to refer before concluding. Recently I had occasion to visit a friend of mine who was ill in the Hume Street Hospital.  The parking space being limited at the time, I pulled up opposite the Office of Public Works.  As I went round the corner <Col N="639" /> to the hospital a man came down the steps and asked me if I were leaving my car there.  I said I was but that I would be only ten minutes.  I went away and I was 25 minutes absent. When I arrived back a gentleman came down the steps out of the Office of Public Works, obviously a doorman, and abused me for leaving my car there while the chairman was forced to walk three or four steps across the street.  Apparently the chairman could not pull into the kerb because of my car.  It is high time that civil servants in this city were told that the parking spaces in front of public offices are not the divine right of civil servants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy James Tully raised a very important point when he referred to the methods of recruitment for work on drainage schemes by the Board of Works and the Special Employment Schemes Office.  I find myself in complete agreement with Deputy Tully's remarks about the problem that has arisen of using the Office of Public works for the purpose of installing political favourites.  I do not want to <Col N="640" /> see money that is voted to drainage schemes in this country, or any portion of that money, used as a form of slush fund in order that political henchmen may get priority over more deserving opponents.  Deputy Tully suggests that he is aware men were appointed as gangers under the Board of Works because they happened to be members of a Fianna Fáil club at some stage.</P>
      <P>If he suggests that is true, he should go further and emphasise the fact that he is quite aware the same thing happened before under the inter-Party régime and that it is happening now.  Two wrongs do not make a right and I am not casting any aspersions on Deputy Beegan, the former Parliamentary Secretary, or on Deputy Donnellan, the present holder of that office. But I do want to make it clear that I believe the best man, the most skilled man, the most competent man, should be appointed, not the man who has the most political influence with whatever Party or Parties happened to be in power at the time.  It is very difficult to bring about a change when we have the present system of recruitment.  As long as it is left to certain individuals to make selections without putting the applicants through rigid tests we are bound to have a certain amount of dissatisfaction and a certain number of incompetent people appointed to posts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make it clear also that because a man happens to be a member of a political Party which helps him to get an appointment that does not mean he may be incompetent. Many of those men are competent and good skilful men at their work, but if we are going to cut out the slush fund, as I will describe it, then we must set up boards for the appointment of gangers and other responsible posts available in the drainage schemes.  We hear no talk or criticism about the method of recruitment to the Civil Service.  Neither do we hear criticisms of the method of recruitment to appointments under local authorities such as clerks or staff officers in county councils.  That is because there is an interview board and an examination, and it would be better for all concerned if that system were <Col N="641" /> put into operation in so far as the Board of Works is concerned.</P>
    <P>I know that as far as the engineering staff is concerned they must undergo an interview and a test.  That is desirable because it would be a tragic state of affairs if the best men were not selected for posts that required technical skill, particularly in relation to arterial drainage.  Before I deal with the other drainage problems I should like to say a few words on the problem that has arisen in Galway in connection with the appointment of paymaster on the Corrib scheme.  During my number of years in the House I happened to know Deputy Beegan and Deputy Donnellan very well and I do not believe that either of them would deal harshly or unjustly with any man no matter what his political views were.</P>
    <P>However, in connection with this particular problem which Deputy Beegan raised, I must say this&mdash;and I am speaking now as a completely neutral observer&mdash;that the files in connection with Mr. Newell's case were put before me.  I read those files very carefully.  I read the sworn affidavits. I also examined the minutes of the various meetings held by the Old I.R.A Organisation.  I must confess that the whole thing sounded very involved and intricate to me.  I believe that, as far as Mr. Newell is concerned, we can say that he was misled in regard to this appointment.  From the evidence brought before me, I am satisfied that Mr. Newell was promised the appointment of paymaster on the Corrib.  I am not in a position to say what place he got as a result of the interview. There is a certain amount of evidence that would suggest that Mr. Newell got first place from the interview board.  I understand that there is conflict of opinion about that.  Some people state that he did not get first place, that he got fifth place.  I would like the Parliamentary Secretary, when replying, to clarify that position definitely.</P>
    <P>I am also satisfied that Mr. Newell was told by the Minister for Finance, Mr. Sweetman, that the position of paymaster would carry a wage of only £3 per week plus travelling expenses and that Mr. Newell was told that, in <Col N="642" /> view of his prominent past record in the country, it was felt that this job was not good enough for him at all. Now we find, as a result of parliamentary questions, that paymasters on other drainage works have been in receipt of a good deal more than £3 per week.</P>
    <P>I raise this matter in order to satisfy myself that justice has been done.  The Parliamentary Secretary will be doing a good day's work for the House if he has the position properly clarified.  I confess I am rather puzzled about the whole thing and I would like the suggestion put forward by the Minister for Lands to be adopted that is, that an inquiry could be held into all the aspects surrounding the appointment of paymaster on the Corrib drainage work.  If that inquiry is held, I am sure it will satisfy, not only Mr. Newell and the Old I.R.A. in Galway, but will satisfy the general public that there has been no hoofling or injustice in connection with this matter.  I hope the offer of the Minister for Lands in connection with the inquiry will be taken up by Deputy Beegan and Deputy Bartley and that the inquiry will be held.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Parliamentary Secretary and the House that the members of the Old I.R.A. who consulted me in this matter were very annoyed, indeed.  They consulted me because I am an Independent Deputy. Their line of approach was that they did not want, under any circumstances, Party politics to enter into this matter. It has been reasonably stated by Deputy Beegan and Deputy Bartley that most of the men who have interested themselves in this matter are not supporters of the Fianna Fáil Party.  Most of them are supporters, I understand, of the Fine Gael Party. So that there can be no question of Party capital being made out of this particular appointment.  I understand also that a number of Deputies were approached in connection with the matter.  Possibly due to the fact that they were too far away from the scene of operations, they neglected to take any steps in the matter.</P>
    <P>All I will say at this stage is what I have already said, that the most <Col N="643" /> satisfactory way of dealing with the matter is to have an inquiry so that we all will be satisfied in regard to the method adopted in making the appointment and we will all be satisfied that justice was done to the particular man who has been mentioned in the debate.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sheldon referred to the desirability of having all drainage works made the responsibility of one authority.  There is a great deal to be said for that.  The present position, where the Board of Works are responsible for arterial drainage, the Department of Local Government and local authorities are responsible for minor works under the various county councils, the Special Employment Schemes Office are responsible for minor drainage works, bog drainage and rural improvement schemes, and the Department of Lands are responsible for the land project scheme, means that none of these Departments knows what is going on in the other Department.  It is most important that all drainage works should be properly co-ordinated and integrated. I would add my voice&mdash;I do not suppose it carries any weight with this Government&mdash;to Deputy Sheldon's in asking the Government to examine the desirability, at any rate, of transferring the Forestry Department to the Board of Works, possibly reconstituting the whole business, and having a drainage board cum forestry board working in co-operation.</P>
    <P>At present a number of areas await attention under the land project scheme.  The Department of Agriculture informs particular farmers that they are anxious to carry out the work but that it would be impossible until major drainage works are done on the outfall.  The responsibility in that connection may now rest either on the Board of Works, as the scheme involved may be an arterial drainage scheme, or it may lie on the county council to get the major drainage work done under the Local Authorities (Works) Act or, possibly, the third body, the Special Employment Schemes Office, may have some responsibility for doing the outfall.  I would like to see all these operations co-ordinated. The particular Department <Col N="644" /> now under discussion would be most suited to have control and responsibility in this connection.</P>
    <P>Within the last 12 months, the Shannon Valley problem has loomed large in the discussions in this House. Great publicity was given by our daily papers during the winter months to the hardship which the people in the Shannon Valley had to suffer due to the very heavy flooding.  I think the general public became aware for the first time in their lives of how serious and tragic is the position of the people who live along the Shannon, both on the Munster and the Leinster sides, and of how precarious their means of livelihood is.  The fact that so much publicity was given in recent months to that problem has raised hopes in the minds of the people who dwell in these areas.  I do not want to see these hopes dying in the near future.  I do not want to see disappointment and despair replace that feeling of hope that exists at the present time.  It is very difficult, really, to deal with all the problems that are involved in connection with the Shannon Valley. Much of what I should like to say would be better and more suitably said on the Estimate for the Department of Lands.  However, I would suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that he should leave his colleague, the Minister for Lands, under no illusion as to what can or what cannot be done as far as relieving the people whose homes were flooded in the Shannon Valley area is concerned.</P>
    <P>At the moment, we have the services of an American engineer, an expert in drainage works.  I understand that at the present time he is making a survey of the Shannon Valley.  I only hope that, as a result of his survey, the Board of Works will undertake certain improvement works on the Shannon. I know that, for many years, the engineers who are responsible for major drainage schemes have been rather cautious about touching the Shannon at all and I do not think we can or should blame them, because most of those engineers had very little practical experience of major drainage works until recent years.  I think that when they started off they felt it would be more desirable to pick the easier <Col N="645" /> schemes in order to get the necessary experience before commencing or tackling a problem of such magnitude as the Shannon presents.</P>
    <P>However, I believe we have very excellent engineering and survey teams now working under the Parliamentary Secretary and that the experience they have gained over the past six or seven years could soon be put to the best possible service by commencing improvement works on the Shannon itself. After all, it is the main artery in the country.  No matter what we may do with tributaries that flow into the Shannon, even to a layman it sounds more sensible to deal with the main artery first.</P>
    <P>When I stress the importance of the Shannon I also have to bear in mind the larger tributaries which flow into it.  It may be said that I will be responsible for holding back the drainage of a river in which I have a very deep interest, namely, the River Suck.  As most Deputies know, or should know, the Suck flows into the River Shannon.  I understand that there is now a volume of opinion that believes that the Suck cannot be drained until improvement works are carried out on the Shannon.  I know that a number of people maintain that if the arterial drainage scheme is carried out on the Suck it is liable to cause immense damage to people who live further down on the Shannon banks.  That is a matter on which I am not competent to offer an opinion. I should not like, for a moment, that this volume of criticism would be used as an excuse to slow up or postpone the drainage scheme for the Suck.</P>
    <P>If there are technical difficulties involved then we shall have to accept them as genuine reasons for not going ahead but we must get assurance that technical problems exist.  There is no use in suggesting here or elsewhere that there are certain technical difficulties which it would take a very large sum of money to surmount.  I do not want that type of excuse offered, either, for the postponing of the draining of the Suck.  The appeal I am making here this evening in connection with that river is really only a repetition of what I said in the course of a <Col N="646" /> debate on a special motion which was discussed here in connection with the drainage of the River Suck.</P>
    <P>I should like now to draw a comparison between the Suck and a river which was mentioned earlier in the course of the debate by Deputy Tully, that is, the River Boyne.  He states, and rightly so, that the Boyne drains first-class agricultural land.  I cannot say the same for the Suck.  It drains a certain amount of good land but it serves and drains a large amount of bad land.  The important point to remember is that, for every family that is affected by the River Boyne, as far as flooding is concerned, there are 15 to 20 families affected by the River Suck.  There are more people per square mile living in the vicinity of the River Suck than on any other river under the arterial drainage scheme. My argument is based on the contention that we should serve the people first.  If there are 20 families living on bad land and if we can improve their circumstances by draining that bad land I think we should give priority to that drainage scheme rather than to the scheme which will serve one man who has as much good land in another area as the 20 families I have mentioned on the Suck.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a very encouraging sign for the future because if the priority list continues to be based on that particular line of thought&mdash;the serving of the greatest number of families&mdash;then I have no doubt but that rivers such as the Suck, and others in the West, will be treated justly and given the highest priority on the list.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A survey of the River Suck has been carried out, and I think it is only fair at this stage for me to pay a tribute both to the present Parliamentary Secretary and to his predecessor for putting the River Suck well up on the priority list. I make no bones about it whatever&mdash;I have taken the opportunity <Col N="647" /> on all possible occasions of speaking about the conditions under which people have to exist on the banks of the River Suck.  The problem there never got the publicity that the Shannon problem got.  Perhaps it was harder for these people who glory in publicity, in photographs and so on, to get a suitable place where their photographs would come out well along the River Suck.  It was easy to have that arranged on the Shannon because the bridge at Athlone was ideal.  The Parliamentary Secretary knows, as other people in the House know, that there are many holdings ranging from £5 to £10 valuation all along the Suck on both sides, right from the outlet to the source, and that these people with these valuations in the past two years have seldom seen more than two or three acres of their land, except for a few months of the year.  People living here in Dublin and in areas where flooding is no problem have no knowledge whatever of the hardships these people undergo in trying to eke out a living.</P>
    <P>I want to make it quite clear to the House that these people owe nothing in the way of thanks or appreciation to any Government for the fact that they are able to exist to-day.  The best check on how these people live, the best way of finding out, is for any Deputy to go to any post office within a couple of miles of one of these flooded areas and have a look&mdash;I suppose, have a chat with the people who get the letters there&mdash;and he will find that there is a weekly pay packet coming back from England into most of those houses.  If that money is not coming from England, there is money coming from America, from Australia and from Canada to each of these families and they can thank their sons and daughters who have emigrated out of the country for helping them to keep the old homestead going.</P>
    <P>I think that it is areas like these that we should serve first and try to improve the lot of the people who are left.  Ten acres to a man down in the West of Ireland mean more than 100 acres mean to the 300-acre farmer in the Midlands.  In the case of the man <Col N="648" /> with the big farm in the Midlands, it is a bit of a hardship to be flooded, but, in the case of the man with the small and poor holding, it is a question of his existence and his family's existence, if he is flooded.</P>
    <P>I did intend to deal with visits made by prominent Ministers to flooded areas in my constituency.  I find it an extraordinary thing that any Minister should be so foolish as to allow himself to be invited to attend a public meeting, in an area that was very badly flooded, two nights before the local elections.  I do not want to dwell on it, except to say that if that type of political enticement is going to be indulged in by members of this Government, it is a very short-sighted policy on their part.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaSnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with most of what Deputy McQuillan has said regarding <Col N="649" /> the urgency of the drainage of the River Suck.  I, too, represent that constituency, and I can bear out the statement made by him, and add my voice to the urgings for full speed in the preparation of this scheme.  In both Galway and Roscommon, our people experience the horror of having to leave their homes time and again, when there is, not exceptionally bad weather, but reasonably bad weather. They have to move out, and, as Deputy McQuillan has said, little note is taken of them.</P>
      <P>I should like to appeal also to the Parliamentary Secretary to get something done to speed up the carrying out of the survey in relation to the Corrib.  In most of the badly flooded areas in my constituency during the winter months, it was not mainly the fault of the river which is being done at present, the Clare-Corrib river, that the big flooding occurred.  To a certain extent, it was, but if drainage is to be carried out in this area and if relief is to be given in this area by way of drainage, it has to be drained into the Black River, which is an entirely different river.  I would urge that an early survey be made of this and that the job be completed.</P>
      <P>I take it that the Board of Works intend to do the whole Corrib while they are at it.  Surely they are not going to shift machinery to do one half and leave the other half in abeyance?  &ldquo;Abeyance&rdquo; was a word used here at one time.  There is the Dalgan river, which is equally as important as the one being done at the moment and I would urge all speed in the survey of that river.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened to Deputy Beegan this evening.  Everyone will agree he is an honest Deputy and does not exaggerate or try to be little or blackguard anyone. I have had the unfortunate experience of having to live in the middle of this area where the Corrib scheme is in operation now.  The employment position there is certainly not a credit to the present Parliamentary Secretary. At the very commencement of the scheme I had time and again to put down questions here to counteract statements made by the Parliamentary <Col N="650" /> Secretary himself.  He had not left the track of his boots in the Office of Public Works until he hastened down to Tuam, Milltown and other centres.  This statement can be borne out by at least one Deputy sitting on the Labour benches and by another from North Galway.  He hastened down to assure the people who supported him during the election that every other Party no matter how they required employment would come second, that members of Clann na Talmhan would be the first that he would see to and would be the first to get employment.  That was carried out to the letter.</P>
    <P>In Tuam in days gone by we used to have a labour exchange operated by the Department of Social Welfare and recognised as the only bureau through which Government Departments would seek people who were in need of employment.  We found in Tuam, very shortly after Deputy Donnellan had been made Parliamentary Secretary, that it was into a public house you had to go to seek employment on the Corrib.  This particular publican kept a book in which your name was entered if you bought a certain number of drinks.  That book was filled up and a second one was taken and a third and a fourth.  There were at least 2,000 Clann na Talmhan supporters popping in and out, who did not see through the game and unfortunately some of them have not seen through it yet.</P>
    <P>I always thought that those responsible for employing men, such as gangers, would be afraid to say that anybody other than the labour exchange could recommend someone, but that was not the case and is not the case to-day.  I have evidence and if we are given the inquiry we have asked for I hope it will be a general inquiry&mdash;not the inquiry that the Minister for Lands promised Deputy Beegan and a challenge which Deputy Beegan accepted.  It would be interesting to have a general inquiry into the whole employment position on the Corrib.  Evidence will be submitted that, unless you produce a card from a prominent key-man of Clann na Talmhan, you have no business looking for employment.  I can produce <Col N="651" /> plenty of evidence to prove that men who needed employment, who actually had to leave this country a fortnight after being refused employment on the Corrib, were living beside the Corrib at Lackagh.</P>

      <P>Anything at all to take the Parliamentary Secretary away from the points that hit sore and hard. This question of employment on the Corrib became a tickle some one, I am sure, when all those people had their names put down in a certain book.  A number of them came to me and asked if they were going to be given this long promised employment on the Corrib.  I said I did not know why so-and-so who is a farmer was employed and leaving his farm there derelict.  At this moment there are a number of farmers employed on the Corrib drainage scheme who own from 40 to 45 acres of land.  A farm of that size is considered to be a reasonably good farm in the County Galway.  They have not sown anything on their land, but they are competing in the market in Tuam against the labourers for cabbages, potatoes and all the rest of it.  They have not cut a sod of turf and they are competing in the turf market against the people who go out to buy a load of turf&mdash;a donkey car load.  They are competing against all those people because they have got employment and they are not sowing anything on their land or cutting a sod of turf for themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All these statements I can stand over at any sworn inquiry.  We have Deputies sitting on the Labour Benches and on the Fine Gael Benches who are fully aware of the circumstances which I have stated.  I had to try and forestall the racketing that was going on by putting down a number of questions in order to try and do something for the unemployed who were facing a Christmas with nothing in their pockets.  They had nothing <Col N="653" /> coming into their homes except the dole, and that was not a happy position for anyone to be in.  In order to try and see if anything could be done for them, I had, as I have said, to put down a number of questions here.  I asked the Minister for Social Welfare the number of people from the Galway Labour Exchange who were unemployed up to the 24th July.  From the answer given, I found that 52 men were unemployed.  I found that there were two taken from the labour exchange, while at that particular time 109 were employed on the Corrib.</P>
    <P>I think that any Government with any sense of responsibility would have an inquiry right away into the whole working of this, and see that justice was done.  I do not want employment for any particular type of individual. I can cite the case of a very strong Fine Gael supporter who was employed as a night watchman on a building that was to be erected in Tuam.  After four nights' employment, it was discovered by the Parliamentary Secretary that this man was a Fine Gael supporter and he was sacked.  There was no more employment for him.</P>

      <P>I do not want to go into this thing further, but if the Government think that there are any exaggerations in the statements which we are making they have a very easy way of settling and solving the problem. If the Labour Party are interested in seeing that the genuine labourer gets work on these schemes, they also have a simple way of solving it, that is, by having an inquiry to see who are those getting employment and those who are not.  I want the Labour Deputies to remember this, that more people have left Tuam by boat for Britain within the last year or eight months than left in the previous five or six years.</P>

      <P>We know that the master tactician discovered that, if something was not done in Tuam to stop Labour men from shouting, the position was going to be very serious. What was done?  A notification was sent down to provide cards for 200 men, the Parliamentary Secretary knowing in his heart and soul that these men had not bicycles or even good boots on <Col N="655" /> their feet to enable them to travel 14 or 15 miles to the work.  The Labour men in Tuam kicked up a row, but the Parliamentary Secretary should have known, if he was serious about the matter, that it was his duty to provide transport to take those men to the work in the morning and home in the evening.  That was done by Government Departments before.</P>

      <P>It was done before by other Government Departments.  It is being done at the present time by the sugar company.  They take their workers from Tuam to Creggs and to the Galway bog every morning and home in the evening.  The Parliamentary Secretary was using these 200 cards to bluff these unfortunates for the time being.  If he was sincere about it, he must have known that they had no means of getting out to Lacken and should have provided transport for them.  Of course, he had no intention in the world of doing that.  He did succeed, however, in bluffing these unfortunates for the time being, and in closing the mouth of this unfortunate Labour man who was kicking up rows at the meetings of the Tuam Town Commissioners. The whole thing worked out nicely for the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
      <P>I listened to-night to Deputy Beegan when he raised this question of the employment on the Corrib drainage of a paymaster.  Deputy Beegan is not as well acquainted with this as I am.

That was not the only job he promised to the Old I.R.A. Shortly after the results of the election became known and as soon as Deputy Donnellan had been made Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, he invited all the Old I.R.A. men in North Galway into a meeting in Lydon's Hotel in Tuam and there every one of them who was able to take employment was given it straightway.  There was no <Col N="661" /> question of an examination or an interview&mdash;they were getting it straight away.  Going a step further, it was said: &ldquo;If there are any of you not able to take work yourselves, send along your sons.&rdquo;</P>

I believe myself that when effect was given to the Drainage Act, 1945, it was not for the purpose of giving employment to the pals or the henchmen of any Parliamentary Secretary or any Minister.  Effect was given to it, firstly, to give relief to the unfortunate people who live on the flooded lands along the rivers of this country and, secondly, to give employment to the people who needed employment; it was not for the benefit of the henchmen of any particular Parliamentary Secretary.</P>

Tá ceantair eile ar fud na tíre go bhfuil géar-ghá le obair a dhéanamh ionta agus ba mhaith liom tagairt a dhéanamh do cheann acu anois.</P>
      <P>I am intervening in this debate in connection with drainage, and I am particularly interested in the drainage of a certain river, that is, the River Deale, in County Limerick.  It is fairly high, I understand, on the priority list. Deputy Beegan has dealt in a very interesting manner with this question of the arterial drainage work that has been planned and is being carried out by the Office of Public Works.  In the course of his speech he gave us some information in regard to the priority list that was compiled for the implementation of the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945.  There are a number of major catchment schemes and a number of minor ones, but the one scheme I wish to speak about at present, and in relation to which I would like to inquire from the Parliamentary Secretary what the position is, is the River Deale in County Limerick, which badly needs attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister for Lands were good enough some time ago to hear the deputation which came from the constituency bordering the River Deale and represented the people who are affected by the flooding of that river at various times. I think the Parliamentary Secretary was impressed by the case that was <Col N="667" /> put forward by the Deale Drainage Committee, the deputation from which came up to me from County Limerick. I would like if the Parliamentary Secretary could say what are the prospects of a survey of the River Deale starting soon.  Judging by the place at which the river is on the priority list it should be within the bounds of possibility to have that survey started before the end of this year or in the near future.  The case for the Deale&mdash;as, I think, will be admitted by those who listened to the case that was made by the committee &mdash;is a strong one and an outstanding one.  It deserves its place and deserves, as I would naturally consider, an even higher place on the priority list than it got.</P>
    <P>I know that there are considerable delays, no matter what anybody may say, in connection with this question of major drainage schemes and even minor drainage schemes.  It is very easy and very simple to talk about having them done but it is a different question altogether when it comes to the planning of a major scheme particularly. We must take into account all the preliminary surveys that must take place, all the interests that must be consulted before anything definite can be done, all the time that must be given to the various interests involved, the time taken up in looking through the scheme, examining it carefully and, when it is prepared, listening to objections, if there are any objections to be made.  It takes a considerable time for a survey before the work is started at all.</P>
    <P>In that connection I think there is a method that the Parliamentary Secretary should consider trying out in regard to the carrying out of this scheme when the preliminary surveys and the plans are made and that is the method that has been employed by other State Departments and by semi-State bodies such as the E.S.B.  That is the system whereby work is done by contract.  If that system is adopted there will then be an opportunity of having the work done direct by the State where the machinery is available and also having schemes carried out by contractors in the same way as the <Col N="668" /> E.S.B. got the work done in relation to Cementation, Limited.</P>
    <P>That system deserves consideration. It would certainly hasten the implementation of the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, in connection with schemes that are still waiting to be carried out. It would thereby hasten the day when we will see much faster progress being made in the carrying out of drainage schemes, particularly in relation to the major schemes which have been outstanding for such a long period and with which even the Parliamentary Secretary, no matter what he may say or what he may boast about, has not made much progress since he returned to office just as he did not make much progress during his first term in office according to the information Deputy Beegan has given us; and everybody knows in this House and outside it that Deputy Beegan is one of the most responsible and decentest Deputies ever elected to this House; any statement he makes, he makes it honestly and sincerely and he can stand over it.</P>
    <P>My proposal for having the work done by contract system instead of the system at present in operation, where the work is carried out directly by the State, should be considered seriously and given a chance to see how it will operate.  The two systems can work side by side.  There could be a contract system operated on one river and the machinery controlled and operated by the Office of Public Works could work on another river in the locality.  Possibly one could have contractors working on a few of our major rivers which are sadly in need of attention.  In that way the work in which we are all so interested and which we are all so anxious to see done, and done as quickly as possible, would be speeded up considerably.</P>
    <P>That suggestion is worthy of careful examination.  It is certainly worth trying out in a few instances at least in the hope that the large number of rivers which still remain to be done will be done.  At the present rate of progress we will not see much drainage done during our lifetime.  Indeed, some of the rivers will not be done during the lifetimes of those who come after us judging by the present rate of <Col N="669" /> progress.  If my suggestion is adopted an added momentum will be given to the work.  That is why I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to consider the contract system in addition to the State operated system at present being carried out.  If that is done there will be some hope of real progress being made in relation to this very important national problem of arterial drainage.</P>
    <P>There has been a good deal of what one might describe as local discussion in relation to operations in County Galway and in relation to the appointment of timekeepers, paymasters, and so on.  Nevertheless, the big question must be kept in mind all the time, though these are admittedly important matters, too.  In the detailed operation and administration of schemes everything should be above board.  Everything should be fair and everybody concerned, irrespective of political views or affiliations, should get a fair crack of the whip.  But the really important point we have to consider in relation to this Estimate at the moment is the speeding-up&mdash;a considerable speeding-up&mdash;of operations under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945.</P>
    <P>There is another matter for which the Parliamentary Secretary's office is responsible.  It is a matter in which I am very interested.  I refer to the question of school building.  The Office of Public Works has a good deal to do with and a good deal to say in relation to the carry-out of that very important national work.  We all know there are three parties concerned in this particular problem of primary school buildings.  There is, first of all, the parish; then there is the reverend manager of the school and the Department of Education.  In addition to that the planning and preparation of these buildings has to be done by the Office of Public Works.  I presume the Office of Public Works is a very hard-pressed body.  I am sure it is, but I think there is considerable room for improvement in the liaison between the Department of Education and the Office of Public Works in connection with school buildings.</P>
    <P>Sometimes it is very hard to understand the reason for the considerable <Col N="670" /> delays that take place in relation to the putting into operation of plans for school buildings, particularly in rural parishes.  Where the school manager is anxious to proceed with this very important work in his parish he should get all the co-operation possible from the Office of Public Works.  I am not saying that the school manager is not always perhaps free from blame where delays occur, but I certainly think there is too much delay in the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>As I say, perhaps the architects' section of the Office of Public Works in charge of school buildings is a very hard-driven body.  It may not be easy for the staff to handle all the work that comes their way, but I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that he should look into the question of the delays that occur and try to do his best to obviate them in the future. He should see that progress is more consistent and more effective than all of us who have experience of dealing with the question of school buildings in rural areas know it to have been in the past.  We know that in many cases it has been hesitant and slow.</P>

      <P>The debate on this Estimate has gone on for the past seven hours&mdash;seven long hours, as far as I was concerned waiting in agony to reply to the charges that were made. When one considers the day it is, 12th July, one remembers that that is the day on which they say the Orangemen break out; goodness knows, some of the Fianna Fáil Party, especially the man for whom I have a certain amount of respect, Deputy Beegan, broke out very much to-day.</P>

      <P>With regard to Deputy Killilea, I can always forgive <Col N="671" /> him because he does not understand and he does not know.  Now, my predecessor, Deputy Beegan, stated, arterial drainage is the rock on which the Office of Public Works is built and when I read Deputy Beegan's speech here I realised that 50 per cent. of it is composed of quotations from the Drainage Commission Report.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course the work Fianna Fáil did for arterial drainage since the Arterial Drainage Act was brought in in 1945 makes me laugh. Across the floor of the House I must ask, especially of Deputy Beegan and of Deputy Smith who was Parliamentary Secretary when the Act was put through, why did the Fianna Fáil Government of the time bring in that measure in 1945.  Why did they not bring it in since 1932?  There is one reason and one reason only and that was that in the year 1943 a Party came into this House of which I had the honour of being a member and of which I am a member to-day.  That Party forced the hand of the then Government to bring in the Arterial Drainage Act of 1945 and no thanks to them for having brought it in.  Not the slightest whatever.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>Wait a second and I will tell the Deputy all about that. They came along with the Act in 1945 because a certain Party had come into this House on whose programme arterial drainage was No. 1.  Up to that time all we heard about drainage was when Poor Deputy Killilea or some fellow like him not responsible for what he was saying stood up outside the church gates and made a speech about drainage.  The Act went through the House and I was one of those in Opposition at the time who spoke on it.  I can quote my words from memory and what I said was that I believed it came long past its time but that it was better late than never.  That was the year 1945.  Every day through 1946 and <Col N="672" /> 1947 we expected something would be done.  The people of Kerry from whom Deputy Beegan tried to defend me&mdash;I never had any need to have anybody defend me; I was always able to defend myself against the Kerrymen or anybody else in any walk of life but I could not see Deputy Beegan able to say that&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was inside barbed wire half the time while the Parliamentary Secretary was free to defend himself against these people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us get the truth and do not get into that kind of thing with me.  It was in 1945 that the Act went through.  What happened about it?  Nothing happened about it until 1948 when the inter-Party Government, the self same inter-Party Government as you have to day, took over.  That inter-Party Government asked me to become Parliamentary Secretary.  When I became Parliamentary Secretary what did I find?  How can arterial drainage be done without machinery? Can it be done with a hay fork or with a spoon?  What did I find, I ask, in the Board of Works?  23 old rusty excavators which had done the work on the Barrow years before.  They were later sold for £109 apiece.  They were proper wrecks.  I started to get in the new machinery and what did I leave there?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The value of what I found in machinery when I became Parliamentary Secretary was nil.  I left 128 new machines of a value of over £1,000,000.  In place of the 23 old rusty excavators I left 76 new ones.  I found 11 transport vehicles.  I left 80.  I found seven compressors and I left 34. I found five concrete mixers and I left 18.  Of bulldozers I found none, but I left 13.  I found no dumpers and I left eight.  I found no mobile cranes and I left two.  Then we had a general election.  What were the people told at every crossroads in the country? They were told that taxes had to go up and that the price of beer and tobacco had to go up because we bought machinery to do work of that description.  And we had Deputy Beegan here the other night, at <Col N="673" /> column 499 of Volume 152 of the Official Reports saying this:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Parliamentary Secretary has mentioned arterial drainage.  Arterial drainage was a big national problem and is a big national problem to be dealt with in a broadminded national way.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Are a couple of rusty excavators going to deal with arterial drainage in a broadminded way?</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Arterial drainage was selected by the Parliamentary Secretary and by the Coalition Government as the flagship of the Coalition propaganda navy and has been used as such since 1948.  The Parliamentary Secretary was given a free hand as first admiral of that navy to lead a campaign of piracy against Fianna Fáil and Fianna Fáil policy.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Piracy against the Fianna Fáil policy&rdquo; is what he said.  Is it because I am doing the work?</P>

      <P>There was another one in 1950 and a third one in 1951. The Deputy should be careful now because this was the year in which I was said to have started a drainage scheme before its time.  Is not that right?  Is it not right that I sent down the machinery&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>Where is Deputy McEllistrim of North Kerry?  Was not he one of those who pressed me to go ahead with that Feale scheme?  It was too fast the Board of Works were going at that time according to Fianna Fáil.  They said that the third scheme should not have been started at all, that it was propaganda to do it.  Was it propaganda to start the first one in 1948?  Deputy Beegan referred to the Brosna.  In 1949, the Glyde and Dee scheme was undertaken <Col N="674" /> and nobody said it was propaganda to do it.  But it was propaganda after three long years of Fianna Fáil inactivity to send down two machines to the Feale.  Was it not in May of last year that we had a general election. A couple of weeks before that general election a couple of machines were brought down and placed on either side of the bridge at Claregalway.  One of them worked a couple of days.  It dug a hole and it had to be removeo and from that day to this they called that hole &ldquo;Deputy Beegan's hole&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Sure the Deputy did not start it at all.  For fear that the House would think that I am the type of an individual some Deputies make me out to be, I will give you the facts. I just want to point out the real fact of the matter as regards what happened in Kerry.  The Deputy said the Feale was started before its time. Why?  The engineers were anxious that the earliest possible start should be made to get an opening in the out flow of the river so as to get a pilot passage through before the winter, and sanction was sought to have that done in anticipation of the later work on the scheme.  We had to set up a store there and assist in erecting machinery.  The scheme was confirmed on the 4th May, 1951, and the preliminary work started in the last week of the month.  There was no labour employed beyond ten or 11 men and the labour exchange was consulted from the start.</P>

      <P>It is not that I wish in any way to be little the people who take the notes here but, when I was listening on Friday in the House, if I do not make a mistake, the words used by Deputy Beegan were that the way that I rushed the Feale scheme for election purposes, in 1951, the engineers and the people who went down had to go to the Civic Guard barracks to inquire where they would get men, but that does not appear here, Deputy, although these were your words.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>I remember it so well because I think it was Deputy James Tully who interrupted and said: &ldquo;That is a change besides having to go to the Fianna Fáil clubs.&rdquo;  There was no such thing as going to the Civic Guard <Col N="676" /> barracks about the appointments.  I have only a short time on this.</P>
      <P>We hear a lot about Old I.R.A. men and what should be done for them and what should not.  I remember, I think it was in the year 1949, I was in charge of another office known as the Special Employment Schemes Office.  I am in charge of it again, thank God.  It is an office that is coupled with the Office of Public Works.  At that time the Government of the day wanted&mdash;and I believe every Government was slow in the matter&mdash;a certain amount of decentralisation. Deputies will agree that anything we can do to transfer work that is carried out in the offices in this city to the country is the best thing that we can do.</P>
      <P>I think it was in 1949 that a proposal was put up to me in the Special Employment Schemes Office from the office.  It was not my proposal, as Deputy Beegan knows.  At the moment we had to take in extra staff in the office in connection with paying workers in certain counties that we had taken over under that scheme, such as Galway, Mayo, Kerry, Roscommon, Tipperary and, if I remember right, Donegal.  No, not Donegal.  We are taking that up in the near future.  They suggested to me that paymasters should be appointed in those areas and I consented.  Not being the political individual that Deputy Beegan tried to make out I was, I looked around to see were these suitable men.  Men were recommended to me from different centres and of the five or six men who were appointed in Galway, one of them is the individual that Deputy Beegan talked about for quite a long time on Friday and again to-day.  Later on, Deputy McQuillan and Deputy Killilea were also cooing about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a strange thing&mdash;does Deputy Beegan deny this&mdash;that after he had got into power, had got into the office in charge, on a certain date, the Parliamentary Secretary, whose heart is now bleeding for the Old I.R.A., who is dying for the Old I.R.A., gave an order in the office that those appointments be terminated, gave an order that a certain machine be purchased, which is, I think, called a comptometer or something like that, at a cost of over <Col N="677" /> £1,000, to displace those men, and he produced the mechanical Old I.R.A. man that I referred to a while ago.  Is that right, Deputy, across the floor of the House, as one Galway man to another?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">

When Deputy Killilea says that he made inquiries in the area to see who was an Old I.R.A. man or who was not and when Deputy Beegan said that he made inquiries, he would need to make inquiries in Galway as to who was and who was not, but there was one about whom he would not have to make inquiries from anybody, and that is the man who is speaking from this side of the House.</P>
