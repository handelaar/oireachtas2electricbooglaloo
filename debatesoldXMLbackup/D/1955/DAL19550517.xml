    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="Minister for Education (General Mulcahy) Richard (General) Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (General Mulcahy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the reply will be a somewhat lengthy one and there are references to certain documents.  I propose, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to place in the Library an assembled group of these documents for the purpose of easy reference.</P>
      <P>1.  The attitude of my Department with regard to the teaching and use of the Irish language in primary schools derives from the national consciousness and is based on&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the recommendations issued in January, 1922, by the National Programme Conference (consisting of representatives of Aireacht an Oideachais of Dáil Éireann, the General Council of County Councils, the Gaelic League, the National Labour Executive, the Association of Secondary Teachers and the Irish National Teachers' Organisation);</P>
      <P>(b)  Public Notice No. 4 issued by the Minister for Education of the Irish Provisional Government on 1st February, 1922, ordering &ldquo;that the Irish language shall be taught, or used as a medium of instruction, for not less than one full hour each day in all national schools where there is a teacher competent to teach it&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(c)  Article 4 of the Constitution of Saorstát Éireann, 1922, which stated that &ldquo;the national language of the Irish Free State (Saorstát Éireann) is the Irish language, but the English <Col N="1494" /> language shall be equally recognised as an official language&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>(d)  The &ldquo;Report and Programme presented by the National Programme Conference to the Minister for Education&rdquo; in March, 1926 (i.e. the Second National Programme Conference); the conference was under the chairmanship of Reverend Lambert McKenna, S.J., and consisted of representatives of the Catholic and Protestant school managers, the teachers in national schools, the General Council of County Councils, the Gaelic League and 11 persons nominated by the Minister for Education because of their association with other educational and administrative interests including the universities.  The recommendations made by the conference were unanimous with the single exception that the representatives of the Irish National Teachers' Organisation noted their disagreement with the proposal that an extra subject, rural science, should be added to the existing programme.</P>
    <P>(e)  The circular of July, 1926, issued by the Department of Education to the managers and teachers of all national schools notifying that the &ldquo;programme prepared by the National Programme Conference has, as already announced in the Dáil by the Minister for Education, been adopted as the official programme for use in national schools&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>(f)  Circular No. 11/31 on &ldquo;Teaching through the medium of Irish&rdquo; issued by the Department of Education in July, 1931, to managers, teachers and inspectors of national schools &ldquo;to define the requirements of the school programme in respect of teaching through Irish and to state at more length what its aims are, and what it expects the schools to do to realise them&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>(g)  The &ldquo;Revised Programme of Primary Instruction&rdquo; which was issued by the Department in September, 1934, and which modified the requirements of the 1926 programme.</P>
    <P>(h)  Article 8 of the Constitution of Ireland, 1937, which states that &ldquo;The Irish language as the national <Col N="1495" /> language is the first official language&rdquo; and that &ldquo;The English language is recognised as a second official language&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>(i)  The &ldquo;Revised Programme for Infants&rdquo; which was issued by the Department in July, 1948, modifying those portions of the 1926 and 1934 programmes relating to infants' classes.</P>
    <P>2.  The programme of secular instruction in national schools in all subjects is that recommended by the National Programme Conference, 1926, as modified in the revisions in 1934 and 1948.</P>
    <P>3.  The present position in regard to the teaching and use of the Irish language is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  Irish, with arithmetic and music, is an obligatory subject in all standards in national schools. English is an optional subject in infant classes and Standard 1, but is obligatory in second and higher standards.  There are additional obligatory subjects, for example, history and geography in the more senior standards.</P>
    <P>(b)  It is stated in the revised programme for infants of 1948, that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The aim of the infant school is to provide the atmosphere and background in which the child's whole personality may develop naturally and easily.  It should, therefore, take cognisance of the child's interests, activities and speech needs, and utilise them to the full in aiding and directing such development.</P>
    <P>The present programme positively integrates with this a further aim, that of giving to young children, from English-speaking homes, a vernacular power over Irish at an age when they are most adaptable and imitative and when their vocal organs are plastic.  Where the teachers are sufficiently qualified the aim should be to reach a stage as early as possible at which Irish can be used as the sole language of the infant school.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1496" /> English, however, may be taught optionally to infants for half an hour per day.</P>
    <P>(c)  As regards the use of Irish as a teaching medium in classes above infants, the directive issued in Circular No. 11 of 1931 remains in operation.  The circular sets forth that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(i)  the aim of the programme is to secure the full use of Irish as the teaching medium in all schools as soon as possible;</P>
    <P>(ii)  that the use of Irish as the teaching medium is now obligatory when the teacher is competent to give instruction and the pupils are able to assimilate the instructions so given;</P>
    <P>(iii)  that teaching through Irish is not obligatory unless the two conditions are fufilled, i.e., ability of the teacher to give instructions and ability of pupils to receive it;</P>
    <P>(iv)  that transitional stages are suggested at which partial use of teaching through Irish should be introduced, according as the teachers become competent to give such instruction and the pupils can understand and assimilate it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It was emphasised in that circular that Irish should not be used as a teaching medium in schools or classes where the conditions set out in the circular as necessary for the success of such teaching are not present.</P>
    <P>4.  The following extracts from the &ldquo;Notes for Teachers&mdash;Irish&rdquo; issued by the Department in elaboration of the programme and the official directives are relevant:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The teaching of Irish in the schools is a part, a very important part, of the general effort to restore the Irish language to its rightful place as the everyday speech of the nation.  Its aim is frankly and unequivocally to make Irish speakers of the children of the Galltacht so that, by the age of 14, they may be able to express themselves freely, fully, and correctly in the new language.  In the Gaeltacht its aim is to perfect <Col N="1497" /> the vernacular into as adequate an instrument for all forms of selfexpression as the English course aims at doing for English-speaking children. But this effort is itself only a part of a wider aim which is to ensure and to preserve the cultural continuity of the nation by putting its youth into possession of the language, literature, history and tradition of the historic Irish people and thus fixing its outlook in the Gaelic mould....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>By this is not meant necessarily that every subject in every school should be taught through Irish, but that the official language of the school and the incidental language of intercourse should be Irish.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>5.  Irish itself is, therefore, an obligatory subject in every national school and the use of Irish as a teaching medium in the schools is determined by certain specified conditions according to the particular circumstances of each school.  The amount of time devoted each day or each week to the teaching of Irish and the use of Irish as a teaching medium varies according to the size of the school, the number of teachers, and the particular circumstances of the school.</P>
    <P>6.  With regard to the Deputy's inquiry as to the extent to which actual practice is in conformity with departmental views and directives, I should like to say that in my opinion any lack of conformity that there is arises from a failure, or perhaps, I should say, an inability, to realise the aims and objectives of the policy indicated in the different documents to which I have referred, rather than from an effort to achieve these aims in cases where the circumstances do not warrant their implementation.</P>
    <P>The Department's inspectors encourage the extension of the use of Irish as a teaching medium wherever the conditions permitting of its use are fulfilled, but owing to a certain atmosphere of thoughtlessness and apathy outside the school progress in the restoration of Irish as the medium of instruction and intercourse frequently falls short of the stated objective.</P>
    <P>If the expressed national policy in relation to the Irish language is to be <Col N="1498" /> realised, the work of the schools must receive a due measure of encouragement and support from the general public outside the school.</P>
    <P>This is not to say that considerable progress in the revival of the language has not been achieved.  For instance, the latest available figures show that of a total of 4,876 national schools, Irish was the sole medium in 490, of which 179 were in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht and 183 (including schools solely for infants) in the English-speaking districts.  In another 1,901 schools Irish was the sole medium of instruction in two or more consecutive classes or standards but not throughout the whole school, and in a further 2,459 schools Irish was the medium of instruction in some class or classes and/or in some subject or subjects other than Irish.  These three groups together give a total of 4,850 which means that there were only 26 schools in which all subjects were taught through English.  But it is necessary to mention that the use of Irish in infants' classes influences these figures to a considerable extent.  The picture will be clearly seen from the tables at pages 70-72 (Appendices Nos. 12-15) of the Department's report for 1951-52, which will be published forthwith.</P>
    <P>7.  The report of the Council of Education presented last year, on the function of the primary school and the curriculum to be pursued therein up to the age of 12 years, includes a survey of the position regarding the language and its use as a teaching medium. The council's views, together with the observations in course of receipt from the important educational interests whose comments have been invited, are being closely studied at present in my Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister whether what he has read does not prove that there is no substantial truth in the statement that Irish is being taught and is used as a medium of instruction by teachers who do not know Irish, to pupils who do not know the language either?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy ought not to ask me to comment on what is being said.  I have given a full statement <Col N="1499" /> of the background and what the departmental regulations are and what the practice with regard to the Department is.  In the interest of clarity, I would sooner that the Deputy and the House generally would bring their minds to bear on the broad position that I have put there, rather than that we would depart from that at this particular stage for a discussion of any of the misconceptions or misrepresentations there may be about any aspect of policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Minister to state precisely, and, I hoped, in as short a form as possible the attitude and regulations of the Department so that a good deal of uninformed criticism might be brought to an end.  That criticism is based, as the Minister and everybody here knows, on statements such as the statement that we have a position in which teachers who do not know Irish are teaching subjects through Irish to pupils who do not know the language and it was to that that I directed the question.  I am very grateful to the Minister&mdash;I think it is in the national interest that he should do so&mdash;for giving us such a long statement, but it does not meet the immediate criticisms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Deputy to understand from me that I am giving him here, after as wide a view of the situation as possible and in the intimate detail he asks for, the position from the departmental point of view.  I am putting an assembly of ten documents into the Library so that any reference to these documents may be fully understood.  I ask the Deputy not to ask me when dealing with the facts of the case to step from the realm of fact into the arena of answering criticism.  Whether the criticism is well founded or not, it is an entirely different day's work, and, from the departmental point of view, I would much sooner concentrate on the constructive details of the work that has to be done and the details to be put right than step into an absurd arena of misrepresentation and controversy that may arise from it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that the Deputy will understand <Col N="1500" /> that, in taking up this attitude in reply to his supplementary question, I am not withholding any help, by tongue or in any other way in which I might have to deal with the matter, and even to dispel misrepresentations and to dispel the lack of information the Deputy refers to in his question.</P>

      <P>The Government has adhered to the decision concerning the extension and stabilisation of liberalisation of trade adopted by the council of the O.E.E.C. at its meeting on the 14th January, 1955.</P>
      <P>Prior to this decision, member countries, including Ireland, had agreed to liberalise, that is, to remove quantitative restrictions on 75 per cent. of their total imports on private account from other member countries, calculated by reference to trade in 1948 and 60 per cent. at least of their imports on private account in each of the three groups: (1) food and feeding stuffs, (2) raw materials, and (3) manufactured goods.  The recent decision requires that these percentages should be increased to 90 per cent. and 75 per cent. respectively.  If any member country considers it necessary to withdraw these increased measures of liberalisation, owing to balance of payments difficulties or for reasons of national importance or equity, it may do so on notifying the organisation of the reason for its action.</P>
      <P>The decision will be reviewed by the council at the end of 18 months after which any member country will be free, without notifying the organisation, to withdraw the increased liberalisation measures taken thereunder.</P>

If the haulage referred to by the Deputy can be effected within the terms of paragraph 3 of Part II of the Schedule to the Finance (Excise Duties) (Vehicles) Act, 1952, the £8 rate of duty applies.

I am aware that in August, 1952, the then resident medical staff made representations to the hospital authority about their living accommodation and that as a result of these representations my predecessor agreed, as a temporary expedient, that some members of that staff could live outside the hospital&mdash;a facility which is being availed of.</P>
      <P>As the position should be righted in the near future, I do not consider that an investigation is necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Cosgrave)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves each of the following Orders in draft:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Double Taxation Relief (Sea or Air Transport) (Kingdom of Denmark) Order, 1955,</P>
      <P>Double Taxation Relief (Sea or Air Transport) (Kingdom of Norway) Order, 1955,</P>
      <P>Double Taxation Relief (Sea or Air Transport) (Kingdom of Sweden) Order, 1955,</P>
      <P>a copy of each of which Orders in draft was laid on the Table of Dáil Éireann on the 11th day of May, 1955.</P>
      <P>On the 18th October, last year, I signed here in Dublin, on behalf of the Government, three agreements with the Governments of Denmark, Norway and Sweden, respectively, for the avoidance of double taxation on income derived from the business of sea and air transport.  These agreements are not yet in force.  They were signed subject to ratification, and will come into operation upon the exchange of instruments of ratification.</P>
      <P>Before, however, the Government are in a position to ratify them, the Government must make an Order, in accordance with the provisions of Section 15 of the Finance Act, 1951 (No. 15 of 1951), to confirm and give the force of Irish law to each of the agreements.  Section 15 of that Act furthermore lays down that, before the Government can make any such Order, a draft of the Order must have been laid before this House and a resolution passed approving the Order in draft.</P>
      <P>Drafts of the Orders to give effect to the agreements in Irish law were laid on the Table of the House on the 11th May.  Deputies will find the text of each agreement scheduled to the appropriate draft Order.  The three agreements are, except in one or two minor points, identical in their terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1511" /> The purpose of the agreements is set out clearly and concisely in Article 2, which reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  All income derived from the business of sea or air transport between Ireland and other countries by Swedish (or Norwegian or Danish, as the case may be) undertakings engaged in such business shall be exempt from income-tax and all other taxes on profits which are chargeable in Ireland.</P>
    <P>(2)  All income derived from the business of sea or air transport between the Kingdom of Sweden (or the Kingdom of Denmark or the Kingdom of Norway, as the case may be) and other countries by Irish undertakings engaged in such business shall be exempt from income-tax and all other taxes on profits which are chargeable in the Kingdom of Sweden (or the Kingdom of Denmark or the Kingdom of Norway, as the case may be).</P>
    <P>The exemption which will be accorded to Swedish, Danish and Norwegian undertakings under the agreements, will cover income-tax (including surtax) and corporations profits tax and also any other tax on income which might be imposed in the future in this country.  Irish undertakings will be exempt from equivalent taxes on income in Sweden, Denmark and Norway.</P>
    <P>Article 1 contains definitions of &ldquo;Irish undertakings&rdquo;, &ldquo;Swedish undertakings&rdquo; or &ldquo;Norwegian or Danish undertakings&rdquo; as the case may be, and &ldquo;the business of sea or air transport&rdquo;.  The meaning of these definitions is clear.  There are just two points to which I should like to draw attention:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  First, trading by the State as well as trading by private individuals and companies is covered in the definition of &ldquo;undertakings&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>(2)  Secondly, in the case of corporations, exemption is limited to corporations constituted under the laws of Ireland and managed and controlled in Ireland, so that the benefits of the agreements will flow only to <i>bona fide</i> Irish enterprises <Col N="1512" /> which have their head office and central administration in the State. Likewise, only <i>bona fide</i> Swedish, Norwegian and Danish corporations will enjoy exemption from double taxation under the agreements.</P>
    <P>Article 3 provides for the coming into force of the agreements and for the termination of the three existing agreements which were concluded with the Governments of Norway, Sweden and Denmark in the early 1930s, but which only related to reciprocal exemption from double income-tax on income derived from shipping business. Article 3 also provides that the agreements with Norway and Sweden will have effect in respect of income earned since the 1st January, 1954, and the agreement with Denmark in respect of income earned since the 1st January, 1951.</P>
    <P>Article 4 states, in each case, that the agreement may be terminated by either party by giving six months' notice in writing to the other party.</P>
    <P>I have just mentioned that we have had for over 20 years agreements with the Governments of Denmark, Norway and Sweden for the avoidance of double taxation on income derived from shipping business.  In a sense, therefore, the new agreements may be regarded as a normal extension of the existing agreements to bring them into line with the development and expansion of air transport.  At the moment, there are no scheduled air services operating between this country and Denmark, Norway or Sweden, but I think there will be general agreement that it is desirable in principle to encourage direct transport of passengers and goods between Ireland and other countries by affording relief from double taxation to companies which are engaged in transport business.</P>
    <P>Negotiations which, I hope, will lead to agreements of a similar kind have been opened with a number of other countries; and, of course, the comprehensive Double Income Tax Relief Agreements which we have concluded with Britain and the United States of America&mdash;as well as the recent one with Canada which remains to be ratified&mdash; all contain provisions for reciprocal exemption from double taxation on <Col N="1513" /> income derived from the business of sea and air transport.</P>

      <P>When I moved to report progress, I had dealt with the salient features of the tragic economic blunders of Fianna Fáil from 1952 to 1954.  That might best be epitomised in some way in the words of the ex-Taoiseach himself that the people were staggering under the burden of taxation.  They were subjected to the serious and far-reaching consequences that arose from the high interest rates paid on the foot of the borrowing by the then Minister for Finance, Deputy MacEntee.  We saw the economy of individuals being burst wide open by the catastrophic effect of a sudden rise in the cost of living.  We saw the depredations which went right through the entire community.  We saw at the same time the tightening and the restriction of credit through the action of the then Government.  They disclaimed all responsibility for it.  The extraordinary thing was that no matter where the responsibility lay, that tightening of credit and the serious effects on expansion were present in the atmosphere of the catastrophic Budget of 1952 and in subsequent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We saw business geared for expansion afraid to expand because of instability, high interest rates and because in many cases they were not able to get the facilities that would have been normally available to them. We saw new projects dying at initiation because of the particular economic set-up then in existence.  Now we have the Opposition prating about what has not been done by this Government but let them pause for a moment and think of what has been effectively done in <Col N="1514" /> the past 11 months.  As I said earlier, during that period the ship of State finance has been steadied and the rift is letting the sun through the gloom that descended on this country in recent years.</P>
    <P>People can see the Government facing those problems and redistributing, as it did this year even though there was not a great amount for redistribution, according to the best principles of Christian charity, not to speak of aiding the most necessitous classes in the State.  But they see something more than that.  They see a return of confidence in their Government and in their institutions.  I venture to say that the success of the Minister's last loan is a portent for an even brighter future.  The Irish people have again got back to the firm and fixed belief that it is worth while lending their money to the type of Government they have now for the development of their nation.</P>
    <P>In the short period of 11 months the Minister has succeeded in getting the people to think again on the basis of increased production and expansionist efforts.  I want to see, as I know we will see, this Government giving all the financial support that is necessary to the projects the people are crying out for&mdash;projects for rapid expansion in afforestation, plans for the rapid completion of the rural electrification scheme and plans for the improvement of the land throughout this State.  I ask the Government to press on in the quickest possible way with the problem of major drainage.  The Government should press on with all those projects which will be of real and practical value to the nation as time goes on. The people are waiting now for guidance and leadership&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;which this Government can give them in a realistic way.  The people realise that this Government, composed as it is of all elements of the community, can see all their problems in the proper perspective. All they ask for now is what I know this Government can give, technical help, direction and co-operation from the various State Departments <Col N="1515" /> and all the financial support that is necessary to further national development.</P>
      <P>This nation knows that the present Government believe and trust in the strength of the Irish people.  With encouragement and help they will do their task infinitely well whether that task be in regard to the agricultural land of Ireland or whether it be the task in the workshops or factories of Ireland.</P>
      <P>I want this Government to continue to give that help and encouragement everywhere it is needed.  With regard to industrialists with worthwhile projects which were crippled and bludgeoned by the economic chaos wrought by the last Government, I want this Government to step in to give them all the help and encouragement that is available to expand not only production but employment as well.  I want to see a continuation of all the fruitful benefits that flow to the Irish farmers and the agricultural community generally from the 1948 agreement.  I want to see once and for all dead in this country the cants that were once the pride of the Opposition when squealing calves were being slaughtered, cants about markets being gone and gone for ever, cants about ships being at the bottom of the sea and cants about all kinds of economic theories that led to national tragedy.</P>
      <P>I want to see, as I believe we will see as one year succeeds another, this Government going from strength to strength with the co-operation of its people behind it, with no compulsion or drive, only on the basis of advice, encouragement and help for the Irish people at all levels whether ministerial or worker, all working together do cum glóire Dé agus onóra na hÉireann.</P>

      <P>My contribution to this debate will be very brief.  It has never been my practice when speaking, either publicly or privately, to pour profuse thanks and praise on any individual for doing his day's work or for doing his duty under normal and reasonable circumstances.  In this particular case I must depart from that practice, and I want here and now to <Col N="1516" /> congratulate the Minister and the Government on having achieved so much during the past 11 months despite the difficulties with which they found themselves confronted, such as the bad weather, the adverse harvest and the other factors which contributed towards making progress somewhat difficult.  What has been achieved by the Government in the last 11 months is worthy of note, and it is for that reason I offer a word of praise and congratulation to the Government and the Minister now.</P>
      <P>The Budget debate provides us with an opportunity annually of making a survey of the Government's activities over the previous year.  It also gives us an insight into what the future holds for us.  Over the past year there has been a considerable improvement in all spheres of our activity, particularly in relation to our industrial drive and also in relation to our agricultural economy.  The tide of emigration has been stemmed.  Unemployment has decreased and the overall picture is a satisfactory one.  We have an indication now of what we may expect in the future; when I say the future I am referring to the next four years since it is my belief, and it is the belief of the people whom I represent, that this Government will run its normal life.</P>
      <P>I have travelled up and down the country since the Budget was introduced. It has been received with universal approval in city, town and country.  In Dublin, where one finds the most severe critics of the Government's activities, people who would normally stand on opposite platforms to those of us in the inter-Party group have stated quite honestly that they believe this Budget is the best Budget that could be introduced under present circumstances.  Possibly some disappointments have been suffered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been alleged that certain promises were made during the course of the last election by the Parties now forming the Government.  Frankly, I never heard a promise made.  As far as I personally am concerned, I made no promises.  I certainly read speeches in the daily papers at the time and I can remember quite clearly a speech made by a man who now holds a very <Col N="1517" /> responsible position in the present Government&mdash;a man who holds the key position in Government: the only promise I ever heard him make was: &ldquo;I make no promises.  The only promise I make is that I will do my best.&rdquo;  That is the only promise I heard him make and that is the only promise anyone could reasonably make.  It is incorrect, therefore, to allege that promises were made.</P>
    <P>In 1951, before the change of Government came, promises were made by the Fianna Fáil Party which were never fulfilled.  Indeed, they could not be fulfilled by any Government.  I would like to refresh the memories of the members of the Opposition in relation to those promises.  Speaking at Rathmines Town Hall on 15th May, 1951, Deputy MacEntee said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A number of persons in the licensed trade were spreading the rumour that if Fianna Fáil were returned to power the taxes imposed on drink in the Supplementary Budget of 1947 would be reimposed. There is no truth in that rumour.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is an extract from the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 16th May, 1951, and that is one of the promises broken by Fianna Fáil.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBernieJnr" hpid="Mr. Beirne Mr. Beirne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beirne</NameTxt>
      <P>Even if the taxes are there, we have given adequate compensation to the people because these taxes are imposed on them.  We have given the people in this Budget a gift of £4,500,000, a gift never hitherto given to our people by any Government of this State.  Through this Budget the people are gaining £4,500,000.  I shall deal with that point more extensively later.</P>
      <P>Here is an extract from the <i>Sunday Press</i> of 13th May, 1951:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1518" />&ldquo;Lemass denies intention to reimpose tax on drink and tobacco. Speaking at Cork on May 12th, 1951, Mr. Seán Lemass said: &lsquo;A Coalition Minister has said that Fianna Fáil, if elected, would increase the tax on beer and tobacco.  Why should these taxes be necessary?  There is no reason why we should reimpose these taxes.&rdquo;&rsquo;</P>
    <P>That is another broken promise.  Here is an extract from the <i>Irish Press</i> of 5th June, 1951; it is a statement from the Fianna Fáil Party that they have a 17-point programme which they intend to follow religiously.  One of the points in that programme was No. 15:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To maintain subsidies, to control the prices of essential foodstuffs and the operation of an efficient system of price regulation for all necessary and scarce commodities.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>People on the Opposition Benches to-day should be a bit reluctant and somewhat slow to talk about promises. But, despite all the promises that have been made, it is comforting to know that the country is now on a firm and solid foundation.  That has been proved beyond doubt over the past 11 months. Agriculture has been stepped up considerably. We all know that agriculture is the predominant industry here and on it all other industries depend for their survival.  If a feeble agricultural policy is pursued, if exports do not increase or fail to hold their own, all other industries will automatically disappear.  This Government has fostered a policy of increasing agricultural production, not only now but also in the years 1948 to 1951.  Unfortunately the Fianna Fáil Government pursued a different policy.  Fianna Fáil were always more inclined to put the cart before the horse.  They favoured or fostered an industrial programme to establish factories all over the country, while at the same time forgetting the basic industry&mdash;agriculture. They placed the agricultural industry in a chaotic state and it was only with great difficulty and after much thought and after securing the advice of the best Minister for Agriculture in the world that this country from 1948 to 1951 recovered its <Col N="1519" /> agricultural industry, which had a steadying effect on the whole economy.</P>
    <P>It is gratifying to know that exports of cattle increased in value by £8.8 million or by no less than 163,000 in number, while exports of dressed beef and veal increased by 347,000 tons, or in value by £3.8 million.  These are figures of which we should all be proud and I think any person who has the interests of the country seriously at heart should be proud of those figures, irrespective of what Government is in office.  I think it is praiseworthy, and that a word of appreciation is due to the present Administration for bringing those figures up to their present high level.  In spite of all the heavy exports of cattle and dressed beef, it is gratifying to know that the cattle population has diminished by almost nothing&mdash;about .6 per cent. of the total.  Our stocks, in spite of the rate of export of live stock and dressed beef, have remained steady and will remain steady.  These are valuable achievements.</P>
    <P>There is one thing which I say the people of this country are very grateful about; that is, the increase in the old age pensions, widows' and orphans' and blind pensions.  I think the Government tackled this problem in a very humane way, first of all looking after the invalids and the old people. That was a very charitable thing to do, but they did not stop there.  They also considered the family man with a fixed income and relieved him of a considerable amount of income-tax. The man with two or three in family with a fixed income is now relieved of a certain amount of income-tax.</P>
    <P>I also wish to pay a very sincere tribute to the Minister and to the Government for having adjusted the rate of tax on tractors hired for the conveyance of milk to the creameries. It is almost incredible that any Government in this country&mdash;Fianna Fáil was responsible for it&mdash;would increase the tax from £8 to £31 on tractors conveying milk to the creameries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Beirne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry for you; you are a foolish young man; you have not got your wisdom teeth yet, but you will grow up.  However, I am glad to see that concession for the tractors. That is a matter that I have been pursuing vigorously since last July.  It was an unjust and an unfair tax and I am glad to see that the Minister and the Government had the courage and consideration to foster the milk industry, in which I am interested as well as Deputy O'Malley, and not to inflict an intolerable burden on the man who carries his neighbour's milk to the creamery.  That is one of the things on which I must congratulate the Minister very sincerely.</P>
      <P>I must also congratulate the Government on the success of their loan last autumn.  For many years no loan has been secured by a Government at such a low rate of interest.  That loan at an interest rate of 4¼ or 4½ per cent. was fully subscribed.  I must congratulate the Minister on the flotation of that loan, which had a steadying influence on bank and interest rates in this country.  It is hard to imagine how many individuals or how many societies or organisations will benefit from the results of that loan, because interest rates were inclined to go up. I am glad to see that the present Government did not follow in the footsteps of the British Chancellor of the Exchequer when the bank rate was increased in England by 1/2 per cent. and we kept our interest rate the same as it was prior to that.  We had a tradition and a bad fashion of following in the footsteps of our neighbours, the English people, so far as monetary matters were concerned.  I am glad we stood out independently and said: &ldquo;We will apply our own interest rates no matter what the other fellow thinks.&rdquo; I think it was an independent and manly thing to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some people bemoan the reduction in the price of wheat.  I do not imagine that the farmer is adequately paid for any of the things he produces at the present time, but I do believe there must be a limit and that a ceiling must be reached some day or other.  I wonder what would happen if this occurred; suppose we were to leave <Col N="1521" /> the price of wheat at its former level &mdash;I think it was 12/6 a barrel more than it is at present&mdash;and suppose we were to offset that in some way or other, could we not have done it?  I think Fianna Fáil had that in mind. They had this in mind&mdash;to rob Peter and pay Paul.  We remember the suggestion made in the Seanad not so very long ago by a responsible Senator of the Fianna Fáil Party, that a tax of £3 per head be placed on all cattle exported.</P>

      <P>We were told some years ago by a leading spokesman of the Fianna Fáil Party that &ldquo;the movement from country to town and abroad is perfectly natural in a country where agricultural holdings barely make ends meet&rdquo;.  That statement was made in December, 1941, by a Minister of the Fianna Fáil Government. Speaking in Cavan on 11th <Col N="1523" /> April, 1945, the same Fianna Fáil spokesman said that he did not see anything abnormal about the flight from the land and he added: &ldquo;It was perfectly natural and it would be a desperate thing if more people would stay on the land than were on it at present.&rdquo;  I wonder if the outlook in the Fianna Fáil Party is still the same &mdash;in other words, that we have still too many people on the land and that we could do with fewer people on the land?  In my view, that was a very feeble argument in connection with one of our biggest problems&mdash;emigration, coupled with unemployment.</P>
      <P>The Government and the Minister have left me in the proud position that, if I am selected as a candidate for the local elections, I can stand up on the platform and ask the people to examine the record of the inter-Party Government over the past nine months and, if they approve of it, to support me.  I know what the answer will be. I know that Fianna Fáil have not long to wait to learn the view of the people in relation to this Budget.  The results of the local elections, which will be held next month, will indicate the pulse of the people.  I can assure the Fianna Fáil Party that they will not be pleased with the results of the local elections and that they will lose seats. I am glad the people will have an opportunity of endorsing the work of this Government.</P>

      <P>I do not think any Deputy envied the Taoiseach the task he had of speaking in this debate.  I believe that anybody less accustomed to making the best of bad cases would have been dismayed by the task which was presented to him.  Deputy after Deputy from this side of the House produced evidence to prove that promises of reduced taxation on the one hand, of extended social services on the other hand, and of a general lowering of the cost of living had been made during the last general election by the Parties that now constitute the Government and that it was on the basis of those promises that they were elected to office.  There was the suggestion that this Government needed time to get warm in their seats before evidence would be given of the steps which they proposed to take to fulfil those promises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Budget time was referred to as the time when evidence would be given of their policy in regard to those promises.  Budget time has come.  What has become of the promises which were made during the general election? What about the people who expected a reduction of taxation by millions of pounds?  What about the people who <Col N="1525" /> expected that the cost of the ordinary household commodities would be brought back to their 1951 level?</P>
    <P>Of course, there has been a trick which I have endeavoured to expose. Apparently it is not yet understood by the majority of the people&mdash;this trick that has been played by the Coalition, or as they choose to call themselves, the inter-Party Government.  They go as separate Parties to the country.  The Fine Gael Party can point to the burden of taxation and say that it is essential in the national interest that that taxation should be reduced by millions.  They do not, of course, attempt to point out in what respect or how they will reduce that taxation. They do not say what social services, for example, will have to be abandoned if taxation is to be reduced.  They point out or suggest vaguely that there are millions that can be saved, that there are millions of economies available in the administration, and their supporters think that it is only a question of putting Fine Gael into office, or Fine Gael representatives into office, and that all these economies will be effected and that all these millions will be taken off the burden of taxation.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, you have the Labour Party.  They go to the country and point out that the benefits available to old age pensioners should be increased, and that, of course, indicates the other side of the picture that if these things are to be done they will necessitate increased taxation. There is no limit to the extent to which each of these Parties can go except the limit that might be imposed by the credulity of the people listening to them.  There is no limit whatever beyond which the representatives of these two Parties may not go.  They have an alibi at hand.  If a Fine Gael representative who has been elected is brought to task by one of those who elected him when in this Budget he sees no reduction in taxation, the Fine Gael Deputy can say at once: &ldquo;Oh, I would do it if it were not for the other fellow.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>They did not get into power with an absolute majority and, of course, everybody knew before the elections, <Col N="1526" /> and Fine Gael knew as well as most, that they would not get a complete majority, so that, therefore, the alibi was ready.  They can say: &ldquo;Oh yes, we would reduce taxation, but you see there is the Labour Party and we have to keep them in humour and we have to give them something.&rdquo;  The Labour Party, on the other hand, have their excuses.  To those who cry out and say to them: &ldquo;You have not reduced the cost of living down to the 1951 figure; you have not reduced prices to the 1951 figure&rdquo;, they will say: &ldquo;Of course we would do that, but that would have required subsidies, which would have meant increased taxation and we could not do that because the other fellow would not let us.  Fine Gael would not let us.&rdquo;  Therefore, there is no limit to the promises that can be made by each of these Parties in election times because they will always be able to have the excuse: &ldquo;We would do this but the other fellow would not let us.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In order that the people might have a fair chance of judging in advance what the policy to be pursued would be, I suggested to these two Parties that if they were determined to coalesce and form a Coalition Government they could, before the election, make their bargains so that they could present a united policy.  When the pulling on the one side and the pulling on the other was over and when some position of equilibrium was reached, they could go to the country and say: &ldquo;This is the policy of our Government, of our inter-Party or Coalition Government, if elected&rdquo;.  We have challenged them in two successive elections; we have challenged them from the very moment the Coalition was spoken of.  We pointed out the system they were working, each particular Party going out with extravagant policies to the country, policies which they knew they could never put into operation.  We challenged them that instead of doing that and deceiving the people in that way they should come to agreement before the elections.</P>
    <P>Now the Taoiseach said that he made no promises.  It was very difficult to distinguish between the &ldquo;I&rdquo; and the &ldquo;we&rdquo;.  When these statements <Col N="1527" /> which were made by the Taoiseach were given to the newspapers, and when one read the newspaper accounts, one had &ldquo;he&rdquo; and &ldquo;they&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;I&rdquo; and &ldquo;we&rdquo; and the result was that one did not know whether the Taoiseach was speaking for himself or whether he was speaking as the prospective head of the Government.  There was no indication of what Government policy was.  He quoted me as approving of some statement or statements he had made to the effect that he was making no promises.  That was only strengthening the alibi I have been mentioning. One had not merely the alibis of the two Parties, but the further alibi that the prospective head of the Government was making no promises.  I said he spoke wisely, but that was only the introductory sentence to the paragraph and it would have been interesting when the Taoiseach quoted that sentence if he had quoted the paragraph as a whole.  It would have been, in fact, merely a question of putting the stop after &ldquo;wisely&rdquo; or the comma and letting the rest follow immediately and necessarily.</P>
    <P>I said he spoke wisely because neither I nor anybody knew&mdash;no voter knew what would be the policy of the inter-Party Government&mdash;what would be the result of the bargaining that would take place, not before the elections when the voters could see what was happening, but after the elections when the political Parties could snap their fingers as they are doing now at the electors.  They think they have a long period during which the voters who are deceived will have time to forget what they were told by the representatives of these Parties.  Of course the Taoiseach could not tell beforehand what would be the policy of his Government, but he gave expression to a number of platitudes to which every Government and every member of a Government would agree&mdash;that they would strive to be a good Government, that they would try to increase production and that they would do their best to keep down the cost of living.</P>
    <P>All these are platitudes, because <Col N="1528" /> every Party that aspires to be a Government will naturally strive after these things and will certainly tell the electorate that they have these objects in view.  In this case, however, there was something very much more explicit than the platitudes.  There was no question of platitudes when the present Attorney-General was speaking over the radio.  He was long enough a member of a Government and long enough associated with his Party to know what were the things the Party stood for, if they stood for anything.</P>
    <P>He said, in the course of that broadcast, that there were economies ready to hand for anybody who went seriously in quest of them, that there were savings to the extent of several millions of pounds similarly available for anybody who went in quest of them and knew what he was about.  Lest there should be any doubt as to what the several millions in question were, he came down to the specific figure of a saving of £20,000,000 which was desirable, he said, in the national interest but that, of course, if you were to get the £20,000,000 you would have to have a change of outlook, you would have to have a new Government and this new Government would supply the change of outlook which would bring about the objective of £20,000,000 in savings.</P>
    <P>One thinks it a pity that the Attorney-General should have deprived the country of his services in the post in which he would immediately be able, as Minister for Finance, to get after these economies but he chose not to take that post and, of course, we know that if there was any truth in these statements, really, anything factual about them, he is sufficiently near to his colleague the Minister for Finance to have given him the tip as to how he was to do it.</P>
    <P>Members of the present Government are not novices.  They have had, many of them, previous experience in the Coalition Government.  Many of them have had experience over a longer period of years in previous Governments. They are not novices and they know where to look for economies if these economies to the extent of millions were available.  The present <Col N="1529" /> Budget does not indicate where these millions lie.</P>
    <P>I, for one, have not much satisfaction in talking of the promises that were made by the respective Parties to the people.  Pretences, however, are always contemptible, the pretence that you could, by a change of Government, bring down the cost of living to the 1951 figure, the pretence that you could, by economies and the prevention of waste, cut down taxation by £20,000,000 and the pretence that you could give renewed social services at the same time.  It was on the basis of these false pretences, in the main, that the present Government got into office.</P>
    <P>The one thing I hope is that pretences of that kind will not become a characteristic of our public life.  I do hope that the experience which the people have gained during the last election and in this Budget will prevent them from being fooled in the future.  Perhaps that is a vain wish but there is one thing certain that the way to prevent false promises being made is for the people to prove to political Parties that pretences and promises of that sort which are not going to be fulfilled do not pay.  I hope our people will see to it that when Parties deliberately make these promises and then cynically, when the time for performance comes, suggest either that they have not made them at all or that they were only made with regard to an indefinite time in the future&mdash;&ldquo;objects all sublime to be achieved in time&rdquo;&mdash;they will be made to realise that that was not the spirit in which the election was conducted.</P>
    <P>Another pretence was that we were in a state of misery during the last period of Fianna Fáil Government.  It was thought that by continually repeating this statement&mdash;that we were in a miserable condition, that there was a Government in power that was cruelly imposing unnecessary taxation, &mdash;it would be believed that that was the situation.</P>
    <P>We have had another thing of the same kind repeated, that we have here the lowest standard of living of English-speaking countries.  The former Minister for Home Affairs (the present <Col N="1530" /> Attorney-General) in the Six County Parliament has recently repeated something which he had written formerly in an article and which, back in 1947, I was able fairly effectively to reply to from the opposite benches.  He has repeated that slander to suggest that we are here living in a miserably low condition with a very low standard of living.</P>
    <P>On that occasion I was able to prove that wages here, on the whole, were higher than wages in the Six Counties, that we had no rationing here, that the standard generally of the people was much higher than it was in the Six Counties during that period.  It was true that the cash benefits in the Six Counties, social services, were at a higher rate but, as here it would cost, so there it did cost a great increase in taxation.  I have not had an opportunity of working out the figures so as to get a proper comparison now, but at that time I remember that the figure was that the central taxation here was at about £16 per head whereas there it was more than twice that, it was £34 per head.</P>
    <P>Of course, if you double the taxation you can undoubtedly provide quite a substantial addition to our social services. At present, if you use &ldquo;social services&rdquo; in a broad sense, about one-half of the national expenditure is in social services.  That is, using it in the widest sense, including education and so on, about one-half of the revenue is spent in that particular way.</P>
    <P>When the people were talking that they could bring back the position to 1951 by subsidies, a calculation was made which would show that you would want from £20,000,000 to £25,000,000 extra taxation to do it.  We can have all these things, undoubtedly, if we are willing to pay for them.  It is not merely a question of being willing to pay for them indeed, but are we able to pay for them?  Are we able to pay for them without causing damage to the community as a whole and therefore making it difficult for the community as a whole to render to the weaker sections the services which the community ought to render and which the community would be willing to <Col N="1531" /> render?  It is a question of ways and means.</P>
    <P>The mere suggestion of that brings me to the attacks that are being made on a speech which I made at the last Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis.  It has been suggested in this House that I have been against an increase in social services. I have said nothing to indicate that I was against an increase.  I said: &ldquo;an increase by all means if you can satisfy yourself that you have the means to meet it.&rdquo;  If you have the means, well and good.  If you have not the means, then you are going to do damage not merely to the rest of the community but even to the section of the community that you wish to help.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste took a paragraph or a sentence from a condensed report of a speech which I made.  That speech, if it were given <i>in extenso,</i> probably would have covered the whole of a page of one of the newspapers.  It was condensed and words were used in the condensation which were not exactly the words I used.  My whole plea, however, at the Ard-Fheis was that, when people were demanding, as the Labour Party are demanding, vast increases in the social services, we would have to watch carefully where we were going and assure ourselves that we had the means of doing these things.</P>
    <P>To accuse Fianna Fáil of being against social services was rather funny.  Practically the whole social code is the code that has been built up by Acts that were passed by Fianna Fáil when it was in a majority in the House.  You had unemployment assistance, widows' and orphans' pensions, children's allowances, and of course the Social Welfare Act, the Conditions of Employment Act, and so on, all passed by Fianna Fáil and proving that Fianna Fáil were true to their original purpose, namely, to work for the nation as a whole and, in particular, to have cognisance of the needs of the workers and the small farmers of the country.  That has been our constant aim and the legislation that has been passed while Fianna Fáil were in office is proof that we have been true to that aim.  Therefore, let nobody from the Labour Benches or <Col N="1532" /> anywhere else suggest that we, on principle, are against either the worker or against social services which we can meet.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach says we can do these things by increased production.  Everybody agrees with that.  That is one of those platitudes.  We all know that if you have increased production you will have increased revenues and that from these increased revenues you will be able, without increasing rates of taxation, to give increased benefits. There is nothing new or strange about that.  The only point is that we have speakers on the opposite benches going through the country talking about the misery that there was when Fianna Fáil were in office and the heaven that there is and will be now that the Coalition are in office.  I do not think that talk like that cuts much ice with the thinking people.  It may, of course, fool those who are simple and who are inclined to be affected by this policy of Couéism pursued by those on the opposite benches: &ldquo;We are getting better and better every day when we are in office; we get worse and worse every day when Fianna Fáil are in office.&rdquo;'</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance in his Budget review spoke of the conditions during the past year.  Favourable conditions they were, but when we pointed out last year that the year 1953 was a year of recovery, that there were advances all along the line, that you had an increase in tillage, an increase in agricultural produce, an increase in real terms in the national income for the previous year for which the figures were available; an increase in industrial production and employment; when we pointed out that more milk had been sent to the creameries than at any time since 1936 or 1921, that 50 per cent. more pigs were delivered to the bacon factories than in the previous years, and so on, when we gave that whole list of advances it was simply pooh-poohed.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to pooh-pooh the advances that have taken place in the last year.  There has been a natural upward trend, but that has been paralleled in other countries.  When the Korean war broke out and a world <Col N="1533" /> war was threatened there was intense activity; there was a boom of buying and stocking and as long as a world war was threatened you had this intense activity which effected the increase in industrial production, and so on, and brought about the relatively boom position that the Coalition Government were fortunate enough to be able to put to their credit.  But they had as much to do with the things that happened at that time as Columbus had to do with the eclipse.  I recall the story about Columbus who, when he wished to impress the simple natives and knowing that an eclipse was at hand, pretended that he could darken the sun, and, of course, knowing also that it would only be temporary he suggested that he could bring back the light. Just as Columbus did not do these things he pretended to do, neither did the Fine Gael Government in that period of office bring about that boom. They pretended they were giving everybody better times.</P>
    <P>However, as a rule after a boom you get depressions and, immediately that it became obvious that the Korean war would not become a world war, you had the position that people had bought in wool and other fundamental articles which had sky-rocketed in price as they had never done before. Then you had goods manufactured from these lying on the shelves; you had them also in the warehouses and in the form of raw materials with manufacturers.  The problem was how to get rid of these highly priced goods. Everybody wished to hold back thinking that prices would come down and, of course, the depression followed. Just as Fine Gael was not responsible for the boom neither were we responsible for the depression.  One followed the other and they were paralleled in practically every country in the world. Certainly in most of the countries for which any statistics are available, you had this intense activity in 1950-51 followed by the depression.  We were unfortunate that we came in at the period of depression.</P>
    <P>We were unfortunate in another way in which the present Government is not unfortunate.  The present Government, <Col N="1534" /> when an election was at hand, dressed up their Estimates for that election. They cut them down.  They did not make provision for commitments and for immediately foreseeable expenditure, with the result that the Budget we had to take over was insufficient to meet the commitments that had been foreshadowed in the Budget and when we came to the end of the year we had a deficit of some £6,000,000 or £7,000,000.  Most of that, if not the whole of it, represented foreseeable expenditure for which provision was deliberately not made in the Budget.</P>
    <P>Of course, those who had done that sort of thing suspected that we were about to do the same thing while we were in office and when we were going to an election.  It was freely suggested here from these benches that our Estimates had been cut in the same way, that our Budget was dressed in the same way and that, when the end of the year would come, it would be proved that there was not sufficient revenue to meet expenditure, that proper provision had not been made.  What has been the result?  In our case the result has been this.  Were it not for the expenditure which was incurred deliberately&mdash;I would like to deal with that word &ldquo;deliberately,&rdquo; but I shall not digress to deal with it now&mdash;to meet, in one case, a subsidy and, in the other, a payment to civil servants, which had not been anticipated in our Budget and for which the Government is glad to take credit, our Budget would have closed with a surplus of some £349,000 &mdash;the first surplus for many years.</P>
    <P>We were taunted some years ago with &ldquo;going for a surplus&rdquo; when it was suggested that we were following a campaign of austerity.  We came into office in 1951 and when we came to our first Budget there were a year's accounts showing a deficit of some £6,000,000 or £7,000,000.  Then there was the situation in which we had to make provision for the various things that had been passed by this House. We found there was a gap of £15,000,000.  The present Minister has not got that to face, after our period of office.  He has got the comfortable position in which there was £4,000,000 that was available for them, £4,000,000 <Col N="1535" /> by which the estimated revenue would exceed expenditure, as the case would have been but for the policy I have just mentioned.</P>
    <P>We left them with £4,000,000 to the good.  We took over with £15,000,000 to the bad after they had been in office and we had to meet that £15,000,000. There was nobody here in opposition at that time who would suggest we should borrow that £15,000,000.  The easy way out was to suggest that there was overestimation of expenses by £10,000,000.  Everyone who has been in Government knows the care with which the Estimates are prepared, the advice that is taken and the steps that are taken to get as near as possible an estimate of the expenditure that is to take place.  Everybody knew that any democratic Government in its senses would not have put up the Estimates and put £10,000,000 or £15,000,000 of unnecessary taxation on the people.</P>
    <P>To try to explain such a thing, they suggested that we had an austerity policy.  We had no such thing.  There was no evidence whatever that an austerity policy was pursued by our Government.  There are certain characteristics of an austerity policy. It is a policy in which you ration and prevent people from using goods which they produce.  That was done in England, where home consumption of production was limited in order that the goods might be exported. Austerity policies are noted for their budgeting for a surplus.  We did not budget for a surplus.  As a matter of fact, at the end of the year, instead of the accounts proving that we had some £10,000,000 surplus in overtaxation, they proved that we had a deficit of £2,000,000.  Yet, the Taoiseach, I am sorry to say, though he must know there is no truth whatever in that suggestion, continues to repeat it and his colleagues with him&mdash;that in the 1952 Budget there was £10,000,000 of unnecessary taxation.</P>
    <P>That &ldquo;unnecessary taxation&rdquo; was the theme at the last election.  I know that the Taoiseach made the mouths of his listeners water in Enniscorthy or elsewhere for the 80,000,000 &ldquo;halfones&rdquo; that might have been drunk <Col N="1536" /> were it not for the Fianna Fáil policy.  He had a chance of getting the 80,000,000 &ldquo;half-ones&rdquo; back: why did he not take it in this Budget?  He became lyrical about it.  He said that it meant that there was not only less gratification to the people who would consume them but that there was less income to the State directly, and that there was unemployment in the distilleries, public-houses and so on.  If all these things followed from the taxation on whiskey being too high, he had an opportunity in this Budget, if he thought it good national policy, to restore that situation and give those people their 80,000,000 &ldquo;half-ones&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I do not know how he got that figure or on what basis it was made up, and I think he confused a couple of things. If there were 80,000,000 &ldquo;half-ones&rdquo; about, that would give satisfaction to our people, bring increased revenue into the Exchequer and put more people into employment in the distilleries and public-houses, why did he not make the change?  The answer is, of course, that the whole thing was on a false basis, that there was no such thing in reality.  The fact was that there was a reduction at the start and that afterwards the revenue increased; but whatever it is, if his argument was right, it ought to hold now as well as then.  Somebody interpolated something about these 80,000,000 &ldquo;half-ones&rdquo; before and said it was suggested from the opposite benches that it would not be dealt with except at Budget time. Now the Budget time has come and these 80,000,000 &ldquo;half-ones&rdquo; are likely to remain in the position in which they were under Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>With our present rate of production and our present rate of taxation, certain revenue is available.  That revenue has been increasing in recent years, that is, the yield from the unchanged rates of taxation has been increasing. There is, however, also an almost automatic increase in certain expenditure and, in the end, you are lucky if the rate of increase in expenditure does not overtake the rate of increase in yield.  This year, as I have said, the Minister had £4,000,000 if he wanted it and if it had been Government policy they could have had £4,000,000.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1537" /> Let us think of this £4,000,000 for a minute or two.  The Coalition Government have £4,000,000&mdash;what are they going to do with it?  If they were going to fulfil the promises made of a reduction in taxation they would have used it for the reduction of taxation, and, to the extent to which they are not doing that, they are not availing of the opportunities which are there for them, if they want to avail of them, for the reduction of taxation.  On the other hand, there is the Labour Party.  There is a sum of £4,000,000 for them and that money could be used to increase subsidies or in other ways to carry out their programme.  To the extent to which they are not making use of that money in that way, they are breaking their promise to their people, but of course they have the alibi that, when it comes down to brass-tacks, there is a struggle in the executive between the various Parties to find out what is the best way of using this money.  A compromise is finally reached and the compromise is to the effect that certain reliefs are given.</P>
    <P>We on this side of the House would have had no complaint whatever against the Government if they had gone to the electorate as a combined Party and said to the electorate: &ldquo;We propose to do so-and-so with any surpluses when we get them; we do not propose to use them for the reduction of taxation.  We propose to use them otherwise.&rdquo;  The common suggestion now is that this reduction of taxation is to be brought about by increased production.  Everybody in the country would be very happy to see an increase in production.  The increase in production began back at the end of 1952 and it went right through 1953.  There were the same records&mdash;not merely the same trends but the same records&mdash;of high figures in 1953 and they were continued on to 1954.  The year 1954 simply continues the curve.</P>
    <P>They are again fortunate that it is so, but we would have had no complaint against this Budget in those circumstances and, as a matter of fact, looking at the figures, I doubt very much if a Fianna Fáil Executive would <Col N="1538" /> have dealt with the situation very much differently from the way in which it was dealt with by this Government. In other words, if there was money coming in from increased revenue, and it was money to spare, there was a class which was deserving of attention, that is, the old age pensioners.  The old age pension, if I recollect correctly, was about 10/- in 1938, and you would require two and one-third times as much money to purchase the same quantity of goods now.  Therefore, if you had a pension of 10/- to buy fundamental commodities which relate definitely to the cost-of-living figures&mdash; to keep pace and not to improve conditions at all&mdash;you would require to have 23/4 or so now.  Therefore, if you give less, you are being less than fair to the old age pensioners, on the present cost of living, and, if you give them any more, you are improving their position relatively.  There is a point in this connection on which I should like to ask the Minister for an explanation&mdash;whether the half-crown is a flat half-crown or a half-crown added on to the maximum and then <i>pro rata</i> reduced?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>No&mdash;a flat half-crown all the way down the scale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>That, from an administrative point of view, is probably easier and it would not mean very much for the Exchequer anyhow to do it differently.  I was anxious for an explanation of that point because it was interpreted in different ways by different people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The marginal scales of means are left the same, but the amount of each marginal scale is increased by a flat half-crown.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>In other words, you give a flat half-crown to every old age pensioner&mdash;that is what it amounts to?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Each old age pensioner gets a half-crown in addition to what he was getting already?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no objection to that and I do not think anybody on <Col N="1539" /> this side would have any objection to it.  It is only fair and, if there are some millions available, undoubtedly the old age pensioners had a good claim on them.  We are not finding fault with that.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of the reduction of the subsidy on flour by not giving the subsidy to those engaged in the confectionery business, we have had some difficulty in understanding how it is going to be carried out.  I hope that we are not to go back to the system of regulations which we had during the war.  We were very glad to free enterprise from regulations of that sort and I hope this can be done without having to resort to measures of that kind, but frankly those of us who know most about administrative measures are rather sceptical as to the ability to administer it properly, in the way which obviously was intended.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Budget, as a Budget, we have not got very much to say to it.  What we have to say is that it is a Budget very different from the Budget the people were led to expect. Let it be remembered that a favourite way of dealing with Budgets, when those who are now on the opposite benches were over here, was to suggest that you could do marvels with a Budget, that you could change the whole economic condition of the country by a Budget.  I was twitted with having been obsessed&mdash;I think that was the word used&mdash;with some allegiance to formal consistency in the Budget and that, when we were balancing a Budget, we were only accountants, keeping accounts, and that a Budget in the hands of people who know how to use it could be a great instrument for changing the economic and social conditions of the country.  You have had your chance. What is in this Budget to do it, except what was in our Budget?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the country is in a sound condition to-day, it is because we faced the unpopular task of balancing expenditure by revenue.  The former Coalition Government ran away from that task.  What they would have done had they been returned to power, I do not <Col N="1540" /> know, but they ran away from that task and they attacked us because we faced it.  It is because we faced it and put the finances of the country on a sound foundation that you are able to have the satisfactory Budget you have to-day from the country's point of view.  It is from the country's point of view satisfactory in that you have been brought down to earth.  If you keep to this line, you are on a solid foundation, a foundation which we had to relay after it had been destroyed by the former Coalition Government.</P>
    <P>I hope, when Fianna Fáil will resume office, that it will not again have to do the things it had to do previously to clear up the mess that was left by the Coalition Government. If you keep on present lines you will probably be all right.  But it is very different from the prating&mdash;I do not know any better word&mdash;that we heard from the people who were talking on the other side of the House.</P>
    <P>We had not merely to settle the position with regard to the Budget deficit in the ordinary State housekeeping accounts but we had also to remedy the position as far as our external accounts were concerned.  We had the balance of payments deficit which reached a record figure of £61.6 million, almost £62,000,000, at a time when the estimated net national reserve in the way of external reserves was only about twice that figure.  Two such years with two such deficits and our national reserves would have been exhausted.  Of course, for the gentlemen who talked about the repatriation of assets, that was a desirable thing. It was desirable that our foreign assets, as they call them, which were being used to help John Bull to have a better standard of living and to subdue other peoples, should be over here.</P>
    <P>There are obvious ways in which you can usefully employ our national reserves.  You can bring them here, but you can bring them only by goods. Some foolish people think that all you have got to do is to change your account in a bank, and transfer your external reserves to this country.  Anybody who has given any thought to the matter knows that you can do nothing of the kind.  Some people think that <Col N="1541" /> any such transfers in the main have only to be transferred from, say, one bank account to another.  This, of course, is not so.  For example, if the Central Bank seeks to pass money, its assets, to commercial banks, or a private individual to the commercial banks, all you do is to change ownership within the nation, and you do not change the total amount of the national external reserves by any such process.  You can only do it by bringing in goods or services.</P>
    <P>If the deficit is due to the introduction of goods to that extent you are reducing your external reserves and then the point is how are these goods or services to be used and for what purpose?  Are they to be used for consumption, to be finished with, or are they going to be used for productive purposes?  If they are to be used for productive purposes then they serve at home as well and perhaps better, according to the yield from them.  But they also serve the national purposes as long as they are outside the country.  You get considerable interest which means you can bring in goods to that amount.  You have to be careful that you do not reduce your reserves too much, even by bringing in goods for productive purposes, because your external assets are valuable at particular times to enable you to get goods which you want.</P>
    <P>We know, for instance, that we wanted to get goods in the dollar area. With the currency that we had, we would not have been able to get them, and we were very glad to get dollar credits for them.  You can have a situation like that.  External reserves have to be carefully conserved and watched so they are not brought below a reasonable figure.  The question arises, what is a reasonable figure?  I think you would have to examine the amount you have to call on.  For instance, if they were below £62,000,000 in 1951 we would have become a debtor nation. The extra goods we got over and above what we could pay for would have to be got by way of loans or some such way, or else we would have to tighten our belts and do without them.  The goods we import enable us to have a higher standard of living than we would otherwise have.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1542" /> I think about £600,000,000 was the total deficit in the period since 1947 in our visible trade or merchandise accounts.  We got goods during that period to the extent of £600,000,000 worth.  We were able to stand certain deficits in the balance of payments and had a considerable invisible export. We would not have got them if we did not have these.</P>
    <P>That brings me to tourism.  We are gradually converting the present Government. It may be a good Govern ment before we have finished with it At the end of the war, there was an exceptional situation.  We saw that we had a very exceptional position and that the time could be used for the development of the tourist industry. We had advantages over other countries; we had good food, a lot of it was not rationed, and we had it to spare.  We were able, therefore, to cater for the immediate needs of lots of people who had not tasted good food for years.  We were anxious to bring them in in order to give them a taste of the food which could be got here, and also a taste of Irish conditions. What do you think we got from the present Government who were then on the Opposition Benches? They behaved most unpatriotically&mdash; altogether against the national interests&mdash;as they have behaved unpatriotically in a good deal of the campaign they have carried on over the past two or three years.  They did not work for the national interests as a whole; they were working definitely for Party and not for national interests.  I know enough not to expect perfection. Human nature being what it is it has never been perfect in any country.</P>
    <P>Considering the things that have been sacrificed in order to get our freedom, we ought to have a higher standard here in political activity and political methods than most other countries have.  But perhaps one would be expecting a higher standard of character, and so on, than people have in general, and that is not easy to find anywhere.  At any rate the present Government in opposition behaved most unpatriotically in trying to prevent us from developing that industry.  When the change of Government <Col N="1543" /> took place they realised very quickly how important that industry was in the whole national interest. When they saw it meant something at the time of about £30,000,000 income to enable us to increase our claims abroad, and which would increase the amount we could get by way of excess of imports over exports, they played quite a different tune.  They were in office then, and could tell the truth.  They did not think it worth their while examining it and telling the truth when they were in opposition.</P>
    <P>In order to keep up our standard of living we want to develop our exports. The Minister for Finance in his talk suggested that Fianna Fáil did not want imports.  We want imports of the things we cannot produce ourselves &mdash;imports of things that are necessary to keep up our standard of living.  We heard some talk about tea recently. We want, as long as the people desire tea as a beverage, to import it.  We want to import raw materials for our factories.  We want to import capital machinery for our factories.  We want to import these things which make for a higher standard of living, but if we want to import them we have got to pay for them, and we must, in order to pay for them, try to increase our visible exports whether from agriculture or from industry.  We want, in addition, to increase our invisible exports.  We want to increase our tourist industry, for instance.</P>
    <P>As regards our external reserves, we naturally want to see that they are managed well so as to yield the highest income possible.  That is a commonsense approach.  We want it and I am sure that every reasonable person on the opposite benches will want the same.  That is why we want imports. We know we have to pay for them by exports, and if there is any difficulty in paying for them by exports we will naturally try to have the substitutes at home which will not need exports to pay for them.</P>
    <P>We want to produce the wheat at home.  We want to produce the food of our people here at home.  With <Col N="1544" /> regard to the land of this country, its first charge should be to produce the essential food of our people.  We want, therefore, to have produced in this country the amount of wheat which is the optimum amount&mdash;the figure of 300,000 tons of dried wheat was the estimate.  We wanted to see that that was done and in order to do it we had to give attractive prices.</P>
    <P>That brings me to another one of the promises of the Coalition Parties. In advertisements and so on they said that the policy of growing wheat here was agreed upon by them.  Not only that, but they were going to go one better than we had gone and would give a five years' guarantee.  They did not say they proposed with that guarantee to reduce the price of wheat. The whole implication of the statement at that time and the manner in which it was made was that there would be a guaranteed price at the existing rate.  Everybody knows that that is true.  When they got into office, they reduced the rate in order to have less subsidy to pay.  I am not saying that the idea of trying to have your subsidies as small as you reasonably can is not a good policy.  A considerable subsidy for flour is being paid already.</P>
    <P>The subsidy, when we were in office, was about £8,000,000 for bread.  Our view was that any moneys made available for subsidy would best be made available for flour and bread.  That was why we spent nearly £1,000,000 in increasing the subsidy in order to reduce the price of the loaf.  Of course, £1,000,000 does not go very far in the case of a reduction in regard to bread. The total subsidy in our time was, as I have said, about £8,000,000.</P>
    <P>The question arises as to whether it is better to continue the subsidy on bread or divide the money you have to give by way of subsidy between bread and butter.  We felt that bread was more universally used.  Whether you subsidise only on bread or partly on bread and partly on butter is a matter on which there can be a difference of opinion.</P>
    <P>To reduce the amount made available for subsidies the price of wheat <Col N="1545" /> was reduced.  It was suggested that that would not lower the amount of wheat which would be grown beyond the limit that would be regarded as the optimum limit.  The figures that have been given seem to suggest that this year you may, with reasonable yields, reach the optimum figure but the cultivation in wheat this year is not to be taken as the standard. This year the farmers had to do something before putting the tillage land back into grass.  They had to have a nursed crop.  Consequently, as they already had produced wheat they continue to produce it this year.  That does not mean that you will have that next year.  What we are afraid of is that the policy that will be pursued now is the policy pursued during the period of the last Coalition when you had tillage cut down by 500,000 acres.</P>
    <P>If we want to increase production&mdash; we are told by the Government that that is their aim; it should be; it was our aim&mdash;the most immediate and best yields can be got by increased production in agriculture.  You cannot increase production in agriculture unless you treat the soil properly and unless you have a reasonable amount of tillage.  Anybody who has given attention to this matter knows that you cannot treat the soil properly and get the best from it unless you have a considerable amount of tillage.  The amount of tillage that most people would consider fair for the whole Twenty-Six Counties would be from 3,000,000 to 3,500,000 acres.  We are very far away from that point and even at the peak period during the war we were very far away from that amount of tillage.</P>
    <P>If this Budget is to be the flexible instrument of policy it is claimed to be&mdash;what a wonderful array of words they applied to it!&mdash;there is a way in which it could be made such an instrument. You could bring about an increase in the total national production undoubtedly by encouraging the farmers to till.  You could bring about an increase in production from the land and you could produce the things here to the full extent that is reasonable and save us from the necessity <Col N="1546" /> of having to produce a surplus in other things in order to pay for them. We are certain of our market at home in these things.  If there is a guaranteed price the farmers can know beforehand what they will get.  We could pursue the national policy of increasing production by treating the soil properly, by seeing it is limed properly.  I can say for myself that I was never satisfied with the rate at which we proceeded in the liming of the land.</P>
    <P>That is true.  We did our best.  We could have, if we wanted to, set up a State company which would probably have accelerated matters.  We could have set up a State company and have a great number of extra State officials. Was that a better policy than to try to induce our people to take advantage themselves of the opportunities that were there; to get people to go out in private enterprise to provide the lime and to get the farmers to interest themselves in obtaining it for their own welfare?  We could have set up a State company which would accelerate matters, but we did not choose to do that because we knew in general it was not a good national policy, it would not be the right trend.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly, everything that a Government can do to stimulate agriculture, by urging the farmers to put more lime on the land and more fertilisers into it so that the soil will produce its maximum, should be done. That is the direction in which we believe this Budget should have been framed.  The amount that has been provided in the Estimates for that purpose does not show any indication whatsoever of a desire on the part of the Government to implement policy in that direction.  In the amount that is provided the Government is simply substituting for the money which came from the Exchequer in previous years moneys from the Grant Counterpart Fund.  To that extent they are, of course, saving revenue and leaving it available for other purposes.</P>
    <P>If it is the intention of the Government to use the Budget as an instrument of national policy, surely that was the direction in which they should have gone and the direction in which <Col N="1547" /> they should have provided more money. I admit that if the money could not be spent there would be no use in providing it; but, if that is the answer, then all one can do is one's utmost to try to ensure that the demand is there. The Government will certainly meet with no opposition from this side of the House if Supplementary Estimates are introduced for the purpose to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>There is no indication in the Estimates or in the Budget of a proper appreciation of the importance of doing that.  So far as the policy in relation to wheat is concerned, that policy is not being implemented in the direction in which we would like it to go but, rather, in the reverse direction. We hope that the Government as a whole&mdash;there may be people in it with different views&mdash;will see to it that the productivity of our land is increased.</P>
    <P>That brings me now to the really fundamental question with which every Government has found itself faced over the last 30 years.  I refer to the problem of emigration.  When we were in office it was customary for the people occupying these benches to shout both here in the House and all over the country that emigration was proceeding at a faster rate than at any time since the Famine.  It was their practice to suggest that our Government was responsible for that situation. Of course that statement can always be made just as it can always be said by certain people that we have the lowest standard of living in Europe, or in the world.  Where is the evidence of that?  When that statement is queried no evidence can be adduced in proof of it.  When one points to statistics showing the consumption of food by our people the reply is: &ldquo;Oh, it was said by so-and-so.&rdquo; In the same way in the North recently those who are anxious that our country should remain divided have tried to pretend that conditions in this part of Ireland are deplorable. Of course these particular people want to decry conditions here.  But the fact is quite the opposite.</P>
    <P>It was said by members of the present Government when in opposition <Col N="1548" /> that we were responsible for emigration.  There is, of course, no truth in that.  We pursued the only possible policy we could pursue in an effort to stop or to limit emigration; that was the policy of providing work for those who needed work.  We set out to do that by developing our manufacturing industries and our natural resources.  The result of that development was that twice as many were employed in industry when we were leaving office as were employed in industry when we first took office in 1932.  All these were given employment at home.  If these industries had not been developed these people would never have had employment at home and would have been compelled to seek it abroad.</P>
    <P>It has been pointed out, and with truth, that, whilst development was taking place in the case of the manufacturing industries, there was at the same time what is commonly called a flight from the land.  The numbers living in the rural areas were diminishing, rapidly diminishing.  At one time when we were in Government I tried to get comparisons between the rural populations in other countries, particularly in Europe.  At that time our rural population was proportionately higher as a whole than in most other European countries.  There has been a gradual movement from the country to the towns.  That is a movement which is taking place in most countries.</P>
    <P>The problem then was to frame and implement a policy which would have the opposite effect or at least stop that particular trend.  As far as we could see the people would either emigrate or go into the town and the only thing we could do was to try to build up industries which would absorb these people in our own towns and cities so that they would not be compelled to seek employment in foreign towns or cities.</P>
    <P>We are told that there is standstill in the number employed on the land at the present time.  I know it can be argued that if production is increased on the land the land will support a greater number of people.  That is true.  Some doubt arises as to whether <Col N="1549" /> the introduction of machinery into agricultural operations will in the long run mean increased employment.  It will undoubtedly mean increased productivity per person and greater productivity generally in the agricultural industry.  I am not quite so sure that it will lead to increased employment on the land.</P>
    <P>In order to alleviate the position to some extent we tried to implement a policy through the medium of which the provincial towns and cities would be developed.  Dublin was developing more rapidly than anybody who had the good of the country as a whole at heart would wish.  Possibly some would not agree with that, but, as far as the majority in Fianna Fáil are concerned, we were anxious that that trend towards a rapid expansion of Dublin should be replaced by a trend towards making cities such as Cork, Limerick, Galway, Kilkenny, Wexford, Sligo and so forth a little bigger.  That is a problem which faces this Government now.</P>
    <P>What are they doing about it?  They will, of course, shout that emigration has stopped.  They shouted that in 1948.  They were shouting when we were in office that emigration was going on at an ever-increasing rate. When the census figures were published, what did they show?  When we were in office in 1946 it was about 3,000; in 1947 it was 10,000.  Then it went up to 24,000 and 34,000 and it was up to 40,000 before the Coalition left office on the last occasion.  These are the facts.  These are figures over which the Office of Central Statistics can stand.  They were not able to stand over any figures in recent years, though, indeed, I pressed them as hard as possible to do something to give us a picture of that situation because it is a factor in our economy which needs to be carefully watched and carefully observed in an effort to discover if a solution can be found for it.  Our opponents set up a commission to examine into emigration.  The report of that commission has been published. What is the attitude of the present Government towards that report? What do they propose to do?  Do they accept some of the findings?  Do they <Col N="1550" /> accept some of the minority reports? Have they any policy?</P>
    <P>This is the time at which the national policy of the country as a whole should be considered.  It is a pity that in present circumstances so much of our time here is occupied with other matters, even though these matters are fundamental to the political life of the country.  This is the one opportunity we have in the year of looking at the social and economic situation as a whole, of trying to plan for it as a whole so as to improve the standard as a whole and conditions as a whole.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is any definite policy that this Government has for dealing with the problem of emigration though it was the one subject of all others upon which they attacked our Government from one end of the country to the other as if they had a solution.  We would all be very happy if the Government could find a solution to this problem.  The only solution we were able to find was to try to provide extra jobs for the 15,000 to 20,000&mdash;it is variously estimated&mdash;that are seeking new jobs every year.</P>
    <P>There are some members of the Government who do not regard emigration as an evil at all.  I am sure that is not the view of the Government as a whole &mdash;certainly it is not our view here, nor is it the view of the people of the country as a whole.  For generations it has been an outstanding evil.  If we could stop that flow of emigration we could have here an expanding economy; if it goes on we shall not have that.  I do not see in the Budget &mdash;this wonderfully flexible instrument according to members of the Government themselves&mdash;a remedy for that economic evil.  Now, that is an outstanding economic evil&mdash;has the Government any policy in regard to it? The only policy we could find is the one I have mentioned&mdash;have they any better?  What is being done in this Budget to further any such policy?</P>
    <P>I have kept the House a fair length of time but I have only, I suppose, spoken of one-tenth of the matters that occupy my mind from time to time when I come into this House and listen <Col N="1551" /> to some of the debates here, things that would occupy the mind of anybody interested in the development of our country.  I have only dealt with a fraction of them but there is one other matter which I have been reminded I had intended to deal with&mdash;I was about to omit it&mdash;this question of capital development.  When we were in office we were accused of starving huge projects by our devotion to sterling, the &ldquo;sacred cow of sterling&rdquo;, was invoked. Formerly it would have been the &ldquo;golden calf&rdquo; I suppose, but it was expressed as the &ldquo;sacred cow of sterling&rdquo;.  Yet they were not able to point to a single enterprise that we were starving through want of capital. They had been boasting&mdash;the Tánaiste and the Minister for Industry and Commerce in particular&mdash;of the number of productive enterprises being examined by his Department.  I think there were some 200 of them brought to completion in our time&mdash;200 such enterprises.  When we left office a further 100 or so were being examined.</P>
    <P>Not merely do Governments sometimes try to pretend that they have control over things on which they have no influence such as the general level of prices, but they pretend also to be able to do quite a number of other things as well.  Talking of the level of prices of course&mdash;I was talking about the Tánaiste&mdash;brings me immediately to that question he raised about the increase in cost of living or the consumer price index that occurred during our period in office.  That word &ldquo;deliberate&rdquo; which the Taoiseach is so fond of using with its suggestion of not merely deliberate, but purposefully deliberate, with a certain designed purpose: the suggestion was that we in 1952 of designed purpose wanted to decrease the standard of living and that that was our aim.</P>
    <P>We are told by the Tánaiste that by designed purpose we increased the consumer prices and consequently the price index.  I pointed out that was one of these trends, that the prices had begun to rise in the November before the Coalition left office, that it continued to rise so rapidly that by May it had gone up nine points.  It had <Col N="1552" /> gone up six points in about three months, from three to nine points. When we came in there was an increase of seven points.  The Tánaiste wanted then to make out that it was 15 points, but it was seven.  The remaining eight were produced by circumstances as much outside our control as the nine were outside the control of the present Government.  Prices can only be controlled to a very limited extent by Governments.  They can if they wish subsidise them and control them in that way but if they do they will have to get the revenue by taxation from the people.</P>
    <P>We set out in 1947 to reduce prices in that particular period because there was a dangerous trend.  We thought it would not be of long duration and we brought down prices far more substantially than they were reduced by the Coalition at any time.  We brought down these prices, but, if we did, we had to look for the money to pay for them from the people in the way of taxation.  It did happen that, on account of the yield, due to the purchasing value of the unit of money decreasing, there was increased revenue at that time and perhaps some of the extra taxation would not have been necessary if everybody had been able to see in advance to the end of the year.  Perhaps it would not have been necessary to put on these at that particular period but generally if you subsidise you have to provide for the subsidies by taxation.</P>
    <P>All I want to say is that of the 24 points it had increased up to our time, nine of these occurred during the time of the Coalition.  They were not able to control prices either.  Eight of these we could not control and the seven were due to the fact that we had to balance a Budget that was unbalanced to the extent of £15,000,000.  There was no desire on our part to do anything of the kind suggested by the Tánaiste: it followed because we had to do the thing we had designed to do and that was to see that expenditure was balanced by revenue.  To do that with a £15,000,000 gap there was no course open to us unless we were to impose staggering taxation which would probably have the effect that <Col N="1553" /> the Taoiseach pretended followed from the whiskey tax of reducing the revenue and so on.</P>
    <P>I want again to repeat that only seven of these 24 points were attributable to our period in office.  The cost-of-living index had, in fact, become stable for about two years and was actually dropping when we left office. It has increased a couple of points since.  If the Ministers on the opposite side of the House had the magic powers they pretend to have they should bring down that cost of living. They promised it to the people.  One of the charges against us was that we had starved productive enterprise, which would have given employment, which would have limited emigration, which would have given better conditions generally to our people, by failing to provide the capital.</P>
    <P>Now, accounts published in the White Paper circulated recently show that that is completely without foundation. The average for the last few years of the former Coalition régime for the State capital expenditure was about £24,000,000.  In our time, it actually went somewhere in the region of an average of £33,000,000.  There is no indication of any starving of State enterprise in that.</P>
    <P>The Government have tried to suggest that they have some wonderful schemes.  I wish they would give us particulars of these schemes.  I was also twitted with having said that we might have to meet this high rate of capital expenditure by having annual loans.  If you need £20,000,000 for two years you can have two single issues of £10,000,000 each year or you can wait and have the whole lot in two years. Sometimes it is a question of anticipating what you need.  You watch the state of the market and conditions generally to see when you can best float your loan.</P>
    <P>In his statement the Minister did not suggest how he will raise the money required.  I hope that when he is replying he will give some indication of where the money required for capital expenditure will be got. Is he going to get a forced loan from the banks or is he going to <Col N="1554" /> give the banks the opportunity of earning considerable interest by getting a loan from them at the normal rates, which is a fact, because, when the banks are given the opportunity of underwriting, it may appear that they are doing a service to the State in guaranteeing that the money that will be required will be secured but they are doing pretty well themselves because they are getting a good rate of interest on a safe investment.</P>
    <P>We should like to know how the Minister for Finance proposes to meet these capital commitments which are there above the line and below the line.  Does he propose to have a loan on public issue or does he propose to get it by way of the banks?  Does he propose to use departmental funds for that purpose?</P>
    <P>On this question of departmental funds, foreign assets and so forth, we notice that the total amount of liabilities that the Minister has to face in respect of the Post Office Savings Banks and Savings Certificates is about the £100,000,000 figure and that he has only £27,000,000 to meet his obligations.  I am not saying that that position is unsound, but the diminution of these departmental funds to any further extent will diminish his powers to make effective bargains with the banks, and so forth.  I think that in the national interest we have to be very watchful so far as any further diminution of these departmental funds is concerned: I am talking now of the Post Office.  Perhaps the Minister, when he is replying, would tell us what funds, besides Post Office Savings Funds and so forth, he has at hand?  He has committed to his charge a number of other funds such as National Health Insurance Funds, the teachers' pensions fund, etc.</P>
    <P>I was going to ask the Minister the total amount of these funds at his disposal so that we might get a clear picture of the financial situation as a whole.  I know that if we were in office the question we should be asked would be: &ldquo;Why not use these funds for national purposes?&rdquo;  We know that responsible people will be very cautious of the way in which these funds are further depleted.  They are <Col N="1555" /> a very useful instrument in the hands of the Minister for Finance and, so long as he has some of these funds available to him, he can hold back and wait for better conditions if he wants to issue a public loan.</P>
    <P>We should like to know what the Minister for Finance proposes to do in the matter of providing the capital funds necessary to finance capital expenditure both above and below the line.  Recently I read the report of an address by a professor of economics whose subject was Budget deficits over a number of years.  He uses the word &ldquo;deficit&rdquo; in the same sense, apparently, as the Central Bank used the word &ldquo;deficit&rdquo;&mdash;that it is not a deficit such as the £1.631 million shown in the balance sheet of this year but deficits including the whole of the voted capital expenditure.  I asked myself more than once why the Central Bank should regard all that as a deficit.  It is obvious that they regard voted capital expenditure as a different type of capital expenditure to expenditure below the line.  Expenditure below the line has been voted in the House and proper provision has been made in all cases, I think, for repayment through sinking fund and the payment of the prescribed rate of interest.  In the case of the voted capital, there has, as Deputies know, been some dispute.  I have never been able to take a definite side as between those who support the view that all the items are legitimate as capital expenditure and those who hold that they are not.  It is quite obvious that if you have recurrent expenditure it ought not be regarded as capital.  With recurrent expenditure, if you try to fund it then you find yourself in rather an interesting situation after a few years.</P>
    <P>The other suggestion in regard to the voted capital below the line is that the items are at the discretion from year to year of the Minister for Finance or the Government as a whole.  They can alter it as they please.  It is suggested that it is, therefore, in quite a different category and that it ought to be regarded in strict accounting as a Budget deficit.  Apparently it was regarded in that light by this professor of economics.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1556" /> I think the Minister for Finance, when he is replying, might also tell us something about our total State indebtedness: the gross national debt is now about £300,000,000.  The service of the debt&mdash;the yearly sum that must be provided to meet the charges, no matter what happens&mdash;has gone up to close on £15,000,000 a year.  Of course, the £300,000,000 is a gross figure.  There are certain items in that figure for which provision is made so that they yield a financial return.  If I understood this professor of economics correctly in the address to which I have referred, he estimates that for nearly half of the whole no provision has been made for any repayments: in other words, this must be regarded as more or less a dead weight debt.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to get any detailed calculations such as they had at the time of the Banking Commission.  It is difficult to get exactly at this figure of what is the true dead weight debt at the present time.  This much is obvious, however.  Our capital liabilities are mounting very rapidly indeed.  The annual sum that has to be provided has grown very substantially in recent years and it is now on the £15,000,000 mark.  It will absorb important items of revenue.  We must very carefully distinguish in future between investments or capital expenditure which are of a productive character and yield definite financial returns to the State or to the community as a whole and those which do not.</P>
    <P>One of the big problems we have in that regard is that of trying to assign to its proper place and proportion the amount of the available State capital that should be assigned to non-productive purposes&mdash;the improvements of various amenities and in turn the improvement of the wellbeing of the community as a whole.  In other words, it is a question of how much good we can do there.  It is obvious that we should go to the limit, but there is a limit.  If we could afford it there would not be a limit but unfortunately there is that limit.  The big problem is, as I say, how much of the State capital available should go to productive enterprise or, on the other side, how <Col N="1557" /> much of it should be used for nonproductive enterprises.</P>
    <P>Productive enterprises would justify themselves, or rather they would justify the raising of capital, but there is the question of the extent to which the State, by its capital investment, might unduly deplete our resources and starve private enterprise.  Our resources in the long run are the current and the accumulated savings of the past, and if the State takes too large a share of these savings there will be less available for private enterprise. It is on these lines that you get your indications of Government policy.  I do not think that anything, except vague indications that some advisory board is to be set up, has been told to us about these things.</P>
    <P>The fundamentals are known to practically anybody who pays any attention whatever to the situation.  No member of the Government need be any more than a few days in office to get the information that would enable him to make decisions as if he were a member of a commission.  The Department of Finance has been concerned with these matters for many years and every Minister for Finance is advised on these matters when he contemplates anything new and it is on the basis of the aim to be reached and the consequences to be feared that a decision is taken.</P>
    <P>I think that the Minister for Finance should enlighten us and the country as a whole, first of all as to how he is to raise the necessary capital, and secondly, what proportion of the estimated savings he proposes to utilise. It is very difficult to estimate savings for a year ahead but we do know what savings have been accumulated over past years.  We found ourselves in the position, in 1951, that there were no savings or that savings were zero.  We were in office during half of that year and we found that the savings of the community were practically nil.  The Minister talked about the importance of savings and I think everybody knows it is of fundamental importance because it is from these savings that we must build up our productive capital resources.  It is from these that we have, to a large extent, to provide the <Col N="1558" /> amenities necessary to improve the conditions of our people.</P>
    <P>I sounded a note of warning at the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis that we had reached a stage at which we must move with caution.  I should like to repeat that warning here to-day.  If we are able to get expansion in productive enterprise we shall be able to afford a higher standard of living and our community will thereby benefit.  If not, we shall go from bad to worse&mdash; we shall reach a stage where our resources will have become exhausted and where we will be a debtor instead of a creditor nation, going with hat in hand to foreigners to get the things we require.  Our external reserves are not being built up.  There is a very heavy deficit in our visible external trade at present as there has been for years.  Our external resources are matters about which a lot of foolish things have been said.  It has been said that they are built up by the transfer of accounts.  I have already dealt with that.  They have been built up as a result of two world wars during which we were able to export goods in a period when we were denied the opportunity of spending them in the purchase of imports.  Let us not waste these; let us see they are carefully conserved and that when there is a question of using them they will be used to the national advantage.</P>
    <P>I do not think that there is anything else that occurs to me.  As far as the Budget is concerned as a Budget I would point out it might be a Budget which we, if we found ourselves on the opposite side of the House, would produce, but it is not the Budget that people were led to expect.  In it we find no lowering of the cost of living. We have all the evidence that some prices are going up and everybody knows why: import prices figure in it as do agricultural prices, labour and so on.  I am talking about labour costs.  All these figure in the level of the cost of living and as long as these figures increase no Government, whether Coalition or even what is called a national Government&mdash;I deplore the idea of a national Government because if such a Government existed there would be no effective <Col N="1559" /> criticism&mdash;can change that level.  The only way that level can be changed is by subsidies, and if you have subsidies you have got to get money to pay for them.</P>
    <P>That means an increase in taxation. The only other way in which the cost of living might be reduced is, as has been suggested, by increasing incomes. We cannot, of course, talk of the cost of living as being something in the air by itself&mdash;an absolute.  Actually it is the price the consumer has to pay in relation to his income.  It is a relation between outgoings and income.  Perhaps you can increase incomes but, mind you, increasing incomes will increase prices which include labour costs and you will then have a further chase between one and the other.  That might not have the same effect on every section of the community; certain sectional interests may find it to their advantage to get increased incomes even though it increases prices generally and will feel justified in extra demands on that basis, but this would be reflected in increasing prices and in an increased cost of living generally.</P>
    <P>You cannot have these things both ways and it is only political mountebanks and political charlatans who pretend that you can.  I do not like using these harsh terms but under the circumstances I think they are justified. They are political charlatans, political mountebanks, who pretend to simple people that you can have these things both ways.  You cannot.  The Government will be excusing itself during the period that it may be in office for the various things it cannot do; it will be excusing itself with the arguments which I have used here. When people are demanding that the Government bring down the price of this or that you will find coming, as they have already come from the Government Benches, the answers that we would have given and that we gave when we were on those benches.</P>
    <P>I was tempted the other day to put down myself or to get one of my colleagues to put down a number of the questions that were asked from this <Col N="1560" /> side of the House, the Opposition side, when we were in office, and to see the answers that would be given to these same questions by the present Government. I believe that substantially the same answers would be given to these things, about foreign assets and the rest of it, that we gave when we were in office, because these answers represented the truth, and when a Government has to defend itself in these matters it would have to tell the truth. It was quite a different thing when you could applaud here, on the Opposition Benches, ridiculous pretences.  These were applauded here on this side of the House from people who were quite irresponsible and pretended to be economists and who either had not examined or did not want to examine or, if they had examined, were not able to understand.  When some of the people who are sitting on the opposite benches were on these benches they applauded tendentious questions that came from this side.  I do not think they would applaud now.  As a Government they would give the self-same answers as we gave in regard to these matters, that is, unless they were completely to ignore the national interest.</P>
    <P>There are probably other things that, if I waited to think of them, would occur to me as proper to be spoken of on an occasion like this.  But perhaps I think I have said enough for the present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (General MacEoin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Leader of the Opposition has all the staying powers of the past and he is still capable of saying all the things that he would like to say and to put his own construction upon them.  I am sorry that he has left the House because I hate to say anything behind his back; I would prefer to say it to his face.  I presume somebody will tell him some of the things that I will say in his absence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Leader of the Opposition has just given us a lecture, because lecture it was, in which he charged us here with platitudes but for the two hours that he has spoken his whole speech consisted of a series of platitudes and inaccuracies.  I shall not travel over the ground that he has covered.  At my time of life I am surprised that he <Col N="1561" /> would still be capable of meandering the old road that he has meandered so often of attacking other people and charging them with his own sins and offences.  The whole line of his offensive was that this Budget was not the Budget that the people were led to expect. He was particular and careful enough to say that they could hardly be expected to improve on it if they were here.  He did indeed say that there was a surplus of £4,000,000 and that they might not distribute it in the way that we distributed it, and he asked the question: Why did we not propose to give it in relief of taxation?  Therefore, I take it that it is a reasonable assumption that he would not, if he were in office, reduce the price of butter, increase the old age pension by the 2/6 or do the things that we have done. He says they might do it.</P>
    <P>When the former Minister for Education, Deputy Derrig, reminded him of capital expenditure, he started off on that and I was astounded again.  When we initiated our capital expenditure programme he and Deputy Childers described it as the rake's progress, that there was nothing for us but expenditure of an extraordinary type.  They described it as the rake's progress and mad capital expenditure.</P>
    <P>What was our programme of capital expenditure?  Land rehabilitation, afforestation, local authority works, the building of schools and hospitals. There was no expenditure of any description that we undertook that was not first-class capital expenditure. All that the Leader of the Opposition could say to-day about it was that they improved on it, that they did better, that they had greater capital expenditure. He said that but their capital expenditure was fantastic, whether it was the £5,000,000 a year in the National Development Fund which was to build ball alleys, swimming pools and what-not, to take off the corners of roads, to make roads flatter and to speed the motor-car, to make the autobahn for the plutocrat.  That was good capital expenditure according to them.</P>
    <P>I put it to you, Sir, that capital expenditure when undertaken by anybody other than Fianna Fáil becomes <Col N="1562" /> wrong, crazy and haywire.  When it is undertaken by Fianna Fáil and is of a different type and of less advantage to the people, it becomes capital expenditure by experts, by people full of wisdom and has all the qualities of well-spent money.  Of course, that is sheer nonsense on their part.  When they try to justify their type of work by condemning ours they are unfair to themselves.  However, that is to be expected from them.</P>
    <P>Their capital expenditure, it should be reiterated, was the Bray Road, Dublin Castle, the £5,000,000, as I said, to wash its face.  That was good and sound work.  Deputy Briscoe put down questions to find out what exactly Dublin Castle would cost.</P>
    <P>The Leader of the Opposition this evening referred to the mess that they had to clear up when they came into office in 1951.  He gave us three different figures this evening of the deficit.  It was £6,000,000 first, then it was £10,000,000 and in the last 20 minutes of his speech it had jumped up to £15,000,000&mdash;three different sets of figures for the one thing.  Which of them is right?  What was the mess that he had to clear up?  The only interpretation I can put on it is that Deputy McGilligan as outgoing Minister for Finance must have scattered the £24,000,000 on the floor and that they had a terrible job in collecting it.  We left £24,000,000 to them and apparently they were not satisfied with that; they would like to get it earmarked, I suppose, and packed in nice little pockets so that they could reach it without having to stoop.  The only way in which I can imagine them having to clear up a mess was that the £24,000,000 was spread all over the office of the Minister for Finance and that poor Deputy MacEntee, when he came in, had to bend his back to gather it up. That is the only mess that there could have been.</P>
    <P>It is asserted and admitted that that £24,000,000 was there and when they came into office so violent were they in their outspoken condemnation of us that they declared it was all spent, that the £6,000,000 of the counterpart fund was spent, that they had nothing at all left. Yet, thanks be to goodness, most of the £6,000,000 of the counterpart <Col N="1563" /> fund has still to be spent and the Minister for Finance now might as well say since he came in: &ldquo;You should have had that spent while we were out of office.&rdquo;  Fianna Fáil had not; they had it there when we came back and it is still there.  What is the point of their saying it was spent in 1951 when it is still to the good?</P>
    <P>The Leader of the Opposition, Deputy de Valera, was very indignant when we said that the Budget of 1952 brought about unemployment and hardship upon our people.  The justification which the then Minister for Finance had for that was that the Central Bank and, I presume, the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, said there was inflation, that the people were eating too much and drinking too much, that expenditure was far too high and that it must be reduced.  Furthermore, they asserted that wages had overtaken and passed the cost of living and that deflation must take place.</P>
    <P>We told Fianna Fáil then that their conduct would create unemployment and that it would lower the standard of living generally.  Of course, they had what they considered to be a reasonable answer to that.  They considered it reasonable because they thought the people would accept it and I regret to say a number of people did.  Fianna Fáil adopted the attitude: &ldquo;Do not blame us.  It was the inter-Party Government that left the situation which we have to clear up.&rdquo; We had a repetition of that this evening from the Leader of the Opposition.</P>
    <P>Other parts of Deputy de Valera's speech were platitudes that could be uttered by any Minister for Finance of Fine Gael&mdash;for instance, savings are very important.  I am glad he thinks that now; there was a time when he did not.  I do not wish to go over the distant past, but he used two phrases this evening which I heard him use not too long ago but I thought I would never hear them again.  One was that if certain things happened we would have to go with our hat in our hand. I never yet saw him in difficulties that he did not pull out that old tag: &ldquo;We <Col N="1564" /> cannot go round with our hat in our hand.&rdquo;  The other was that we would be unable to secure sufficient imports and that we would have to tighten our belts.  We said that one time and that was countered by the present Deputy Aiken who said we were all wrong about tightening our belts, that there would be so much beef and everything else in the country, that we would have to loosen our belts; that it was a great blessing our cattle trade with England was broken and that we had the meat to eat at home, and that Fine Gael were all wrong when they said we would have to tighten our belts.  The Leader of the Opposition has gone into reverse on that and I presume he would not now say that the cattle market was gone, that the British were unable to buy from us and that anybody asking for such a thing was like a child asking for the moon.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera took the offensive this evening in regard to the promises we made.  Why is it that it is all wrong for the inter-Party Government to come together after an election and issue 12 points of policy and to decide that that is the policy they intend to put into effect, and why is it right for Fianna Fáil after an election to publish 17 points of policy and say that that is what they intend to do?  It is a question that cannot be answered; it can only be explained by saying that it is charging your opponents with your own sins.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil came in with their 17 points after the election of 1951 and nobody could say a word to them.  They were 17 excellent points of policy and all that Government had to do to get every credit in the world was to put them into effect.  However, when they were in office for a while they ran away from them and put on the taxation they promised not to impose, and so on.  It is wrong for us apparently to come together with 12 points of policy which we have announced; yet they cannot attack one of them except to say that we made promises, and asserted things that were wrong.</P>
    <P>I have been attacked by the new paper <i>Gléas,</i> which supports Fianna <Col N="1565" /> Fáil, for saying certain things in Sligo-Leitrim, that rates would have to be reduced and that central funds would have to bear the burden.  In the issue of the <i>Irish Press</i> reporting that speech to which I refer there is not a word about that.  They say the report was published in the <i>Sligo Champion.</i> I was dealing with the situation that in 1932-33 Fianna Fáil wept tears of sorrow for the Irish farmer, the businessman and the industrialist when the total rates of the country amounted to £3,000,000 per annum, and that at the time that I was speaking at Tubbercurry rates had jumped to £16,500,000 under Fianna Fáil administration.  I put this question: Was it not time that that would stop?</P>
    <P>I have nothing to withdraw in that connection.  I said that if a Government decided to have any further expenditure they could draw for it out of their Central Fund rather than increase the rates.  Apparently Fianna Fáil would have you believe that I promised that not only would future expenditure be carried on the Central Fund but that some of the existing rates would be taken off.  One could not do anything of the sort and I did not say that.  I was criticising the difference between the tears of sorrow that Fianna Fáil shed for the people when the rates were £3,000,000 and when the Minister for Finance, then Deputy MacEntee, was able to say that &ldquo;taxation lay lightly on the land&rdquo;&mdash;taxation on the land that had increased in round figures from £3,000,000 to £16,000,000.</P>
    <P>They say we made certain promises. It is true that each Party advocated a programme which would be the ideal one in their opinion.  They are perfectly entitled to do that and there is nothing wrong with it, when you can get a majority for it.  We did say that the inter-Party would come together and would carry out a programme in the interest of the people.  I submit that we are doing that.  What was the counter argument by Fianna Fáil?  It was that not only would we not do what we were saying but we would do the direct opposite.</P>
    <P>Then you get this kind of intimidation <Col N="1566" /> producing poster of the weakest sections of the community.  Fianna Fáil was out only to this extent&mdash;we have increased widows' and orphans' and old age pensions by 2/6, so they made a mistake of only 6/6; since according to them if we got in those pensions would go back to 1951 and be cut by 4/-, and children's allowances also by 4/- and wages by 12/6.  That was intimidation, but there was worse than that.  I was canvassing with others in an area and found it had been covered by a Fianna Fáil county councillor and a Parliamentary Secretary. We went into a household and asked them to vote for us but we were told by the people there that they could not, that they had been told by this Parliamentary Secretary and county councillor that if they voted for Labour or Fine Gael their children's allowances would be taken off them and they would lose them.</P>
    <P>That intimidation is in keeping with this document published by the <i>Sunday Press</i> to intimidate those who read the <i>Sunday Press</i>.  It told them that if they attempted to vote otherwise they were cutting a rod to beat themselves.  It was a mean form of intimidation, carried out not by a Party trying to get into office but by a Party in power.  That was the time they did it.  Our promises could not counteract that intimidation, which was barefaced and unashamed.  They then charge us with their offences. They were the father and mother of broken promises.  No one could ever equal their efficiency in promising&mdash; they were able to promise everything to everybody.  I have kept this record safe for all time, it is now in my hand, it is battered but it is the greatest record of promises ever made by a Party and that were broken, that Fianna Fáil had no intention of ever putting into effect.</P>

      <P>It is a great thing to remind an old war-horse like myself of that.  I am delighted the Deputy has mentioned that I was on the side of the British then, as I want to tell a story that was told to me, no later than three months ago, by a person in Northern Ireland who is a Nationalist now fighting a battle.  He said: &ldquo;In 1932 we were satisfied that to end Partition all we had to do was to vote Fianna Fáil.&rdquo;  He said: &ldquo;I believed that and I believed that you, Seán MacEoin, were standing against it and I would kill you without the slightest hesitation.&rdquo;  I told him I did not doubt it.  He said: &ldquo;Then, worse than that, when Fianna Fáil got into office, you backed the British.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>This is a good Budget.  It has given and will give very substantial benefits to the weakest section of the community. It goes a long way towards assisting the aged, the blind and the weaker sections of the community to improve their standard of living and it does give effect to what was suggested by &ldquo;Mr. Everyman&rdquo; in the <i>Evening Press,</i> in that it increases the allowance in respect of children for income-tax purposes.  It is true that, coupled with the butter subsidy, it is a great help to the people.  There is only one thing the Leader of the Opposition said with which I agree and that is that when we give subsidies the money has to be got somewhere. The money must be got by taxation because subsidies can be met only by taxation.  I think he paid a great tribute to us and our achievement in giving these increased benefits to the people without increasing taxation, and we can now give an indication that, as things improve, we will have a much better situation next year.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance dealt with the economic condition of the country in a very able and factual way and far be it from me to attempt to improve on it.  The Leader of the Opposition has asked the Minister for some facts relating to funds.  It is a technical matter and I am sure the Minister will meet his request.  By and large, through the establishment of the inter-Party Government and through the careful management and handling of the nation's finances, we have been able to reach this situation in which we can give these benefits and I have no doubt whatever that, with God's help&mdash;because we do want a good harvest and we do want to see people working and receiving proper compensation for their labour&mdash;this country will have travelled a good distance along the road to that prosperity which every one of us would like to see by the time the next Budget comes along.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1570" /> I congratulate the Minister on his able handling of the Budget and his careful management of the finances of the country.  I will complain, as any Minister will, when he holds the pursestrings very tight against me, but that is something which the Minister for Finance, as the custodian of the nation's purse, is bound to do.  He must exercise that care which is exercised by any good businessman or any person who is managing a household, but, knowing that he will do everything that is right and everything that the Government requires him to do, I am satisfied that, when we come to discuss the Budget of 1956, we will have had a prosperous year and, please God, our programme will be well on the way to fulfilment.</P>
    <P>I know that if we succeed in that the Opposition will not be too pleased because it will mean that they will be a long time in the wilderness.  The Leader of the Opposition spoke about the time when they would come back, but I suggest to him that his comeback will be a long, long trek and he will have a long wait before he arrives at the haven to which he looks forward.  I wish him the best of good health in his weary road, but I hope it will be as long as possible, so that the country will never again have to suffer the hardships which Fianna Fáil imposed on it.</P>

We are always prepared to take over the reins of Government, but we have never looked on being in Government as a haven.  Rather have we looked on it as hard work in the interests of the country and not as an opportunity to bask in the sunshine. That, however, is not the note on which I intended to speak in relation to this Resolution.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The same thing applies to speakers on the other side. I do not think the Minister for Defence said anything that we had not heard before, and quite a number of times before.  But there is an advantage to this extent, that one is enabled to review the general situation, to get the trend of all the speeches and see what Deputies of the different Parties are thinking and how they look on the Budget Resolutions as a whole.</P>
      <P>From the point of view of Deputies on this side, it simply is amusing.  I was trying to visualise what would be said on this side if we had introduced this Budget.  The 1953 Budget showed reliefs and the 1954 Budget showed further reliefs, but the then Leader of the Opposition, when speaking at column 1339 on 7th May, 1952, on the Budget which had just been introduced, a Budget similar to the Budget introduced a few days ago, said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I characterised last year's proposals as severe, hard and unjust because they were unnecessary.  The phrases that I used then apply with all the more force to the present financial proposals of the Minister for Finance.  They are all the more cruel, they are all the more unnecessary because they are still more unnecessary this year than they were last year.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>In what column is that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already quoted the column&mdash;it is column 1339 of the 7th May.  We were castigated by the Leader of the Opposition on that occasion because we did not go all out to do what he said, to amend the damage done in the Budget of the previous year.  Yet the Minister for Finance merely continues on the same strain which was shown in the Budget of 1953, and continued in 1954 in a Budget which was claimed to be a great Budget by all concerned.  It is a <Col N="1572" /> pity, if we are to apply the real test to this question of estimating whether promises were made or not, that members who support the Government, the various Coalition Parties, did not think, for a moment, of making the same speeches at the cross-roads as they are making on this Budget.  Is there one of them who has any doubt where he would be to-day if he had spoken in the same strain?  It is not a question of anybody denying that promises were made or not made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>Or threats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Or threats.  An old man to whom I had given a lift on my way to Dublin told me: &ldquo;I voted for them because they came in and told me they would bring down the cost of living.  They did not do so, and now they are telling us that no promises were made.&rdquo;  It is men such as he who will eventually say whether promises were made or not.  It is immaterial whether or not the Government get up in this House and say that they did not make promises.  The man or woman who gave a vote did so in the belief that what was said at the cross-roads was meant.  They are the persons who will tell you, in no unmistakable manner, when the opportunity presents itself, whether promises were made or not.  When we take up the reins of office&mdash;and we do not look forward to it as being a very pleasant job&mdash;the job will be tackled in the proper manner, as it was on many occasions before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened to him with much interest, because the Minister for Defence dealt mainly with the points made by the Leader of the Opposition when he was speaking.  Shortly before that, I was listening with interest to the speech made by a Deputy who is supposed to be representing the farmers in this House.  Deputy Beirne, from Roscommon, spoke at great length on the Budget and he is the Deputy who is quoted as saying that he could not see a single ray of hope in the last two Budgets.  But in every line of his speech&mdash;if you read the Official Report next week&mdash;you will find that he congratulated the Minister for Finance, and one would almost have <Col N="1573" /> thought that he was calling for his canonisation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Beirne actually complained to the House about the neglect of Fianna Fáil in the ground limestone scheme during the three years they were in office.  He said there was a reduction in quantity.  Is Deputy Beirne seriously representing the farmers, or is he not?  Everybody knows there was an increase.  Where is the point in a Deputy, proposing to represent the farmers in this House, making such a statement, when we are supposed to keep as close as possible to the facts, and not mislead the people who sent us here to represent them? Where is the point in making such a statement which, I am sure, every Deputy of average intelligence knows is not true?</P>
    <P>In the next breath he compliments the Minister in relation to the figures of emigration.  He did not read the answer to a question I asked last week about emigration to countries, other than Great Britain.  It would stagger him.  To confuse the issue, he put in the figures of emigration from Britain to America.  As everybody knows, there is full employment in Britain, and emigration from there to America is negligible, if it at all exists.</P>
    <P>The farmers' Deputy tells us that the Budget is a good one, but he does not make the slightest attempt to show us what is in it for the farmer.  Personally, I see nothing in it for the three most important sections of the community: the worker, the farmer and the industrialist.  Have they got a single penny of relief in the Budget? Has any one of these sections got anything?  Yet we are told that it is to be the instrument on which the financial stability of the country is to be built.</P>
    <P>I fail to see, as many Deputies suggest, how a reduction of tax on tractors bringing milk to the creameries is a great concession.  I hope it is a great concession.  I should like to know the number of people who are affected.  If the Minister wanted to give a concession worth giving to people who have tractors, I would have liked to see him do something for <Col N="1574" /> the people of the Gaeltacht and the undeveloped areas, where tractors are almost the sole means of bringing turf from the bogs, and where you cannot bring home your neighbour's turf without running the risk of being fined. I would have liked to see the concession extended to those people, because, when bog roads become so impassable, one can always draw out turf by tractor and trailer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>Why did you not tell that to Deputy Smith?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>How do you know I did not tell it to him?  If you read my speech made not so very long ago, you will find that I made it very clear. I say now that we will agitate until we get that concession.  I believe we are just as well entitled to it as are those few people who take their neighbours' milk to the creamery on tractors.</P>
      <P>I drive through the country every week and so do other Deputies.  We drive through in the morning, when milk is being collected for the creameries.  I drive through Fermanagh over which, unfortunately, we have no control, and Cavan.  I could count on the fingers of one hand all the tractors I have seen, from Donegal to Dublin, collecting milk in the morning.  I doubt if one could see more than two or three.  I am afraid that is a concession which is more window-dressing than anything else.  It may be a benefit to people in counties such as Limerick and other counties.  If a concession were to be given, I should like to see it given for the haulage of turf in the neglected counties, from which people are fleeing in increasing numbers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Beirne referred to the one thing for which he said he was most thankful and grateful to the Minister for Finance.  Deputy Beirne said that the Minister had given him an opportunity, as a candidate in the local government elections, to get up on a platform and tell the people that the Government has done something wonderful, and that, as a result, he could foresee every local authority in Ireland getting rid of Fianna Fáil representatives. <Col N="1575" /> He was not very relevant at times.  The only thing he could think of when he mentioned the great victory he anticipated&mdash;of course, it was wishful thinking&mdash;was the reply of the Leader of the Labour Party at their conference in Limerick, who bemoaned the fact that powers were not really being given back to the local authorities in the Bill before the House.  I am not going to discuss that Bill now, of course.  The reason why the Labour Party did not go all out to support the extra powers was, according to the reply, that Fianna Fáil would control the county councils.  It was only giving power to the Fianna Fáil council. That is the real fault behind the mind of the Opposition.  They are beginning to realise that their past is creeping up on them.  The first effects will be evident in the results of the local government elections.  We have no doubt whatever about that.</P>
    <P>Every Deputy opposite was loud in stating that promises were not given. The Minister for Defence talked about going through some areas through which canvassers had passed.  He insinuated that somebody threatened somebody.  I went canvassing to as many houses as any other Deputy. Whom did I meet?  You met the housewives who said that the others were there last night and that they were going to reduce bread, butter, tea, sugar and the pint.  Of course, that did not mean anything as they were only trying to cod them.  In West Donegal they did not believe you.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry if I used the first person.  With regard to the promises, the Ministers occupying the Front Bench and the Deputies behind them tried to gloss over them by merely saying that they did not promise anything. Then they insinuated that they did make promises but were going to implement them over a long number of years.  That attitude is reminiscent of a certain American general who promised the parents of America that the boys would be back from Korea at Christmas.  When they were not back the general said he did not say which Christmas.  That is the attitude of the Government supporters.  They made promises but did not say when they would be fulfilled.  I suppose that before this century is out they will claim they fulfilled the promises.</P>
      <P>Let me quote Deputy Giles on the question of taxation with which he was quite satisfied this year.  This is what he said when we only slightly eased the situation in regard to taxation. I quote from column 1703 of the Official Debates dated 12th May, 1953: &ldquo;This country could have the taxation reduced by £15,000,000 in one year without doing a bit of harm.&rdquo;  As a matter of fact, it would do a lot of good.  Deputy Giles goes on to say: &ldquo;There are too many drones getting big money and giving no return.&rdquo;  I do not know whom he meant when he referred to the drones but I venture to say that the same drones who were referred to by Deputy Giles would still be droning.  Nothing has been done about wiping out the £15,000,000 taxation which Deputy Giles said could have been wiped out so easily.  Everything in the garden is rosy now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That only leads one to the conclusion that everything Fianna Fáil does is wrong and everything Fine Gael does is right.  When cattle prices were favourable last year, that was due to the 1948 Agreement but if a slump had occurred it would have been due to Deputy Lemass and Deputy Walsh. That sort of thing might have been all right for the first years of the inter-Party Government but the people are getting sick and sore of it.  They are also getting politically intelligent.  I would strongly advise the other side <Col N="1577" /> of the House not to try the same tactics too often because they will not always work.  In fact, they may have used the same old thing once too often.  If the Minister for Defence had made the same speech in Longford or some other part of the country during the election campaign that he made here&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the people might have said that the General was becoming honest at last and they might have given him an increased vote but I guarantee that his Party would be sitting over here.  Those opposite may ask themselves whether they made promises or not but, as Deputy de Valera said, there was not much wrong with the Budget in so far as it maintained the trends of the Fianna Fáil Budget but it was far from what the public expected having regard to what was promised to them before the election.  Nobody knows that better than the present Minister for Defence.</P>
      <P>We are satisfied that the debunking of the old system as a result of the Minister's performance is better than all the speeches we could make in defence of what we had to do during those three years.  It speaks louder than anything we could have said at the cross-roads, in the Press or through any other medium.  The Opposition have now vindicated everything that was done by Fianna Fáil in their three Budgets over the past three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TadhgManley" hpid="Mr. Manley Mr. Manley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manley</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, I should like to compliment the Minister for Finance on this his first Budget.  Any Minister coming here under present conditions and giving remissions and reliefs without increasing taxation must get the plaudits of the people. The present Minister for Finance under difficult circumstances came along and gave reductions and reliefs to the extent of £4,250,000 without any increase whatsoever in taxation.  That is not to be sneered at.  I think it is a feat in itself.  He is to be complimented with his colleagues for having <Col N="1578" /> shown a real earnest effort to bring this staggering annual bill into line with the circumstances of the people and with the nation's requirements.</P>
      <P>There are many who may be disappointed in the Budget.  There are some who are disappointed because in the Budget of 1948 certain major concessions were given and certain taxes which had been imposed in the Supplementary Budget of 1947 were remitted. Bearing that fact in mind, people naturally assumed that greater things could be done now, too; but, under all the circumstances, the present Budget is a good Budget.  It is a prudent Budget and it is a fair Budget.  It is possibly as good as any Budget that could be brought in here under present circumstances.</P>
      <P>So far there has been very little objective speaking on this Budget.  For hours Deputies on the opposite benches have satisfied themselves with quoting extracts from speeches made in the last general election, intended to prove that certain statements were made and certain promises given.  These quotations have been effectively dealt with by the Taoiseach, by the Tánaiste, by the Minister for Defence to-day and by other speakers during the past three weeks.</P>
      <P>So far there has been very little objective thinking in connection with this Budget.  Indeed, had there been some objective thinking, we would not have found ourselves compelled to listen to these extracts from newspapers; speakers here would have dealt with the Budget and with the Budget alone. The extraordinary thing is that several of the Opposition speakers&mdash;Deputy Vivion de Valera last week, Deputy Carter, Deputy Bartley and several others&mdash;said at the outset that they were not criticising the Budget. Deputy Vivion de Valera said it was a sound Budget, sound in principle. Despite that frank admission that the Budget was a sound one, Deputies on the opposite benches devoted hours to quoting extracts which bore no relation at all to the matters at issue here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We on these benches have been accused of breaking promises.  People cannot be accused of breaking promises until such time as they have failed to <Col N="1579" /> use every opportunity that comes their way to reduce the cost of living.  Surely in the last 11 months the present Government has seized on every opportunity to make life easier for our people?  The present Government restored the subsidy on butter in order to relieve consumers generally throughout the Twenty-Six Counties.  The restoration of that subsidy cost the State £2,000,000.  The present Government dealt with the tea situation in a very ingenious way so that the repercussions of the international situation would not affect the stability of price here and would not impose an added hardship on our people.</P>
    <P>I think the Government are to be complimented on that.  The Government dealt with the bank rate very effectively for the first time in our financial autonomy.  There is not a businessman in the country who would not have been adversely affected in his business had the bank rate followed the increase in Great Britain.  All these things are signs of the Government's watchfulness, earnestness and determination to look after the vital things that matter so much in the lives of our people.  In this Budget they have shown the same sense of reality and the same determination to save our people from unnecessary hardships.</P>
    <P>What the cost of living is or what it will be is not the important point: it is what the cost of living would have been had there not been a change of Administration.  The people on the Opposition Benches should not talk about broken promises.  Did they not, with fire and fury, go up and down the country at one time saying that taxation could be reduced by £1,000,000? Did they not say that no man here was worth more than £1,000 per annum?  Did they not say they would bring back the exiles to take up the employment they would create here under their administration?  Have they not fallen down on all those promises?</P>
    <P>I made no promises, but I came in here convinced that we would do better for the country, a country which has been bled by emigration and lost the flower of its manhood and <Col N="1580" /> womanhood over the last 30 years. These are sad reflections, but we cannot cure our present ills by dwelling on them.  We must apply ourselves to the task that confronts us with earnestness.  We must get rid of this political ballooning across the floor of this House.  There are major problems to be solved.</P>
    <P>I have always had the feeling that there is a tendency here to look at Ireland as if Dublin constituted Ireland.  Anyone travelling through the city here must come to the inevitable conclusion that this country is living in the lap of luxury.  Go down to the South and the West and go into the remote rural areas and see there the cheerless homes and the comfortless firesides.  One becomes very disillusioned indeed.  Go into our provincial towns and villages.  What does one find?  Decayed buildings and tottering edifices of the past.  Kinsale, in my own constituency, is one of the most historic towns in the life of this nation; it has lost half its population over the last 30 years.  Go into Kinsale to-day and one finds deserted streets, empty homes and tottering buildings.</P>
    <P>These are not happy reflections and, when we talk here about our industrial progress, let us remember that while progress has been made&mdash;all credit to those who have contributed towards that progress&mdash;at the same time one must admit that 100,000 workers have left the land in recent years.  The overall picture is not as bright as might appear at first glance.  Our people are still continuing to leave the land. Dublin has grown at the expense of the countryside.  I hope the present Government will make a really determined effort to try to bring about some measure of decentralisation so that the people in the rural areas will have an opportunity of getting employment in close proximity to their own homes.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his opening statement talked about capital development and many references have been made since in the course of the debate to capital development.  It is a wise policy to encourage our own people to invest their money in local enterprises.  In former days when we were ruled by <Col N="1581" /> a foreign power those who had money to invest invested it in British securities.  Now the Irishman with money has an opportunity of showing his loyalty to his own land.  Money should be provided for capital development and I think myself that we ought to be drawing near finality in our capital programme and therefore the need for these recurring loans should in time become obviated and we will not pass on to posterity a load of national debt.</P>
    <P>I think this State has far too costly a set-up.  I believe that this House is a bit unwieldy.  Numerically it is too large.  I would reduce the strength of this House by at least one-third in the interests of efficiency and economy.  We would then have a Parliament more in keeping with our requirements and we would not have this top-heaviness we come up against so often here.  Now that the Minister is applying his pruning shears, cutting our waste and cutting our extravagance of all kinds, I hope that he will go a little further.</P>
    <P>We have in this State an Institute for Advanced Studies.  I have not seen one result of any kind from that institute, an institute which is costing the taxpayers a princely sum each year.  I hope he and his colleagues in Government will consider this matter and take the appropriate action to save the taxpayers that sum and divert the money saved to some other more useful purpose.  I have my doubts about the Irish newsagency, and whether the expenditure on it is wise or not.</P>
    <P>We have an Irish Navy.  I have a great respect for our Army and Navy but in the modern set-up of world conditions, with the hydrogen bomb developed to the present stage, I cannot see for the life of me if we had a warship in every port in this country and if every port was from the naval point of view mechanised to the greatest possible extent how it would give us immunity in war or from war, and I do not see why money spent on the Irish Navy could not be spent on providing houses for our people or in some project to develop this country so that the people would have employment here at home.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1582" /> I do not know what is the policy of the present Government with regard to the new agricultural institute.  I do tender this remark&mdash;I hope the Government will not be so foolish as to embark on building a central institute here.  The last generation of Irishmen fought hard and long for a national university.  We have that national university now and we are proud of it.  We have in the constituent colleges of the national university men of international repute capable of handling that institute.  I see no reason why the institute in its entirety could not be handled by the three constituent colleges of the national university.  One of them could deal with research in seeds and manures, another with live stock and breeding and another with diseases of cattle. These different research bodies could be co-ordinated under a central committee, detached entirely from the Department of Agriculture, a committee set up by people who are interested in agriculture, and worked in collaboration with the national university.</P>
    <P>I have great confidence in this Minister, as a man of courage, ability and youth, and, if he can give the same record of service after another 12 months as he has given on this occasion, I believe we can look forward with optimism to a better building up of our finances while the taxpayers will be relieved from some of their obligations and allow more money to be provided to advance this country agriculturally and industrially.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Defence, in the course of his speech, proved one thing at least&mdash;that as a story-teller he has few equals.  He told us a few stories&mdash;I do not know that they were very relevant to the discussion but they were interesting to hear. He told us one story of how he entered a particular home in his constituency and was told the hair-raising story of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Government having been there before him and telling the people what would happen to them if they did not vote for Fianna Fáil.  I was rather surprised to hear him repeating that story because it is hoary.  We had the same <Col N="1583" /> story told to us in almost the same words about a former Coalition Minister and a former Parliamentary Secretary.  These stories are told&mdash;I do not know why, perhaps to show how wrongly the Party to which the speaker is opposed is acting.</P>
      <P>Having told us the story he went on to regard himself as a prophet.  He told us that we would never again be on the benches from which he was speaking.  I have a very clear recollection of Deputy Morrissey, who was then Minister for Industry and Commerce, making almost the same prophecy and, strange to say, in not too long a period after he had made that prophecy we found ourselves back on the benches from which Deputy Morrissey spoke.</P>
      <P>The Minister held up the poster or large advertisement with Fianna Fáil promises which were made in 1932.  I think that was an unhappy thing for the Minister to have done because everybody who takes an intelligent interest in the affairs of this nation knows that the advances of this nation began in 1932.  The industrialisation of the nation followed the election of 1932.</P>

      <P>Advances in tillage started after 1932.  The various social services which exist to-day, and which are being operated by the present Ministers on the benches opposite, were established in 1932, or from then onwards.  The shackles which connected this nation to the sister isle were broken after the 1932 election.  I think it was a very unhappy thing for the Minister for Defence to have introduced that particular advertisement because I believe everyone who knows anything about the affairs of this nation knows that every promise that was made in that advertisement was carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last speaker was rather annoyed about speakers from this side of the House reminding Deputies who are behind the Government of the promises which they had been making in the <Col N="1584" /> course of the last election.  He objected very strongly to the quotations which were being read out by members from this side.  I presume that his objection arises from the fact that he is a new member and that he has not the experience behind him that most of us have.  We know that for years and years, more years than we care to look back upon, the same attitude has been taken by whichever side was discussing the merits or demerits of the case before the House.</P>
    <P>Before concluding, he entered into the sphere of telling us about what we should do in regard to defence of the nation.  He said he had a great admiration for the Army and also for the Navy, but he could see no use for either one or the other, although he had this admiration for them.  I want to remind him and other Deputies that the Naval Service was never intended to throw back an invasion such as the Deputy spoke about, but its main purpose is to develop the skill of our countrymen in the art of seamanship. I think the Deputy must have forgotten that we are an island race and that we should have in this country one of the finest maritime services of any nation in the world.  Yet, we probably have the poorest.  There are inland nations in Europe with mercantile marines, while we at this stage are only endeavouring to build up one. The Naval Service is intended&mdash;we hope it will achieve that intention&mdash; to provide skilled seamen to man the merchant vessels which we hope we will have here in greater numbers than at present.</P>
    <P>It is more than interesting to hear the various excuses and the arguments that are being put forward by the members on the Government Benches as to why they were unable to carry out to the full in this Budget the promises they had been making in the course of the last general election.  The excuses vary from: &ldquo;Give us a chance&rdquo; to &ldquo;We are only ten or 11 months in office&rdquo; and so forth.  In normal circumstances, these would be legitimate excuses but the circumstances in which they were made were far from being normal.  The object, at the time, was to get rid of Fianna Fáil at any <Col N="1585" /> cost.  It did not matter how Fianna Fáil were put out; the thing was to get them out.  The campaign of misrepresentation of the Fianna Fáil Government plus the very rosy promises that were being made were the tactics that were considered most capable of carrying out that plan.</P>
    <P>We all know that the scheme of rosy promises glibly made began in the course of the two by-elections.  Apparently they succeeded to such an extent in the course of these elections that it was deemed very good policy to carry on that campaign in the course of the general election.  Not everybody went into the market and bid the high prices that the back benchers were bidding. It is interesting to note that amongest the Ministers were quite a few who did not make promises because, perhaps, they were appalled at the vastness of the promises being made by the back benchers and they decided to keep out of the bidding market.  However, it is also of interest to note that they did not take any steps to prevent their back benchers from continuing to make these promises&mdash;and, of course, the promises went on and on and on.  Now, when we remind the people on the Government Benches of these facts, the only thing we are told is that we have a brazen cheek to mention them.</P>
    <P>In the course of this discussion, we have heard quite an amount of talk about the Budget of 1952.  It might be no harm if we examined the situation which existed in respect to the Budget of 1952.  In May of 1948, as reported in volume 110, column 1053, of the Official Report, the then Minister for Finance, Deputy McGilligan, said it was impossible to &ldquo;view with equanimity a continued reduction in external assets on last year's scale. These assets can be consumed now only at the expense of a reduced standard of living for the future.&rdquo;  Just three months after that, the then Taoiseach&mdash;who is also the present Taoiseach&mdash;said that the adverse trade balance had &ldquo;gone to an extent which must cause anybody who thinks about it for one moment or who looks at the figures the utmost alarm for our economic and financial stability.&rdquo;  The <Col N="1586" /> reference there is Volume 112, column 2146, of the Official Report, and the statement was made in August, 1948.</P>
    <P>Although these causes for alarm were mentioned both by the then Minister for Finance, Deputy McGilligan, and the then Taoiseach, who is also the present Taoiseach, no apparent steps were taken to bring about any alleviation in that situation.  For all that, as far as one could see, the Minister for Finance was still wrestling with the difficulties which he had mentioned because in his Budget speech of 1951, as reported at column 1880 of the Official Report, Volume 125, he said: &ldquo;Deficits in the balance of payments cannot, however, be sustained for more than a short period&rdquo;. Further on in the same statement, he said: &ldquo;The present position on external account is by no means satisfactory, and if it continues to develop unfavourably the application of corrective measures will be called for.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We all know what &ldquo;corrective measures&rdquo; are.  Corrective measures are usually brought in as a last resort to bring about normality in something that has become abnormal.  Usually, as we all know, corrective measures hurt somebody.  They may hurt quite a large number of people but, in the ultimate, the majority will benefit. That is why I presume the Minister talked about corrective measures. Therefore, in addition to the reduced standard of living which was mentioned by the Minister, we had the threat of corrective measures.</P>
    <P>Again I want to emphasise that these corrective measures were mentioned in the Budget of 1951.  No action was taken because perhaps the time between the making of the statement and the date on which the Government went out of office did not permit it. However, they were promised but not taken.  It was left to Fianna Fáil in the 1952 Budget to introduce these corrective measures and to operate these measures which had been promised by the then Minister for Finance, Deputy McGilligan.  It is an extraordinary situation that, because men change from one side of the House to the other, the corrective measures which they themselves were advocating <Col N="1587" /> should become harsh and unjust and unnatural when operated by another group of individuals.</P>
    <P>I think it is dishonest for a group of men who have had the experience of Government for three and a half years, and who knew the full facts of the situation in respect to what the nation was facing, and advocating the introduction of corrective measures if certain things did not happen, to denounce the group of men who introduced and operated these corrective measures.  I am not one of those who will say that the present Budget is a bad one.  The only thing I shall say in regard to the Budget is that it is not the Budget that the Irish people were led to believe they would get if they put Fianna Fáil out and put the Coalition in.</P>
    <P>What I am going to say is this: it is proof, positive proof, of the fact that the system which the Fianna Fáil Government were operating, and which we were told was not a natural situation&mdash;we were told by the present Taoiseach that we were estimating for a sum of £10,000,000 unnecessarily&mdash;was an honest and just one.  Now the present Government know whether we were or were not overestimating.  If there was £10,000,000 to be expended surely it would be expended in this Budget, and I think it only goes to prove that the surplus which they were talking about then was but a mythical one&mdash;that it did not exist in fact but only in the minds of the individuals who were talking about it. We all know in actual fact that at the end of the year during which they were talking about an overestimation of £10,000,000 we did not get the revenue for which we had estimated&mdash;in other words, we were short of the amount.</P>
    <P>There is not a lot more to be said in regard to this Financial Resolution. I should like though to let my imagination operate for a few moments and I do not think it needs a very vivid imagination to picture the scene in the Council Chamber when the unfortunate Minister for Finance had to bring in the framework of the Budget which he was about to present to this House.  He naturally had to make the Government <Col N="1588" /> fully and clearly aware of what the situation was and I am pretty sure there were some very red faces among the members of the Cabinet when the Minister put the stark, naked facts before them and when they found that all the fat they were to distribute was not in fact there and that all the very rosy promises which had been made up and down the country, around about the cross-roads and in various other places, could not be fulfilled under any circumstances.  That is the situation.</P>
    <P>I say again it is not a bad Budget; but it is no better than the Budget we brought in in 1954.  In that year we gave reliefs in income-tax which cost £442,000; in stamp duty we gave reliefs amounting to £45,000; in the reduction of duty on matches the reliefs amounted to £21,000; there was a reduction in entertainment duty of £35,000; the reduction in the duty on beer was £350,000; and the reduction in bread and flour prices accounted for £900,000.  That, I do not think, was what anyone could describe as a bad Budget, but strange to say the Tánaiste did not think very much of it.</P>

      <P>I do not think the people complained very much about it. It was not on the Budget the people were asked to vote but on the promises which the Parties opposite were making.  Unfortunately the statements which they made were believed by the people.  It is sad to say that there are people still in this country, in fact quite a number of people, who believe the words of a public man when he stands up on a platform and makes certain statements.  Naturally, people believed that these promises, made with such harmony all over the country, were to be fulfilled.</P>
      <P>I am glad that the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Corish, is here, because I have a little extract from the Dáil Debates of a speech which he made in regard to the Budget to which I am referring, that is, the 1954 Budget.  The quotation is from Volume 145, column 725:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1589" />&ldquo;As far as we in the Labour Party are concerned, we propose to make it a bread-and-butter election.  As far as we are concerned, no matter what our position is in the Dáil, and no matter what our numbers are, we say that the prices of these essential foodstuffs must be reduced because the people in our own constituencies and the people whom we canvassed in the last three or four weeks are more concerned about the cost of living than they are about practically any other problem in the country.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that that last part of the statement is perfectly true.  It is also perfectly true that they are still concerned about the cost of living and that it has not been brought down, that, in fact, it is still rising.</P>
    <P>Proof of that is to be found in the statements which are being made by the various trades bodies which we can read from time to time.  I do not think anybody will say that we have control of these organisations or that we can influence their statements.  In fact, I think they are much closer to the Government than they are to Fianna Fáil.  Yet, either from pressure from behind or because they can see the dangerous trend which is operating in the continual rise in these prices, they are making these protests.  It may be no harm that these protests are being made.  They may, perhaps, make the members of the Government realise that the task of bringing down prices is not the very easy one that it appeared to be when they were sitting on Opposition Benches or when they were going down the country telling the people the fairy tales which they were then telling them.</P>
    <P>If nothing else happens, perhaps the experience which they will have gained as a result of the information which the Minister for Finance was able to give them and is perhaps continuing to give them as to the financial resources behind them will justify the price which was paid to get over there but the cost in the meantime will be somewhat heavy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. T.F. O'Higgins) Thomas Francis (Jnr.) O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. T.F. O'Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Budget debate is generally recognised as being the <Col N="1590" /> occasion on which Government policy is discussed and when the House is asked each year to express approval or disapproval of the policy being pursued by the Government.  It is, therefore, interesting to find in the debate on this Budget that the last speaker, Deputy Traynor, should have ended his speech by saying: &ldquo;This is not a bad Budget.&rdquo;  That, in effect, is the view of the Opposition.  They find it a Budget difficult to criticise because they realise that the Budget and the policy which is enshrined in it are acceptable to the people of the country.  Deputy Traynor, therefore, says that the Budget is not a bad Budget and in those few words we may sum up the Opposition attitude to the Budget.  Let the Opposition realise that the people outside will regard that expression of opinion as being pretty well the expression of opinion of the majority of the people of this country.</P>
      <P>This is a good Budget.  It is the first Budget of a new Government and it gives a very satisfactory account of the condition of the country.  The Minister in his Financial Statement dealt in detail, as is customary, with the condition of the country in the last 12 months and his statement in that connection shows that things are satisfactory and have been particularly satisfactory in the last quarter of the last calendar year.  As the Minister said, in the last quarter the balance of trade took a very dramatic turn in favour of this country.  While in the first nine months of the last calendar year the balance of trade was running against us to the extent of £5,000,000 more than in the previous year, nevertheless, the balance ended last year with close on £4,000,000 better than in the previous year.</P>
      <P>Also in his Financial Statement the Minister disclosed that the employment situation, again particularly in the last quarter of the last calendar year, has shown a very welcome turn for the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the date the Minister was speaking there were some 7,000 more employed. Unemployment has gone down by at least that figure and, of course, the figure would have been much higher then were it not for a current trade dispute.  That dispute has since been <Col N="1591" /> settled and it is welcome to note that unemployment is once again decreasing.</P>
    <P>In the last quarter of the last year the figure for employment in manufacturing industries reached 150,000 for the first time ever in the history of this country.  That also is a welcome feature which is disclosed in the Financial Statement and which is open for discussion here in this debate.</P>
    <P>Again, it appears from the Minister's review of the condition of the country that towards the end of the last calendar year business improved; more business was done by more people; more money was in circulation, revenue is more buoyant and generally things are looking up.</P>
    <P>These welcome conditions can be debated here by both sides of the House.  The Opposition, if one is to judge by Deputy Lemass's speech, would be only too anxious to say: &ldquo;Well, if things are good or have been good within recent months, it is all due to the hard work we put in.&rdquo;  I wonder would that be accepted by the country? Is there anyone in the country who would accept that the present reduction in unemployment, the present increase in business activity, are due or even partially due to the policy pursued by the previous Government from 1951 until June of 1954?  I think it would be very hard to get anyone to accept that statement.</P>
    <P>When we were in opposition, particularly this time last year, prior to the last election, we pointed out that there was an urgent need for a change of Government not merely to change the policy being pursued by the then Government but to restore a feeling of confidence amongst the ordinary people in the Government and in its policy. In the last Dáil, time and again the Opposition, with merit and justification, were able to point the finger of scorn across this House at the then Government and tell them that they had no mandate from the people to govern and that they were in office despite the wishes of the people.  We knew only too well that when the last Government was in office the ordinary <Col N="1592" /> people had no confidence in their ability to remain in office and placed no faith in the policy they said they were pursuing.  There was not a businessman or a farmer who could regard ministerial announcements up to 12 months ago with any seriousness because he never knew whether the man who was speaking as Minister would be even in the Dáil in a few weeks' time.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is anyone who could have any doubt that what was urgently needed in order to bring about the necessary change was, first of all, a general election, which we had just 12 months ago, and secondly, the election of a Government with a clear, definite policy and a Government backed by a strong majority in this House.  This change was attained last June and the new Government came in. Having announced a clear policy last June, they set about implementing each article contained in it.  The result has been in the last nine, ten or 11 months, that people know whether they agree with this Government or not, that the present Government is in office not for a few weeks or for a few months but just as long as they desire to remain there.  Accordingly, they know that Government policy is not merely a passing statement to suit passing conditions, but embodies the considered view of those who represent the majority of the people.  That has meant a restoration of confidence in the Government, in its ability and in the work it is setting out to do.</P>
    <P>It is not surprising, therefore, that things should have tended to improve under the stable conditions which this Government brought about.  In addition, last autumn the Government went to the people for a national loan and succeeded in raising the necessary money at a lower rate of interest than had been offered in the previous two national loans.  Indeed, the national loan of last autumn was over-subscribed and I think that in itself indicated that the investors in this country believed in the plans and the proposals being pursued by the Government. In any event it showed a definite feeling of confidence in the country and in its future and that also <Col N="1593" /> has helped in the turn of the tide which took place after the change of Government.</P>
    <P>In other ways in recent months this Government has shown its determination to carry out here a clear and definite policy.  There was a time when it was thought that whatever might be done in England by the British Chancellor of the Exchequer or the British Government would necessarily entail similar action here.  In fact, all of us can remember with some dismay the spectacle of Deputy MacEntee, as Minister for Finance in the last Government, trailing his coat in London prior to the introduction of the Fianna Fáil Budget of 1952.  Again in recent months our people have been satisfied in no uncertain way that whatever policy is followed here, whatever decisions are taken here will be shaped and conditioned by the circumstances of Irish life and will not be a pale pattern of what may be thought proper in England.</P>
    <P>All these circumstances have contributed to the feeling of confidence which I have mentioned and which the Government has engendered. Accordingly, the Minister for Finance has been able to introduce his first Budget with a worthwhile statement in regard to the condition of the country and has also been able to put before the House and the people proposals which are sound in themselves. The Budget is based on sound social values.  It has regard to the distressed sections of the community.  It has regard to the troubles of married people.  Without setting out to do anything extraordinary, this Budget gives relief where it is most needed. The old age pensioners, the widows, the recipients of orphans' pensions and the blind, all totalling 200,000 people, receive an increase.  Pensions are increased by 2/6 a week, a flat increase which will take place on every pension. That 2/6 has been referred to by some Opposition Deputies as if it were something slight or trivial.</P>
    <P>An attempt was made by Deputy Lemass, and probably by others, to sneer at that increase.  Just in case any other Fianna Fáil Deputy might <Col N="1594" /> follow in that line, it is as well to wave a red flag for him.  I cannot remember any Fianna Fáil Deputy who was in the House in 1952 being in any way sceptical of the effect of an increase in the old age pension of 1/6 a week, 1/- less than they are getting now.  That 1/6 was trotted around the House by Deputy MacEntee, as Minister for Finance, and by the other supporters of the Government, as being so magnificent a sum that it would compensate the old age pensioner for paying twice as much for his tea, for paying more for his bread, for his flour, for his butter and his super.  We were told that this 1/6 would compensate those unfortunate people for the impositions which in that Budget were being imposed on them.</P>
    <P>In reading over those debates, I was interested to come across a speech made by Deputy Lemass, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, in that Budget debate.  Here is what he had to say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is the Government's intention that simultaneous with the disappearance, in some cases, and the reduction in the case of flour and bread, of the subsidies and the operation of higher prices for these footstuffs, there will come into operation increased payments under all social welfare schemes.  The aim is to effect both changes simultaneously in the first week in July. The effect of the subsidy changes contemplated is, as the House has been told, to increase the cost of these foodstuffs to each individual by approximately 1/6 per week.  In July, because of the higher rates of benefit which will become operative when the Social Welfare Bill is passed, all persons who are out of employment and in receipt of unemployment insurance benefit or of national health benefit, or who are widows or orphans, will be very much better off than they are now. The additional payments they will receive will very substantially exceed the additional charges they will have to meet.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is taken from Volume 130, column 1297.  There is Deputy Lemass as a Minister in a Fianna Fáil Government <Col N="1595" /> that was taxing foodstuffs on the one hand and giving 1/6 to old age pensioners on the other hand.  It is interesting to compare that statement by Deputy Lemass, that the additional payments will very substantially exceed the additional charges they would have to meet in the way of paying more for tea, butter, flour, sugar and bread, with his statements in this debate.  He wanted to criticise the effect of 2/6 for old age pensioners and speaking in this debate at column 1298 he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The point I want to emphasise is that bringing the old age pension to 24/- is only restoring the purchasing power which it had in 1952.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Bringing it three years later to 24/-, according to him, is only restoring to the old age pensioner what was pillaged from him in 1952.  Where is the reason or the logic or the common sense in that kind of approach?  As a Government Minister, speaking from this side of the House, he was trying to convince the people, the aged, the blind and the widowed, that although they were paying more for essential foodstuffs, 1/6 made them better off.</P>

      <P>Now we have the position&mdash;Deputy Lemass in Government, Deputy Lemass out of <Col N="1596" /> Government, different speeches but bluffing all the time.  Over here, 1/6 was enough; over there, 2/6 is merely restoring what he and his Government took from the old and the distressed people.  That kind of an approach may be amusing and interesting.  It may convince Deputy Kennedy and Deputy Davern, but it does not convince the people.  We all would very much like to have been able to provide more in the pension increases, but I am satisfied that the people appreciate what has been done.  The 2/6 per week which the old age pensioner is getting from this Government is something he would not have got had a change of Government not taken place last June.</P>
      <P>Let there be no mistake whatever about that, because Deputy de Valera let the cat out of the bag on 13th October last.  Speaking at the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis, Deputy de Valera said that any increase in social services would be dangerous.  He was referring apparently to some suggestion that the Fianna Fáil Party should advocate an increase in social services and he stated that, in his view, any increase in social services would be dangerous. His exact words were:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The means must be there to meet increases in social services.  Otherwise, the whole nation would be crippled.  Taxation is now running at a very high level and any increase in social services would be dangerous.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That was Deputy de Valera, speaking as Leader of the Opposition in October, 1954, only some seven months ago.  I think it gave a fair indication to the old age pensioner, to the widow pensioner and the blind pensioner that, had there not been a change of Government 12 months ago, there would have been no increase in the pension of 2/6 or anything else.  It is worth reminding Deputies of matters such as those I have mentioned.  An increase in the old age pension is a worthwhile increase and it is something which the people would not have got if a change of Government had not taken place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Putting that increase side by side with some of the things said during <Col N="1597" /> the last election, as Fianna Fáil have tried to do in the course of this debate, a very interesting position is discovered. The Tánaiste, when speaking here, referred to this cartoon and I am going to refer to it again because it is well worth reminding the people of the kind of propaganda that we had to fight during the course of the last election.  In the <i>Sunday Press</i> of May 9th, 1954&mdash;I hope Deputy Davern will keep his cackling until I am finished&mdash;there is a cartoon headed &ldquo;Back to 1951&rdquo; and underneath it: &ldquo;To the people: Don't cut a rod to beat yourselves.  This means to cut wages by 12/6 and to cut the old age pension by 4/- per week.  Don't cut a rod to beat yourselves.  Vote Fianna Fáil.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Will Deputies opposite remember that cartoon now when the old age pension goes up to 24/- a week, instead of being cut by 4/- to 17/6?  What brain decided on this cartoon?  What dirty mind was behind it, because it is only a dirty mind would suggest to the unfortunate distressed people of the country that putting Fianna Fáil out meant a reduction in the old age pensions?  I am quite certain that very shortly many people who might have been codded by reading this &ldquo;Sunday Smile&rdquo; as they call the <i>Sunday Press</i> will remember that cartoon when next they are asked to vote for Fianna Fáil candidates.</P>

      <P>There were a few other interesting things said in <Col N="1598" /> this debate which illustrate the different kind of clothes, the different kind of words that Fianna Fáil Deputies use when they go to the right-hand side of the Chair.  I was interested to read Deputy Lemass's views on the price of bread in 1955 compared with his attitude towards the staff of life in 1952.  Speaking at column 831 of the Official Debates of 5th May this year, Deputy Lemass said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In my view&mdash;and I will admit it is probably a personal view&mdash;whatever money the Government can make available for subsidies can be best applied to lowering the price of flour and bread.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is a wonderful reflection from the deputy-leader of a Government who put up the price of the 2-lb. loaf by 50 per cent.  In 1952, no considerations of how important bread and flour were to the poor people prevented the price going up but, out of office, Deputy Lemass can make a speech about how important bread and flour are and state that, in his opinion&mdash;a personal one, mind you&mdash;the Government would be better served by using any money available to reduce the price of bread and the price of flour. Again, I do not know whether that kind of approach or that kind of sentiment will convince any Deputy.  It certainly could scarcely convince people outside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the course of the debate, Deputy de Valera, the Leader of the Opposition, made some references to what he called promises cynically made by members of the present Government and he proceeded to suggest that we had in some way played false with the people.  It is difficult to sit quietly here and listen to that kind of ráiméis. One would imagine that Deputy de Valera came into this House only yesterday, that he has no recollection or experience of recent years in this country. When he talks of promises being cynically made and disregarded, does he remember his own promises to the Irish people published by him over his own signature, that, if he were elected as Government in 1951, he would maintain existing food subsidies, and keep the price of food cheap for the <Col N="1599" /> people of this country?  Does he forget that?</P>
    <P>Does he not remember the famous point 15 of his 17-point policy published in the newspapers over his own signature, prior to the formation of the last Government?  What kind of cynicism or lack of memory compelled the ignoring of that promise only nine months later?  Does he remember Deputy MacEntee's promise given in the course of the election of 1951, that, if Fianna Fáil were elected, no one need worry about beer, tobacco and spirits being taxed again, because it would not happen?  What happened to that promise?  Was it made cynically, was it made sinfully, was it ignored cynically, or was it broken sinfully? When Deputy de Valera comes in&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I think it is always pleasant to have Deputy MacEntee in a debate like this.  He always gives material for discussion, in any event.  I think the people of this country appreciate what has been done by the Government, and also the policy which it is pursuing.  I should like to hear references to the promises made on behalf of this Government, but I should particularly like to hear references being made by the Deputies sitting opposite, because we stand over every single undertaking given on behalf of this Government.  The people need not have illusions about it.</P>
      <P>This Budget fulfils part of the policy contained in the 12-point programme. The very fact that it does is the surest intimation that every other point in that programme will be fully implemented.  I would suggest to the Fianna Fáil Deputies that they should keep on reminding the people of what this Government stands for, and if they keep on doing that, they will dig their political graves deeper and deeper and deeper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was made to a speech by <Col N="1600" /> the present Taoiseach in the Budget debate of 1952, when he suggested that there was probably over-taxation of about £10,000,000.  I will not go into the details of that, but I wonder was the present Taoiseach so far out when he made that statement three years ago?  There has been no additional taxation in three years.  The taxation imposed in that Budget of 1952 provides to-day the revenue necessary to run this State.  Deputy Lemass and other Deputies suggested that the Minister for Finance had available to him in this Budget the sum of £2,000,000 which he could dangle and disperse as he wished.  The Minister in this Budget not only provides £1,000,000 of increased social services and income-tax reliefs, but also continues the butter subsidy of 5d. per lb.  The reduction in the price of butter is continued this year, and it is costing £2,000,000.  Apparently there is a difference of opinion in this House as to whether that is the proper thing on which to spend £2,000,000.  Deputy Lemass suggests perhaps that it is not. In any event, it appears clear that butter is to-day 5d. per lb. cheaper than it was last year, because last year the people changed the Government.</P>
    <P>I should like to know if, by any fearful catastrophe, Fianna Fáil were to become the Government next week&mdash; I think it was Deputy Traynor who was whistling to keep his courage up a while ago, when he said it was not impossible&mdash;would they continue the butter subsidy in order to provide it at 5d. per lb. cheaper than it was when they were last in office?  It would be interesting to know that, because, if they would not do it, what is the sense in saying in this debate that the Minister applied the £2,000,000 wrongfully in order to reduce the price of that commodity by 5d. per lb., and that he should have used it for something else? In order to reduce the price the Minister had to provide £2,000,000 accordingly, once he was committed to that, as this Government is.  There was, in fact, no £2,000,000 available to him.</P>
    <P>I should like, before I conclude, to make a reference to the provision in the Budget relating to health insurance. As Minister for Health, I am <Col N="1601" /> naturally pleased to be able to welcome that particular provision.  I think there is a worthwhile development in this country along the lines of health insurance.  I regard that portion of the Budget as rich in social significance.  I think it is a recognition by the Minister, and by the Government, of the idea of self-help as being an expression of man's personal honour and dignity.  No one can doubt that we need, and always will need, a free medical service, or a partially free medical service.  There will always be thousands and thousands of our citizens who are unable to provide for themselves, and to whom our society will owe a very clear obligation. But there are also very many thousands of people who are neither rich nor poor, who are in between, who have to struggle to get help to face considerable difficulties and who have to face them within their own resources.</P>
    <P>Those people are always tortured by the threat of serious illness or accidents. They are the classes not covered by the recent Health Act but who are as much entitled to help and assistance from the State as anyone else.  I think that, in relation to health insurance, if it is possible, as I believe it is in this country, it is important that people such as those should be encouraged by insurance to help themselves in making provision for illness to themselves and illness to their families.  This may appear to be a small provision in the Budget at the moment but I think it is a very significant part of the Budget&mdash;one which I hope will have significant consequences in the country.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil Deputies such as Deputy Traynor admit that this is not a bad Budget.  By doing so they, in fact, admit that the policy contained in the Budget is not a bad policy and that the Government which follows that policy and introduces the Budget is not a bad Government.  I think that the prestige of the Government in the country is high and is rising every day.</P>

Of course, they do not want an election.  Deputy Lemass said that.  Let there be no mistake about it.  It is clear that this Government is following a sound policy, doing it intelligently and building quietly but well.  It is backed by the confidence and the support of the people.  So long as it continues following its expressed policy it will continue to have that support in the country.  It is a change to the situation which obtained 12 months ago when not a Deputy in this House knew when the Sword of Damocles would fall.  It is a great thing to know now that you can all sit back over there and know you will be here for the next four years at least.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to commence by saying that this is the sort of Budget I expected.  I was wondering how the boys were going to get out from under it and I was rather amused at the excuses they endeavoured to find in order to do so.  At the start, I also would like to congratulate the Minister for Finance for at last finding a means of extracting income-tax out of the old farmer.  God knows he has been trying a long time.  Now, through a very simple act, every bag of wheat going into the mills next year will bear on top of it 12/6 tax for the Minister for Finance.  There is no doubt about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I heard the Minister for Health tell us a few minutes ago that <Col N="1603" /> they were going to honour every promise made by the Government I began to wonder.  I have here a document which states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Carlow-Kilkenny Constituency. The tillage farmer and his man and Fine Gael.  Wheat.  Fine Gael in 1948 gave a five year price guarantee for wheat.  The price fixed for this season is in accord with that policy and will be paid by Fine Gael.  Fine Gael, as a Government, will give another five year guarantee.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I wonder, when that little document was issued on behalf of the present Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Crotty, Deputy Hughes and the runner up, Mr. Fielding, whether the people knew that the Government was going to slash the price of wheat by 12/6 a barrel?  Mark you, they put it very cutely.  They said that the price fixed for this season was in accord with that policy and would be paid by Fine Gael and that Fine Gael, as a Government, would give another five year guarantee.  Through slashing the price of wheat by 12/6 a barrel the Minister for Finance is going to succeed in extracting from the farmers of this country £1,976,000 on wheat alone.  Not only that but the Minister for Industry and Commerce was going to come along and increase the income of the Government by increasing the price of offals by £4 10s. per ton.  That is another £450,000, so that the present Government have succeeded in the case of wheat and the by-products of wheat in collecting from the agricultural community practically £2,500,000.</P>
    <P>It has been generally recognised in this country&mdash;I have always heard it put forward as the main plank in Labour's platform&mdash;that any reduction in the cost of foodstuffs is to be passed on immediately to the consumer. Speaking on the Financial Resolution on the Budget on 3rd April, 1952, Deputy Norton, as he then was, stated that in future the people were going to pay 9d. for a 6½d. loaf, and he described that as outrageous.  Yet, those people on the benches opposite, who promised nothing, poor fellows, <Col N="1604" /> came along during the last election with this little leaflet, knocking at every door, and they showed the 2-lb. loaf that the Minister for Health was talking about a few moments ago at 6½d., under their régime, and at 9½d. under the Fianna Fáil Government&mdash;an implied promise that they were going to bring the loaf back to 6½d.  The last Minister for Finance gave a reduction of ½d. in the price of the loaf last year.  That reduction cost £900,000 and the Budget was called the ha'penny Budget because of that.</P>
    <P>I want to know now from the Minister for Finance why, in implementing the principle of a reduction in the cost of foodstuffs, he has failed to pass on to the consumer the £2,500,000 extracted from the agricultural community. Why has that not been passed on to the consumer in the price of bread?  It would represent a reduction of 1½d. per loaf.  It would not mean looking for any more money for subsidy and it would provide a very simple method whereby the Minister could pass on the reduction in the price of wheat to the man who is consuming the loaf.</P>
    <P>I am wondering what the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the other members of this mixum-gatherum Government are doing.  I wonder what they expected to do for the ordinary working-class person, over whom they were weeping salt tears, when they were knocking at the doors handing in this little leaflet at every house and saying: &ldquo;Look at the price of bread, Ma'am.&rdquo;  Now the Government has an opportunity of reducing the price of bread without costing anybody anything, except, of course, the unfortunate old farmer that the Government is robbing.  Will the Government pass on the benefit of that reduction?  I am astonished that not one Labour Party Deputy has argued here that the benefit of that reduction should be passed along to the consumer.  Where has this £2,500,000 gone?</P>

      <P>Deputy Tully would not be one bit interested in this because in <Col N="1605" /> County Meath they hardly know what wheat is.  Now that is the first thing I see wrong in this Budget.  What effect will that policy have on our principal industry?  Is there any policy there?  We were informed by the Minister for Agriculture that we have priced ourselves out of the egg market, out of the butter market and out of the bacon market; and, in case we might not be able to completely price ourselves out of the bacon market, the Minister for Agriculture gave permission to the Minister for Industry and Commerce to increase the price of the pig ration by £4 10s. per ton to bring in another little bit of income to the Exchequer.  That was the statement made here by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  If the Minister for Finance gets that opening speech and reads it he will find stated there that the Minister for Industry and Commerce expected to get £1,000,000 odd out of the reduced price for wheat to the farmer and he expected to get some more by increasing the price of offals.</P>
      <P>Let us look at the other side of the picture now.  The cost of living has gone up.  Every time anyone wants a rasher he has to pay a bit more for it and the old farmer has decided to get out of pigs.  I want to know from the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Crotty, how he justifies the statement he made to the farmers down in Kilkenny and the guarantee that he gave them.  At least poor Deputy Hughes went to a meeting and protested against a reduction in the price but I did not hear anything from the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Crotty, and I would like to hear something from him about it.  Is he quite satisfied to leave the poor dupes whom he assured solemnly that Fine Gael would give a guaranteed price for wheat for five years without a word? Is he quite satisfied to accept the price being slashed by 12/6 per barrel?  I would like to have a reply to that question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture assured us we had priced ourselves out of all three markets for our agricultural produce.  The Government, apparently, have decided that they will price us <Col N="1606" /> out of the grain market.  In the old days here we used to hear a lot about the land for the people and the road for the bullock.  The only leg the old farmer will have to stand on to help him keep his financial stability in the future is the price of the bullock.  That was always the policy of the Cumann na nGaedheal Government in the old days just as it is the policy of Fine Gael to-day.  What will be the result of it?  I do not know where the farmer will even get the old bullock because the bullock will disappear in time too.</P>
    <P>I was very interested in a statement made by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture.  Just before the last two or three Budgets I remember meeting some very cross people out at the gate.  The last time I met them they were looking for the Independent Deputies; they wanted to know what they were going to do about the price of the pint.  I have a little picture here of the pint with a nice lot of froth on the top of it; it was 10d. at one time; it is 1/2 to-day I know the promises that the people opposite gave and I know the reward for the promises in the shape of the cheque from the Licensed Vintners' Association.</P>
    <P>I happened to be out of this House when the Budget was introduced here, and when I was coming in I met the same poor little man with the pair of glasses on him outside the gate and I said to him: &ldquo;Tell me what kind of Budget was it?&rdquo;&ldquo;I do not want to hear anything about it,&rdquo; he replied.  I said: &ldquo;Tell me, what did they do with you?&rdquo;  He said: &ldquo;They did nothing for me in spite of all their promises.&rdquo;  And I said: &ldquo;That is the wages of sin.&rdquo; They were paid well for all those little pictures that we have here.  A lot of the money went into them.  There was that poor little man walking out and the old pint was still the same as it was the day before.  I saw people going into the pubs the day after the announcement of the change of Government and asking for the pint for a bob and kicking up the dickens of a row because they were not getting it. They wanted to know what was going <Col N="1607" /> to be done.  &ldquo;Were we not promised it?&rdquo; they asked.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;I say that the Minister to-night is sounding the last post for the brewing industry, one of the oldest industries in this country.  I can prophesy unemployment in the brewing industry.

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1608" />&ldquo;I can also prophesy that within 12 months from now the weeds will reach from jamb to jamb of country public houses, and in city public houses the hinges of the doors will have to be oiled, as they will be so infrequently used.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That looked very bad for the hopes of any Minister for Finance in this country and for the licensed vintners.  I thought that when the man felt that way about the industry the first thing we would see in the Budget, on which he appeared to be a distinguished adviser, would be that the price of the pint would come down.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I protest in the strongest possible terms on behalf of the unfortunate beer drinker, the man who loves his pint, and whom Deputy Cowan now hopes to prevent drinking that pint....  They are responsible for putting the 3d. on every pint consumed by these unfortunate men.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was the statement made by the Parliamentary Secretary on the 7th April, 1952, and one would imagine that the price of the pint would be the first thing that would be brought down, that surely they would give some little gesture, take 1d. off or make some move towards reducing the cost of the poor man's pint.  But, as I said, I met my friend going out sad and downhearted and four more like him, their throats like lime-kilns&mdash;Deputy Tully was interested in ground limestone the other day&mdash;and no hope of any reduction in the cost of reducing their thirst.  I want to know when these people say they make no promises&mdash; was this meant as a promise or what was the meaning of it?</P>

Now we are told that the 1952 Budget was an unjust Budget, that there was no reason for those taxes and that they should not have been imposed, that they were only imposed out of spite.  Those were the statements that were made here when that Budget was introduced. Now there is a complete admission that all those taxes were necessary and that no Government could reduce them or change them.</P>

      <P>I am not inviting interruptions. I am giving the facts as I see them.  The people are entitled to some explanation from the Government. I am very glad that when the Deputies opposite took office they found that every accusation they had hurled at Deputy MacEntee, as Minister for Finance, was false and wrong. Any little bit of sanity there was between them&mdash;and, God knows, there is not too much of it&mdash;leant to the view: &ldquo;We will have to do just as Deputy MacEntee did with his Budget.  We will have to allow those taxes to stand. The only relief we can give is in what we have ruined the agricultural industry to produce.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I have no intention of inflicting the rest of the items in this document on the Deputies opposite.  Sugar is marked down here at 4d. and at 7d.  I am not going to ask them when they are going to bring the price of sugar back to 4d.  I have not a notion of asking them that question&mdash;any more than they have a notion of bringing the price back to 4d.  However, it looks very well in the picture.</P>

      <P>This little promise, which was handed in at every housekeeper's door, was a very good little bit of propaganda.  I have no intention in the world of asking Government Deputies to tell us when they are going to reduce the price of cigarettes from 2/4 to 1/8, as was guaranteed in this promise which every voter in my constituency got.  However, I will give a guarantee here and now that the Minister for Finance will not do it in the four years he says he has ahead of him in office.  Similarly, I am not going to ask anything about tea.  God knows, the tea situation is bad enough. There is a whole list of items in this document.  I would advise Government Deputies to get a copy of this document and study it.  According as they come to each item, they can strike their breasts and say: &ldquo;Through my fault,&rdquo; and make an act of contrition for the bluff which they put over on the people of this country.</P>
      <P>Budget time is more or less a time of stocktaking&mdash;a time when we can look back and examine the position and ask ourselves where the country is heading.  In that respect, I should like to compliment Deputy Manley on the speech he made here this evening. It was his first Budget speech in this House and I think we could agree on a lot of the things which he said.</P>
      <P>The Government in this country is costing too much.  Some time ago, being interested in this matter, I asked a parliamentary question and I got some interesting information.  The information which I am now about to quote is to be found at column 8 of the Official Report of the 22nd April, 1952, Volume 131.  The number of civil servants in State employment on the 2nd January, 1939, was 26,775 and that number rose to 35,287 by the 1st January, 1951.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and give him the job of going through each Department with a view to finding out where the surplus stock is.  In my view, it would be of great benefit to this nation if that were done because I believe there is an undoubted surplus.</P>
      <P>On the 1st January, 1947, there were 31,179 civil servants in State employment. We all know that, at that period, we had rationing in this country and a large number of extra officials had to be employed on that work.  Those of us who had the misfortune to have to go over to Ballsbridge at that time to seek fair play for our constituents or anything that our constituents required could see a whole host of civil servants there. You would be inclined to wonder where the dickens they got them all. Rationing has ended but here is the joke: the number of civil servants rose from 31,179 on the 1st January, 1947, to 33,975 on the 2nd January, 1950. This country cannot afford that large number of civil servants.  I suggest there is room for retrenchment and for saving.  I also suggest that the Minister should investigate this matter.  I have been told: &ldquo;You cannot sack a civil servant because he or she is permanent.&rdquo; A simple and easy way of remedying the position would be to stop recruitment for a couple of years.</P>
      <P>To get further on the general line of the Budget, I stated here that in my opinion those people had not the slightest scruple and I still hold that they are over there by absolutely false pretences.  They did not confine it alone to the guarantees and promises they gave and the whispers they issued from the public platforms; nor did they confine it to the unfortunate old farmers.  It was not confined to that at all.  Those people had made a good drive in 1951 to continue to hold office and they were not above using their position then when only caretakers&mdash; when the Dáil had dissolved and when the Ministers were only there as caretakers waiting for their successors to go back&mdash;to throw a burden of something like £855,000 on the Exchequer and over £1,000,000 on the ratepayers of this country.  They had no hesitation in doing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1612" /> They came along at that time and wrote to the local authorities throughout the country telling them to increase the salaries of their employees by 12½ per cent.  These letters were sent out after the Dáil had dissolved in 1951.  Deputy Norton, the Tánaiste, started the ball rolling in the manner and in the fashion that you would expect from him.  He came along, having had a letter from the South Cork Board of Assistance in February, 1951, asking for some increases for the officials, and refused to grant that increase.  He said they were already granted and that their salaries were stabilised.  The Dáil dissolved on the 4th May and on the 7th May Deputy Norton changed his mind and issued a letter to the South Cork Board of Assistance ordering them not alone to pay the officials the 12½ per cent. increase but ordered that the men who were not entitled to it in February according to him were entitled to it in the previous November.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>He was Minister for Social Welfare and the cost of his letter alone was £500,000 to the ratepayers. It was followed up immediately by the Minister for Health at the time, the present Taoiseach.  He wrote another letter down.  He said to himself: &ldquo;Labour are not going to get all the votes from the officials; I am going to get my whack too&rdquo; and he wrote down after the Dáil had dissolved on the same lines and put another load on the ratepayers of this country.  This load, of course, meant something towards increasing the price of the pint.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He was followed up by the Minister for Local Government, Deputy Keyes, who was followed up in turn by every one of them.  All contributed towards <Col N="1613" /> imposing an extra burden of £1,200,000 on the ratepayers.  The actual amount of extra expenditure imposed on the Cork Board of Assistance was 1/8 in the £ on the rates.  These increases in pay were given by those Ministers when they were looking for the votes and support of the local authority employees.  They were prepared to buy these votes and did pay for them because each official of the local authorities had a gift from the Ministers the week before these officials went to vote.  They had six months' bonus in their back pockets, and God knows human nature is human nature.</P>

The Minister for Local Government could not find the exact sum that he had to pay.  In the case of the Minister for Education, £24,180 was the bill.  When I hear Deputies over there talking from time to time about bribery and corruption, I look at that and consider the price paid, put down in black and white in the Official Report, the price paid for even an attempt to get into power, the price they paid, after running out, in trying to get back.  At the last election they found that worked so well that they went off and told the civil servants: &ldquo;We will give you £1,000,000.&rdquo;</P>

I will give you now the reasons why I knew there would be no change in the Budget.  I knew because I had it here in question and answer in this House that whilst that mixum-gatherum was there on the last occasion they borrowed £74,000,000 to run this bit of an island for three and a half years.  I knew also, by question and answer in this House&mdash;they can find it in the Official Report&mdash;that whatever Government is in power, whether it is a Fianna Fáil Government, a mixum-gatherum Government <Col N="1615" /> or any other Government, they will have to find £7,000,000 every year to pay for the spree the boys had the last time they were over there.</P>

      <P>It was well worth the gamble to pay for shifting across the way.  When poor Deputy Tully goes down to Meath I am sure he will not say a word about the money that the County Meath boys had to pay for the first try of corruption in the shape of the purchase of Government officials.</P>

      <P>The purchase of Government officials&mdash;that is what it amounts to.  They ranged over the whole lot of them.  The county manager for Limerick got his whack a week before the poll. He got his six months' back money bonus and put it in his pocket and said: &ldquo;They were not a bad Government at all.  We might put them back&rdquo;. That is how it was done.  The nice little cheque came out and the boys took it.  Who would blame them?  A great number of years ago a man, by accident, got the wife's cheque for the geese.  He went out to the pub and had a right good day and a good bit of a night until it was all gone and then he said: &ldquo;What was it only goose money?&rdquo;  What is this only ratepayers' money?  It does not matter.  It is only ratepayers' money.  That is the way all those people got over there.</P>
      <P>I saw a bunch of nice respectable old ladies in Prince's Street calling on Deputy Tony Barry, looking for the 2/8 tea.  There was a regular procession of them there and they were going there for three weeks after the last election and poor Deputy Barry had to clear out, shop and all.</P>
      <P>Those things happen.  Those promises come home to roost.  I tell you, as an old campaigner for 30 years, I never make a promise that I do not keep.  Never.  Every promise I ever made I kept.</P>

Some couple of years ago we got a windfall, 84/- a barrel for barley, and the year we got the 84/-Messrs. Arthur Guinness and others applied to the Prices Commission and told them that because of that increase they wanted an increase of 1d. a pint on stout, and they got it.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.  I have better manners than the Ministers have.  The present price of malting barley is 57/6 which represents a reduction of 33 per cent.  I would suggest to the Minister that there he has an opportunity of reducing the price of the pint by 1d. and that he should take it, or has the Minister for Finance still his eye, as in the case of bread, on something in the line of excess profits that can be collected from the breweries?  The Prices Commission, on the grounds that the price of malting barley had been increased to 84/- a barrel, gave permission to the breweries to increase the price of the pint by 1d.  As I said, the price of barley is now down by over 30 per cent. and it is high time that the consumer was considered and that that reduction of 26/6 on barley that has been taken out of the farmers' pockets by Messrs. Arthur Guinness, with the assistance and collusion of the Minister for Agriculture, were passed back to the consumer in the shape of a reduction of 1d. on the pint of stout.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that is a wrong suggestion <Col N="1619" /> and my main reason for making it is that I have the utmost sympathy with the unfortunate people over there because of the position in which they find themselves.  I feel sorry for any poor devil who is found out.  I have enormous sympathy for the Minister who has to come in now, after all the statements that were made, and say: &ldquo;Deputy MacEntee was right in putting the 3d. on the pint.  Deputy MacEntee was right in what he did with regard to bread.  Deputy MacEntee was right in what he did in connection with sugar.  Deputy MacEntee was right in everything he did.  The only relief I can offer the people,&rdquo; and that is what the Minister is doing in effect, &ldquo;is to rob from the agricultural farmers and the tillage farmers, from the men who plough and give employment, £3,600,000 in 12 months.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>£400,000 on the feeding barley that the Minister for Agriculture reduced from 48/- a barrel to 40/-and £800,000 on the 200,000 tons that he expects to get, as he says, this harvest.  That makes £1,200,000.  Add that to the £2,400,000 you have in the wheat and offals.  I am sure the Minister could make that up, or the Parliamentary Secretary could help him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister knows where he stands now.  The farmer was bluffed by this document issued by the other Parliamentary Secretary, bluffed by the five year guarantee in the price of wheat. That made a Parliamentary Secretary out of Deputy Crotty.  One wonders whether another 12 months would not be too much of it for the boys over there.  You must remember that by those purchases that I have read out, the farmers are being bled in their rates to the extent of 1/8 in the £. You must remember that 50 per cent. of what should be a Government charge, namely, the disability allowance, has to be found by the home assistance authority and that sum, 10/-out of every £ paid in that allowance, has to come out of the ratepayers' <Col N="1620" /> pockets.  All these things mount up. Whilst the farmer could be in a position to pay, when he was being allowed a fair price for his produce, sufficient to cover at least his cost of production, this changed policy of the Government will leave him in a position where he cannot pay.</P>
    <P>Even in the beet crop we have a reduced acreage this year, even where we have a costed crop, where a farmer is sure of getting his cost of production plus some profit.  We have a Government afraid of their lives, that dare not publish the milk costings, because if they did all the dairy cows would be shipped out in the morning.  They dare not publish them, because they could not face an increased subsidy.  The costs of production, according to question and answer we got 12 months ago, were finished before the late Minister for Agriculture left office.</P>

      <P>I would like to go back to a subject I did not deal fully with a while ago.  I would like to know from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Oliver Flanagan, what became of the weeds that were going to choke up all the public-house doors and what effort he made in this Budget to do away with those weeds.  When he travels around the city &ldquo;pubs&rdquo; oiling the doors for them, because they cannot be opened, they are opened so seldom now after the increase in the price of the pint, I wonder he did not try to get rid of the annoying job he had of oiling the hinges&mdash;by reducing the price of the pint.  He is an honest speaker and I would like to hear something from him on this Budget, giving us the reason why he did not reduce the price of the pint.  We are entitled to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to hear something from <Col N="1622" /> Deputy Norton in particular, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, this man whose heart bled at the increase in the price of bread in 1952.  I would like to hear from the Labour Party as a whole on their main principle. They have always maintained that any reduction in the price of foodstuffs should be passed on to the consumer. I would like to know from them why the £2,500,000 that has been extracted from the farmer in wheat and offals has not been passed on as a reduction of 1½d. per loaf of bread. When will we hear that?  I would like some Labour Deputy to explain to us why they have not done it.  There could be improvements.</P>
    <P>The Government are getting the money&mdash;the old farmer is paying it.  It is just the same as the price of the pint a while ago, you can reduce the price of the pint by 1d.; you can reduce the price of bread by 1½d. a loaf, without it costing anybody anything, only the people you have skinned, the old farmers of this country.  You can reduce the price of bread by 1½d. a loaf without costing anybody anything, except the people you have skinned, the old farmers in this country, and I suppose that, when you look at some of them, you are inclined to say: &ldquo;The Devil mend them.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Crotty)</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened to the Leader of the Opposition this evening saying he was quite satisfied with this Budget and I was very glad to hear that, because he is a very responsible man.  I do not think anybody would pay as much attention to what the Deputy who has preceded me has said as he would to a statement by the Leader of the Opposition.  He has said he is quite satisfied with it.  The Fine Gael Party, of course, are quite satisfied with it; the Labour Party are quite satisfied with it; and Clann na Talmhan are quite satisfied with it. Therefore, the only people who can be dissatisfied with it are a few cranks and such people&mdash;people who would never be satisfied.  The Leader of the Opposition, as I say, gave his blessing <Col N="1623" /> to the Minister for Finance and to his Budget.</P>
      <P>For some weeks before the Budget was brought in, some of the principal speakers in the Fianna Fáil Party and particularly Deputy Lemass, said: &ldquo;We must wait until we see what the Budget is like before we know the policy of the present inter-Party Government.&rdquo;  I do not think there was any necessity to wait for the Budget to know the policy of the inter-Party Government.  The Budget has only confirmed that policy.  The present Government were in office scarcely a month when they showed what they wanted to do and how they were going to do it.  Their policy was a policy of improving the standard of living of the general public&mdash;not of any particular section&mdash;and they set about implementing that policy, in the first instance, by reducing the price of butter, by subsidising the price of butter to the consumer.</P>
      <P>I remember when I went out canvassing the main thing that most housewives asked me was: &ldquo;Whatever else you do, will you bring down the price of butter?&rdquo;  I said I was sure that if the inter-Party Government were returned, it would be brought down, and I am very glad it was brought down and in quite a substantial way.  From the point at which it was brought down last year, it meant £1,000,000 and this year it involves a cost of £2,000,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Likewise, as the year wore on, the price of tea became unsettled.  The price of tea in the markets increased very substantially and the increase would have been 1/8 a lb. and subsequently 3/4.  The present Government maintained tea at its original price and did not allow it to increase.  I have no doubt that if Fianna Fáil had been in office, judging by some of their speeches on this Budget, they would not have helped out the price of tea at all, but would have allowed it to soar.  We know what it is to let the price of a particular commodity go up and the effect which this has on the economic position of the country.  We know how hard it is afterwards to bring down a price that has been <Col N="1624" /> allowed to increase, and to increase as substantially as the price of tea has increased.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil policy while they were in office was a policy of making money scarce and dear.  We saw the result of their restriction of credit policy.  We saw it in the very streets of this city and at the gates of Leinster House when the streets of Dublin were full of unemployed, and when proportionately there was the same unemployment down the country.  That was the policy of Fianna Fáil&mdash;restriction.  No wonder that Government could arrive at a balance when they had all the workers in the country drawing their unemployment benefit, instead of being fully employed.  No wonder these people had a surplus in the matter of imports and exports when the people were not able to buy the food for their families which they would have bought had they been in full employment.</P>
    <P>That restriction of credit and the increase in interest rates meant that business to a great extent was practically closed down.  The building industry was very much hampered in that period and building operations even by the Department of Local Government very much curtailed.  In addition, there will be people paying for that Fianna Fáil policy in relation to the building trade and the increase of interest rates for the next 35 years. Anybody who raised a loan while that policy was being pursued by the Fianna Fáil Party will be paying the extra charges involved&mdash;possibly 5/- or 10/- a week&mdash;not for one year or two years, but for the next 35 years.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil saw then that the byelections were going against them and they decided they would have to do something, and so they brought in panic measures to create employment. They sent down panicky directives to the county surveyors asking them to send up plans overnight because they wanted to create employment&mdash;not constructive employment, but employment merely to absorb people off the labour market.  We saw these panic measures all over the country at that time.  The inter-Party policy is quite the opposite.</P>
    <P>The Minister floated his recent loan <Col N="1625" /> at a much lower interest rate than his predecessor, and when the bank rate went up in England twice this year, the Minister intervened and the result of his intervention was that the bank rate here was held.  What effect has that on the country, I wonder?  I do not think we realise the effect which the holding of the bank rate has on the country.  The normal person feels: &ldquo;This is not a thing for me to bother about.  Why should I bother about what the bank rate is?  What effect has it on me?&rdquo;; but that person does not realise that the rents of the houses built now will be affected for years to come by the rate of interest.  The person who is raising a loan to build a house will also be affected by it.</P>
    <P>There is no restriction of credit at present and the banks are not asked to withhold credit from the industrialists and the business people, whereas, in the old days, business people had to sell out stock because of pressure by the banks.  Now these people can maintain and enlarge their stocks and keep our factories going.  This is one of the most important precedents set in this country since we got our independence &mdash;the precedent of breaking away from the English bank rate&mdash;and had the inter-Party Government done no more than that they would deserve well of the people of Ireland.</P>
    <P>We had Deputy S. Flanagan saying here recently that 30,000 jobs a year were needed to provide work and to stop emigration.  Deputy Lemass was not so extravagant.  I saw speeches by him before the introduction of the Budget in which he said that 15,000 jobs per year were required.  Since we came into office we have reduced unemployment by 6,000 or 7,000.  In the quarter ended in December, there was the greatest number that was ever employed in Irish industry, 150,000 people. I was glad when the Minister stated that a greater number of people were engaged in agriculture for the first time in many years.  We in the previous inter-Party Government considered the whole problem month after month, and we were able to put 1,000 people into employment, an increase of 12,000 per year.  That was very nearly the estimate made by Deputy Lemass <Col N="1626" /> which would be required to stop emigration. I have no doubt that if the previous inter-Party Government could put 12,000 people per year into industry, we could do much more than that.</P>
    <P>The present Government is out to protect industries against dumping. The threat of dumping to our Irish industries is very bad especially if the goods dumped are produced in some country which has a lower standard of living than Ireland.  The Minister has given a guarantee to protect the textile industry.</P>
    <P>Likewise, the farmers have been guaranteed protection for their industry. They have been guaranteed a market this year for wheat, feeding barley and oats.  Last year we saw the results of Fianna Fáil policy in regard to agriculture.  We had a worse harvest last year than we had for many years.  We will have next August a surplus of anything from 60,000 to 80,000 tons of Irish wheat.  We had a surplus of wheat and a month after the harvest was gathered the millers had to go to the Minister for Agriculture to look for licences to import feeding barley.  In the same way, the oatmeal millers had to go to the Minister for licences to import oats. Was not that a nice return for Fianna Fáil policy?  We had a surplus of wheat which could not be handled in this country.  What would that have been if God had sent us a good harvest?  We would have had a shortage of feeding barley and oats and a wheat surplus.  Imagine in a country like this that we should be short of oats.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the farmers have a guaranteed price for wheat, and a guaranteed minimum price for feeding barley.  Last year, when they brought the feeding barley to the mills, the millers said: &ldquo;We have too much.&rdquo; It was the same with oats.  Within a month they came to the Minister looking for import licences for both barley and oats.  This year, the farmers have a guaranteed price for feeding barley, a minimum price of £2 per barrel.  The oatmeal millers have made contracts with the farmers to supply them with the oats they require in the coming <Col N="1627" /> year.  I think that is a sensible policy. Quite a number of farmers in my county grew oats this year under the contract system.  This crop can be grown on very acid, damp land where wheat could not be grown.  I think these farmers will appreciate the policy of the present Government.</P>
    <P>The Opposition found it very hard to find anything wrong with the Budget, and they talked about the rural electrification scheme.  Deputy Lemass and several other speakers who followed him made out that, due to the policy of the present Government, rural electrification would not be developed as it had been up to this. If Deputies meet any of their constituents they can tell them that they need not be the slightest bit afraid that rural electrification will not be developed.  They can tell them it will be developed and in a much bigger way than it has been up to the present.  In the year ending March 31st, 1943, there were 49 areas developed; in the year ending March 31st, 1944, there were 60 areas developed; in the year ending March, 31st, 1951, there were 75 areas developed.  It is the policy of the E.S.B. to complete 100 areas in the present year, and they hope to complete the whole scheme of rural electrification in 1959, without any increase in the price of current.  The present Government see that there is no reason why, if there is a surplus of E.S.B. revenue, it should not be used for the purpose of helping out rural electrification, or for any other purpose to which it should be put.</P>
    <P>In this Budget one of the biggest benefits, apart from the butter subsidy, is the increase to old age pensioners of 2/6 per week.  Whether a person is drawing 21/6 per week or 6/6 per week he will get that increase.  For a person who is drawing 6/6 per week it means an increase of close on 40 per cent. That is very good news for 162,000 people in the country, and it is also very good news for 3,383 people in Kilkenny.  They will be very pleased, and I think it is only just that they should get it.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil, when they increased the <Col N="1628" /> price of bread in 1950 from 6d. to 9d., doubled the price of tea and increased sugar by 50 per cent.  At that time, Deputy MacEntee, who was Minister for Finance, thought that the old age pensioners were fully compensated by an increase of 1/6 per week, and that they could pay the increased prices for bread, flour, tea, sugar and butter with that increase.  This Government feels that if there is to be any rebate given to any section of the community, it should be given to the poorer section, and it was in order to cater for that section that the Government gave that increase of 2/6 to the old age pensioners, to the blind and to the widows.  Since the Budget was introduced, I have been speaking to many people who all thought that this was the proper thing to do.  The Government have also increased the allowance in respect of children for income-tax purposes from £85 to £100, and this should be of great help to any man who is at present raising a young family.  He has got an increase which possibly is much more important to him than a reduction of 6d. in the rate of income-tax.</P>
    <P>In my native city the concession which the Minister has given to breweries is very much appreciated.  I am sure that the £10,000 rebate of excise duty which that brewery will receive this year from the Minister will be greatly valued.  It will help the local industry, and will help all the breweries in the country to modernise their plant and enable them to compete with overseas competitors.  They have to deal with great competition, and it is good to see our native Government giving them that assistance. It will also enable the breweries to make contracts with the farmers for malting barley.  As I said, the Minister's concession to breweries is very much appreciated, especially in my native city.  The reduction from £31 10s to £8 in the tax on tractors will be a great help to the farmer.  The tax of £31 10s. was imposed by the Fianna Fáil Government.  It meant that a person paying the lower rate could not carry milk to the creamery for his neighbour.  Every farmer had to send his own vehicle to the creamery as a result of the tax of £31 10s.  When <Col N="1629" /> the tax is reduced to £8, four or five neighbours can club together and have their milk brought to the creamery by one tractor.  One man can carry it for reward for others, if necessary.  They could not do that up to this.</P>
    <P>I feel that the Government are going in the right direction when they allocate nearly £3,000,000 from the American Grant Counterpart Fund towards the eradication of bovine T.B. and for the provision of pasteurising plant for creameries and cream separating stations and also the continued subsidisation of ground limestone.  I think the Government are doing the proper thing in that respect.</P>
    <P>The people have confidence in the present Government and they can rest assured that they will have a stable Government in the country for the next three or four years.  That to the farmers, the industrialists and the business people is, in itself, a big thing.</P>

      <P>I think this Budget could be described as the &ldquo;excuse me Budget&rdquo;.  Last year every financial amendment put forward by the Fianna Fáil Party was met with the statement: &ldquo;It is a Fianna Fáil Budget. We must operate it.  Do not strike me now with the child in my arms&rdquo;.  Since then, we have had wholesale repudiations of the election promises.  That is a very unfortunate thing in Irish life. I think it tends more than anything else I can speak of to lower the standard of public life in this country. Regardless of what we may have said about the old parliamentarians of pre-1916 at the worst stage, I doubt if they ever lowered Irish public life as Fine Gael did in the last election.  There was certainly not any desire on their part to improve conditions because it has been shown quite clearly and conclusively that they have not improved the conditions of the people.  On the contrary, they have created a state of uncertainty which has been responsible for trade recession in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is most unfortunate, I think, that public men would deliberately make false statements and promises because they hoped to get a few extra votes. That does not work out well in the long run.  I can assure the Deputies <Col N="1630" /> opposite that before another election is at hand the people will have found them out fully and will be so much disgusted with the people who are now in office that there will be a general demand for their removal.</P>

      <P>Deputy Crotty, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, said that everyone in this country was satisfied with the present state of affairs.  The present cocktail Government&mdash;I mention the word &ldquo;cocktail&rdquo; specifically because that is exactly what the present Government is&mdash;have very little regard for the cocktail shakers.  I know that most of the Fine Gael Party would have liked to relieve the cocktail shakers and the bars, but would one not think they would be ashamed of themselves for not having reduced the price of the old pint?  I want to ask one question and to request the Minister to answer it when he is replying.  If the present Government had not made the false promises, if they had not made false promise after false promise which they had no hope of redeeming would they be on the side of the House they occupy to-day?  They would not.</P>
      <P>Therefore, the Government ought to be ashamed of themselves.  I hope they will be contrite and apologise to the Irish people for the false promises they made.  The Parliamentary Secretary stated that everybody was satisfied.  I am not going to quote Fianna Fáil this time.  I am going to quote a gentleman who was a Fine Gael candidate in the last election.  He is charged with the serious and onerous duty of being Chairman of the Licensed Grocers' and Vintners' Association.  He is not satisfied. Here is the quotation:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;It is most likely that the prices of drink will be increased on the consumer in the near future,&rsquo; said Mr. John Hedigan, chairman of the Licensed Grocers' and Vintners' <Col N="1631" /> Association, addressing the annual meeting of the association in Dublin yesterday.</P>
    <P>Mr. Hedigan was referring to the Budget statement last week and said that taken with the association's claims, it had created emergency conditions for the trade.</P>
    <P>&lsquo;We had looked forward,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;with a lively expectancy to the Budget of last week.  We had expected and felt we had a right to expect that the least that the Minister for Finance would have done would be to have followed the example of his predecessor and give some direct relief to the retail licensed trade of no less an amount than that which Mr. MacEntee gave in his 1954 Budget.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is from Mr. Hedigan.  I have his photograph here.  It is a beautiful photograph.  It is one of which anyone would be proud.  Mr. Hedigan is shown here in company with the Attorney-General, I think.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamMurphy" hpid="Mr. W. Murphy Mr. W. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. W. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>He did not look so well in 1952.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that however well he looked in 1952, his wife would not recognise him after the last Budget.  The poor man's face <Col N="1632" /> was so long that she could not possibly do it.  I have quoted what Mr. Hedigan said and he holds a very responsible position.  It is quite true to say that the licensed traders of Dublin invested some £30,000 in Fine Gael by way of subscription to that political Party.  It was a damn bad investment.  It certainly did not pay dividends.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy really mean that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt that each and every one of the licensed trade is unquestionably disappointed and for very good reasons.  Every publican in Dublin became a Fine Gael organiser. The Minister, of course, knows that one penny per pint more is paid in the small towns and rural areas in Ireland and if the licensed trade in Dublin grumble it is no wonder that rural Ireland grumbles.  I hope the prophecy of Deputy Flanagan, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture, will not be fulfilled now.  I move to report progress.</P>
      <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 18th May, 1955.</P>
