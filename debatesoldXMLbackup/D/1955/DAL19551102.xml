      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will state the name and date of the publication from which he quoted bank credit accommodation figures in relation, <i>inter alia</i>, to the month of September, 1955, in the course of the debate on 27th October, 1955.</P>

      <P>The statistics of bank advances within the State, which I quoted during the course of the debate on the 27th October, were based, in so far as periods up to June, 1955, are concerned, on particulars published in the <i>Quarterly Statistical Bulletins</i> of the Central Bank of Ireland.  The figures for the months of July, August and September, 1955, were obtained from the Central Bank and will appear in the Bank's Statistical Bulletin for the September quarter, 1955, which <Col N="338" /> will be published within the next week or so.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the reply, may I say that when the Taoiseach gave these figures, they were not obtainable by anybody but himself?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Nine out of 12 of the figures I gave were obtainable by anybody. The other three were obtained from the Central Bank in accordance with what I am advised is the normal official practice.</P>

      <P>Imports are brought to account according to the headings of the official import list which, in the case of tea, does not separately distinguish different varieties.  The only available details, therefore, relate to the classification of such imports by country of origin, and I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to circulate in the Official Report a statement giving an analysis of tea imports by country of origin in each of the years 1950 to 1954 and for the period January-September, 1955.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he has investigated the reason for the recent increase in the price of Irish-made glucose, and if he will make a statement in the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Norton) William Norton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Norton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied, as a result of investigation of the matter, that the price at present being charged by Ceimici Teoranta for home-manufactured glucose is reasonable having regard to home market prices in other countries and the desirability of developing a native glucose industry.</P>
      <P>The price charged by the company previous to the recent imposition of customs duty on imports of this commodity was related to the price at which surplus production is disposed of here by foreign manufacturers whose home markets are protected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Minister has answered the question that I asked.  What was the reason for the increase?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason for protecting the industry and permitting the increase was that the glucose industry here, recently established, has to compete with glucose which is sold on the Irish market at a price less than that at which glucose is sold on the home market of the country exporting the glucose to this country.  In other words, the Irish industry has to compete with glucose sent in here at dumped prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I not correct in assuming that the Irish industry was selling glucose at £9 a ton less than it is now charging?  Was it losing money when it was doing so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that the Irish glucose industry could not sell glucose against the dumped prices at which glucose was being exported to this country, that glucose which was exported here being sold at substantialy higher prices on the home market of the exporting country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 9 together.</P>
      <P>As Tea Importers, Limited, have only a nominal capital, bank accommodation has been necessary since the company was set up in 1941 in order to finance the company's purchases of tea.  On the 30th September, 1955, the total liability of Tea Importers, Limited, on foot of borrowings for purchase of tea was £5,161,465, which included £1,861,465 due on bank overdraft and £3,300,000 in respect of accommodation bank bills.  These borrowings were arranged in the same way as in the earlier years since 1941.</P>
      <P>The bank overdraft was subject to an interest rate of 3½ per cent. to the 31st August, 1955, and of 4 per cent. from the 1st September and £20,436 had accrued under this head on the 30th September.  The accommodation bank bills outstanding on the same date were discounted at varying rates, the total discount amounting to £60,173.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The increase of 2/- per lb. in the average list price of Tea Importers, Limited, which was announced recently <Col N="345" /> includes 2½d. a lb. towards the recoupment of the trading loss, which arose from the maintenance during the previous 12 months of an average issue price below the economic level and which accounts for £1,070,000 out of the total of the company's liability of £5,161,465 at the 30th September, 1955. It is not possible to forecast the period required for the total liquidation of the loss incurred by Tea Importers, Limited, up to the 30th September, 1955, as this will be affected by the cost of future purchases by the company.</P>
    <P>The increase of 2/- a lb. refers to the issue price from Tea Importers, Limited, for original teas.  Since 5th July, 1952, the prices of the blended teas which are sold by wholesalers and retailers are not subject to official control.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister make clear one point which he has not made clear?  According to his statement, the annual consumption of tea in the country amounts to something like 24,000,000 lb.  Is he aware that 1d. on the lb. for the liquidation of overdraft and interest charges would produce £100,000 and that 2½d. would produce £250,000 per year?  What I wanted to know was: allowing for the payment of interest, whatever the rate may be, how long will it be before the existing £5,000,000 overdraft is paid off?  For how many years will interest have to be paid?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is obvious that the Deputy is confusing two entirely different matters.  Since Tea Importers, Limited, were set up as a company, with no capital or a very nominal capital, they have had to resort to bank overdrafts as a means of financing tea purchases.  The Government Party of which the Deputy is a member agreed that for the best part of the past 14 years, Tea Importers, Limited should have a bank overdraft of £6,000,000 per year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Tea on tick, in other words.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the company operated, they had to have a bank overdraft and they were allowed to <Col N="346" /> draw on that overdraft up to £6,000,000.  That was going on all the years the Deputy's Party was in office, and, in every one of these years, everybody who consumed an ounce of tea paid interest on that overdraft. That is one aspect of the matter.  I do not say there is any other way of getting out of the difficulty and I am not complaining.  I am merely giving the Deputy information.  When we decided, early this year, to hold tea prices, it was necessary for Tea Importers, Limited to increase the overdraft, because they were issuing tea at less than the economic price.  The extent of that overdraft for which we were responsible in the past 12 months is £1,071,000 and that overdraft in due course will have to be liquidated.  How much of it will be interest depends on when it is liquidated and that cannot be decided until the liquidation actually takes place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not obvious that the levy of 2½d. a lb. on the price of tea to meet these losses will have to continue for at least four years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Not necessarily continuing that way, because there is a variety of steps that might be taken in the meantime.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask for a clarification with regard to what I call borrowings as distinct from bank overdraft? Was it for 14 years that bills were discounted with the Central Bank, or how long is it since that was started?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think bills were discounted by the Central Bank at all, but if the Deputy wants details, if he will put down a question, I shall be most happy to give the answer.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the E.S.B. that Kylemore is included in the Letterfrack rural area and that a canvass of that area carried out by the board in the spring of 1953 disclosed that 58 per cent. of the householders were willing to take supply.  I am also informed by the board that the townlands of Knock, Inverin, Tully, Rosaveele and Carraroe are included in the Carraroe rural area and that the last canvass of this area which was carried out last summer disclosed that 47 per cent. of the householders were willing to take supply.  Both of these areas have been considered by the board on a number of occasions for development under the rural electrification scheme, but have not, so far, been selected as their returns have not compared favourably with those of other areas still awaiting development in the Galway district.  I am unable to state when the development of these areas is likely to take place.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the board that Lettermore and Lettermullen are included in the Lettermore area, but that a canvass of the householders in that area has not yet been carried out by the board.  Until the results of such a canvass are available, it would not be possible to indicate the area's prospects of being selected for development.</P>

      <P>As I informed the Deputy in reply to his previous question on the 23rd February, 1955, a grant towards the cost of the erection of a new school has been sanctioned by my Department.  There has, however, been some unavoidable delay owing to necessary investigations as to the feasibility of obtaining, on or near the site, an adequate supply of water for a water-flushed system of sanitation at the new school.  The question of the sanitation will be settled as soon as possible and when this has been done every effort will be made to expedite the completion of the remaining preliminary arrangements which have to be made in order to enable building operations to be put in hands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>In general the Land Commission find it more satisfactory and cheaper to have houses erected by contract; but quite frequently cases arise in which, owing to special circumstances such as inaccessibility of site or urgency, it is considered more economic to resort to direct labour. During the years 1953 and 1954 the Land Commission used the direct labour method very extensively in County Meath.  Owing to the difficulty of getting and retaining skilled labour and owing to the fact that growing competition has led to growing keenness <Col N="351" /> both in prices tendered and in the expeditious completion of contracts, the Land Commission found it advisable to revert largely to the contract system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that there is no scarcity of skilled labour in County Meath for house building?  Is he also not aware that the houses built by direct labour are good houses, and remain good houses for many years, while some of those built by contract recently are already falling down and require almost immediate repair?  That being so, will the Minister not again ask the Land Commission to build houses by direct labour?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>As I told the Deputy in reply to his question, the Land Commission is only too anxious to avail of direct labour wherever sufficient skilled labour is available to supervise the work.  I admit I am surprised to hear that houses built by contract are falling down.  Even in the case of houses built by direct labour faults in workmanship cannot always be easily detected during erection.  On the whole the work is going ahead satisfactorily. As the Deputy knows, the Land Commission is building houses all over the country and there have not been many complaints about defective work.</P>

      <P>That Dáil Éireann hereby approves of the Control of Imports (Quota No. 13) (Woven Woollen and Synthetic and Artificial Fabrics) (Amendment) (No. 2) Order, 1955.</P>
      <P>Section 4 (2) of the Control of Imports Act, 1934, provides that any quota Order made under the Act and any Order similarly made amending a quota Order shall cease to have effect on the expiration of six months from the date on which it was made unless it is approved by each House of the Oireachtas by resolution passed before the expiration of the said six months.</P>
      <P>The Control of Imports (Quota No. 13) (Woven Woollen and Synthetic Synthetic and Artificial Fabrics) (Amendment) (No. 2) Order, 1955, was made on the 2nd June, 1955, and must be confirmed before the 2nd December, 1955.</P>
      <P>The Control of Imports (Quota No. 13) Order, 1935, as amended by subsequent Orders prohibits the importation of woollen and worsted and certain types of rayon cloth except under licence.  There is an exemption in the Order for printed fabrics, which are not produced here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In November, 1954, certain of the Irish mills, which had previously engaged to a small extent in the production of rayon suitings, decided to go into this trade in a fairly substantial way.  It emerged, however, that a cloth was on offer to the trade here which had been specially prepared to evade <Col N="356" /> the quota control.  This cloth had a pattern printed on one side and was finished in such a way that either side could be used as the outer side of a garment.  In the case of trousers, gaberdine coats, etc., it is, of course, immaterial to the wearer whether the garment is printed on the inside or not.  These cloths, according to statutory provisions, were printed fabrics and, as such, exempt from the quota. This evasion of the quota was regarded as a serious threat to the Irish mills. Traders who had placed orders with the mills were reluctant to confirm them as they feared that when the weakness in the quota became generally known, there would be large scale importation of cloths printed in the manner indicated and they would find themselves with the Irish cloth left on their hands.</P>
    <P>It was decided that the existing exemption regarding printed fabrics should be substituted by an exemption for fabrics with a <i>bona fide</i> design or pattern permanently printed or painted thereon which is visible on both surfaces of the fabric.  Where genuine printed cloths happen to be caught by the quota reasonable facilities for their importation are granted.  This amendment prevented the importation of cloths designed to evade the quota but as almost all genuine printed cloths have the printing showing on both sides, traders are still free to import their requirements of genuine printed cloth.</P>
    <P>The amendment of the Order was effected by Control of Imports (Quota No. 13) (Woven Woollen and Synthetic and Artificial Fabrics) (Amendment) (No. 2) Order, 1955, made by the Government on the 2nd June, 1955, which came into effect on the 9th June, 1955.</P>

    <Title>Imposition of Duties (Confirmation of Orders) (No. 2) Bill, 1955&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Norton) William Norton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Norton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The purpose of the Bill, as set out in the explanatory memorandum which I have <Col N="357" /> circulated to Deputies, is to confirm 13 Orders made by the Government under the Emergency Imposition of Duties Act, 1932.  The commodities covered by the Orders are as follows:&mdash;fabric gloves, slashers or slash hooks, artificial silk fabrics, underfelt, flexible mirror glass, knitted woollen gloves, artificial textile and union fabrics, display shapes and stands, storage water heaters, angle iron fencing posts, milk cans, iron and steel bolts, margarine.</P>
      <P>The Orders dealing with fabric gloves and knitted woollen gloves arose out of a threat to the glove-making industry from low priced gloves manufactured in the Far East. The existing <i>ad valorem</i> customs duties were inadequate to protect the industry against imports of such gloves and it was necessary to impose specific duties at rates sufficient to ensure the continuance of production and employment. A feature of the knitted woollen glove industry is that it is located almost exclusively in County Donegal.</P>
      <P>The danger of substantial imports of low priced fabrics from the Far East was also an important factor which led to the making of the Orders dealing with artificial silk fabrics and with artificial textile and union fabrics. A position had arisen where the output of the firms engaged in the production of bag-making cloth, linings, lingerie cloth and dress cloth was being seriously threatened by imports from the Far East and elsewhere at low prices which bore no comparison to normal costs of production.</P>
      <P>The duty on slashers or slash hooks was reduced from 25 per cent. to 20 per cent. <i>ad valorem</i> in respect of imports of United Kingdom or Canadian origin.  The British Board of Trade asked for a review of this duty in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Anglo-Irish Trade Agreement of 1938.  The review was carried out by the Industrial Development Authority, who recommended that the duty should be reduced from 25 per cent. to 20 per cent. <i>ad valorem.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The manufacture of underfelt was commenced within the past year or so <Col N="358" /> and the duty was imposed in order to afford a measure of protection for the industry.  Underfelt is a textile material primarily used as an underlay for carpets.  It is also used as trimming and flooring in motor cars.</P>
    <P>The manufacture of flexible mirror glass is a small but interesting development in the glass trade and it was decided to afford it a measure of protection.  Flexible mirror glass consists of ordinary mirror glass cut into small rectangles and fixed to a textile backing, which can be formed into various shapes and used for shop window dressing and display purposes.</P>
    <P>The Orders dealing with display shapes and stands and with angle iron fencing posts revoked the duties hitherto chargeable on these goods. The duties were originally intended to be protective duties but the manufacture of the goods in question did not develop satisfactorily and no useful purpose was being served by allowing the duties to remain in operation.</P>
    <P>The manufacture of copper boilers and cylinders for use in hot water systems has been carried on satisfactorily here for many years and has been protected by customs duty.  This protection did not extend to what are known as indirect cylinders and calorifiers which are ordinary cylinders with water or steam carrying coils inside them.  Indirect cylinders are used mainly in central heating units and calorifiers are similarly used in large premises where steam is generated. The Irish firms are equipped to meet the full demand.  It was accordingly decided to extend protection to the manufacture of indirect cylinders and calorifiers.</P>
    <P>Early in 1954 a customs duty of 15 per cent. (full rate), 10 per cent. (preferential rate) <i>ad valorem</i> was imposed on milk cans up to 12 gallons capacity as a measure of protection for the manufacture of these goods which had recommenced after a lapse of some years.  The industry producing the milk cans is equipped to turn out the full requirements of the country in cans up to 12 gallons capacity.  Although the home produced cans were competitive in price with the normal or list prices of similar imported <Col N="359" /> cans there was evidence that exporters in other countries were manipulating prices to bring them down to or below Irish prices notwithstanding the duty payable.  It was considered necessary therefore to increase the rate of duty to 37½ per cent. (full) 25 per cent. (preferential) to afford the home industry adequate protection.</P>
    <P>There was a customs duty on certain iron and steel bolts not less than ? inches in diameter.  Bolts which were only fractionally less than ? inches in diameter were being imported free of the duty to the serious deteriment of the firms who manufacture bolts here. It was, accordingly, necessary to close this loophole in the duty.  Since 1927 there has been a customs duty of 3d. per lb. on margarine.  When this duty was originally imposed it was equivalent to an <i>ad valorem</i> rate of 50 per cent. and under this protection the industry developed to the point where the full requirements of the market were being supplied by the Irish manufacturers. During 1954, importation of continental margarine commenced and developed to a point where it was necessary to bring the specific duty of 3d. per lb. imposed in 1927 into line with current money values, to keep the industry adequately protected.  It was decided to convert the specific duty into an <i>ad valorem</i> duty at the rate of 50 per cent. (full), 33? per cent. (U.K. and Canada).</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill appears to offer the only opportunity the Dáil is likely to have during the present session of querying the Minister upon some recent developments in his policy regarding industry.  I am aware that on similar Bills in the past we have had fairly wide discussions upon industrial policy generally and I think that precedent will permit me to wander a little outside the precise terms of the Bill this afternoon.  However, if at any time the Ceann Comhairle thinks I am speaking in a manner which is irrelevant to the Bill I feel sure he will draw my attention to the fact.  During the course of the Dáil recess, and before that, the Minister <Col N="360" /> made in public repeated invitations to firms in other countries to interest themselves in industrial development here, and there are, I understand, missions now abroad or about to go abroad to Germany and Sweden, charged with the duty of selling to individual firms in these countries the idea of participating in Irish industry.</P>
      <P>While I want to make it quite clear that I have no objection either to the issuing of these general invitations or the sending of these missions abroad or to other efforts to attract foreign firms into Irish industrial development, or certain aspects of it, I think that the Minister has not realised the importance of defining precisely what he has in mind.  On at least two previous occassions during the present year I tried to urge upon him the inadvisability of vague, general statements in matters of that kind.  I am sorry I did not succeed in getting from him any precise indications of his intentions.  I do not know if the Minister is aware that in certain industrial circles here he is regarded as having &ldquo;a bee in his bonnet&rdquo; about the introduction of foreign firms into Irish industry, and I personally am aware of some firms which were contemplating extensions of their activities and which have delayed doing so until the position is clarified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to urge on the Minister that he should state&mdash;if not this afternoon, then upon some other occasion in the near future&mdash;in a precise way the type of industrial activities into which foreign firms would be welcome and the type of industrial activities into which they are not required to come and where it is not intended that they should be allowed to come.  I think he should state the conditions under which foreign firms will be allowed to operate here.  The Minister has power under the Control of Manufactures Act to attach conditions to any licence given to an externally-owned firm.  What conditions does he intend to impose? Is it contemplated in the case of any foreign-owned firm starting business here that it will be subject to the condition that any proportion of its total production is to be exported?  I want him to say is it still correct that, assuming there are two propositions of equal merit for the commencement of <Col N="361" /> any industrial process here, one from an Irish firm and the other from a foreign firm, that the Irish firm will get preference?</P>
    <P>There appears to be a belief in some quarters at the present time that the preference is being exercised the other way.</P>
    <P>In the past when, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, I had the obligation of speaking on these matters I made it clear that we would welcome foreign participation in Irish industrial development when it brought with it&mdash;and only when it brought with it&mdash; skills and opportunities which we have not got here, or the prospect of developments which were unlikely to come within a reasonable time from exclusively Irish enterprise.  My experience in these matters leads me to argue that no matter how energetic the efforts that may be made to attract foreigners into Irish industrial development, no matter how many missions we send abroad, we must place our main reliance in securing an extension of industrial activity here upon encouraging Irish investment in industry. We must rely on those who have a personal as well as a financial interest in Irish development.</P>
    <P>I think also we should have very close regard to the dangers which are associated with industrial development in the form of branch factories established by foreign firms.  Branch factories of foreign firms established here for the purpose of undertaking export trade will always be marginal undertakings.  If there is a trade recession of some kind or some alteration in trade conditions which involves a curtailment of sales by the parent company their branch factories here will be the first to be closed.  The managements of these foreign firms will naturally try to keep their main plants in operation to the maximum extent and will sacrifice the marginal units without hesitation if it is necessary to that end.  Any foreign firm coming in here is solely concerned with the profit it can make from operating here and when the prospect of profit disappears it will disappear also.  If we had any substantial proportion of Irish industrial activity carried on in <Col N="362" /> such branch factories owned by foreign firms, then, in a period of trade difficulty, even a very slight trade slump we could get a disproportionate displacement of labour here.</P>
    <P>In 1952, there was something in the nature of a trade slump in the world generally and I remember pointing out to the Dáil on that occassion that the effect of that slump on industrial development in this country was much less severe relatively than in Great Britain and in other countries which were largely dependent on the industrial export trade.  That was mainly because exports represented such a small proportion of the output of Irish firms.  We must get an expansion of industrial exports if we can, but we want it to be directed by firms that will fight for every bit of it and not ruthlessly sacrifice or relinquish it when the interests of some larger concern elsewhere so require.</P>
    <P>I think there is growing in the country a certain amount of apprehension as to what the consequences may be of putting undue emphasis on foreign participation in our industrial development when, as it appeares at the present time, that emphasis even requires ignoring the prospects of equal or similar development directed by Irish-owned concerns.  When I was Minister for Industry and Commerce I believed and acted on the belief that policy in these matters should be detailed not in speeches but in legislation. The control of Manufactures Act which was passed for the purpose of preventing Irish industrial development mainly taking the form of the establishment of branch factories by foreign firms forced in here by protective tariffs, has to a large extent served its purpose and it may be that there is a case for its revision&mdash;I certainly do not think there is a case for its repeal. But if there is to be any loosening up on the granting of licences under that Act to externally-owned firms, then the case for revision is very strong.  Indeed one Irish industrialist has already stated publicly that if the aim of that Act is to be in part nullified by the free granting of licences to foreign-owned firms the existing Irish firms <Col N="363" /> should also be allowed to go abroad to get the capital required for the extension of their own activities, a course they are prohibited from taking under existing legislation.</P>
    <P>I realise that the Minister has not had any notice that I was raising this question now and he need not deal with it if he does not wish to deal with it, but I would urge on him the importance of dealing with it in a specific and definite way as soon as possible because the vagueness and uncertainty and doubt that surround the existing position are, I believe, holding up many developments&mdash;perhaps not the establishment of new industrial concerns which can clear their position with the Department beforehand&mdash;but the extension of activities by existing concerns which is the main method by which Irish industrial activity has increased in recent years.</P>
    <P>There is one other aspect of the Minister's policy which is also arousing discussion and some grave anxiety. It has been announced that in connection with the commercial development of minerals in Avoca a tax concession is going to be given.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Dáil will have an opportunity of discussing that whole business because it brings up the questions of public policy on which the Dáil should be consulted.</P>
      <P>With regard to the other matters I have mentioned I would urge upon the Minister to take the opportunity of letting everybody know what he is doing and to see that every possible opportunity is taken to publicise the opportunities there are in this country for further industrial expansion so that everybody will know what is going on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the specific Orders to which the Bill refers, three of them are the revocation or reduction of duties already in force.  In so far as the one which relates to display stands used in shop windows is concerned I have no comment to make.  The firm that was engaged in that business never developed with the efficiency and enterprise which justified the maintenance of their protection.  That firm was repeatedly warned that the continuation of that protection was not <Col N="365" /> to be taken for granted if they did not do better than they had been doing.</P>
    <P>So far as the Order dealing with fencing posts and stakes is concerned the position is somewhat different. Again I am not objecting to the revocation of the duties because the amount of fabrication needed to turn a bar of iron into a fencing post is not very great and I do not think that the revocation of the duty will interfere very much with the firms on whose behalf the duty was first imposed.  I understand that their inability to develop the production of these goods arises from the disparity between the price of bar iron from Haulbowline and bar iron from Britain.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the circumstances at Haulbowline are now, but some year or two ago it was claimed that the cost of conversion from billets to bars there was lower than in any English steel mill.  Whether that is so still or not I do not know.  There were, in the past few years, many instances where, because of the high cost of steel to the Irish firm engaged in various forms of manufacture, it was cheaper to import manufactured commodities from Britain and pay duty on them, than to attempt to make them here.  While I do not object to the revocation of the duty on fencing posts and stakes, I want to say that I think it is undesirable that we should go to any great extent in that direction without knowing precisely what the future holds for us.  There was a time when the cost of unprocessed steel from Britain to firms in this country was often higher than the goods manufactured from it and on many occasions I refused to issue duty free licences, because I believed that such a position could not continue, and that it was undesirable for us to cease any type of productive activity on that account of to disperse skilled labour because of a temporary situation of that sort.</P>
    <P>We have got a number of industries using Irish steel produced in Haulbowline and it is important to them that the steel works there should be so operated that they will be at no very great competitive disadvantage as against similar works in Great Britain.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="366" /> While I cannot say that I have any idea of the reason why Haulbowline steel should be so much dearer, I hope it is a temporary situation and that the Minister will be able to so assure the House.</P>
    <P>The reduction in the duty on slashers and slash hooks has, the Minister told us, been effected following a review of the previous tariff, undertaken at the instance of the British Trade Commissioner. I am aware that the firm concerned in the production of these goods views the reduction of the duty with disapproval and even some apprehension. I think I am correct in saying that when the question of protecting the manufacture of these goods first arose the application was for an <i>ad valorem</i> duty of 50 per cent., but a duty of only 25 per cent. was granted and this Order now reduces that to 20 per cent.  The firm whom I asked for its reaction on the matter has said to me that they feel that a 25 per cent. minimum duty is essential.  That is not because the goods they are producing are any dearer than the goods produced in Britain or inferior in quality.</P>
    <P>Most people will agree that these goods produced here in Wexford are of excellent quality and are as good as anything that are imported.</P>
    <P>But, as everybody here knows, there is, not so much a prejudice against Irish produced goods, as a desire on the part of traders in a town to have something different from what other traders are offering.  If the reduction of the duty permits of it, it is almost certain that it will be availed of to import a greater quantity of these goods from abroad merely to have something different to show, to the detriment of Irish manufacturers and the employment given by them, because, of cource, any curtailment in their output will also curtail their efficiency, their ability to maintain their present competitive price position.</P>
    <P>I think I should on Committee Stage produce an amendment to delete that Order from the Schedule to the Bill so as to give the Minister a fuller <Col N="367" /> opportunity of explaining why he thinks this reduction in duty can be made and of expressing his views as to what the consequences of the reduction may be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is refreshing to find general agreement on both sides of the House in relation to such an important matter as the development of industry in this country both in order to meet the requirements of the home market and for export.  I could find myself in agreement with a great deal of what Deputy Lemass has said.</P>
      <P>It would have been better, however, if he had not introduced and given publicity here to what he said was the belief, for instance, which some people had that, other things being equal, as between the Irish firm and the non-Irish firm, in some cases the non-Irish firm was getting the preference. I do not think Deputy Lemass himself believes that.  I do not think that that can be established satisfactorily by anybody outside.  I suggest that a statement like that should not be made, particularly by a Deputy of the standing and experience of Deputy Lemass, with his particularly intimate knowledge of the matter that we are now discussing, unless he were satisfied that there was conclusive evidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lemass said that there is apprehension among certain people outside regarding statements which the Minister has made with a view to attracting outside firms in here to produce goods that are not produced here at all, or that are not produced here in sufficient quantity, or to produce entirely, or almost entirely, for export. The Deputy knows, probably better than anybody else either outside or inside this House, that if there is to be any change whatever in the position which has obtained for the last 30 years there will be apprehension among certain people.  Nobody knows that better than the Deputy.  I do not think there will be any apprehension amongst the majority of Irish industrialists, among those who have made an effort to make themselves efficient and to produce as good an article as <Col N="368" /> can be produced within the circumstances obtaining here.</P>
    <P>Some of the fears which were expressed arose, I am quite satisfied, from a complete misunderstanding of what the Minister was doing and was trying to do.  Some of the feelings of apprehension were expressed by people who have reason, as I say, to be apprehension of any change that would be made.</P>
    <P>It is better that we should speak quite plainly on this matter.  There is common agreement on both sides of the House that Irish industrialists should get, not merely preference, but whatever measure of protection is required to put them on at least an equal footing, taking everything into consideration, with anybody who may come in from outside.  I want to emphasise &ldquo;at least an equal footing&rdquo;. After 30 odd years, I think we and the people outside are entitled to say that, whilst giving the fullest protection against unfair competition, there must be some recognition of the fact that merely because it is an Irish firm it will not become a 100 per cent. monopoly, sheltered completely from any form of competition.  I venture to say that a good deal of the apprehension&mdash;I do not say all of it&mdash;has been expressed by people who take the view that this Legislature should protect them against all and any competition. The Deputy and the Minister are quite aware that there are Irish firms who not merely are apprehensive, but who protest vehemently, not only against anybody from outside coming in to compete with them, but if any other Irish firm goes into the same system of processing or production. Deputy Lemass knows that quite well.</P>
    <P>The Deputy said that the Minister should publicise the facilities that are available to people in this country, in order to encourage them to come in. I think the Minister is doing quite a good job.  I think he has publicised them pretty well.  May I say that what might not have been either possible or desirable at any time within the last 30 years, up to a year or two ago, may be both possible and very desirable now in the very changed circumstances which obtain throughout <Col N="369" /> the world and particularly throughout Europe to-day?  Deputy Lemass knows quite well that the circumstances have changed completely.  Foreign firms who might desire to establish industries in Great Britain and established British factories are finding it almost impossible to expand because the requisite labour is just not available there.  On that point, let me say&mdash;and I am quite sure Deputy Lemass will be in entire agreement on this&mdash;it would be preferable for us to have factories here giving employment to our own workers in Ireland rather than that our workers should go to Great Britain or elsewhere to produce the goods in factories there.  There are reasons and there are inducements and there are almost compulsions in the circumstances of the day for outsiders to establish factories here that were not there two or three or four years ago.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Lemass says that Irish industrialists must get first preference in any development, whether for the home market or the export market, again he must agree that, with a few notable exceptions, in the last 30 years or 20 years, very few of them have made any real effort to get into any part of the export market and I think it is true to say and that it should be said that there are certain manufacturers in this country who have got very substantial protection, at pretty severe cost to the ordinary citizen over a long number of years.  Again I want to emphasise that those that I am now talking about are in the minority but they are there and Deputy Lemass knows they are there and the Minister and most people in this House know they are there.  Although they have received very adequate protection at rather substantial cost to the ordinary citizen, they have made no effort to get into the export market and quite a number of them have not made an effort even to meet the requirements of the home market.  Nobody knows that better than Deputy Lemass.</P>
    <P>There is a situation&mdash;I was going to say &ldquo;arising&rdquo;&mdash;which has arisen, a situation which has been brought more sharply to our notice because of the drive in recent years for an export market, wherein our ability to get into <Col N="370" /> the export market and stay in it depends very largely on the ability of other Irish industries to give us the raw materials of the quality and kind that are essential, if we are to compare not merely in price but in quality, finish, design and so on, with the products of competitors whom we will have to meet when we go into the export market.</P>
    <P>It is not an easy problem; it is a very difficult problem; but one is not going to solve it by pretending that it is not there, by making no effort in any way whatever to deal with it or by just shutting one's eyes to it.  When we talk about exports and an export market, whether it is into Britain or into America&mdash;we may talk about a greater Ireland beyond the seas in America and some people may fool themselves for a time by talking about the sentiment value that is there&mdash;we know that we are not going to get into the America market, and certainly are not going to remain there, unless we give them what they want, and not what we think they want, and give it to them at least as good as they can get it from anybody else.  There is no member of the House who is not prepared, in my opinion, from my experience of the House, to give to the fullest extent justified any measure or type of protection a genuine Irish manufacturer wants to enable him to get on his feet and to give him a fair chance of meeting competition, no matter whence it may come.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is any harm to say this but, whether it is or not, I am going to say it, and to ask the Minister whether he knows it and whether Deputy Lemass can give us any information on it.  I understand that American industrialists are establishing industries over practically the whole of Europe, Great Britain and the northern part of this country.  Is there any reason that can be given as to why there does not seem to be any anxiety on their part to come in here? If there is any obstacle which we can be told about&mdash;or, at least, which the Minister can be told about; I do not necessarily mean the House&mdash;I am quite sure that, if it is possible to have that obstacle or obstacles removed, not merely will they be removed, but <Col N="371" /> whatever inducements the Government can properly give to get worth while industries here, and particularly from America, will be given.</P>
    <P>There was a very large amount of misrepresentation of one of the first speeches made by the Minister regarding his efforts to induce outside industrialists to come in here.  A good deal of that speech was misrepresented, and very much misrepresented across the water in Great Britain, by some people, I am quite certain, through a misunderstanding of what the Minister said, by some people, through ignorance and by many people, out of mischief.  The Minister was represented in many of the British newspapers and even by speeches by some of our friends in the northern part of this country, as offering inducements to the Germans to come in here which were not being offered to anybody else.  It might be no harm to say here that no inducements were offered to the Germans or anybody else which have not been available and pressed upon British manufacturers and industrialists for many a long day and many a long year.  Both the Minister and his immediate predecessor, Deputy Lemass, know that better than I do.</P>
    <P>There is what may appear to be a small point, but it is a very important point and I should like the Minister to take a look again to see if he can find some better arrangement in regard to it.  I am speaking now about Irish factories and Irish citizens who require the products of other Irish factories and who, if they cannot get them, want permission to import.  This system of the person who wants to purchase the article having to get a letter from the Irish manufacturer who is producing, or is supposed to be producing, an efficient article in sufficient quantity, is not working out satisfactorily or justly, and I go further and say that, in some cases, it is being abused.  Again, I am quite certain that out of their own experience, Deputy Lemass and the Minister know that that is quite true.</P>
    <P>Not merely must the finished article produced for consumption here at <Col N="372" /> home, but, in particular, for export, if we are to talk seriously about export, be good and look good, but the various raw materials which go into the making of that finished article must be equally good, because naturally if they are not, the finished article itself cannot be good.  This is a question not merely of the firm, the actual exporter of the finished article.  It does not rest very often entirely with that firm, the actual exporter, as to whether they can or cannot get in successfully to an export market.  It depends on whether every piece of raw material that goes into the making of the finished article is of itself the best that can be produced.</P>
    <P>We have made very great progress in this country industrially.  I do not think anybody is satisfied that we have made anything like the progress we should have made and when you count, over a period of over 30 years, the assistance of various kinds which has been given by successive Governments to people who want to start and develop industry here, the results to date are not as good as they should be.  I want to say this, from whatever experience I have, that we have to face the fact that it is quality and value, and nothing else, that counts. In order, in the first place, to get the quality in the article, one must have efficiency not merely at the top, but right down to the lowest paid operative in the particular firm.  When it comes to the question of putting on the market that finished article, which in quality compares favourably with anything produced elsewhere, the question of price will be determined in very large measure by the executive, managerial and technical skill available, a skill which is being used efficiently for the direction of that particular type of industry, by the type of machinery used, the degree of skill necessary and the relative output of the operatives engaged in the industry. I need not tell anybody here, or outside, that in commerce, business and trade, particularly international trade, there is no room for sentiment; that has always been true of trade, and it is even truer of trade to-day than heretofore. There is the driving of hard <Col N="373" /> bargains and it is quality and price, and nothing else, that count.</P>
    <P>We are merely beating the air in talking about building our industrial arm to the point where we cannot merely provide employment for those of our people who cannot get employment on the land, much less bring back those of our people who have gone out of the country.  We shall never reach that position unless we can measure up to the requirements which I have been trying, however inadequately, to put before this House to-day.  It is about time we grew up.  It is about time we adopted a realistic approach.  It is about time we faced the problems that are there, and faced the facts, by making ourselves aware of what has to be done.  When we have done that, let us put the position then to those immediately concerned with the production and sale of the goods about which we are talking here.</P>
    <P>It is not my purpose to compare our improvements, either agriculturally or industrially, one year with another. Neither do I intend to compare the increase in production and output, either industrially or agriculturally, as between ourselves and other countries. I think it is futile to do that because conditions may be completely different. I feel, however, that we can do a lot more than has been done.  There are firms here of which we can be extremely proud, firms which are turning out a really first-class article both for the home market and the export market, firms which are successfully putting their goods on the export market and meeting and beating competition from countries with a much longer industrial tradition.  I feel there are many other industries here which could do the same.</P>
    <P>On the whole, it is only fair to say that Irish industry is in a pretty healthy and a pretty sound condition. The outlook is good.  From my experience in another walk I can say that the demand for industrial premises at the moment is probably greater now than it has ever been at any time; and that demand comes in the main from Irish citizens.</P>

      <P>I do not think so.  Probably this is not the occasion for following the Deputy, however, into the highways and the byways which he traversed in the course of his speech this afternoon.  The first of the three Orders to which the Deputy referred imposed a duty of 50 per cent. full and 33 per cent. preferential on what are described as &ldquo;display shapes or stands&rdquo;.  That duty was imposed in 1947.  It was quite a substantial duty. I do not think there were ever more than two or three people employed. It was a travesty of the Act under which this duty was imposed ever to have invoked it for the purpose of giving a 50 per cent. protective duty on the evidence that was produced.  One of the miracles to me was how it was allowed to continue from 1947 to the present day.  The staff employed would have fitted on a bicycle, and that after eight years with a 50 per cent. duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was not the only difficulty.  Not only would the manufacturer not make the goods for which he got a duty of 50 per cent. imposed but he would not even answer letters sent to him by people asking him if he could supply them.  In order to avoid paying the duty they wanted to place an order with this manufacturer; but they could not get a reply from him as to whether or not he would make the article. When they wrote a second time and asked whether he could supply so that, in the event of his not being able to <Col N="375" /> supply, they could make application for a duty free licence, he would not even answer the letters.  That is the position I found.</P>
    <P>Does Deputy Lemass or anybody else think that honest, bona fide traders here should have their whole business dislocated because this individual gets a duty of 50 per cent. on the presumption that he will manufacture, does, in fact, no manufacturing, and succeeds only in remaining in existence for the purpose of thwarting firms in whose business this particular commodity is essential?</P>
    <P>I do not want to discuss this matter at any great length.  That is not the only feature about this 50 per cent. tariff in this particular case.  I anticipate there will be a sequel elsewhere because there are some other aspects. I do not want to discuss those aspects now; but that position certainly shows me, and I am sure it will show any impartial committee of this House, how careful one must be before promiscuously permitting a 50 per cent. tariff in the circumstances surrounding this case.</P>
    <P>On the question of fencing material, the manufacturers stated the fabrication of the posts would give virtually no employment whatever and, because of supply and price difficulties, it was not the kind of business about which they had any great anxiety.  The matter was discussed with them at the time and the position is still the same; they said they had no interest in the continued production of these goods and they indicated they saw no objection to the removal of them from the scope of the duty.</P>
    <P>It is in accordance with the conclusions reached following that consultation that the duty has been removed from these articles.  If at any time it is thought to be desirable to reimpose it in order to facilitate the establishment of an industry here, which offers the prospect of a reasonable amount of employment, the same methods as were heretofore adopted can be resorted to.</P>
    <P>On this question of slashers and <Col N="376" /> hooks, the British Government sought a review of these articles under the 1938 Trade Agreement.  As Deputy Lemass knows only too well, once they ask for a review the review has to take place.  The review was carried out by an Irish authority&mdash;the Irish Industrial Authority&mdash;and as the Deputy knows well we have to accept their recommendations in this case or abrogate the treaty.  I take it Deputy Lemass or any other responsible Deputy does not want us to do that. The British Government consented to this review machinery and they as well as we have to accept the recommendations of the Industrial Development Authority&mdash;an Irish authority.</P>
    <P>In this particular case the Industrial Development Authority reviewed two products, slashers and billhooks.  They recommended the continuance of the old rate in one and a decrease of 5 per cent.  in the other.  Since this review there has been no change in the volume of imports and we have not had a single complaint from the firm since this review took place; in fact the firm was glad because of the fact that the difficulties have been disposed of. I would think that Deputy Lemass should think again on the question as to whether or not it would be good for the firm concerned to have a discussion in public here on the ins and outs of this business.  If he were to listen to my advice he would see the desirability of discussing this personally with me if there is to be any discussion on the matter.  I am prepared to have such a personal discussion with him at any time.  Because this is a commodity subject to review I do not think public discussion is likely to be helpful to the people making the commodity.</P>
    <P>Deputy Morrissey raised the question which is always inseparable from the situation where you have got a protective industry wanting to import commodities and inquiring whether these goods could be imported.  I think a good deal of that is necessary. There may be cases&mdash;I have come across some of them&mdash;where a firm which wishes to import a commodity sometimes wholly or sometimes as part of a bigger piece of machinery wants to ascertain from the manufacturer of <Col N="377" /> the microscopic piece of a big machine whether they can supply the microscopic part.</P>
    <P>In many cases, because of our practice in following a certain procedure over the years, some people anxious to purchase machinery which is only an infinitesimal portion of their finished product have been given a most irritating and frustrating run round.  While the machine lies in the dock the cost of making the part might give employment to one while the idle machine might give employment to 100.</P>
    <P>It is not easy to find such difficult cases in shoals in respect of which one could say that a certain procedure should be adopted but it would appear to be irritating to have to ask a firm to find out from a possible manufacturer whether they can or cannot supply a commodity, when they can supply such a commodity and at what price.  The procedure should be modified as much as possible, particularly where trivial articles are concerned. There is no assurance at all&mdash;and this has been brought home rather forcibly to me&mdash;that a firm which does not make a commodity is going to give a high priority in dealing with a letter which merely asks if it can supply this commodity and at what cost.  But the unfortunate importer here, waiting for the commodities out of customs, has to wait until the firm across the water wakes up to the desirability of extending the courtesy of a reply to the inquiring firm's letter.</P>
    <P>I think there would be common agreement that these irritations and frustrations should be eliminated as much as possible and I have certainly endeavoured to do that in my relatively brief time in the Department of Industry and Commerce.  On the question of the ability to purchase satisfactory materials from an Irish manufacturer of goods for the export market, I have a lot of sympathy with Deputy Morrissey because if a firm has to produce the finished article for sale in the export market it is necessary, in order to maintain his efficiency and skill, to produce a perfect article. The sole determining feature of that is the appearance of the finished article <Col N="378" />&mdash;the sole determining feature as to the article's appeal to the importer in another country.</P>
    <P>Very often a firm may get as its raw materials badly finished or unfinished articles which form a necessary part of the completely manufactured commodity which he produces for export, and unless all the materials which go into the finished article tot up to give a satisfactorily finished product, the firm which finally does the exporting is at a considerable disadvantage with its competitors.  That is not an insoluble problem.  It has been the practice to permit a firm to buy its raw materials from outside the country and to permit its access to the best and most suitable type of raw material knowing that if we are to hold our place on the highly competitive export market this must occur.  I think Deputy Morrissey, when Minister for Industry and Commerce, my predecessor and myself have all in turn taken the view that the exporter of a commodity must be given every facility to get the best raw material to produce at the cheapest possible price the most efficient and most attractive article. The problems envisaged by Deputy Morrissey are soluble by a resort to that procedure and there is no reason why it cannot be adopted in any of the cases he has in mind.  Deputy Lemass raised the question of the Avoca mines.</P>

      <P>The Deputy did not do too badly.  From the point of view of the Bill we are discussing the Deputy was allowed to go further than any other Deputy in the past 30 years.  In a Press interview which I gave following the conclusion of an agreement with the Canadian mining group I said on behalf of the Government that legislation would be introduced to provide certain tax concessions for the exploiting of the Avoca mineral deposits.  That would apply not merely to Avoca but to any new group going into the production of non-bedded minerals which started operations within three years.  I felt that if we are to get development here on a satisfactory scale we have got to <Col N="379" /> amend our tax laws in regard to the exploitation of metallic ores.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>On the general question of efforts to establish industries in this country, I had hoped that 33 years after we had got power to regulate our own affairs and order our own individual lives here within the limits of the jurisdiction of this Parliament we would be well on the way towards having agreement so far as industrial policy is concerned. I think the most unsettling and the most mischievous situation to have in this country is one in which industrialists believe that there is going to be <Col N="382" /> any vital change of policy with the change from one Government to another.</P>
    <P>I think it is essential that we should give over all the artificialities which produce these artificial alignments and settle down now after 33 years of native Government to evolving a national industrial policy in which there will be a broad understanding that certain things are desirable and that the approach to the problem of industrial development will not change with the change of Government; that if there is to be any disagreement it will only be as to the rate of acceleration of our industrial development and at this stage that no question of the wisdom of going on with it will be permitted to arise and become a serious factor in our discussions here.  Is it not clear that there is agreement among all Parties in this country that we must establish more industries here for two reasons&mdash;(1) to provide ourselves with goods which we now import, (2) to provide employment for our people, and arising out of these, to provide greater wealth for the nation as a whole?</P>
    <P>Can we, on both sides of the House now, in 1955 get agreement that that is a desirable national policy and can we tell our present industrialists, potential industrialists here or elsewhere that so far as anybody starting a new industry in this country is concerned he can always look forward to the help, guidance and assistance of whatever Government happens to be in power in this country?  Is that ideal impossible of attainment?  Is it possible to get agreement on that to-day so as to take this question of industrial development out of the acrimonious atmosphere in which one Party tries to score over another in regard to matters that are raised from time to time as regards whether a particular situation will continue if a particular Government is in power?  I do not think there is any great difficulty in getting agreement on these broad lines, and having got the agreement we should not be tempted to make Party capital out of this matter or that, out of this issue or that issue because the fundamental is so desirable&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is our duty to establish more industries we must ask ourselves: Where are we going to get them and how are we going to get them?  We have had 33 years to establish industries in this country.  During that period&mdash;I think this will not be denied&mdash;we applied ourselves to establishing the industries which were easiest to establish.  We established industries which, in a goodly number of cases, were of fabricated or partly fabricated articles.  These articles came in here and so the production of the actual raw material was not necessary here.  We established quite a considerable number of assembly industries here without getting down to producing the basic materials, metal or textile, which were an essential part of the development of the industry.  In a whole variety of ways we established industries which were not the most difficult to establish, here or in any <Col N="384" /> other country.  Take, for instance, the case of the gentleman making his models with two or three people employed, and you will have some idea of instances in which we wasted time when we should not have wasted time.</P>
      <P>The big problem now is from what source are we going to get the technical know-how to establish the industries which, after 33 years of sustained effort, we have failed to establish.  For 19 of these 33 years that effort was under the personal supervision of Deputy Lemass.  I am not blaming Deputy Lemass.  As Minister for Industry and Commerce Deputy Lemass did everything in his power to establish here any industry that could possibly be established here.  After 33 years there is still a substantial number of industries not in existence in this country and tens of millions of pounds' worth of manufactured goods flow in through our ports or over our land frontiers.  The problem to-day is whether we can find the ways and means to employ our people and to manufacture these goods in this country instead of exporting our capital and labour to manufacture them in some other country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only answering Deputy Lemass because he was permitted by the Ceann Comhairle to raise these matters.  He asked me to make a clear statement on the question of what were the facilities to be afforded to outside industrialists to manufacture commodities here.  I do not know whether he wants clarification on this matter.  I have put forward my point of view on it in speeches which I have made and which have appeared in the newspapers.  They have appeared in the <i>Irish Press</i> and I do Deputy Lemass the honour of believing that he reads that paper.  I have made it quite clear that my aim is to induce <Col N="385" /> outside industrialists to come in here and to manufacture commodities which we do not produce here at present.</P>
      <P>I have said to Irish industrialists and in my public pronouncements that, so far as I am concerned, in implementing that policy, it will not operate in any way to expose the present Irish manufacturer, who is supplying the needs of the home market, to competition from a powerful external firm which might want to go into the manufacture of the same commodity.  I would prefer to see Irish manufacturers producing the commodities which they do not now produce, and I will give every possible facility to the efficient and realistic production of goods in Ireland by Irish manufacturers for sale here.</P>
      <P>I assure such Irish manufacturers that they will get my warm and most sympathetic consideration, but if we cannot, for a variety of reasons, induce Irish manufacturers to engage in the manufacture of these commodities here, then we have to go out and find the technical know-how in order to have such commodities made here.  Where can we get the technical know-how?  Only from the people who have it.  If these people are not in Ireland, then we have to go elsewhere &mdash;to Britain, the European countries and the United States&mdash;and endeavour to induce people in these countries to come in here and fill the vacuum created by our own inability to supply the goods we are not now making.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Irish industrialist can provide the commodities here in Ireland, then my view is that he ought to get every encouragement to do that, so long as it is a worthwhile realistic proposition which will ensure the development of Irish industries at home.  It is in pursuance of that policy that I have endeavoured to induce industrialists from other countries to come here.  I have had discussions with the British Trade Commission in an effort to induce British industrialists to come here and manufacture commodities which are not made here.  Similar discussions have taken place with industrialists in other countries, the aim <Col N="386" /> being to establish more industries here and provide more employment for our people.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass raised the question of branch industries but I do not think there is any technical definition of a branch industry here.  I think it is desirable to get industrialists from outside to establish factories here for the supply of commodities to the home market, No. 1, and to the export market, No. 2&mdash;to see if there can be a bridgehead or a foothold to be got into the export market with the possibility of expanding it.  If industrialists willing to do that come here from England they will be as welcome as if they came from Germany or anywhere else. The main concern is to establish the industries here.</P>
    <P>There are many lads catching a boat, probably to-night, looking for a job in England, who would not be particular whether the industry in Ireland was a branch industry or not, if they could get a job in it instead of having to go to England and find a factory.  With what emigration we have had over the past 30 years we have got to make up our minds that employment must be provided in Ireland for our people.  It is all right to talk about emigration but we must have employment to give our people, either in the factories, on the farm or in the public service.  We must find the work for them where we can.  It is essential to do that if we are going to stop the hæmorrhage of the best blood of our men and women who cannot find the where withal to sustain themselves here.  I think I have the goodwill of the House behind me in this matter and the goodwill of all political Parties.  This is a matter which transcends all political Parties and is more important than the scoring of debating points in the House.  For my part I would always applaud any Government which was taking responsibility for taking an Irish lad or an Irish girl out of an emigrant ship and keeping him or her in employment in Ireland.</P>
    <P>If any of the Deputies on the other side of the House or on this side of the House want to test that in their <Col N="387" /> constituencies, they have ways and means of doing it.  I bet that the overwhelming majority of our people will approve any kind of policy, almost, which offers employment for Irish men and women in their own land.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is necessary to pursue this matter further.  I hope that what I have said will dissipate the last of the mists of fog which have been created on this whole question. I would conclude, again putting this emphasis on what I say: so far as I am concerned, the aim will be to establish as many industries as possible here to provide employment for our people and the emphasis will be on encouraging Irish industrialists to undertake the establishment of these industries but, if they cannot or will not do it, we must get industrialists elsewhere in order to provide a livelihood for our people.</P>
    <P>I think I have dealt with all the points which have been raised in the course of this discussion and I would ask the House to approve the Second Reading of the Bill.</P>
    <P>May I put this consideration to Deputy Lemass?  The Bill has to be passed by the Seanad on the 13th or 14th of this month and I was hoping, therefore, that he might co-operate in permitting the passage of this customary Bill at this stage.  If the Deputy wants any discussion with me on the other point that he raised I will be only too glad to put him in possession of all the facts relative to that case but if the Deputy insists on his parliamentary right, which I frankly acknowledge, I do not mind dealing with it in a Committee Stage.</P>

The measure is introduced in pursuance of the policy of providing in permanent legislation where necessary for matters which have been dealt with under the Supplies and Services Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first question dealt with by the Bill is the carriage of milk to creameries and cream separating stations and the carriage of empty containers and separated milk back to the milk producers.  The collection of milk for delivery to creameries and the return of empty containers to the farmers present special difficulties and the public transport concerns have not found that the work is an economic proposition for them.  The bulk of the milk has to be collected in small quantities, often from farms in isolated areas served by bad roads.  Generally, <Col N="389" /> collection areas are far removed from central transport depots and the collection of the milk and return of the empty cans by the public transport companies would require the traversing of very extensive areas with unladen or partially laden vehicles.  Milk collection furnishes only spasmodic part-time employment for vehicles and is not of a nature suitable for integration with other local public transport, particularly as collection may have to be arranged outside normal working hours.</P>
    <P>Up to recent years the horse and cart was principally used by farmers or others for the transport of their own and their neighbours' milk to the creameries and no difficulty arose under the Road Transport Acts.  With the growing use of tractors and trailers and the reduction in the number of horses it became necessary to exempt this work from the provisions of the Road Transport Acts.  An Order to this effect has been made annually since 1949 under the Supplies and Services (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1946. It is proposed to continue this exemption and to embody it in permanent legislation.</P>
    <P>The carriage of wheat by licensed agents for licensed mills presents a special problem.  Prior to 1942 wheat was purchased on their own account by licensed wheat dealers who transported it in their own lorries and then sold it to the millers.  The dealers did not require licences under the Road Transport Acts for the transport of the wheat as it was their own property. New arrangements for the purchase of wheat were introduced in 1942 and under these arrangements the wheat dealers purchased the wheat in the capacity of agents for the millers. The wheat did not become their property and the transport of the wheat by them constituted carriage for reward.  Since 1942 an Emergency Powers Order was made annually to allow the wheat dealers to continue to carry the wheat in their own lorries without a licence under the Road Transport Acts.  It is proposed to provide power to exempt the carriage of wheat by licensed agents in the same way as has been done over a <Col N="390" /> number of years by Emergency Powers Order.</P>
    <P>When the Road Transport Acts were enacted in the early thirties the need for a safety valve in the legislation was not foreseen.  Experience during the war and succeeding years has shown that circumstances may arise when it would be necessary in the public interest to relax the control of carriage for reward embodied in the Road Transport Acts so as to avoid a serious crisis in the supply or transport of some important commodity. At present the only means of doing so would be an Order made under the Supplies and Services (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1946.  Provision is accordingly made in this Bill to enable the Government to make an Order exempting for a specified period the carriage of any particular commodity should this appear to them to be necessary in the interests of public safety or the preservation of the State or for maintaining supplies and services essential to the life of the community.</P>
    <P>The final provision of the Bill relates to some branch line train services which have been discontinued.  Under the authority of an Emergency Powers Order made in December, 1944, C.I.E. reduced or discontinued services on 20 branch lines.  Section 55 of the Transport Act, 1950, provides that the services temporarily reduced or discontinued under this Emergency Powers Order shall not be permanently discontinued save in accordance with an Order made by the Transport Tribunal.  The legal position is, therefore, that unless an Order has been made by the Transport Tribunal authorising the permanent discontinuance or reduction of a service, the relaxation of the obligation to provide transport services which existed prior to the 1944 Emergency Powers Order is dependent on the provision in the Supplies and Services Act.  Applications in respect of ten of the 20 branch lines concerned have already been dealt with by the tribunal.  C.I.E. have now decided, however, to defer any further applications to the tribunal for the time being.  They propose to carry out experiments in the working of <Col N="391" /> branch lines with light weight diesel trains, aimed at the more economic operation of branch line services.</P>
    <P>Their future policy regarding the operation of branch lines will be determined in the light of the outcome of these experiments which will take some years to complete.  In the meantime it is proposed by means of this Bill that C.I.E. should not be obliged to restore services reduced or discontinued under the authority of the Emergency Powers Order on branch lines in respect of which applications have not been dealt with by the tribunal.  The obligation would revive three years after the coming into operation of the Bill except in the case of any line in respect of which C.I.E. had in the meantime made application to the Transport Tribunal.  The obligation of C.I.E. would then be determined by the findings of the tribunal. There is also provision to allow by special Order an additional period not exceeding two years in case the period of three years should prove too short.</P>
    <P>In recommending this Bill to the House I have every confidence that no Deputy will object to the continuance of provisions which although originally embodied in emergency regulations are still of value to the public.  This Bill, in short, is necessitated by the fact that it is desired to embody in permanent legislation powers which now reside in the Supplies and Services Act as part of the general policy of substituting that Act by permanent legislation dealing with the same subjects.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>Agreed to take the remaining stages to-day.</P>

      <Col N="392" /> In the definition of &ldquo;gaming&rdquo;, line 19, to insert after &ldquo;game&rdquo; the following:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(whether of skill or chance or partly of skill and partly of chance)&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is a drafting amendment of the definition of gaming and its purpose is important.  It removes from any possibility of doubt in anyone's mind that when we come later in Section 4 to define unlawful gaming we are referring to games of skill as well as games of chance.</P>

      <P>There are two kinds of slot-machines dealt with in the Bill.  The kind which is absolutely prohibited under Section 9 and the other kind dealt with in Section 4, under the heading of unlawful gaming.

      <P>In page 3, between lines 38 and 39, to insert a new definition as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;stake&rdquo; includes any payment for the right to take part in a game and any other form of payment required to be made as a condition of taking part in the game but does not include a payment made solely for facilities provided for the playing of the game;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is one of the drafting amendments I referred to in moving amendment No. 1.  As I explained then, it is in the interests of clarification and furthermore, it is necessary in order to bring within the provisions of unlawful gaming a type of competition devised since the Bill was circulated which would enable a person on buying an article, such as a song sheet, to become <Col N="393" /> eligible to take part in a game for prizes without directly hazarding a stake.</P>

      <P>The definition of &ldquo;lottery&rdquo; in the Bill sets out that it includes all competition for money or money's worth involving forecasts of future events or of past events, the results of which are not yet ascertained or not yet generally known, and I suggest that the Minister should alter that definition.  It is not possible, I respectfully submit, to forecast a result which has not yet been ascertained but may possibly be generally known, and how the Minister can argue under this definition that a forecast can be made of a past event is beyond me.  The definition here suggests that a past event can be forecast, which is ridiculous.  The definition also says: &ldquo;the results of which are not yet ascertained or not yet generally known&rdquo;, and I take exception to the phrase &ldquo;generally known&rdquo;. It suggests that some people may know the result of a race or some other such event.</P>

      <P>I trust Deputy O'Malley will not misunderstand me, but I do not think there is anything in the point he has put.  However, I am sure the Minister will have it examined by the draftsman to see if there is any possibility of a loophole.  The forecasting of past events does, of course, sound rather peculiar; but it is conceivable that some people might have a little pool or lottery in a public-house on what happened in America two or three hours earlier; they would not know the result, and that would clearly be a lottery because the result would not be known generally.  But somebody in America might know the result and it is to catch that sort of thing that the definition is framed in this particular way.  Really the definition is put in to catch all sorts of evasions which might take place if the word &ldquo;lottery&rdquo; was not defined in the widest possible way.</P>
      <P>In considering this Bill, it should be kept clearly in mind&mdash;I mention this because I found it difficult to understand the Bill until I got this clearly into my mind&mdash;that lottery includes games of skill as well as games of chance.  Hitherto the accepted definition of lottery was the forecasting or deciding of something by lot or chance and the usual defence in a prosecution was to establish that the game involved a large element of skill. In order to prevent that element coming in it was decided in this Bill to have a general definition of &ldquo;lottery&rdquo; to cover everything, even where skill is involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 4 to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>4.&mdash;(1)  No person shall promote or assist in promoting or provide facilities for any kind of gaming&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  in which by reason of the nature of the game, the chances of all the players, including the banker, are not equal, or</P>
      <P>(b)  in which any portion of the stakes is retained by the promoter or is retained by the banker otherwise than as winnings on the result of the play, or,</P>
      <P>(c)  by means of any slot-machine not prohibited by Section 9.</P>
      <P>(2)  Such gaming is in this Act referred to as unlawful gaming.</P>
      <P>(3)  Gaming shall not be unlawful if no stake is hazarded by the players with the promoter or banker other than a charge for the right to take part in the game, provided that&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  only one such charge is made in respect of the day on which the game is played, and</P>
      <P>(b)  the charge is of the same amount for all the players, and</P>
      <P>(c)  the promoter derives no personal profit from the promotion of the game.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sub-section (1) prohibits any person from promoting or assisting in promoting or providing facilities for unlawful <Col N="396" /> gaming.  The House will observe that the offence is not for unlawful games but for the promoting or providing of assistance in unlawful games. The person we want to get after under these gaming provision is the fellow who runs a gambling school or a gambling saloon for his own personal profit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that the definition of gaming must have given the draftsmen considerable difficulty.  There is a doubt in my mind in relation to this proposed Section 4. The Minister has made it clear that the object of the section is to catch promoters of certain types of gaming. One of the types specified in sub-section (b) is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;in which any portion of the stakes is retained by the promoter or is retained by the banker otherwise than as winnings on the result of the play, or&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It seems to me that proprietors of golf clubs might be promoting gaming where sweepstakes are held on matches and such proprietors could conceivably be caught under this section inasmuch as they would be promoting gaming in which portion of the stakes is retained by them since it is not unusual for a club to retain part of such sweepstakes as a means of augmenting the income of the club.</P>
      <P>In a later sub-section it is proposed not to make such an eventuality illegal.  Sub-section (3) provides:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Gaming shall not be unlawful if no stake is hazarded by the players with the promoter or banker.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the sub-section were left like that that would probably obviate the difficulty I have in mind; but the sub-section goes on to say: &ldquo;Provided that (a) only one such charge is made in respect of the day on which the game is played.&rdquo;  Deputies who have a certain amount of experience of sweepstake competitions in golf clubs know that it is quite a common practice for two cards to be put in by players.  It seems to me that if a player puts in two cards&mdash;he will be charged twice&mdash; the committee promoting the match may be involved in an unlawful gaming <Col N="397" /> enterprise.  I would like the Minister to look into this and, if possible, make the section a little clearer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I too have some doubts like Deputy Declan Costello. Sub-section (1) states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>No person shall promote or assist in promoting or provide facilities for any kind of gaming&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  in which by reason of the nature of the game, the chances of all the players, including the banker, are not equal.</P>
      <P>Is it lawful, or will it be lawful, in the Minister's opinion, if it can be proved that the chances of all the players taking part in the game and the banker are equal?  That is the first point.  If the chances are equal, will the game be lawful?  The word &ldquo;or&rdquo; occurs at the end of that sub-section.  I think that should be &ldquo;and&rdquo;.  Sub-section (b) states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;... in which any portion of the stakes is retained by the promoter or is retained by the banker otherwise than as winnings on the result of the play.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>To my mind that is very ambiguous. In sub-section (3) (a) it is stipulated:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Only one such charge is made in respect of the day on which the game is played.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>A charge of £5 or £10 could be made by a club providing the necessary facilities.  In other words, what I am pointing out is that a group of promoters could make a very heavy charge of, say, £3, £5 or even £10 to run a gambling school such as poker, forty-five or whist.  The Minister made very clear, when he introduced the Bill, what exactly he had in mind, but I think that the Minister should make this section much more specific.</P>
      <P>Amendment put and agreed to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="398" /> To delete paragraph (b) and substitute:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(b)  the gaming does not extend over a period exceeding ten days and has not been carried on during the preceding three months as part of the show when being held at that place or anywhere within three miles of that place, and</P>
    <P>There are two reasons for the amendment. The first is to make it quite clear that in this Bill we are concerned only with gaming at these shows: we are not concerned with the shows themselves and accordingly they can continue as long as the owners want to stay, provided the gaming does not go on for more than ten days.</P>
    <P>The extension of the period from a week to ten days is the second point. The representatives of travelling showmen asked for an extension so that they could stay over a second weekend. The amendment is designed to enable them to do so and I recommend it to the House.  The draftsman has also taken the opportunity to alter the wording a little as some Deputies found that the reference to &ldquo;area&rdquo; in the section as introduced was confusing.</P>
    <P>I should like to add a word on the substance of this provision.  It is designed to deal with a particular type of show&mdash;the circus or travelling show which stays only a short time in any one place.  The object of the provision is to let such a showman have some games of chance&mdash;and some lotteries also as will appear later&mdash; without any formality.  Some Deputies may say: &ldquo;Why not let him stay a month or two or three if he wants to?&rdquo; My answer is that if he wants to stay a long time, and wants to carry on gaming all the time, there are other provisions in the Bill to provide for him: he is not the type of showman for which this particular section caters. I am satisfied from my discussions with showmen that there are a number of showmen to whom this section will apply, and I suggest to the House that because of the nature of their business they can and should be exempt from the requirements which the bigger showman who stays for a longer period must be asked to comply with.  If the <Col N="399" /> period were extended to, say, a month, we obviously would have to impose the same restrictions as on carnivals&mdash;and that is not going to help the showmen concerned at all: quite the contrary.</P>
    <P>Acceptance of my amendment involves rejection of amendments Nos. 6, 7 and 8 put down by Deputy Moran.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">

      <P>This stipulation recurs in other sections.  As the Minister mentioned, 10/- is odds of 20 to 1 when 6d. is the maximum stake.  But the fantastic position arises in these pongo parlours where anything from 150 to 200 players participate in the more popular seaside resorts.  Does the Minister appreciate the fact that if 200 players pay 6d. each, the promoter takes £4 10s. out of each game and that all the unfortunate patron gets is 10/-?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="402" /> The Minister's statement, that he is getting odds of 20 to 1 is correct, but this is in my opinion most unjust, and if the Minister is attempting to give amusement to people and at the same time couple that with some justice, then he is not achieving his purpose. If there is an average of 40 games in a night one could lose 10/- on the night.  Against that if the promoter with 200 players in an average size arcade has 40 games, he takes his £4 10s. out of each game and will so get £180 altogether.  Is not that the position?  It is no wonder that some people in the amusement arcades were delighted with some of these provisions.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Malley is quite incorrect in saying that revenue from either horse or greyhound racing is derived purposefully and by way of recognising horse-racing and dog-racing and thereby recognising gambling. The amount of revenue that is got is only incidental.  The purpose of the revenue and the purpose of dealing with the greyhound racing by the tote is&mdash;so far as horse-racing is concerned &mdash;to encourage the bloodstock industry and in the case of the dogs to see if <Col N="405" /> we can regulate greyhound racing in the interests of the public generally.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that the amendment has been brought in in order to cut out gambling as far as the poorer section of the community is concerned.  I am sure the Minister can produce any number of letters in connection with widows who have been left without anything for themselves and their children because of this terrible game of pongo.  That, I understand, is one of the reasons why this particular section has been introduced to this Bill&mdash;to prevent people from spending all their wages on a game of pongo.  Yet we have bookmakers' offices scattered all over the country and only last week I saw applications by three different individuals to set up fresh bookmakers' offices in an already overcrowded area.</P>
      <P>In these bookmakers' offices a man can gamble away his whole week's wages and leave his wife and family without anything to live on for the remainder of the week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, if a poor family go to the sea and if the mother and <Col N="407" /> father and the older children go to an establishment where pongo is played, they go there to meet their friends and have a friendly chat.  There is some kind of social amenity in this but, nevertheless, they have to be saved from themselves by limiting the amount of money they can make in a bet.  I am not objecting to placing a limit on the amount they can bet, but I have not heard any serious reason advanced why there should be any limit on the amount they can win. If there is a feeling in the House that there should be a limit surely the amount of 10/- is a partly one when the value of the £1 to-day is only 8/6 in comparison with what it was in 1938.</P>
    <P>The place where pongo is played performs a social function in many areas and I think it is far better to have people going into such places and spending a few bob and perhaps winning a £1 or 30/- than to have them going into a bookmaker's shop and losing all their wages and leaving their wives and children without means of subsistence.  If we are serious about preventing gambling why not tackle the matter at the proper point?  Do not attack that section of the community which is the weakest and the most vulnerable.</P>
    <P>I know well that if the Government is serious about tackling gambling they will keep far away from the bookmakers because these people can protect themselves and they form another very strong vested interest.  If we have these strong vested interest talking back to the Government they will be listened to, but there is nobody to speak for the poor individual who walks into a pongo school and lays a bet of 6d. and then is told by the proprietor that by law 10/- is all that he can win.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>You are still encouraging gambling.  It must be remembered, as I say in connection with the misapprehension, that at the present moment all this kind of thing is illegal.  We could have left them there and not brought this Bill in at all.  What we are doing is providing reasonable facilities under the law so that the law will not be brought into disrepute as it has been in the past by the law being enforced in some places and not in others.  We are giving a position where people can come into a particular circus or show, knowing that they are doing something legal, something reasonable and something which is not encouraging gambling.</P>
      <P>Deputies must make up their minds whether they want to encourage gambling or not.  If they want to discourage gambling for high stakes and to leave the position where there will be a reasonable amount of amusement without the excitement of heavy gambling, I suggest the section in the Bill is the proper approach.  The House should make its choice.  To bring in the number of betting shops that there are around the country or the fact that betting on horse-racing is allowed is entirely irrelevant to the present consideration.</P>
      <P>My recollection is that the imposition of the duty on bets and the provisions in regard to betting shops were brought in, not for the purpose, primarily, of raising revenue, although it did that incidentally and does it now, but for the purpose of regulating something which was going on anyway in an illicit fashion and bringing it out into the open.  Before the betting tax was put on there were, as we knew as students&mdash;I knew&mdash;betting men around the corners of the streets, taking slips and going to the bookies.</P>

      <P>The second point is this: pongo places are not full all the time.  The seats around the table are not fully taken up.  Very often the proprietor has to put up the prize to attract a crowd and he gets very little out of it. He is not operating the whole year round, whereas the betting shop is operating the whole year round.</P>

      <P>Judging by this debate it would appear that some Deputies never play pongo.  Pongo is another name for house, which has always been condemned in this country.  The game is called pongo, baseball, lineup and by other names in order to get around the difficulty.  When there is a small crowd at a pongo stall in a carnival the cards are only 2d. and the proprietor gets half the collection and puts so much into the pool.  If the pool is not won to-night, the crowd goes back on the following night.  I have known cases where the cards were anything from 6d. to 1/-.  When pongo started first there was a limit to the number of cards of 38.  As time went on there was no limit on the cards and the showman had the big advantage, instead of the people who were playing.  That is the case at every show, even those organised for charity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Forget about the seaside for the moment.  Think of towns where charity bazaars were organised.  Men and women were losing their wages, playing up to one o'clock at night, waiting for the shilling card or trying to win the pool.  That is why some protection for these people is necessary. In the city and towns and throughout the country pongo is played under various names and the working people are fleeced.  I often lost 50/-.  One night there were two <Col N="410" /> of us to divide the prize.  I got 5/- and my partner got 5/-.  There could be 100 cards out.  That is where you need the protection, to limit the number. In that way you would be doing something to help the player.  The showman should not be allowed to issue up to 80 cards and give only the same prize as he would give if there were 30 people playing.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to horse-racing and dog-racing.  The poor people that I have in mind do not attend such race meetings.  It costs 10/- to go into the ring and therefore the workers do not go there.  It costs 2/6 to get into a greyhound track. These two things are entirely different from pongo.  They were legalised by the Fianna Fáil Government and betting shops were licensed.</P>

If you are serious about doing away with gambling, why not limit the stake to 3d. and leave the 10/-?  I have played pongo and I think the fairest way is that the prize would be limited according to the number of players and the number of stakes received.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 14:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 8 to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>8.&mdash;(1) In this section&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;qualified individual&rdquo; means an individual who, during the period of 12 months preceding a given date, has had his usual or principal place of residence in the State;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;qualified company&rdquo; means a body corporate in the case of which both a majority of the members and a majority of the persons exercising control and management are qualified individuals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2) Nothing in Section 6 or Section 7 shall render it lawful for a person <Col N="414" /> to promote, assist in promoting or provide facilities for gaming to which Section 4 applies unless&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) that person is a qualified individual or a qualified company, and</P>
    <P>(b)  if that person is acting on behalf of another person, that other person is also a qualified individual or a qualified company or an unincorporated body of persons, each member of which is a qualified individual.</P>
    <P>(3) This section does not apply to an individual who is merely assisting in the promotion of gaming in accordance with a contract of service.</P>
    <P>This amendment proposes to put in a residence qualification for persons promoting gaming at travelling shows, carnivals and so on.  There is another amendment, amendment No. 20, to be moved later, the effect of which will be to apply the same test to applicants for licences for amusement halls and funfairs. The need for a residence qualification arises from the very nature of the business; the promotion of gaming is particularly open to sharp practice and fraud.  It is, therefore, desirable that those engaged in this business should be living here, so that if there are grounds for criminal proceedings or grounds for complaint, the person concerned will be available to answer.</P>

      <P>Before sub-section (3) to insert the following new sub-section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>( ) This section does not apply to the playing of a game where no stake is hazarded by the players other than a charge for the right to take part in the game, provided that&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  only one such charge is made in respect of the day on which the game is played, and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b) the charge is of the same amount for all the players, and <Col N="415" /> (c) the promoter (if any) derives no personal profit from the promotion of the game.</P>
    <P>As Section 8 stood, the prohibition on gaming, defined in Section 2, on licensed premises might be held to include the playing of collective games, such as whist or bridge drives, or darts or ring competitions which are generally promoted for charitable or sociable purposes.  This amendment will enable games played in such circumstances to be carried on without infringing the law.</P>

    <P>The words to which I object are &ldquo;has had his usual or principal place of residence in the State&rdquo;.

I submit that the present definition is much too lax and ambiguous and will give rise to a lot of difficulties.  For instance, if a very big English bookmaker has a mansion down in Buckinghamshire and another <Col N="416" /> mansion in Ballsbridge, which is his principal place of residence?</P>

      <P>I think it is going to ease a few people out of the licensed premises.  When speaking on the Second Reading the Minister said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Section 8, which prohibits gaming on licensed premises, and Section 10 which provides penalties for cheating, are simply restating existing law.  It is intended, however, that where there is only one charge in respect of the day on which the game is played, the charge will not constitute part of the stakes hazarded by the player and in consequence playing of games such as whist or rings or darts, in which there are no side-stakes, but in which the player hazards his entry fee in a competition to win a prize will not come within the definition of gaming and will not be prohibited on licensed premises.  This is simply a case of removing the technical offence which is at present committed by the operation of some of these harmless games in public-houses, licensed hotels and clubs.&rdquo;</P>

    <P>This is a drafting amendment and the purpose of it is to make quite clear that the section does not prohibit all <Col N="419" /> slot machines used for gaming.  Slot machines not used for gaming are not, of course, affected by the Bill.  There is no ground for believing that machines used for the sale of cigarettes or chocolates are prohibited. The Bill prohibits only those slot machines which deliver cash prizes or tokens, which the promoter undertakes to exchange for cash or which would operate the machine again; in other words, the Bill prohibits machines such as the &ldquo;Bell-fruit&rdquo; machine; it prohibits them whether operated in the ordinary way or by a token coin.</P>

      <P>(3) It shall be a condition of the grant of a certificate that music or announcements of any kind whatsoever shall not be broadcast by any method from an amusement hall so as to be audible outside such amusement hall.</P>
      <P>The wording of the amendment may not be altogether satisfactory.  It is not my intention to interfere with fancy fairs or carnivals which broadcast from fields or public parks.  The case I have in mind is that affecting the city business centre.  In O'Connell Street at night one will hear a musical broadcast from one of the principle restaurant windows in order to draw attention to the trade.  This is not a very pleasant practice.  Down in Talbot Street there are two public halls vying with one another in trying to attract patrons.  There, music is blared forth from morning until night and the result is that the ordinary business people cannot carry on their trade to their satisfaction. This is a great nuisance to traders.  I appeal to the Minister to consider the matter and take some steps to stop this interference with traders in the centre of the city.  I do not want to interfere with the musical attractions provided at seaside resorts during the holiday period but I do not think this practice should be permitted in the heart of the city.  It is disconcerting to find this practice in the principal street in Ireland, O'Connell Street. There should be some method of control. Another type of business has crept into Grafton Street.  I refer to the public auction.</P>

There is something in the Minister's amendment that would leave it to the discretion of the courts but I cannot see from a practical viewpoint why the certificate should not run for the whole year in the same way as dance-hall licences run for 12 months.  I would suggest to the Minister that in the interest of uniformity the section would specify a yearly licence.</P>
      <P>I would suggest there is no good reason against that.  If there is one thing more than anything else that tends to bring the law into disrespect it is to have different interpretations given on similar issues by different district justices.  This House is the place in which the period of the licence should be defined and I see no reason why the House should not do so; I can see no reason why it should be left to the discretion of the district justices to interpret the period during which a licence should run because from a practical point of view the place to decide the duration of the licence is here.  We should not leave it, willy-nilly, to the discretion of every district justice throughout the land.</P>

      <P>I think it was not intended that any disrespect should be shown to Deputy Moran's point.  I think it was decided it was better to leave it to the District Court to fix the period of the certificate rather than to have us here putting down our foot about a certain period which would cover the entire country.  Such a decision of ours would cover different areas where different conditions obtain. In some parts of the country a month might be adequate while in others 12 months might be desirable.  Interested <Col N="424" /> parties, we thought, might make a case in the courts.  In the City of Dublin there are certain hall owners who want to stay open all the year round. They can go into the court and make the case that this has been the practice for years and that it should continue. They can give their reasons to the court.  You have remote country areas where a month might be sufficient and I think if Deputy Moran goes into the thing carefully he will see it is better that there should be different periods for different areas because the circumstances alter according to the different parts of the country.  Anybody interested who has a case for a 12 months' licence can make it before the judicial authority.</P>

      <P>I would again ask the Minister to consider the point I raised and have an amendment brought in on Report Stage.  I believe serious consideration should be given to the desirability of having these licences run for a year and not to leave the matter to the discretion of the different district justices.  I can see the point the Taoiseach has made, particularly in relation to Dublin, where this thing has been going on for years, but the point is that by this Bill we are legalising something that up to the moment was held to be illegal.  I think there should be uniformity as to the duration of these licences.  I think the Taoiseach's point does not apply here because I suggest that in this <Col N="425" /> Bill we are taking steps to legalise something that has been accepted for 100 years as illegal.  We are creating a new law and I suggest the duration of the licence should be the same as in the case of dance-hall licences.  We all know that different district justices have different views and different approaches.  You have some district justices who look upon pongo or roulette as being worse than original sin, whereas you have another justice who possibly himself has played the games and regards them as harmless.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 26:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 15 to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>15.&mdash;(1) No application for an amusement caterer's licence (other than a temporary amusement caterer's licence for a defined period not exceeding two months) shall be <Col N="426" /> made or entertained unless the person making such application has, at least one month before the hearing of such application, published a notice of his intention to make such application in a newspaper circulating in the district in which is situate the place to which such application relates.</P>
    <P>(2) Every person applying to the District Court for the grant of an amusement caterer's licence shall&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  in case of an application for a temporary amusement caterer's licence for a definite period not exceeding two months give to the superintendent of the Garda Síochána and the secretary or town clerk of any public authority within whose district and whose functional area respectively is situate the place to which such application relates at least seven days' notice in writing of such application, and</P>
    <P>(b)  in every other case, give at least six weeks' notice in writing to the superintendent of the Garda Síochána within whose district and to the public authority within whose functional area is situate the place to which such application relates.</P>
    <P>(3) The notices specified in subsections (1) and (2) hereof shall state the number and kinds of games proposed to be carried on and the other forms of amusement to be provided.</P>
    <P>This goes back to what I suggested here on the Second Stage.  My reason for putting down this amendment is to point out to the House that under Section 15 the procedure prescribed would in my opinion be unworkable, that is that &ldquo;the intending applicant for a certificate shall give 28 days' notice in writing of his intention to each local authority within whose administrative area the premises to which the application relates are situate and to the superintendent of the Garda Síochána for the locality&rdquo;, and that &ldquo;the notice shall state the number and kinds of games proposed to be carried on and the other forms of amusement to be provided&rdquo;, and that <Col N="427" />&ldquo;the applicant shall also cause a notice of his intention to be published at least 14 days before the hearing in a newspaper circulating in the locality&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This would mean that the intending applicant for this licence would have to start off by giving one month's notice to each local authority, and that might mean a county council, an urban council and town commissioners, and to the superintendent of the Gardaí. Then he must also cause notice of his intention to be published 14 days before the hearing in a newspaper circulating in the area.  My objection to that matter is that this&mdash;and I think there are other sections which would also come into this matter&mdash;makes the procedure that is proposed under this Bill in its entirety very cumbersome. Local authorities, as envisaged originally under the Bill, would have to consult between themselves, come to a decision as to whether they would in fact allow the man to operate in their area, and then all this other cumbersome procedure would have to be gone through.</P>
    <P>What I am suggesting is that notice would be served on them, as I have set out in my proposed amendment, and then it is open to the local authority to come in and object or record their objection before the district justice who will be hearing the application.  I think from the factual point of view, this is the way the matter should be approached.  I think the procedure is cumbersome as laid down in the Bill at present and that it would really be beyond the applicant's ability to comply with the regulations as laid down.  The different periods set out are cumbersome and wrong. Under the procedure as proposed in this amendment, the local authorities will get due notice and if they wish to come in and object they may do so as they do come in to object to dance-hall licences because they consider the halls structurally unsuitable, or need alterations, or that the number of people attending them should be limited.  They would have all these facilities to do that.  I think the same procedure should be adopted here so that the local authorities could explain <Col N="428" /> their views and ask for any limitations that might be desirable before the court at which the application is being heard.  I do not know whether the Minister has considered this matter since I made the point when speaking on the Second Stage.  I do not know the Minister's views now and I would like to hear from him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 15 provides that advance notice of intention to apply for a licence must be given to the local authority and to the superintendent of the Gardaí and further that a notice must be published before the application is heard.  This gives the opportunity to parties resident in the area to come in and object if they so desire.  Deputy Moran's amendment would nullify the whole spirit of the Bill.  It would give a chance to individuals without any licences to come into an area and exploit the people. Therefore, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I still do not quite understand what the Minister's intentions are under the Bill.  I shall summarise it briefly and I want to know if this is the position.  Does the Minister contemplate that, first, an amusement caterer has to apply to the local authority, that they then have to sit down solemnly and decide whether they should allow him to have a licence or not?  Having gone through that he has to come along then under this proposed court procedure and give a month's notice.  Then he must give 14 days' notice in the newspapers before the court application.  If I am misreading this, the Minister will no doubt correct me but that is the way is appears to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy is misinterpreting it&mdash;I hope I am not. Under the section as it stands, all one is required to do is to give notice of his intention to apply for a certificate of the court under Section 16 within 28 days.  One also gives notice in the newspapers.  The section merely provides for the giving of notice to the local authority and to the Gardaí in order that if they wish, they may come in and be heard in court just as notice <Col N="429" /> must be given if there is an application for a new licence.  The local authority has not to sit at all; they merely get the notice.  If they do not wish to come into court, they do not have to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Taoiseach is correct, I will accept that.  There is only one other matter arising and that is the proposal to allow for a temporary licence.  It may and will happen, obviously, in practice that people who did not consider applying say at the annual licensing court, would if applying later have to give at least one month's notice, then 14 days' notice by publication.  I want to know if the Minister has considered the position of an applicant who by force of circumstances or for some particular reason would apply possibly for one licence for a special event?</P>
      <P>I want to know whether the Minister has considered the position of the applicant who, by force of circumstances, or for some particular reason, would apply, perhaps, for only one licence for a special event and possibly for a very short time.  What I want to provide for is that in that case he could, without wasting all this time, apply for a temporary licence for a week or a month or for whatever period he requires it.  The Minister can visualise the case of a very small travelling showman who leaves one town after a couple of days and goes on to the next.  He may be only waiting in one town for two or three days or for a week.  Under this Bill as it stands he cannot wait in any town at all because he cannot get a licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section applies only to a man with fixed premises in Dublin or who sets up in a seaside resort such as Galway or Tramore for three or four months of the year.  Such a man will be thinking of making his application for a licence three months before the summer season will begin.  He will have his notices furnished and the newspaper advertisements published and so on.  But take the position of the small man who moves around from place to place and week by week. Such a man would want a multiplicity of licences to operate under the section as it is drafted.  He would want a <Col N="430" /> separate compartment for legal advisers and it would be practically impossible for him to keep track of the applications in every county and possibly in every big town.  He could not possibly operate otherwise or he would be breaking the law.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister should accept a procedure whereby a particular person who is not staying in one place for any more than 14 days or a month can apply for a licence without publishing the notices in the newspapers or giving notice to the local authorities.  I suggest that such a man, at 48 hours' notice, could go into the local Guards and then go into court and get a licence.  That kind of man has not been provided for in this Bill.</P>

As far as I can see, there is no provision for a public board to grant a licence to such an individual as I have mentioned.  I cannot see it in this section and I say that Section 6 does not cover it.</P>

It is some time since I read this Bill but I remember making it up and deciding that such a man was not covered under it unless we could provide machinery for making an application for a licence for a shorter period without having to give the written notice and publish it in the newspapers.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that Deputy Moran is under a misapprehension in regard to the provisions of Part III of the Bill.  First of all, there is a very distinct provision covering the travelling show moving throughout the country.  That is the kind of show covered by Section 6. Part III is the part of the Bill which licenses a permanent amusement hall, and not a travelling show.  In that case it is the hall itself that is to be licensed.  As I read the Bill all the provisions of Part III following Section 11 only come into operation if the resolution required in Section 11 is adopted.  Once that is adopted then the following sections will come into operation.  It is only following a resolution under Section 11 that Section 15 begins to operate.  Section 15 is only a preparatory section to the hearing of the applications referred to in Section 16 and it is only to put in operation the different matters A to F which come under Section 16.  These are the ordinary notifications required under the ordinary Licensing Acts but they only apply when the procedure set out in Section 11 has been carried out. Section 11 is the key to the operation of the other sections set out in Part III.  I think that if that is understood the difficulties mentioned by Deputy Moran do not exist.</P>

      <P>The Minister may consider this matter before the Report Stage.  I am still not satisfied that the situation which I envisage will not <Col N="432" /> arise.  My difficulty in putting down the amendment was this: Going back to Section 12 for the moment for the purpose of my argument, I had in mind when dealing with the other amendment a moment ago that the local authority may by resolution adopt this part of the Act in respect of the whole or a specified part of its administrative area and that for the purpose of Section 12 the administrative area of a council of a county shall not include any borough, urban district or town and that a resolution shall not have effect unless not less than one month's notice of the intention to propose it has been given in writing to every member of the local authority and has been published by advertisement in at least two newspapers circulating in the area to which the proposal relates.</P>
      <P>That section, I take it, has been passed.  I proposed to do away with that section for the reasons I am advancing on this section because the whole matter of the procedure is interdependent. I want to say again on this amendment, and the same thing went for the previous amendment, that, supposing the local authority has to be put in motion, who is going to put it in motion?  Is it the showman? Does a prospective amusement caterer, if he wants a licence, have to start off and get a special meeting of the local authority held to deal with the matter?  Somebody must do it. The Minister for Health shakes his head.  Under Section 12, which the House in its wisdom has passed, it must be done by somebody.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that it has to take the general case.  Take the County of Dublin or the County of Mayo or any other county.  Before anybody can get within shouting distance of a court the local authority must sit down and deal with this matter and discuss it between themselves and debate the rights and <Col N="433" /> wrongs of allowing gaming in their county.  They must come to a decision and then a resolution of theirs in the matter shall not have effect unless not less than one month's notice has been given to every member of the local authority.  That must be done, I assume, by the county manager or somebody else before they get together.  One month has elapsed because the manager must give them notice.  Somebody must give notice to the county manager.  I am trying to put the Minister's horse to a practical cart because it appears to me that first the amusement caterer must start off to get at the county manager; the county manager must then give at least one month's notice to the members of the authority.  Possibly two months have elapsed by this time. Then the local authority come together and decide to pass or not to pass the resolution.  If they do pass it and are going to allow the Bill to operate and are going to allow gaming within the confines of their county they have to publish that by advertisement in at least two newspapers circulating in the area to which the proposal relates.</P>
      <P>All that cumbersome rigmarole has to be gone through before the applicant himself starts to give notice.  It would be Tibb's Eve, under that procedure, before any amusement caterer would know whether or not he could get a licence.  He would want to start in the month of January to get a licence to play a game of pongo the following Christmas Eve, the way this matter is drafted.</P>
      <P>I would point out to the Minister that the House has adopted Section 12. I was providing under this amendment for a temporary licence for a temporary building or that the showman, who moves from place to place, could be licensed without getting on to his bicycle and getting on to the county manager and the manager getting on to the local authority and the local authority having to deal with it and then the showman going back to his solicitor and so on.  I do not want to take up the time of the House unduly but I am suggesting that that procedure is completely unworkable from the point of view of the people who want to operate the Bill.</P>

For instance, again drawing the analogy between this and the operation of the Public Dance Halls Act, in one area, you may have three dance hall owners who are satisfied with certain hours.  They may be satisfied to finish their dances at 12 midnight, but there may be two more in the same area who want to go on until three o'clock in the morning.  All these are separate applicants under the Public Dance Halls Act and any person can appear, as is the position under many other statutes, and make his objections.  If one individual or somebody in the locality who objects to late dances comes in and makes his objection, should he not have the right to appeal, if the matter is decided against him?</P>

It seems to me that where a district justice had a full hearing, with all the rights of parties to oppose the application and where he comes to a decision that it should be granted, it would be an injustice if the applicant were to be held up for a period of something like two and a half months or possibly three months, merely because a person, who might be a crank, without any ground for opposing the application, served notice of appeal.  There is no provision, so far as I know, for any person appealing against an order of the district justice entering into any sort of recognisances.  A crank can come in, show no case and be rejected by the district justice, and then file a document with a stamp costing 1/- on it and hold the whole matter up for three months.</P>

      <P>If the Minister is refusing to accept this amendment, he should not base his refusal on the fact that it might be necessary to amend some other section of the Bill. There are quite a number of other sections that I should like to see amended.  I think the principle behind this amendment is a sound one and I suggest that the Minister should at least reconsider it to see if the position can be met in some way.  The points urged by Deputy Moran and Deputy Finlay are, in my view, cogent points. It is possible under the sections of the Bill adopted by the House already that an application made to the District Court can be opposed without any real grounds, can be opposed by someone who has a bee in his bonnet and can be opposed, not only against the interest of the applicant but even against the public interest.  As the Bill stands, unless some such amendment as this is inserted, there is nothing at all to prevent such a person, once he has appeared in the District Court, pursuing the matter to an appeal in the High Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can visualise a situation in which a district justice has no doubts whatever with regard to the merits of an application and grants it, and an appeal is then made by someone of the character I describe.  In those circumstances, as the Bill stands, the unfortunate applicant is going to be without a remedy, until the appeal comes off, and, as Deputy Finlay has pointed out, that might well be a period of two to three months later, depending on a number of different <Col N="439" /> factors.  I do not believe it is the Minister's intention, or that of his Department, to do an injustice to an applicant in these circumstances and I strongly urge that this matter be reconsidered before Report Stage.</P>

    <P>21.&mdash;No person shall print, publish in any newspaper or periodical publication, exhibit on any cinema screen or broadcast by radio any <Col N="440" /> notice or announcement concerning a lottery (other than an announcement of the results of a lottery declared by any provision of this Part not to be unlawful) or cause or procure any such notice or announcement to be so printed, published, exhibited or broadcast or knowingly circulate or cause or procure to be circulated any newspaper or periodical publication containing any such notice or announcement.</P>
    <P>The amendment proposes to replace Section 21 by a new section, which is not as severe.  I have taken into consideration certain criticisms of the section as it stands and I agree that it needs to be modified.  I think the amendment is as far as we can reasonably be expected to go to meet the objections raised.  The whole principle of the Bill is that gaming and lotteries in moderation should be allowed.  In allowing them, however, we must recognise that we are running a risk that they will do some harm.  We do not want to go too far.  All these things were illegal up to now and there is the danger that the Bill will give them a fillip.  To permit newspapers or radio advertising of lotteries would, therefore, in my opinion be most unwise.  We are providing for announcements in the Press, etc., of the results of lotteries as, otherwise, subscribers would have no easy means of ascertaining results and this would be conducive to fraud on the part of promoters.</P>

    <P>The object of this amendment, apart from such changes in line with similar changes made by earlier amendments, to which I need not refer again, is to permit small lotteries to be run in amusement halls and at funfairs and travelling shows, in the same way as at carnivals.

      <P>Section 23 does not appear to cover the ordinary gaming which often occurs, namely, the small lottery at a dance.  This amendment does not seem to bring it in either. There does not seem to me to be any reason why at a carnival, bazaar or sports meeting one can hold a cloakroom ticket-that is generally the way these things are run-confined to the people there, with a small prize and at a dance in aid of charity one cannot; very often such a lottery forms part of the revenue derived at dances in aid of charity.  I do not know whether &ldquo;exhibition or other like event&rdquo; would cover that, but it seems to me that would be <i>ejusdem generis</i> as far as construction goes and would be governed by the preceding words &ldquo;carnival, bazaar, sports meeting, local festival, exhibition.&rdquo;  The words &ldquo;or other like event&rdquo; would be construed with reference to the same type of recreation, say, and would not cover the matter in the ordinary way.</P>

      <P>With respect to what the Minister said in reply to Deputy Finlay, I do not think that the words &ldquo;or other like event&rdquo; cover the holding of a lottery at a dance or ceilidhe.  I suggest that an amendment could be inserted to clarify the position.  The courts interpreting that section would apply the <i>ejusdem generis</i> rule and, in construing the words &ldquo;or other like event&rdquo;, would construe them in the light of the previous words; and the previous words would not carry the construction that they covered dances.  I ask the Minister to look into the matter.</P>

      <P>Perhaps Deputy Briscoe would look at the previous section. The original Bill, as drafted, has now been amended to include lotteries in the gaming section in relation to what can be done at a travelling show or circus; and it appears to me that the alteration of the section merely balances that out again.</P>

      <P>There is no change of principle.  The original Bill which permitted gaming under certain circumstances at travelling shows or circuses would not appear to have reference to lotteries.  An amendment has now been introduced, which we have passed, which puts lotteries under the gaming provisions and this amendment that we are now discussing puts lotteries back in the same position.  I do not think there is a change of principle.</P>

      <P>I, too, would like a little clarification on this.  I thought I followed the reasoning when Deputy Finlay was speaking, but I confess now I do not.  In Section 4 an amendment was introduced with regard to the type of gaming which would not be unlawful.  That provided that the game would not be unlawful if the various things were implemented, one of which was that the promoter would derive no personal profit.  That was on a par with Section 23 dealing with lotteries in the original Bill.  Under that section one of the conditions attached to making lotteries lawful was that the promoters would derive no personal profit.  For some reason or another, though the amendment in Section 4 has been introduced, that particular subclause has now been dropped from the amended Section 23.  I must say it does not appear clear to me why that has been done.  There may be some profound reason but as Deputy Finlay suggested I cannot see it.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that an effort is now being made to make the thing uniform.  Under Section 23, as it stood, there was the prohibition that deriving a personal profit excluded them.  It is now proposed to have a new sub-section in which the price of each ticket is limited to 6d. <Col N="445" /> and the prize limit is 10/-.  That is in accordance with the principle already approved in the Bill.  In other words, it is saying there is no objection to small lotteries.  Rather it is an effort to make the thing uniform.</P>

In other words, I should like to know if dance or céilí committees who run an event for charity are covered by another section or will this section apply a limit to the lotteries they hold? If a subsequent section covers them I am not concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a change in Section 23.  As Section 23 <Col N="446" /> stood in the original Bill it permitted these small lotteries at carnivals and like events and what Deputy Finlay and myself want is that these lotteries would be permitted provided no personal profit was made.  The point here is that the original Section 23 did not put any ceiling on the prize fund.  We all know that a number of charitable organisations hold functions like dances and make part of their profits out of the raffles held.  A lot of these people, in order to cover their overheads, hold such raffles.  As the section stands you would not have a successful raffle if the winning ticket yielded only 10/-.  We know the Minister can say these people may apply for a permit, but that is a cumbersome system.  It would be a very simple matter to re-word the section making it clear that persons who promote raffles at carnivals or local festivals or dances will be entitled to do so provided they do so out of no view to profit for themselves.  It should be provided that they are entitled to give whatever prize they wish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with 95 per cent. of what Deputy Declan Costello has said.  I interjected the bottle of whiskey because it is worth more than 10/-.  I disagree with him only on the point that the term &ldquo;profit&rdquo; can be arguable.  Perhaps Deputy Costello will listen to me and help me.  We all know there are organisations that sometimes have to run events to get funds to keep going.  Some of these organisations come around to various people&mdash;they come to ourselves occasionally and we give them a present of perhaps a goose or a hamper, the value of which would obviously exceed 10/- and there is now this ceiling which Deputy Costello refers to.  Where I cannot agree with him is on the point of where profit begins and ends.  If we have an organisation that wants to make funds to pay off a debt on a hall or some such liability, and if they run these raffles, obviously the profit is for these organisations.  I think Deputy Costello suggests that the Minister should review this amending section and include something which would meet what he has in mind and possibly <Col N="447" /> remove the doubt in our minds about this ceiling so that there would not be the necessity to have to apply for permission to raffle a bottle of whiskey or a hamper at Christmas.  I think the inclusion of some defining word would overcome the difficulty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I also wish to support Deputy Declan Costello.  I do not think that to date we have adverted to the fact that the amendment proposed by the Minister very drastically curtails the liberty which it was proposed to give under the old Section 23 of the Bill.  Every one of us knows that for many years past, whatever may have been the strict letter of the law, at every social function for charitable causes or for political causes it was the universal practice to hold a 2d., 3d., or 6d. raffle and invariably the money value of the prize was more than 10/-.  In fact I do not believe you would get anybody to subscribe to even a 1d. draw if the prize were only 10/-.  It seems to me that the amendment now proposed is going to wipe that out completely.</P>
      <P>I do not know if the attention of the House has been drawn sufficiently to this.  Undoubtedly if the amendment is accepted in its present form it must have the result I have indicated.  Perhaps it is the intention that this will not be enforced rigidly.  I do not think that should be put up as a defence.  We are passing this legislation to try to rectify the position which has obtained here for very many years where the Legislature, the Gardaí, and everyone else has to close one eye to what was going on.  I think Deputy Costello and Deputy Briscoe are quite right with regard to the ceiling imposed under this amendment.  I would like to draw attention to paragraph (h) of the proposed amendment.  I think it is within the knowledge of everyone here that a popular prize in a number of these raffles is a Sweep ticket in the Irish Hospitals Sweeps.  That has been a customary prize for many years past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the proposed <Col N="448" /> amendment that would become illegal also.  The final remark I want to make is in connection with paragraph (d) and it is this.  Most of us know that in order to make money out of these raffles, to have them successful, enthusiastic committees often prepare for months, certainly weeks, ahead, distributing their raffle tickets and trying to dispose of them.  But under Section (d) of this amendment they are not entitled to sell the tickets outside the place where the event is being held.  It seems to me on reading the amendment proposed by the Minister that he is departing from the spirit in which he introduced this Bill to the House.  He made it quite clear&mdash;and I certainly applauded the manner in which he introduced it&mdash;that he was accepting to a great extent the factual position which had been obtaining here for a number of years where certain forms of gaming and lotteries existed because of public demand, and that the effort behind the Bill was to curb excessive gambling in the form of gaming and lotteries.  I feel, pending what the Minister may say on it, that he is departing from the spirit of his Second Reading speech in the amendment which he is now proposing.</P>

      <P>I think a ceiling is ridiculous because it is not actually what the prize is that does the harm; it is the amount of tickets bought or sold.  Surely nobody could suggest that if there is a raffle at any of these functions for a 10/- prize it is necessary that the price of the ticket should be limited to not more than 6d.  It would be ridiculous to suggest that anybody would be prepared to pay any more than that when the prize is limited.</P>
      <P>I think that the important thing, so far as the whole Bill is concerned, is to prevent so many tickets being sold that there is danger to the pockets of the people buying them apart entirely from the nuisance effect of the whole thing.  I would agree with Deputy Costello that the suggestion he has just made would certainly improve this section of the Bill.</P>

A number of Deputies know the reason why I have suggested £500 and others have suggested £600 and others up to £1,000.  The reason is that, at present, as Deputies are aware, a number of very deserving charities are running raffles, admittedly outside the law, but none the less they are holding them for very deserving purposes.  It has come to my knowledge, as it must have come to the knowledge of a number of other Deputies, that the promoters of these raffles have had extensive experience, over a number of years, of the type of raffle which will appeal to the public. These people, who have organised these raffles for very charitable purposes, have informed us that as the Bill stands at the present time it would be impossible for the raffles to be a success. These people have no interest in these raffles other than to get as much as possible for their organisation and I would ask the Minister to bear in mind the representations which have been made to him by these people who have extensive experience of running these raffles.</P>
    <P>As the Bill stands at present it is proposed that a district justice may grant a licence for a period up to one year for the holding of a lottery and there are two conditions under which the lottery may be held.  One is that the total value of the prizes does not exceed £300 and the second is that no more than one quarter of the gross proceeds should be utilised for the expenses of promotion.  I have put amendments down to sub-sections (2) (c) and (2) (e).  I have been informed that if these sections remain as they are it will be impossible for these organisations to run their raffles.</P>
    <P>It is the whole intention of this Bill to declare illegal this type of raffle and then to permit certain raffles for charitable purposes.  Let us not defeat the purpose of the Bill by imposing conditions in the granting of the <Col N="453" /> licences which would nullify the licences themselves.</P>
    <P>It is agreed in this House that an unreasonable expansion of lotteries and raffles would be undesirable.  I could see no objection to permitting licences to be granted by district justices if the conditions which I have suggested be put in.  It is the public we are trying to safeguard by leaving the granting of the licences to district justices and by inserting in the wording of the Bill that licences can only be granted to certain organisations.  I see no reason why, if you are going to have raffles run by charitable organisations, the prize fund should not be £500, a figure which I have been informed would be sufficient to enable the raffles to be a success.</P>

      <P>This section has been included to provide that no large commercial organisation would cash in on our charitable organisations, which are at the moment deriving funds for excellent purposes from the present system of pools.</P>
      <P>Now, that anxiety I share wholeheartedly but at the same time I, like my colleague Deputy Costello, have found that the view of the most easily mollified groups among these promoters is that £300 is altogether too small and that they would require £500, which is the figure which would allow them to promote a decent pool which would have the effect they require.  With a weekly contribution of 1/- there is absolutely no danger of a large and countrywide commercial organisation coming in, especially if the maximum prize is only £500.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A typical framework for one of these pools is a group of people, usually in the professional class, accountants, etc., looking after the pool within the parish or within a town and a paid secretary or two, and a telephone. Now, even with the advertising and printing added to that modest expense it is a fact that, as they see it, £300 is not a practical business proposition and I would ask the Minister to reconsider the ceiling of £300 with a view to increasing it to £500 in the <Col N="454" /> realisation that both Deputy Declan Costello and I are with him in his anxiety to prevent countrywide commercial organisations cashing in.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to urge the Minister to accept first the proposal of Deputy Declan Costello to raise the ceiling.  The difference between myself and him is on the basis of mathematics.  I would like to see it £600.  First of all there is the prize. We are talking of the prize, that is, the amount given, not the total amount collected, and I have great sympathy with the point of view he has expressed about the 25 per cent.  As a matter of mathematics if you increase the prize the 25 per cent. may work out all right because the total collection has to be so much higher if you take into account that a certain percentage must go in expenses.  There is an amendment by Deputy McGrath that 25 per cent. must go to charitable objects.  You have the amount of the prize money, the cost of printing and the clerical assistance and so on.</P>
      <P>I think we are living a little bit in the past and I think the Taoiseach will agree that £300 to-day is not what it was a few years ago.  I am not saying the Taoiseach has any responsibility for it but let us face facts.  Six hundred pounds to-day is roughly the equivalent of what £300 was some years ago and I think that if we really want to legislate, with full control, for the purpose of helping these pools which are run for charitable objects we should do it in a way that is not going to be unreasonable.  I have had representations made to me similar to those which have been made to Deputy Costello and it is a matter of mathematics.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say in relation to amendment No. 42 that the principle behind the amendment is the same as behind Deputy Declan Costello's amendment.  It is a fact, and most Deputies on the Second Reading of the Bill referred to it, that there have been in this country for some years various charitable organisations which have found it necessary to turn to the operation of these lotteries to get in sufficient income to enable them to continue their work.  I think every one of us will have in mind one or more of these charities and I do not think it is suggested or can be suggested by the Minister or anyone else that the works which these organisations are doing are not very necessary works and not worthy of support from the general public.</P>
      <P>Over the years particular organisations have been accorded public support for the lotteries which they run and certainly for the past five or six years these organisations have come to depend on the income which they derive from these ventures to keep the work of their charities going to the extent to which they have been accustomed. I have in mind a particular charity which has been accorded very widespread public support in the South of Ireland although the fund is intended for a hospital operated in Belfast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to go into details.  I think the Taoiseach and other Deputies are well aware of the circumstances which operate in this particular case and of the reasons which make it pretty well essential that we should not interfere with the work which is being done by this organisation by clamping down, as this Bill appears to clamp down, on their efforts.  I want to amend that by saying I am very fully aware that hard cases often make bad law and that it is not possible for the Minister or for the Taoiseach to introduce a Bill of this sort and have <Col N="456" /> regard to every particular case put up to them but I would like to urge again the suggestion which I made on the Second Reading, and I think it is within the spirit of the Minister's speech when he recommended this Bill to the House.</P>
    <P>I would like to urge the Government, so far as these lotteries of a bigger type are concerned, to try to freeze the position as it is to-day and as it has existed for some time past. The Minister, when he recommended the Bill to the House, recognised frankly on behalf of the Government that there was public demand for lotteries of the type which we are discussing now in these amendments. These lotteries, for various amounts, giving varying amounts in prize money, have been existing side by side in this country for a number of years past.  There has been plenty of room for all of them.  No one can suggest that there was anything in any way improper, anyway fraudulent, or anyway irregular in the management of these lotteries.  Nor do I think it can be suggested that the existence of these lotteries has to any gross degree whetted the gambling appetites of our people.  The weekly contribution for the lottery ticket, or pool, or whatever it is called, is 6d. or 1/-.  That is not going to break anyone.</P>
    <P>I do not claim that everyone subscribes because of the laudable charitable object of the organisation running the lottery but I do say that in many cases the subscribers are motivated because of the charitable object of the lottery.  These lotteries have existed side by side for a number of years past.  They have not led to excessive gambling and one has not interfered to any great degree with the other.</P>
    <P>There has been room for all of them. They have been able to operate with varying degrees of success.  I would urge the Government to accept the position that these lotteries are there and that the Government should try to meet them.  If they impose a ceiling, and I agree that they must impose some ceiling, the suggestion I make is that the ceiling should be as high as <Col N="457" /> £1,000.  I do not take that figure just out of the air.  I take it because I believe that that figure would accommodate even the biggest of the existing lotteries.  In the spirit in which the Minister introduced this Bill, we should aim at accepting the position as it exists at the moment and, by whatever ceiling we impose, accommodate even the biggest of the present-day lotteries.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is necessary to say anything with regard to the expenses because the Taoiseach has met the House very fairly on that.</P>
    <P>I do not want to intervene in the debate again so may I deal with the alternative suggestion I have made in amendment No. 44?  I think it is linked to the suggestion I am making in regard to the ceiling, by providing an alternative method of dealing with the matter.</P>
    <P>I recognise the Minister's difficulty where he is asked to raise the ceiling to such a level as will adequately accommodate even the biggest lottery being run at the moment.  I realise that he must be faced with certain difficulties in doing that and that by putting the ceiling as high as suggested by me he may find himself faced with a position where other lotteries will endeavour to take advantage of that ceiling even though heretofore they have not done so.</P>
    <P>As an alternative suggestion, I put down amendment No. 44 which is designed to grant to the court, on the hearing of the application for a licence, discretion to fix the percentage of the gross proceeds which may be granted in prize money.  What I have in mind is this: the Minister wants to put in a particular ceiling.  Whether it is £300, £500, £600 or £1,000, he wants in this Bill to have a particular ceiling fixed.  It seems to me that in most cases whatever ceiling is fixed by the Minister will probably be satisfactory, but there will be the exception where a convincing case may be made to the Minister, the Government or the Dáil that in a particular instance the amount of prize fund allowed should exceed the ceiling.  Such applications have to be made to the district justices, and my suggestions is that the <Col N="458" /> district justice should be enabled to fix the percentage of the gross proceeds which may be given as prize money on any particular occasion.  That would enable an applicant who feels he has a good case for asking that he should be allowed to exceed the ceiling to make that case to the court.</P>
    <P>In another amendment I have suggested that the district justice's decision in fixing the percentage may be appealed to the Circuit Court.  I would recommend this course to the Government. It will, I think, save them and save the Department of Justice and the Gardaí a lot of trouble if that discretion is left with the district justice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that the ceiling should be raised because while a number of pools are running very successfully with a £300 prize limit, quite a number of them have a prize limit much higher than that, and if there were a sudden change, downwards, in the prize money it might have an adverse effect on the pools, which are run for very laudable purposes. I could not follow Deputy Briscoe's line of reasoning that an increase in the prize money might possibly be one way of getting over the question of the percentage expenses.</P>

      <P>If the Taoiseach has indicated that he is agreeable to 40 per cent. it would be waste of time to say any more about that, but there is one matter that worries me regarding the operation of the pools, that is, the question of the control or machinery for examination that there will be.  I believe that in England the Act prescribes that an accountant who is entirely independent of the people running the lottery must be appointed, presumably by the Minister, that he is paid by the State and the State is reimbursed out of the funds of the pool that he is to account for.  The accountant has the right by law to go into the premises at any reasonable hour of the day, during business hours, and he has extensive powers regarding the discovery of documents and so forth. The result of that system is that the pools are, in fact, run strictly according to the law which is in operation regarding them.</P>

They cannot compete with lotteries run in Dublin.  The prizes that can be given by Dublin-operated lotteries destroy any effort on the part of people in rural areas.  If you have £300 under Section 25 and £500 under Section 26 and one is run by a committee and the other by somebody else the lottery run under Section 26 will destroy any effort in the rural area.  I do not think the Taoiseach should depart from the £300.  By allowing 40 per cent., you make the thing a profession.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>May I answer Deputy Kennedy's points first?  He says that when we have confined it to £300 under Section 25, we should have the same sum in Section 26, but the two sections deal with entirely different subject matter.  Under Section 25, a person can get a permit from the superintendent to carry on a lottery on the basis of £300.  That is all he has to do, subject to the conditions in the section.  Under Section 26, however, it is a much more business-like affair and more of a business than it is under Section 25, because a District Court might grant a licence for a period of not more than one year for periodic lotteries, so that you could have a number of lotteries during the 365 days.  The things are quite different.</P>
      <P>As regards the £300 to £500, I settled across the House with Deputy Briscoe for £500 and 40 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Being, like Deputy Kennedy, a good democrat and open to conviction, and occasionally to pressure. <Col N="462" /> The charitable organisations put the case for 40 per cent. on the basis that it was necessary for them to have that percentage for their expenses, that otherwise they could not carry on. I personally would have thought that 40 per cent. of the expenses was a large amount, but the case was put so cogently from various parts of the House that we decided to give in on the point.</P>
      <P>With regard to the amendment by Deputy O'Higgins for £1,000, I state frankly that I had, and still have, considerable sympathy with the case put up by Deputy O'Higgins, because of the people or organisation on whose behalf he is really speaking, and for some little time we considered whether it might be possible to meet that case.  I personally approached the consideration of the problem with more than sympathy, with a very great leaning towards doing what the particular organisation wanted because of the particular conditions in which they were; but having considered the entire matter and what granting facilities to that particular organisation or cognate organisations down here would involve, I was coerced to the conclusion that the door would be too widely opened to all sorts of people, if we gave in on it.  The promotion of lotteries down here would become a complete business, really big business, and it would develop from being merely a method by which charities can finance themselves into nothing less than a racket, probably organised from outside, so, in all the circumstances, I was personally coerced, in spite of my own personal sympathetic outlook, into saying that £500 must be the limit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have great sympathy for the point of view of Deputy Kennedy in relation to the rural areas, although he did put it in a somewhat offensive way from the point of view of a Dublin man like myself, saying that Dublin is getting everything, as Deputy Corry would say from the point of view of Cork. What he really wanted to say, and it is this I agree with, was that, if you have a big lottery which requires big organisation to carry it on and if that big organisation is there, it will tend to put out the smaller lotteries down <Col N="463" /> the country by the local parish priests looking for money to build their churches, schools, halls and so on.  To that extent, I have the greatest sympathy with Deputy Kennedy's point of view, but on the whole the £500 and the 40 per cent. meets the general view of the House and it probably meets, so far as we can in all the circumstances, the views of the people outside.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to draw the attention of the Taoiseach to paragraph (d), which sets out that the value of each prize shall be stated on every ticket or coupon.  I want the Taoiseach to explain to me where is the power in this Bill to provide for the tickets that are sold at a dance or by a small showman being so printed. These tickets are simply numbered.  A showman will have a little raffle at his show, depending on the house he has got on the particular night, for £2 one night, perhaps £1 another night and £5 another night.  Take also the case of a sports organisation or a cultural organisation.  Very often at their dances, in order to raise a few shillings to help to pay the band, they will have a raffle for a £1 note or a couple of pounds and perhaps give some other prizes.  Under this section, it would appear that they would have to have tickets in advance, specifying, in accordance with the law, the kind of prizes they are going to give.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the whole of this part of the Bill there does not appear to me to be any provision made whereby people can carry on a small raffle such as is going <Col N="464" /> on from time immemorial at dances, and in particular in a number of cases where small showmen operate perhaps a couple of nights a week in each town. It appears to me that either they would have to come armed with tickets setting out the specific prizes given on each occasion or they could not hold these raffles.  I do not say that this whole Bill is unworkable, but that if this is so this part of it will preclude the ordinary dance committee from running a small raffle or the small showman from running a lottery, since the prize would, of necessity, vary from night to night depending on the takings and they would be prevented from doing so under the legislation we envisage under this Bill.  I would like the Minister to tell us whether they can carry on with these small raffles as they used to.</P>

      <P>I cannot see any case for the section.  Under the section you are saying that no person shall send or attempt to send out of the State any ticket or counterfoil or any prize money.  I think that is going too far altogether.  We have agreed to allow these organisations in the State, and I suppose &ldquo;State&rdquo; means the Twenty-Six Counties.  A lot of tickets are sold across in the Six Counties and in England, and it would be an undue hardship on those people to prevent them sending any ticket or prize money won out of the country.  I do not see any reason for that at all and I have heard no case for it.  On the Second Reading I took strong exception to it.  I am very much opposed to it, and so are most of our Party.

Take the case of the country parish priest trying to collect funds to renovate his <Col N="469" /> dwelling house or for other parish purposes.  The vast majority of parish priests get such funds by running raffles, tickets for which are sent by their parishioners to friends and relatives in England, America and elsewhere. The same is true of many sporting organisations.  Many fishing clubs in the West depend largely for funds on tickets sent out to friends in England and America.

      <P>I think the section should be opposed from another point of view. One thing I am afraid of in relation to it is that the Post Office authorities might be used as a means of enforcing it.  As far as Gaelic games are concerned, the State connotes the whole of Ireland and the results connote the whole of Ireland.  If this section is enforced the only pools organisation based on our native games will be put out of operation.  I think that would be deplorable.  I think the House should not introduce a section which will injure not alone our native games but our native language as well.  If this organisation is not permitted to operate, the people will then have the right to apply to the State direct for aid.  The fact they are not doing that now is no justification for incorporating this section in this Bill, a section which will make it impossible for this organisation to carry on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of it is to delete the second item of the Schedule; in other words, to refuse confirmation to the Order made by the Minister reducing from 25 per cent. to 20 per cent. <i>ad valorem</i> customs duty upon slashers and slash hooks.  I learned to-day when the Minister was introducing the Bill that this Order was made on the recommendation of the Industrial Development Authority following a review of the duty carried out under the trade agreement at the instance of the British Board of Trade.  I recognise that under that agreement the Minister was pledged to refer to the Industrial <Col N="471" /> Development Authority the question of this duty and I recognise that he is equally obliged to act upon the recommendation of that body.  I certainly would not argue that the reduction of 5 per cent. in the duty upon slashers and slash hooks is sufficient ground to reopen the whole question of the agreement.</P>
      <P>I, therefore, have no intention of putting this amendment to a division.  But the fact that the British Board of Trade has the right under the agreement to secure a review of any duty in operation and that the Minister is obliged under that agreement to give effect to any recommendation which the Industrial Development Authority may make as the reviewing body set up under the agreement does not mean that we must silently accept the recommendation of that body.  In fact, I think it would be an undesirable precedent to establish that all these recommendations must be acted upon by the Dáil in an unquestioning silence. There will again no doubt be references to that body at the instance of the British Board of Trade and similar propositions will be brought to the House for a review of duties; and it is well that the Industrial Development Authority should know and the Board of Trade should know that the Dáil will look with a critical eye upon all these proposals if they appear likely to have any detrimental effect upon industrial activity or industrial employment here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as this particular duty is concerned, it is difficult to understand the basis of the recommendation, and indeed I think that where there has been a reconsideration of a duty by the Industrial Development Authority on the request of the Board of Trade the Minister should make it a practice to give, in general terms, the considerations which led to the recommendation for an alteration in the duties. The arguments against the reduction of the duty were those I mentioned earlier to-day&mdash;that the quality and the price of the Irish products have been always regarded as very good but that there is a natural tendency among shopkeepers in the trade to have something <Col N="472" /> different to sell; and that a reduction in the rate of duty will probably lead to some increases in the imports of these things which might lead to a contraction of sales by the Wexford firm, to less efficiency and might make it more difficult for them to maintain their prices and the quality of their products.</P>
    <P>Before I raised the matter here I contacted the firm concerned and asked them if they were agreeable to the alteration and if they desired that the motion for the alteration of duty should be opposed here.  The information I got was that they opposed the alternation strongly&mdash;perhaps they thought they had made a sufficiently good case before the Industrial Development Authority.  So there need be no feeling here that this is something being done affecting a particular firm in a particular county about which that firm is not aware and about which it was not consulted in advance. It is agreed that the rate of duty which was imposed was not a very high one; we have had some very much higher rates on other industries not dissimilar to this one.  The rate of duty on edge instruments, the cutlery products of Newbridge, was increased recently and when the Wexford firm sought protection in the first instance it looked for 50 per cent.  It did not get 50 per cent: it got 25 per cent.  A further decrease in that low <i>ad valorem</i> rate is rather contrary to the interests of the firm, having regard to the estimate of the protection they said they required to develop maximum production with maximum efficiency.  I formally criticise the action of the Industrial Development Authority, not the Government, in recommending a reduction here unless a stronger case was made for the decrease than was stated here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if the Minister could inform us when the duty was first imposed?  There was an application for a 50 per cent. duty and I should like to know what influences the Industrial Development Authority to recommend to the Minister that the existing duty should be decreased.  The Minister did say here to-day that the Industrial Development Authority had <Col N="473" /> recommended the present rate of 25 per cent. on bill-hooks should remain. My information is that the use of bill-hooks is a thing of the past in this country&mdash;that they are as obsolete now as reaping-hooks were a quarter of a century ago.  With regard to slash-hooks, however, there is very definitely a big trade in this country for them. They are used by all the road authorities and by farmers generally and there is no doubt, as Deputy Lemass has suggested, that the products of this firm in the way of edge instruments are second to none in the world.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt in the world about that.  If it were a case that their products were inferior there would be some justification for this reduction in duty.  This firm is entitled to 100 per cent. of the Irish market no matter what the Industrial Development Authority or anybody else may think. We do know that certain hardware merchants in this country have always been hostile to Irish products and these people have sufficient influence with the Board of Trade to have this recommendation made.</P>

      <P>This has been a most extraordinary discussion, completely wide of the circumstances surrounding this case.  This duty was imposed long before the war, was suspended in 1942, was restored in 1953 under the 1938 Trade Agreement, and Deputy Allen <Col N="474" /> should find out who was in office then. The British Board of Trade was given a right under the agreement to ask for a review in these cases and, in accordance with the rights then given, asked for this review.  The review was not carried out by some people from Siam or by the British Board of Trade; it was carried out by three members of the Industrial Development Authority who were Irishmen and who held office under the last Government and still hold office.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Get rid of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>All the facts of the case were put before the Irish Development Authority; the British representatives went before them as did representatives of the Irish firm.  The representatives of the Irish firm got every possible opportunity of making their case and the case they made was such that the Industrial Development Authority recommended that the duty on bill-hooks should remain but that the duty on slash-hooks should be reduced from 25 per cent. to 20 per cent.  If this firm makes bill-hooks they probably sell bill-hooks and if they continue to make bill-hooks they must regard their manufacture and their sale as good profitable business.  There is no question in the world that the products of this firm are excellent not merely in respect of these two commodities but in a whole variety of other goods. Neither is there any question of this firm's ability to sell slash-hooks against any other competitor in the Irish market.  They are the only firm which makes them and they do not need a tariff to sell slash-hooks here.  The plain facts are that they make slash-hooks and can sell them at a lower price than the landed price of British slash-hooks without a duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So Pierces need no duty whatever to sell their slash hooks against the price disadvantage.  I agree they need assistance to sell against those who may prefer, for reasons not justified by economy, a British-made slash hook or a German-made one, but they get all the protection they need from the price point of view for sales against British, German <Col N="475" /> or any other type of slash hook imported here.  Since the duty was reduced from 25 per cent. to 20 per cent. there has been no increase that we can discover in the importation of slash hooks.  There has not been a single complaint nor a single murmur by anybody in Pierce's or anybody on behalf of Pierces since the duty was fixed by the Industrial Development Authority at 20 per cent. and representatives of the firm told me at a conference that they were quite satisfied with the result of the Industrial Development Authority review.  If they told something else to Deputy Lemass that is their business.</P>
    <P>They told me they were quite satisfied with the Industrial Development Authority review.  They are quite satisfied that they made a good case and in fact all the representations made since were quite favourable from their point of view.  The position is this in a nutshell: Pierces are making and can sell slash-hooks here even without a tariff because their prices are lower than the prices of any imported slash-hooks. Protection is there against a preference for outside slash-hooks; there is no increase in the importation of slash-hooks; there is no complaint from the firm about any inability to sell slash-hooks; on the contrary, the firm told me they were quite satisfied with Industrial Development Authority recommendations.  I think Deputy Lemass would agree that it is highly undesirable on this Bill to raise the whole question as to what we should do about Industrial Development Authority recommendations.  He has his views and I have mine and they are probably the same views, but when it comes into this House you cannot reopen one side of an Industrial Development Authority report without reference to the other.  We are bound to accept the Industrial Development Authority report&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Will you look at the unaltered manuscript of your speech this evening and see what you said? Will you look at your speech of ten <Col N="476" /> minutes ago and see what you said? If we are going to claim the right to repudiate an Industrial Development Authority recommendation, then we had better concede that right to the other side.  Does Deputy Lemass think that is going to mean good business from our point of view?  Does he think that we are going to retain the Industrial Development Authority as the reviewing body if its recommendations are to be repudiated by us?</P>
      <P>A mountain is being made out of what is not even a molehill.  I am satisfied that Pierces will sell slash-hooks against the world.  They could sell even if the duty were reduced much lower than it is.  It is at 20 per cent. now, 5 per cent. less than it was, but the quality of their slash-hooks is such as to sell even without the 20 per cent.  The fact that there has been no complaint to the Department and that the firm's representative expressed satisfaction with the Industrial Development Authority report and with the level of duty protection are clear indications that this matter poses no problems to the firm and no problem to a single worker employed at the factory.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann is of the opinion that the Electoral Acts should be amended forthwith in order to accord the franchise to members of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think this first motion on the Order Paper should take up much of the time of the House.  To my knowledge, at any rate, the majority of Deputies in the House and the Government <Col N="477" /> are in agreement with this motion, but I would like to say a few words on the reasons which prompted me to put this motion on the Order Paper initially.</P>
    <P>It was only within the last 12 months that I discovered that members of the Garda Síochána were not entitled to cast their votes in a general election. I had always been of the opinion prior to that that they were in the same position and had the same rights as every other citizen in the community. I knew that they had power to cast a vote in the local elections and I also knew that at times it was quite difficult for members of that force to exercise their vote in the local elections.  It was during a discussion that I had on their difficulty in exercising the franchise in the local elections that it came to my knowledge that they had no right or authority to cast their votes in the general election for this House.</P>
    <P>When I heard the true position I decided the best possible way to deal with it was to put a motion before this House so that Deputies would urge the Government to pass the necessary amending legislation to remedy this injustice or grievance at the earliest possible moment.  The position very briefly is this: every country in the democratic world confers the rights on its police force to exercise the franchise and we are the only democratic country in which that right does not obtain. Believe it or not, in the small area of the Six Counties the police force is entitled to exercise the franchise.  In some democratic countries they even go so far as to make it mandatory or compulsory on their citizens, including members of the police force, to cast their votes.</P>
    <P>I am not going that far; it is outside the scope of this motion, but I do suggest that any member of that force who wishes or desires to cast his vote&mdash; and to my mind the majority of them do&mdash;should be given that right.  The case is being made that when in 1924 the right to vote was withheld there were some sound reasons at that particular period for that action.  That may have been so, but we are not concerned at this particular moment <Col N="478" /> with that period and if there were good reasons at that time I am sure all will agree those reasons do not exist to-day.  No matter what anybody says it is an extraordinary thing that it was felt wiser at that particular period not to give that right to the Gardaí in view of the turmoil and conditions of unrest that may have obtained, while the Army, which was just as much concerned at that particular period, was allowed to exercise the franchise.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government and the Minister for Justice in recent speeches expressed themselves as being willing to give this right to members of the Garda Síochána, and I am glad that both of them have shown such a progressive outlook on this matter.  All I want at this stage in this motion is a word from the Minister for Local Government that he is prepared to introduce the necessary legislation at the earliest possible opportunity.  I think his own speech in recent months gave the impression to the public that the legislation was likely to be introduced in this present session.  I would ask him to introduce it before Christmas. We all know it is a very simple matter and I do not think there is any need to hold up the House any further on it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support Deputy McQuillan's motion.  It is an extraordinary fact that the only people in this country who cannot exercise the franchise at the present time are convicts and members of the Garda Síochána.  It is high time that that situation should be rectified at any rate in regard to members of the Garda Síochána.  Good reasons may have obtained in 1924 for depriving members of the Garda Síochána of the vote. What is of vital importance is that the Garda force should be loyal to the State.  I believe that they are loyal to the State and I believe that the fact that they would be given a vote in the general election would not in any way make more likely disloyalty on the part of the force.  Our Army and the Civil Service have votes and the time has long since passed when we should give the vote to the Guards. <Col N="479" /> I hope the Minister will accept the motion.</P>

      <P>I want to associate myself with this motion and while I may in some way be responsible for the hold-up I do not think that I really am.  A good many years ago when the question was raised and I sat on those benches with the authority of our Government I was told that when an electoral Bill would come along the vote for the Gardaí would be included. The last time I was in office I informed the representative body of that fact but I do not know what has become of that Bill since.  Of course, if the electoral Bill is coming it would be a good thing to take up the two matters together.  We did not consider it necessary to bring in a special Bill at the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support the motion.  It has been an extraordinary thing that for years the members of the Garda have been without votes. I do not think there will be any objection in this House to these men getting this long overdue right.</P>
      <P>I would like to impress on the House that they should be given a vote in a way that would make it practical for them to exercise it.  As we are well aware they have, over a long period of years, exercised control and supervision over the polling booths and we could well find the position that many of the Guards would be on duty outside their own area and their own immediate polling booth or polling station. I would like to urge on the Minister, if he is, as I believe he is, going to grant this right to the Guards, that he should do it in such a way that they will be able to exercise the vote even if duty demands that they will be away from their own immediate polling station.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is something that is very long overdue and it is an extraordinary travesty on the freedom we have in this country that for no less than 30 odd years this particular force in the State has been without the right to vote.  They have given loyal service throughout the years in the maintenance <Col N="480" /> of law and order in the State and it is an extraordinary thing that the very custodians of that law and order should be denied the right to vote as to who would be the arbiters of law and order within the natural rights of justice.</P>
    <P>I suppose it is not in our best interests to take up the time of the House in discrimination or in castigating people for what should have been done and what was not done.  There has been discrimination over the years but I feel that the time has come when something should be done to restore their rights to these men who have been such a credit to the State.  It has been said in this House that there never was a more loyal, more conscientious or more courteous force than the police force has been since its inception. Over the years they have built up a tradition that has earned the respect of the people generally.  I hope that there will be no unnecessary delay now in giving to these men the right that for far, far too long they have been denied, a right that I feel should never have been denied and one that they should get from any freedom-loving people.  It seems extraordinary that such a long period should have passed by with these people ranked, as far as the franchise is concerned, with convicts.</P>
    <P>Why it was ever done I am not going to ask.  What queer twist of somebody's sense of justice denied them being recognised as other citizens of the State are recognised I do not know, but suffice it to say that it is now time that we wiped out this prejudice and injustice and gave to these worthy citizens of the State the franchise which they have so jealously guarded for so long.  I hope it will be given to them forthwith and that they will rapidly forget that the State was ever so ungrateful that 30 years were let pass by leaving them in that disenfranchised position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like also to add my support to this motion. I think Deputy McQuillan was aware of the fact that in putting down this motion he was, to a great extent, pushing an open door.  The Minister has made it quite clear from time to <Col N="481" /> time that he is in sympathy with the sentiments contained in the motion and he has indicated that it is his intention to introduce legislation governing the matter.  I can appreciate the fact that many of us to-day cannot understand the incongruous position that the members of the Garda Síochána are virtually the only citizens of the State disfranchised at the time of a general election, but those who have longer service in this House and those who are older than many of us of the present generation will probably appreciate the reasons why, when the Electoral Act of 1923 was being pased, Section 5 was inserted debarring members of the Garda Síochána from voting.</P>
      <P>Like Deputy Seán Collins and other speakers here, I certainly do not want &mdash;on a motion like this, which I think is going to be supported unanimously in this House&mdash;to say anything which would have the appearance of endeavouring to stir up controversy of any sort.  I think, however, it is at least relevant to point out that, when the Electoral Act of 1923 was passed through this Assembly, the state of affairs in this country was completely different from the state of affairs existing to-day or from the state of affairs that has existed, one might say, for the past 20 years.  You had in office for the first time for some 700 years or so an Irish Government which was charged with the responsibility of establishing in this State an Irish police force, an Irish Army, an Irish Civil Service and an Irish judiciary. You had a fresh Government of a fresh and new-born State endeavouring to find its feet and to take over the administration of this country from a mighty empire.  At the same time, you had a young Government endeavouring to undertake the Herculean task of building up Irish institutions, an Irish Civil Service, an Irish police force and an Irish Army.  You had existing at the same time a state of turmoil within our own borders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To my mind, it showed an extraordinary sense of justice and fair play that the Ministers then in charge of the administration of this country should legislate in such a way as to ensure <Col N="482" /> that, no matter how violently political differences existed, the police force in this State should not be stigmatised as being political, that the police force should be above and beyond anything in the nature of political controversy. Consequently, when this House considered the Electoral Act of 1923 they framed it in such a way as to ensure, even at the cost of an apparent injustice to the Garda Síochána, that the members of the Garda Síochána on full pay would not have the right to vote in parliamentary elections or in Seanad elections.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy McQuillan who, in introducing this motion, drew attention to the distinction between the position of the Gardaí <i>vis-á-vis</i> parliamentary elections and local elections. There, again, the distinction is, I think, historical.  At the time of which we are now speaking&mdash;in the days of 1923 onwards&mdash;the local elections were not contested on a political basis&mdash;theoretically, anyhow&mdash;and it was not until comparatively recent times that political Parties unashamedly got into local politics.  I think that will be conceded.  I know Deputy Boland's Party hold that view. I am not arguing it now: it is not one that I am to be taken as agreeing with because I am not arguing it.  However, I know they have always quite frankly held the view that it is right and proper that the national political Parties should contest the local elections and should operate as political Parties and political groups within local councils.</P>

      <P>All I want to point out is that, while in the Electoral Act of 1923, which this motion urges should be amended, it was not permitted to members of the Garda Síochána on full pay to vote in Seanad or Dáil elections, nevertheless their right to vote at municipal elections continued to exist unimpaired.  The reason for that, I think, is that local elections&mdash;at any rate, theoretically&mdash; were considered as outside the sphere of politics and political activity. Deputy McQuillan drew attention to something which I believe is a fact, namely, that for many years, even in relation to local elections, members of the Gárda Síochána were not encouraged to exercise the franchise although they had the right to vote.  They were quite entitled to cast their vote, just as any other section of the community. I understand things even went to the length that a directive was issued to them from the Commissioner or from Garda Headquarters suggesting that they should not exercise the franchise.</P>
      <P>I was glad to hear Deputy Boland's contribution to this discussion because I got the impression, when this matter of the right of Gardaí to vote was raised by way of parliamentary question in this House last May or June, that Deputy MacEntee, as the spokesman of the Fianna Fáil Party on that occasion, was rather inclined to voice his opposition to any steps&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>So far as the Party to which I belong is concerned, we have expressed the view on a number of occasions during the years that the Electoral Act of 1923 should be amended in this particular regard.  In my view, Deputy Boland is quite sensible in foreseeing that greater amendments than this particular one are desirable and it may be that, instead of introducing legislation to cover this specific point, the Minister may be contemplating the introduction of a further Electoral Act which will clear up some of the anomalies which exist at the moment.  Before I am reprimanded by the Chair, let me say that I quite recognise the fact that it would not be in order to discuss such anomalies, other than by way of passing comment, at the moment.  I merely mention it because Deputy Boland threw out the comment that while he was in office such legislation was contemplated.</P>
      <P>The point I was dealing with was that, so far as the Fine Gael Party is concerned, on more than one occasion we have expressed our desire to see the Electoral Act amended by permitting the Garda Síochána to cast their votes at parliamentary elections as well as at local elections.  The Minister has indicated his attitude to this matter already.</P>
      <P>I think it is desirable that this alteration in the law should take place. The turmoil and the excitement no longer exist.  The Garda Síochána have long been established in the minds of the people as a body that have done their job loyally and well without favour to any particular Government or any particular political Party.  They serve the State and not political Parties.</P>

      <Col N="485" /> The task of establishing in this country an unarmed, non-political police force has been accomplished to the extent that the Irish police force have, I think, earned the admiration, the goodwill and the gratitude of all sections of the Irish people irrespective of their political differences.</P>
    <P>I certainly agree with those speakers who have urged that whatever the reasons for this difference in legislation in the past those reasons are no longer valid ones and the time has come when the law should be amended as suggested by Deputy McQuillan.</P>

      <P>I was in favour of the motion until I heard Deputy Corry say that all the Guards voted for him.  I am now inclined to question whether or not we should give it to them at all. Notwithstanding that, on behalf of the Labour Party, I should like to say that we are in favour of the motion.  I do not want to repeat all the reasons why we are in favour of it but I think it is unpardonable of Deputy Corry to suggest that the police force as a body are any more likely to be bought than any other section of the people in this country.  I think that wage increases would have no more effect on the Guards than on civil servants or the public in general.  The Guards will exercise the vote, as we all do, by electing the people best suited to run this country.  I will end by saying that we in the Labour Party hope that this is but a beginning and that there will be an extension of the view that civil servants of all kinds should not only have a vote but the political right to exercise that vote.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as Deputy Corry's comment on buying the Guards is concerned, I would like to say that there is one thing we are very proud of and that is that the Guards cannot be bought. I doubt very much if that is true of many other countries.  The Guards are definitely as fine a body of men as you would get in any part of the world.  If <Col N="488" /> you travel outside this country, even across the water, you would appreciate that.</P>
    <P>To suggest that Guards can be bought by increases in salaries or anything like that is, I think, most unfair to that body.  From our experience, I think the Guards should be very good judges of politicians.  They travel round on fair days and other occasions when we are addressing public meetings and from time to time they hear politicians saying one thing in one town and something entirely different in another.  If Civic Guards got votes they would be good judges of the politicians and would exercise the vote properly.  We appreciate there is difficulty in that a Guard has to be on duty at a particular polling booth. Whenever this matter is being put in order by the House, I hope some provision will be made to afford them the opportunity of casting the vote.  I express the view on behalf of our Party that we agree with this motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. P. O'Donnell) Patrick O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. P. O'Donnell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that the electoral laws of this country are really archaic.  It may surprise the House to know that the electoral laws in force here are the very same as those which flouted the opinion of mid-Ulster recently, when the duly elected Deputy there, Deputy Mitchell, was unseated under the Forfeiture Act of 1870.  These same archaic laws exist here, and I think the House will agree that it is time they were amended.  The electoral laws here go back to 1850 and no Government has taken steps to amend them.  I am glad to be able to tell the House that I have taken steps to codify them, and that I hope to do that in the very near future.  I hope to do see the Forfeiture Act of 1870, the Ballot Act of 1872 and other archaic Acts&mdash;introduced into this country by a foreign Government&mdash;amended or abolished completely.  No one in this House is in favour of legislation by reference.  We wish to see our laws codified&mdash;be they fishery laws, local government laws or electoral laws&mdash; and that is what I propose doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope to include in the new Bill a section amending Section 5 of the Electoral Act of 1923, to extend the <Col N="489" /> franchise to the Garda in Dáil and presidential elections.  It is not so easy to do that.  When I came into office I found that the Gardaí had not exercised&mdash;contrary to what Deputy Corry says&mdash;the franchise in local elections. I have no hesitation in saying now that 95 per cent. of the Gardaí did not exercise the vote in local elections. Immediately before the last local election, I took steps to ensure that the Gardaí would be facilitated in exercising the franchise.  On the 18th June last, less than a week before the election&mdash;not for the purpose of vote-catching, as suggested by Deputy Corry&mdash;I caused the following circular to be sent out.  It stated <i>inter alia</i> the following:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am directed by the Minister for Local Government to enclose for your information a copy of an Order made by the Minister on the 17th instant, amending the Local Elections Order, 1942, so as to enable a returning officer at a local election to give a member of the Garda Síochána assigned for duty in connection with the election a written authorisation enabling such member to vote at a polling station in his electoral area other than the polling station at which he would otherwise be entitled to vote.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I caused that to be sent out to each returning officer, thereby ensuring that Gardaí posted at polling stations other than those in which they were entitled to vote would have the opportunity to vote.  I did that before the first available election&mdash;in June last.  We are due a Dáil election in 1959 and I now assure this House that, prior to that Dáil election in 1959, I will ensure that every member of the Gardaí will have the right to exercise the franchise. Further than that I cannot go.</P>
    <P>I deplore the suggestion of Deputy Corry and I deplore the interjection of Deputy MacEntee, when a question was asked here by Deputy McQuillan on the 1st June last, as to whether the Electoral Acts would be amended so that the Gardaí could vote.  I deplore the innuendo that it was for the purpose of buying votes, the votes of the Gardaí, for inter-Party candidates, just <Col N="490" /> as I deplore the suggestion of my friend Deputy Corry to-day.</P>

There are approximately 7,000 Gardaí in the country, they are divided over the constituencies of the entire State and their votes will scarcely influence the election of a successful candidate in any one constituency.</P>

I do not think that is true: I think they are honest men who will vote whatever way they think.  They will vote for the best possible candidate.  I can give Deputy McQuillan the assurance that when I come to amend the Electoral Acts and codify them I will include a section to amend Section 5 of the 1923 Act.</P>

      <P>I would like to support in general the purpose of this discussion and would like to mention one particular section which it appears to me will affect the mechanics and details of any legislation amending the Electoral. Act of 1923 in so far as it affects <Col N="491" /> Dublin and possibly other cities.  The situation which the Minister mentioned operated this year for the first time in a local government election.  The Gardaí were entitled to vote and were given a special authorisation to vote at a polling booth other than their own, in the same constituency area.  In the City of Dublin, as soon as this franchise is extended, a Guard will be on duty in one end of the city and will have a vote in another constituency entirely.  Presumably, on polling day most Gardaí in Dublin would have a long spell of duty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of speakers referred to their anxiety for some time past to have amending legislation introduced.  Prior to the last local elections I raised the problem in this House that the Garda Síochána were not in a position to cast their votes in the local elections.  A number of Deputies, including one Minister, contradicted me and more or less suggested that I did not know what I was talking about.  Some of the Deputies themselves have now admitted that I was correct and that in the local elections, in spite of the fact that by law the Garda Síochána are entitled to vote, they have had a number of difficulties put in their way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>As a matter of fact it is not the Minister for Social Welfare I had in mind at all, but another Minister.  As a result of the questions that were asked in the Dáil at the time, the Minister for Justice made it clear to me in a supplementary reply that he would ensure that no difficulties would be put in the way of the Garda Síochána in casting their votes <Col N="492" /> in the local elections and as a result of the Minister for Local Government's action, a direction was issued through the commissioner to the various superintendents to facilitate the Garda Síochána, and I know in my own constituency that worked.</P>
      <P>The Minister has told us the position with regard to the archaic laws here and I am very much afraid that if there are laws that need amending since 1850 this Minister, energetic, virile and enthusiastic as he may be, may be taking on more than he can deal with in saying that he will be able to amend, codify and get rid of certain legislation during his present term of office.</P>

He has stated that the date on which he will bring it in will be before 1959.  I want this clarified in the Minister's mind.  I am not suggesting that there will be a general election in 1957, 1958 or 1959, but would the Minister make this promise, that it will be prior to the next general election and leave out the dates 1959 or 1969?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann is of the opinion that (a) the present system of <i>bona fide</i> licensed trading should be completely re-examined with a view to correcting existing abuses, (b) the normal opening hours in the trade should operate throughout the country on St. Patrick's Day, and (c) the present licensing laws should be amended so as to enable rural dwellers to enjoy the same facilities <Col N="493" /> as are at present afforded to city residents: Dáil Éireann accordingly calls upon the Government to introduce forthwith the necessary amending legislation to this effect.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether we can hope to have the same agreement amongst the Deputies on this particular motion on the Order Paper.  I can assure the House that, as far as I, personally, am concerned, I am only trying to help the Government in my own small way in connection with a matter that is of great importance.  This motion that is before the House is in three sections. I know that there are Deputies on both sides of the House who disagree violently with my suggestions in connection with one or two sections but there is at least one section that will appeal to Deputies on all sides of the House, and if we have agreement on one part I see no reason why the part on which there is agreement cannot be dealt with.  The last attempt made in this House to overhaul and improve our liquor laws was made in 1948 by way of Private Members' Bill sponsored by the one and only Deputy Corry.</P>
    <P>The Bill introduced by Deputy Corry dealt with only one aspect of this serious problem and that aspect was the injustice that is meted out to the rural dwellers in the matter of Sunday opening hours.  His Bill was defeated by an overwhelming majority because Deputies on both sides of the House felt that there were too many issues involved and the only satisfactory way to deal with the problem was by Government action.  Many Deputies were strengthened in that belief by the statement made by the then Minister for Justice.  Many of the Deputies felt that it was envisaged by the Government that our licensing laws would be overhauled because the then Minister for Justice, Deputy MacEoin, stated, at column 235, Volume 114 of the Official Debates of the 17th February, 1949, with regard to Deputy Corry's Bill:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;He (Deputy Corry) knew perfectly well that the Department of Justice were examining, and are examining, the whole licensing code. <Col N="494" /> He was told that then, but Deputy Corry saw fit to introduce that Bill and he sees fit, for some reason, to introduce this one now....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That statement was made by the former Minister for Justice and it led me and others in this House to believe that the Department of Justice were actually engaged in a thorough investigation and examination of the licensing laws with a view to preparing a report for consideration of the Government. That statement was made by the Minister on the 17th February, 1949, six years ago.  We all know how painfully slow Government Departments are in preparing legislation, and so forth, and I do not think that there is any Deputy who will disagree that a period of six years is sufficient for any Department to prepare its information for submission to a Government in the form of a report.</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that in the last six years no amending legislation or no report has been submitted to this House, I felt it would not be unreasonable on my part to submit a Private Members' motion here in order to bring the matter to the immediate attention of the Government.  In moving this motion, I am mindful of the many difficulties that beset a Government in their efforts to bring into operation wise and beneficial licensing laws.  For that very reason I have drafted this motion in a broad way so that the Government may take the necessary steps.  As I have already said, the motion is in three parts and I feel sure, although all Deputies may not be in agreement with me on all three sections of the motion, that, at the same time, there is something that will appeal to most, if not all members, within its terms.</P>
    <P>There is, I might mention at this stage, an amendment here that might appeal to Deputies as being a more reasonable method of dealing with this problem.  I am sure the mover of that amendment will give his own reasons, but very briefly I propose to give a few of the reasons why I have submitted this motion in three sections.</P>
    <P>The first part of the motion, namely, that the present system of <i>bona fide</i><Col N="495" /> licensed trading should be completely re-examined with a view to correcting existing abuses, is to my mind the most important part.</P>
    <P>The history of the <i>bona fide</i> trade goes back a long way.  It is a feature that was introduced here when travelling was really travelling.  A day's journey at that particular time was a formidable undertaking.  It was very often arduous and caused hardship on the individuals who were making the journey.  What was a day's travelling at that time is only an hour's journey to day.  We can all accept that the motor-car has indeed brought about a big number of changes.</P>
    <P>On the last occasion that a Bill dealing with the licensing laws did go through this House&mdash;I think it was in 1943&mdash;it was decided then by the Minister for Justice to continue the <i>bona fide</i> laws as a form of experiment&mdash;a form of further experiment.  That is very important to remember, that the <i>bona fide</i> laws were included in the last legislation that passed through this House as an experiment.  The whole idea behind the <i>bona fide</i> laws was to allow a traveller to strengthen himself while on his journey.  It was never envisaged that a person would specifically set out on a journey for the purpose of having a drink.  That practice has now grown up and we have a very large trade carried on in the sale of liquor under the guise of <i>bona fide.</i></P>
    <P>In and around Dublin we have a rash of <i>bona fide</i> houses where trade really begins when the city public-houses close.  We have a picture here in Dublin of the lounge bars where people drink until the normal city closing hour.  At the normal closing hour here many of these people, in good form, or in merry form, ready for anything, depart for the <i>bona fide</i> houses.  They normally pile into their own cars with their friends and head for those public-houses which have the right to trade up to 12 o'clock.  Now, these people&mdash;I do not say the majority, but many of them&mdash;drink pretty hard up to 12 o'clock.  Very often it is a matter of competition to get as many drinks as they can down <Col N="496" /> before 12 o'clock, and it is no exaggeration for me to say that many of these people, after finishing at 12 o'clock, are unfit to drive their cars back home. From 12 o'clock on we have in many areas a procession of murder machines on the roads back to Dublin.</P>
    <P>I think it is an extraordinary situation that in many of these premises, these <i>bona fide</i> houses, that the quiet, decent, respectable citizen who is having his pint without causing trouble to anybody has to be turned out at the normal closing hours of 10 or 10.30 from his local public-house and that he is replaced by a group, very often of tipsy individuals who have travelled out for the sole purpose of having a drink in that particular pub.  Of course, Deputies may say that this respectable, quiet man who is having his pint may, if he so desires, after leaving the local pub travel, if he has a car, three or four miles and that he then is entitled to more drink.  That may be, but they all have not cars.</P>
    <P>To my mind, this question of travelling in order to keep within the letter of the law is a real game of musical chairs as far as the law is concerned.  It would seem to me, at any rate, that quite a large number of the people who indulge in the <i>bona fide</i> trade&mdash;and when I say &ldquo;indulge in it&rdquo; I mean from the consumer point of view&mdash;have money to spare and I have no objection in the world to the Government relieving them of any spare cash they have in the form of taxation.  I do not want to deprive people of their legitimate entertainment, but I also believe that we have responsibility to other people and that the welfare of the ordinary members of the community who are not lucky enough to have this spare cash has to be taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>One of the biggest problems arising from this trade, and I do not think anyone will deny this, is the danger of serious accident.  There have been Dáil questions asked from time to time dealing with fatal accidents that have occurred on our roads and very often it is significant to note where these accidents take place and the times at which they take place.  While that is all I have to say in connection with the first part of the motion, I have a <Col N="497" /> suggestion to make in connection with it.  It is to extend the licensing hours in all areas in the hope of eliminating this problem of chasing from one licensed premises to the other in order to keep within the letter of the law. There are Deputies in this House who may not agree with that solution, and I am only putting it forward as my own view; but at any rate I think most Deputies will agree that there is an abuse there and that it is up to us to see what is the best way of dealing with the problem.</P>
    <P>The second part of the motion is one that is likely to cause a certain amount of controversy.  I make no bones about it at all.  It is that normal opening hours in this trade should operate throughout the country on St. Patrick's Day.  I will make apology to nobody for that.  There are Deputies and plenty of people outside this House who may disagree entirely with my view on that, but I would like to have on the record of the House what I think of it and the reason I think the law should be amended in that respect.  It is a well-known fact that more Irish people celebrate St. Patrick's Day outside of Ireland than in it.  I quoted the Bishop of Cork last week where he said it was a shame that so many of our people had to celebrate St. Patrick's Day outside the country.  I do not for a moment suggest that his lordship's suggestion was that they should celebrate it in the manner indicated in this part of my motion.  He was not dealing with it in that respect. But, I believe that many of our exiles abroad have a drink as part of the celebration of St. Patrick's Day and they are none the worse for it.</P>
    <P>In this country there is a restriction on the sale of liquor on Good Friday and other days.  I am all for that, but I do not think that anybody should compare for a moment our feelings on Good Friday with our feelings on St. Patrick's Day.  Tourists arriving in this country are under the impression that St. Patrick's Day is a day on which all Irishmen enjoy themselves, but they soon find that it is a day of gloom.</P>

      <P>Nobody has suggested getting drunk, but I guarantee to the Minister that there are more people drunk when they have to drink stealthily than there would be if the door were open and they were allowed in decently on St. Patrick's Day.</P>
      <P>I want to get this clear.  The ordinary men and women in this country are not entitled to take a drink on St. Patrick's Day, but on that day there is a dog show in Dublin and I never saw such a number of dog-admirers as come to Dublin on that day.  People have to queue to get in to see all the little doggies that are exhibited.  Why do they go there? Because they are entitled to have a drink in the show grounds.  If it is right to have a drink at the dog show on St. Patrick's Day, what is wrong with the ordinary individual having his drink?  Either cut it all out or let them all have it.</P>
      <P>Go down to Limerick on St. Patrick's Day.  I challenge any Deputy to deny that the position in Limerick City is that every public-house and hotel opens on St. Patrick's Day and they are open illegally as far as the law is concerned.  Races are held in Limerick on that day and it has been found impossible to get the public-houses closed when the people know that the hotels can sell drink and are doing so.  In recent years, as a result of the crowds getting into the hotels in Limerick for drink on St. Patrick's Day, the position has been that all the public-houses had to open. I hope I will be contradicted if that is not correct.  I happen to be very familiar with the position, more so than some of the people in this House. I want to see that state of affairs remedied.</P>
      <P>The Minister, by his interjection, more or less showed his own viewpoint on this matter.  I am of the opinion that there will be fewer people drunk and reeling around the streets when they can drink openly and aboveboard. I do not suppose, however, that there is much hope of getting the unanimous support of this House for that portion of this motion.</P>

      <P>I will leave that for the moment and deal with the third portion of the motion, namely, that the present licensing laws should be amended so as to enable rural dwellers to enjoy the same facilities as are at present afforded to city residents.  This part of the motion was the subject of a Private Members' Bill by Deputy Corry in 1948 and we know how the House received his Bill at that time. We also know that many of the Deputies who cast their vote at that time were subject to very strong pressure outside this House, when every pioneer group in the country wrote to Deputies.  They wrote to me. They threatened to put horns on me and all sorts of things if I supported a Bill that would allow the rural dweller to have the same facilities as the city dweller.  The extraordinary thing is that when Deputy Corry sought shortly afterwards to give the same facilities in the city as in the rural areas, namely, to stop the drinking in the cities on Sundays, we did not get the same rush of Deputies into the Division Lobbies to support that Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Constitution we all have equal rights in this State.  I maintain that as far as this section of the licensing code is concerned that right has been negatived. We have a licensing law here that confers liberty and facilities on the city dweller and we have other legislation which penalises the dweller in the rural area.  It is obvious, or should be obvious, to all Deputies that Parliament should pass no laws except laws which can be and must be enforced.  I believe that the laws made by this House must be enforced impartially as against all sections of the community. It is only common sense that legislation should be capable of general enforcement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In connection with the hours of trading on Sunday, the law is not being <Col N="501" /> enforced impartially towards all sections of the community.  Public-houses in the city areas open for a certain period on Sundays while in rural areas it is an offence to have a drink in your local premises on Sunday.  It is a well-known fact that the authorities are incapable of enforcing this harsh law and consequently the law is broken every Sunday of the year.  In some cases it is broken quite openly and flagrantly in rural areas.  I can put it briefly: there is no respect whatever for the licensing code, as it stands, in the country, and I believe it is bad for legislation generally that there should be no respect for the law.  Again I hope I am not hurting Deputy Tully's feelings&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Do not worry about my feelings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but whether he likes it or not, and whether the Government like it or not, the countryman will have his drink on a Sunday, if he feels like it, law or no law, and he is not one bit worried as to who condemns him.</P>
      <P>This part of my motion seeks not to prevent the city man from his enjoyment on Sunday but to give to the countryman the very same privilege. Judging by the present law, it looks very much as though it were the opinion of this House that the backbone of the nation, namely, the small farmers and workers in rural Ireland, must be protected from themselves by legislation passed by the city man. There are certain tribes in Africa to whom it is an offence to sell intoxicating liquor.  I presume the idea is that these people would go mad and shoot down all those who stand for law and order.  It would appear that the same mentality exists in this country as regards the rural dwellers&mdash;that they would not conduct themselves and consequently would be a menace to society as a whole, if they were allowed to have their refreshment on Sunday just like the city man.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Deputies and some people other than Deputies argue that, if the licensing law is changed, there would be more drinking on Sunday in rural <Col N="502" /> areas.  I do not accept that and I think we can put it this way: Is there a suggestion that there is more being drunk in Dublin as a result of the fact that they have that privilege on Sunday?  I do not see why that fear exists in the minds of the authorities, that the countryman is going to take advantage of the opportunity to drink to excess.  There are people in both city and country who will drink to excess at any time, but we cannot have the majority of the community penalised for the sake of this small minority.</P>
    <P>I think I have a fairly good knowledge of rural Ireland and I will say this to the Minister, that I am thoroughly convinced that if the licensing code was amended to-morrow morning, to confer on the rural man the same privilege as the city man enjoys, there would not be one extra bottle of stout drunk on Sundays.  Deputies who know rural Ireland will agree with me on that.  It is while there is illegal drinking going on that there is the danger of drunkenness.  When a man gets into a public-house illegally on a Sunday, he sits down silently and takes full advantage of the limited time at his disposal.  He will drink as much as he can because he is getting the drink possibly under an obligation to the publican and he sits there as long as he can because he knows he cannot get back if he leaves.  There are pubs in rural Ireland to-day&mdash;I do not say there are many&mdash;in which the safest time to have a drink is when the local sergeant is at Mass on Sunday.</P>
    <P>It is no use blaming the publicans for this state of affairs.  The majority of publicans are decent, law-abiding men, but they have to live amongst the people and they know their neighbours. It is up to them not to fall out with their neighbours and it has been the custom for years back to allow small farmers who come in two miles on Sunday morning, when Mass is over at 12 o'clock or one o'clock, to have a drink before they face the long journey home.  There is nothing wrong with making that position legal.  I have said it is no use blaming the publican for lack of public spirit.  I know that may be a pun, but, so far as his public spiritedness is concerned, I do not think he differs from any other <Col N="503" /> citizen.  If these people are given the opportunity of fixed hours on a Sunday, the majority of the publicans will be delighted to carry the law into operation and it will be a help to them as well.</P>
    <P>It is very funny to hear the people who want to save the farmer and the rural worker from the evils of drink. It is not among these people I mention, the rural dwellers, the farmers and workers, that the evils of drink are wrought.  I believe the people in rural Ireland can be trusted, that the small farmer and the worker in the rural areas, just like their counterparts in the city, have their feet solidly on the ground, and it is not amongst those sections of our community that the excesses take place.  It is, to my mind, amongst the lounge lizards and cocktail guzzlers who flit from one licensed premises to the other that the excessive drinking takes place.  I have <Col N="504" /> already referred to them as the group who, when closing time comes in the city, get into their cars with their lady friends, well primed with gin-and-it, and proceed to do a <i>bona fide</i> pub crawl.</P>
    <P>That is the law.  They are entitled to do that at the moment, but the decent farmer and worker in rural Ireland is not allowed to have a pint on Sunday.  The people in the rural areas are entitled to sit down publicly and openly in a clean bar on a Sunday for an hour or two and have their couple of pints and their chat with their neighbours.  It must be realised that the period after Mass on Sunday is one of the few occasions on which the rural people have an opportunity of meeting each other in a social way.</P>
