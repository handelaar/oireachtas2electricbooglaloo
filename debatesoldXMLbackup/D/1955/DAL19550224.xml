    <P>It is not possible to state the total number of persons insured under the Social Welfare Act, 1952, in Dublin County Borough at the end of each month.  It is estimated, however, that the number of persons insured (inclusive of agriculture, fishing and private domestic service) in Dublin at the relevant period was 221,200.  This estimate is based on the number of insurance cards exchanged at the local offices of the Department of Social Welfare in Dublin during the period January, 1954, to January, 1955.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is &ldquo;No&rdquo;. Under the Kerosene (Maximum Prices) (No. 3) Order, made in September, 1951, price control in relation to paraffin oil extends only to the margin to be taken on sales by retailers.  No increase in this margin was included in price adjustments recently announced by the wholesale suppliers.</P>

      <P>The information asked for in Parts (1) to (4) of the question is not available and could only be obtained by an exhaustive survey. Statistical returns in regard to land project operations are furnished quarterly for the information of members of the Oireachtas.  As has already been indicated in replies to previous similar questions, the provision of special statistical data other than as <Col N="849" /> given in the quarterly returns would entail a volume of work on the part of the land project staff which would not be justified.</P>
      <P>For the information of the Deputy I might mention that delay in the completion by farmers of work under Section A of the project is not a matter for which my Department has any responsibility.  If, however, the Deputy has any specific cases in mind and furnishes me with the relevant names and addresses, I will arrange to have them investigated.</P>

If the Deputy would put down a question to that effect I will see if any information can be got without unreasonable investigation, in order to help to clear up the <Col N="850" /> whole proceedings.

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to accept that, but is it not reasonable to expect that there are times when it may be necessary for a Deputy to ask what is the average cost per acre in any particular case?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no need for misunderstanding. Number 3 asks: &ldquo;the cost per acre to State funds of land improved on each such holding&rdquo;. If you want to refer back to each such holding would you look to number 1, which says: &ldquo;&ldquo;(1) the number of holdings in the Counties of Carlow, Wexford and Wicklow in which work has been in progress for three or more years&rdquo;.  It is perfectly clear that an investigation as to the number of holdings which are finished or in course of progress, and the average price per acre, would take infinitely more time and employ more personnel than could conceivably be justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">

In regard to the question of staff employment, this matter will naturally arise and be considered by the local authorities <Col N="864" /> concerned when a decision has actually been taken in regard to the future use of the institution.  It should be remembered, however, that some of the staff of the hospital were employed by the Roscommon County Council, subject to the condition that they may be transferred to the western regional sanatorium at Merlin Park, Galway, while other members of the staff are officers of the Ballinasloe Mental Hospital Authority.  The Deputy may be assured that full consideration will be given to any problems in regard to staff that may arise from the transfer of patients from Castlerea.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will state, in respect of Limerick City, (i) the estimated cost of providing a dental service, (ii) the amount which will be contributed by his Department, and (iii) when service will be in operation.</P>

      <P>The Limerick Corporation is already making a dental service available on a restricted scale for the classes that are at present eligible for such services, that is, for <Col N="866" /> persons who, broadly speaking, are in the lower income group and the dependents of such persons, for pupils of national schools in respect of defects discovered at school health examinations and for children under six years of age attending child welfare clinics in respect of defects discovered at such clinics.  Any immediate expansion of dental services is to meet the requirements of those classes.  Further groups are not being covered for the present.</P>
      <P>The additional cost of providing improved dental services will depend on the extent to which additional staff is employed by the corporation to meet requirements.  I have not yet received the proposals of the local authority in the matter and it is not possible, therefore, to indicate what the additional cost is likely to be in the coming financial year.</P>
      <P>In so far as the contribution to be made towards the cost involved in improving dental services is concerned, the normal contribution from the Exchequer is 50 per cent. but, as I informed a deputation from the corporation which I saw recently, I am examining specially the financing of health service schemes in Limerick City.</P>

    <P>Persons requiring such services normally make written application to the secretary of the responsible health authority to have their names included in the general medical services register.  I understand that local authorities have made forms for the purpose available at dispensaries, clinics and other health institutions and that the appropriate officers of <Col N="867" /> those authorities have availed of contacts with recipients of home assistance, old age and blind pensioners, recipients of unemployment assistance or non-contributory widows' pensions, foster parents of boarded-out children, etc., to make the procedure known.</P>
    <P>Where a person requires medical attention before his application has been considered by the health authority he can obtain a direction under Article 16 of the General Medical Services Regulations, 1954, from the local assistance officer or other authorised person which will entitle him and his dependents to the services of the district medical officer without further delay.</P>

      <P>The regulations mentioned apply to persons (e.g., the former public assistance class) in respect of whom no contribution was ever made by the Department of Social Welfare, as well as to the insured persons who were entitled to avail themselves of the hospital and specialist services formerly administered by that Department.  The cost of these services for insured persons was borne, not on the contributions of insured workers or their employers, but on the Exchequer, but, as I have already indicated, the effect of the provision of the Health Act, 1953, in relation to these services is that in future citizens as ratepayers will be bearing half the cost which formerly they bore as general taxpayers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>When I moved to report progress last night I was getting to what I called one of the gems of the discussion, introduced by the Minister for Health and supported ably by the Tánaiste.  An emphatic statement was made by the Minister for Health that the present high cost of beef was due to the fact that in 1932 the calves were slaughtered during the economic war; that if those calves had not been slaughtered then they would be available now as beef and would help to bring down the cost of beef.  Anything more nonsensical from two responsible Ministers is beyond my imagination. First of all, I hope some person who subscribes to <i>Dublin Opinion</i> or some other such journal will take time to make a drawing of the Minister for Health and the Tánaiste attending at the Dublin markets with 13-year-old beasts for sale.  They would be very &ldquo;scrawny&rdquo; at 13 years of age.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister for Health and the Tánaiste will ask the consumers of beef in Britain to explain why their beef has risen to the price of our beef to-day.  I have seen nowhere any evidence that there was a wholesale slaughter of calves in England in 1932 or at any other time, yet beef is scarce and dear there.  I am sorry the Minister for Health has not remained in the House.  He said here, as reported in column 651:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Economics of Grangegorman it certainly was,&rdquo;</P>
      <P>&mdash;the economics of Fianna Fáil&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;but it becomes more serious when those indulging in those economics are heard tut-tutting because there is a shortage of cattle, increased demand for them and prices going up &mdash; a shortage of cattle because the calves they slaughtered are not cattle to-day.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is an interesting contribution. This country in normal times, before the war, in the supply of its cattle contributed something like 5 per cent. of the British meat consumption and during the war, when the British had very severe rationing, our supplies to their market increased to about 10 per cent.  It is suggested now that because calves were slaughtered during the <Col N="870" /> economic war we have upset the whole world, that we are responsible for the high price of beef in the Argentine and for the shortage of beef in Australia; that the whole thing has been controlled by the mad economics of Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>That is just on a par with the intelligence that apparently is uppermost and leading the present Coalition groups.  They think people will accept that as an explanation because they were foolish enough to believe all the spokesmen of all those Parties when they suggested that the high cost of living was caused by bad management or by design, as I will prove later from the Minister for Health's speech.  They believed that those people had some good reason for making the statements they made.  They did not believe &mdash; as they could not be expected to believe &mdash;that they were being deliberately misled.</P>
    <P>As I said yesterday, we have now an admission from the Labour group that these commitments and promises were definitely made.  Now the Labour group is at sixes and sevens itself. Deputy Larkin &mdash; as I pointed out yesterday, reading extracts from his contribution here &mdash; admits that the high prices cannot be brought down and are not likely to be brought down. He says we must expect further steep increases in the near future.  His solution now is that the only way is to give further increases in wages to the workers to keep their standard of living on the level that it is on or should be on.  Then you have another member of the Labour Party clapping hands here, applauding the Government for the wonderful progress they have made and saying that when the five years of office is up they will be sent back here with flags flying for work well done in reducing the cost of living.</P>
    <P>You have Alderman Alfred Byrne, the Lord Mayor of Dublin, who made a solemn promise to the people of his constituency, that the loaves of bread which he had carried around in the October by-election on a stick would be brought down to the level that the people could afford to pay.  As I pointed out yesterday the butter reduction <Col N="871" /> of 5d. a lb. had been spread so thinly, to cover everything in the shape of the promises made, that if that money from the Exchequer had been utilised to bring even a further ½d. reduction in the cost of bread, the people would have had a better saving than from the butter alone.</P>

      <P>I will come to the price of butter.  I know now, as the result of an answer to a question to-day, why butter came down.  It was not out of the goodness of heart of the Minister for Health, to help the suffering people, but because there had to be some <i>quid pro quo</i> to the people because of the loss to the State in the sale of our butter abroad.  To-day, in answer to a question, we find that for this financial year up to the present, the cost to the Exchequer is nearly £250,000 for export butter subsidy.  I take it that it would be impossible to stand over that if there had not been this other little gesture and then the butter spread, until you were not likely to see it any more.</P>

      <P>Did anyone ever hear such nonsense? The Parliamentary Secretary to the Government, who is paraded to the world as one of our leading experts in matters of finance, hold out or prophesies inflation, though he need not bother now, because there is going to be inflation brought to us by inflation elsewhere.  I heard the Parliamentary Secretary, on the eve of an election, giving people the assurance that prices could be brought down and that subsidies could be introduced in sufficient amounts to keep prices at the 1951 level.  Is his Government doing it?</P>

The policies of our Parties, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, were discussed in the presence of the university students and of the other persons present.  The Parliamentary Secretary stated how this could be done&mdash;that the tax on beer and spirits would be so heavily reduced as to bring about such an increase in consumption that there would be additional revenue to the State sufficient to meet the cost of the subsidies.  That is what the Parliamentary Secretary said, and if he wants to deny that, then I take it that he will get the students of the university to confirm his denial.</P>

I said yesterday that the time will come when the public will display their intelligence by giving the proper answer, and in a manner to ensure that it will not ever be played again.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Higgins made a speech here that obviously had no relation to the facts.  I would say that it was made without any consideration before he stood up.  It was just a bluff speech. The whole speech was in defence of their position and not an admission, such as should be made now, in order that the public would be educated and would get an understanding of what the position is, that a great many items, which increased in price due to conditions beyond our control, cannot be controlled except by subsidies.  If you have subsidies you must attach them to rationing in order that the Exchequer can see that there is an equitable distribution of the subsidised goods to the public at large.  Has it not penetrated into the Minister's mind that that is the position rather than keep fooling the people, or attempting to fool them, for a little while longer?  Should it not now be admitted that that is the position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I deliberately said yesterday that I am not criticising the present set up because they were not able to prevent price rises.  I am criticising them, and <Col N="875" /> will continue to do so, until they make an honest admission that they were wrong in what they thought could be done or they were wrong in saying something that they knew could not be done, and that we will have to face the situation as it develops from time to time in the ups and downs of things. How are you going to do it?  That is a matter for the Government to decide, and as regards the methods by which it will be dealt with, it will be the duty of the Opposition to criticise or to suggest better methods to those which are proposed.  But the responsibility now is broadly on the back of the Government opposite.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health, speaking a couple of days ago as reported in column 648 of the Dáil Debates, said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Believing that, the Government in 1952 introduced the black Budget. They deliberately increased the price of essential foodstuffs as part of their financial policy, forcing up the prices of tea, of butter, sugar, flour and bread.&rdquo;</P>

Until recently, as a person who because of his standing and his membership of the House and the position he holds as adviser to the Government, he was taken quite seriously.  Comparatively recently at a meeting in the country the Parliamentary Secretary pointed out that the fall in the price of bacon and pigs products was one of the first steps in the right direction and resulted from Government policy, but the people should wait another six months when there would be another fall.  What was the reaction to that?  Everybody who had a pig or sow rushed to the bacon factories or the markets to get rid of it before the price fell.  Now we have the further reaction to that. There are not enough pigs and prices are going up again.</P>

    <P>I think the Parliamentary Secretary might be well advised to keep his theories and prophecies in cold storage for a while so that there would be less damage done in the quick time that it is done as a result of his statements. We could say that the cause of the <Col N="880" /> increased cost of living since the advent of this Government is something that was deliberately done by them.</P>
    <P>Yesterday I asked the Tánaiste what he was going to do.  There is a very attractive price for our beef and markets are being fully supplied with beef for sale abroad.  If that price remains as attractive as it is or tends to go up and if somebody says that the price will fall in six, eight or ten weeks' time you will have people rushing to denude the country of our stock of cattle.  What steps will be taken in that respect?  Can they say to us now that they have information or that, according to the theories of the experts, the price will fall as they expect and say will be the case in respect of tea?  Is the situation going to continue? There will be a question put down next week asking the Tánaiste to tell the House by how much has beef risen in the last seven months as compared with the rise in the price of beef in the previous three years.  When it is found that the price has risen even higher in the last seven months than in the previous three years, what is the answer going to be?</P>
    <P>Who is responsible?  Is this the result of deliberate policy by the Government to make life harder for the people, to stop them from having money to spend or to save, as the Minister for Health has said?  What is the ultimate position going to be? Is it not far better for the Deputies who comprise these groups over here and for their Ministers to say: &ldquo;We have learned a lot in the last seven years.  It is impossible for us to carry out a form of administration to ensure that the economics of the State will be as we believed they could be when we were sitting over here, and it is something that must be juggled with from day to day because of the circumstances under which we exist, and because we have no control over outside affairs?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I want to say this: I know many people who have come to me in recent months and have said that they regret very much the support they gave towards bringing about this change.  But how could we be <Col N="881" /> blamed, they asked.  We were shown that in our expenditure at home pounds per week could be saved in our cost of living, and instead the situation has become worse.  The present Government may juggle all it likes with the figures.  It can show that unemployment is not as high as it was when we left office, no matter how they get these figures.  They say there are 7,000 fewer unemployed, but there are some 70,000 still unemployed and there was not a promise by Fine Gael to reduce unemployment by 7,000 or 8,000.  Their promise was to abolish unemployment altogether and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Government was most interesting on that in the matter of emigration.  From what I have heard the solution that would flow from his contribution to that debate &mdash; or was it Deputy O'Donovan's? I do not know which Parliamentary Secretary it was because I have not yet seen the verbatim report&mdash;but that solution will not find favour.  I am not quoting it, but I would say there is a solution suggested by implication again.</P>
    <P>What the unemployed are concerned about is that if there were only 10,000 unemployed, and if there were 50,000 or 60,000 fewer unemployed now than when Fianna Fáil were in office, that 10,000 still want work and a decent standard of living.  Fine Gael are not going to escape the responsibility by saying that there are 7,000 fewer signing the register.  It is a very dangerous thing to play with.  What is going to happen if by some unforeseen circumstances an unfortunate situation develops in which they have 7,000 more signing on at the labour exchanges than Fianna Fáil had?  Who is going to be blamed then?  Those Deputies who espouse the cause and wave the flags of their particular groups do not realise what they are letting themselves in for.  They got in once into Government for three years and they got out again.  They are now in for seven or eight months, but I can tell Deputies that if they hope to stay in for five or ten years they will have to &ldquo;deliver the goods.&rdquo;  It will be to their credit if they last five years and it will be to their greater credit if they last for ten years.</P>

      <P>I intervene in this debate merely to dispose of one remark of Deputy Briscoe.  We can shortly be sending for the sackcloth and ashes.  In the course of a reference to the address of the Minister for Health, Deputy Briscoe, in his contribution here to-day, cited column 651 and he ascribed to the Minister for Health certain remarks in relation to the slaughtering of calves at some particular period.  Well, I have read that column and the Minister for Health did not ascribe the slaughter of calves to any particular period other than by saying that it occurred during the Fianna Fáil term of office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not giving way to the Deputy, but the Deputy will be interested to know that calves were slaughtered long after the economic war and those calves would not be 13 years old to-day, but their progeny would be extremely valuable in view of <Col N="883" /> present prices.  I know I am addressing my remarks to the Party that gloried in the death of the British market and gloried in the fact that while it took 100 years to build, it would take but 100 days to destroy.  Shades of Senator Connolly, Minister for Lands at one time in the Fianna Fáil Government, who proclaimed that view!</P>
      <P>Coming back to Deputy Briscoe, he seems &mdash; and, mark you, when this interchange was going on he was acclaimed by the smiles of his colleagues for his smartness in pointing out how those cattle would be extremely hoary if still alive, those cattle that fell by the wayside during the Fianna Fáil term of office.  I wanted to point out and put on the records of the House what had been occurring to the cattle trade during the period Fianna Fáil was in office and on the 25th March, 1953, I put down a question which is reported at column 1006 in Volume 137, asking the then Minister for Agriculture to state the number of calves slaughtered for export during each of the years 1945 to 1952, inclusive, giving details of differentiation between breeds, and this is the reply which Deputy Bartley, the then Parliamentary Secretary, provided.  It makes interesting reading.  Deputy Briscoe may at this point be advised to make a few notes.</P>

      <P>This is the reply: &ldquo;The numbers of calves slaughtered at cattle-slaughtering premises registered for export purposes under the Agricultural Produce (Fresh Meat) Act, during each of the years 1945 to 1952 inclusive were as follows: 1945, 36,533; 1946, 29,738; 1947&rdquo;&mdash;which was the last year that Fianna Fáil had an opportunity to slaughter calves in this country&mdash;&ldquo;49,790.&rdquo;  Deputies will note the improvement in their capacity for cattle slaughtering as time went on.  In 1948 there was a providential change of Government and the new Minister for Agriculture made a particular Order relating to the wholesale slaughter of young cattle in this country.  In that year the number of young cattle that were slaughtered in this country was 97.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the Supplies and Services Bill has been introduced it has been availed of by the Opposition to charge this Government with having, to a certain extent, failed to redeem particular promises made in the course of the last general election. We on this side of the House have pointed out, in relation to these deliberate promises which the Opposition are claiming we made, that we were formerly attacked by the same Opposition for not making promises.  However, we in the course of the formation of this Government have furnished a programme which it is our intention to implement and the only point at issue, to my mind, is the period which this Government should get to implement that programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There seemed to be some difference of opinion among the Opposition as to the period which should be reviewed. It was interesting to hear Deputy Traynor say that the period under review was not exactly seven months but a period of seven months plus three and a half years.  That was naïve.  That suggested that nothing occurred between the period that the inter-Party Government had been in office from 1948 to 1951 up to the time it attained office in June of last year.  We know <Col N="886" /> what actually occurred, that by deliberate governmental action during that period, by one fell stroke, there was a dramatic, a tragic increase in the cost of living and that it could not be attributable in any way to any occurrence outside this State.  We know that it was deliberate Government policy, that it was deliberately planned by that Government at that time and that since then various sections of our people have had to obtain increases in their wages, increases in their allowances, in order to meet the impact of the action of the then Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    <P>It is also to be remarked that we have at our disposal to-day resources which we left after us when we left office in 1951.  The Leader of the present Opposition let the cat out of the bag in the town of Youghal, in Deputy Moher's constituency, during the momentous by-election as a result of which Deputy Barry was elected, when he admitted that there was £24,500,000 left of the American moneys at the time that his Government got into office and that six months later there was not a penny left.  There is no doubt if that money was available to this Government when we got back into office in June of last year we would be able to do much more in the short period we are in office towards the implementation of the programme we have begun.</P>
    <P>No matter how Deputies may try to make points out of it, it is a fact that the general feeling throughout this country to-day is one of satisfaction because the people know there is a stable Government in office, not one which staggered into power like the previous Government had done on assurances that were given by particular Deputies whom the electorate, the moment they got a chance, cleared from this House.  It is true that during the whole period that Fianna Fáil were in office from 1951 up to the time of their resignation, it was rightly claimed that they had no mandate to be in office or to pursue the policy they were unfortunately pursuing at that time.  This Government can rightly claim it has a clear and definite mandate, secured in the election of last year, to attain office <Col N="887" /> and to do better than the Government that had been there before them had done.</P>
    <P>It has been stated by a number of those on the Opposition side that seven months was too short a period to expect from this Government anything remarkable in the way of achievement.  But during that seven months certain promises have been redeemed and there was no need for pressure from anybody to do that because the decision to take those actions was prompted by the messages that were received by everybody on this side of the House as they journeyed from door to door in the course of their election campaign last year when they were met by the housewives who said: &ldquo;What will you do about the price of butter if you get into office?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I represent a predominantly dairying constituency and I am aware of the fact that as well as having this impact on the capacity of our people to purchase such a necessary food as butter, there were families in this State who were not any longer in a position to buy as much, if any, butter for their household in the course of the week. At the same time we were faced with the challenge of margarine and I claim the contribution made by this Government in reducing butter by 5d. a lb. was a notable contribution in two ways, No. 1, to the consumers, so as to bring butter within their reach to purchase, and No. 2, to the dairying farmers of this country to assist them in meeting the challenge of margarine in its ultimate ill-effects on what is a basic industry in this country.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that, reading reports of the criticisms made by the Deputies of the Opposition, one can only infer from their remarks that if they were in office still butter would not have been reduced by 5d. a lb. One can also infer from such a reading that if in office they would have allowed the price of tea to rise. Neither is there any doubt that were it not for the visit of the Prime Minister of Ceylon and of the statement made by him about the price of tea, the Opposition would have used this debate on the Supplies and Services <Col N="888" /> Bill to criticise the Government for the manner in which the price of tea was kept down.  Were it not for the statement of the Prime Minister of Ceylon&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It seems from the speeches made by the Opposition Deputies that if Fianna Fáil were in office now they would have allowed the price of tea to rise and that on the other hand the price of butter would now be at least as high as it was before Fianna Fáil lost office.  Before I finish, I should like to refute the allegation that there were no calves slaughtered except during the economic war period because, as I pointed out, 116,000 young cattle lost their lives during Fianna Fáil's term.  These young cattle would be an extremely valuable asset to us to-day&mdash;or at least their offspring would be.

      <P>Deputy Briscoe and his colleagues have accused this side of the House from every possible angle.  I have no argument to offer against that &mdash; they are quite entitled to do that&mdash;but I do think that Deputy Briscoe should be man enough to give credit to the Minister for Industry and Commerce for one particular fact. Deputy Briscoe and Deputy de Valera are very fond of looking up past records and past speeches made in the House and I would suggest that it would be very helpful for them in the course of this debate if they had looked up the debate of early November, 1953, again on the problem of the Supplies and Services Bill, when their Deputy Lemass was the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I am glad at any rate, no matter what may be said in this debate, that the present Minister for Industry and Commerce has made no attempt whatsoever to use his powers to try and stifle criticism in the manner in which Deputy Lemass did in 1953, and if we have the full freedom of discussion on this matter now, that in itself shows that the inter-Party Government are not smothering criticism in any sense of the word.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last night Deputy Briscoe, in the course of his contribution to the debate, used a statement made by my colleague, Deputy James Larkin. Deputy Briscoe, of course, is very able in switching around arguments to suit his point.  Let me now inform him with all the authority of the Labour Party in this House that Deputy Larkin, when speaking here last week, was not speaking for a section of the Labour Party only.  Deputy Larkin's views were the views of the entire Labour Party in the House.  Let that be made quite clear.  Whether there is to be credit given for or criticism offered of the remarks of Deputy <Col N="890" /> Larkin, his remarks were the views of every member of this Party.  I believe myself that the approach of the Opposition to this matter is that we should go and admit defeat and that if we did, they would be quite satisfied. If we did admit defeat, they would not say a word against us.  They would not dream then about going to the Library of the Dáil and of bringing up here records of past debates and quoting from them.</P>
    <P>Personally, I have no interest in quoting from past debates.  The only person whose contribution I read &mdash; and it is very rarely I go back and read any of the debates &mdash; is myself for the very simple reason that from the time we come in here we may take a strong clear-cut line and in order that we will not deviate from that line I believe it is essential that every member would have an odd look at what he said.  I include Deputy Briscoe in that.  Of course Deputy Briscoe was able conveniently to be very silent during his last three years on this side of the House.</P>
    <P>I am giving the Opposition credit for any offers of criticism that they may make on this Supplies and Services Bill because, after all, they are entitled to make criticisms and we do not assume the right to take umbrage at such criticisms, but what strikes me as extraordinary is the reason why they object to the members of this side of the House being able to get up and, where necessary, being able to criticise their own Government.  Is it because members of the Opposition were not allowed to do it when in Government that they believe we should not have that right of criticism?  The difference in the approach of the Fianna Fáil Party and of the members of the Labour Party is that we are not afraid to express our views whether in Opposition or in Government; and for Deputy Lemass's benefit again let me say &mdash; and he can use it as he likes &mdash; if the day comes when we in the Labour Party believe that no more can be done in the way of improvements, we will be the first to admit it, but we shall never throw in the stick and let things drag until that day comes.  We shall never say that we will express a view in support of the policy of a Government if <Col N="891" /> it should be something in the nature of the views expressed by Deputy Lemass, the first speaker in this debate on behalf of the Opposition.</P>
    <P>I suppose one could describe Deputy Lemass as the Crown Prince of the Opposition Party.  It is quite obvious that his view was: &ldquo;Look!  prices are going up, and we can do nothing about them but admit they are going up.&rdquo; Now we refuse to take that easy way out, so long as we are members of this House.  We realise that the century is getting old.  Many of the Deputies here have been here a long time, but they do not seem to realise that the century is getting old.  We are over halfway through.  Because we, in the Labour Party, give our support to the Government we do not believe in sitting back and saying: &ldquo;Let things take their course.&rdquo;  It is because of that that we are prepared to criticise the line of approach taken by the Government, if we think such criticism is necessary, in the same way as we would criticise any Government.  Possibly it is because Fianna Fáil are envious of that fact, since they did not have that right themselves when they were in Government, that they now seem to recent our exercising that right and would prefer that we did not avail ourselves of it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass, when speaking in this debate, referred to the continuation of these powers.  We would all naturally like to see some form of permanent legislation instead of the present temporary measure.  Undoubtedly that would be an advantage.  But Deputy Lemass was in office for three years from 1951 to 1954, to say nothing of the first period from 1932 onwards. Surely it ill-becomes him now to stand up here and criticise when he himself held that responsible office and could have done what he now takes the present Minister to task for not doing. He told us he intended to do that.  It is no use saying what he was going to do.</P>

      <P>Deputy Lemass knows as well as I do all about some of the famous drafts left in Departments when people go out of office.  He spoke <Col N="892" /> about the inefficiency and ineffectiveness of the present system.  What did he do to remedy that position?  Merely because Deputy J. Larkin had the honesty and the courage to speak about the possible inefficiency and ineffectiveness of this system Deputy Briscoe gets up on his hind legs, as it were, and ridicules him and says his views are divorced from the views of his Party.  If we as a Party believe there is room for improvement in the present system in operation in relation to prices we are quite prepared to make that view plain.  We believe there is need for improvement.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce knows there is need for improvement. It is for that reason that we come out here openly and say not alone that we want it but we want it as soon as possible.</P>

If I draw attention to what he said, it is merely because of the views he uttered and is not personal to the man.  I was surprised at the approach adopted by an intelligent Deputy like Deputy Cunningham.  He talked about the tea on tick and he was ticking away all the time during which members of the Government Parties got up to speak.</P>
      <P>The Crown Prince is missing at the moment but Deputy Major de Valera is here.  He is waiting with all his paraphernalia and perhaps he would explain to his own colleagues if it is a serious and heinous crime for the present Government to let tea importers operate on a bank overdraft from now until next September, why then in answer to a question on 26th March, 1953 at columns 1173-1174, did the then Minister for Finance state in relation to Tea Importers that the amount due to the bank at the end of 1952 by Tea Importers amounted to £3,849,201.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The date is 26th March, 1953, and the columns 1173-4. Surely, if it is a crime now, Deputy Cunningham should have been objecting virulently to the cup of tea on tick for the last three years.  I do not say the present system is the most favourable one.  All I am saying is that in present circumstances it is wise that the people, through the intervention of the present Government, should not have to suffer an increase of 1/4 per lb. where tea is concerned.  That is the amount by which the price would have been increased had Deputy Briscoe and his colleagues been on this side of the House instead of over there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe complains about butter.  He says that here in Dublin a lot of the working people use margarine. The people down the country do not use margarine.  I hope they will never have to use it.  Butter is one item we want brought under proper control.  We reduced it by 5d. per lb., and that is something Fianna Fáil would never have done.  Speaking a few days ago here Deputy Lemass said, in connection with butter and tea, that this decision was arrived at regardless of the consequences either to the national finances or the national well-being.  Deputies will find that at column 192 of the Official Report, Volume 148.  Surely the national finances must be subjected to the national well-being of the people.  It would be poor satisfaction to us, irrespective of where we sit in this House, if we knew that a Government could easily balance its Budget and that there would be no overdrafts if, at the same time, the people were not in a <Col N="894" /> position to provide the necessaries of life for themselves.</P>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe in attacking us for making reductions referred to certain promises or statements that were made.  Assuming that Deputies in their wisdom went out and in the heat of election made certain statements or promises will Deputy de Valera, for instance, say that his own Party in the throes of the general election in 1951, said they were going to reduce or remove subsidies?  Let us be candid about this.  We are trying to form a stable Government and stable living conditions for our people.  Where will we get by pointing the finger at one another and saying: &ldquo;You said such and such a thing&rdquo;?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Fan nomead anois, a dhuine uasail.  I know candidates who in 1951 went out and told the people that the policy of the Party for which they stood, the Fianna Fáil Party, was completely contrary to the policy of the inter-Party Government at that time.  I think that the Fianna Fáil Party said they would reduce these items themselves &mdash; if they said that and they did not &mdash; the point is they attacked someone on this side of the House.  I will not waste time in attacking you.  I am interested in the future of this country and its people.  Many items are under discussion in this House and there is no need for me to dwell much longer on this aspect because many Deputies, including Deputy Larkin and Kyne, mentioned quite clearly the policy of the Labour Party. We stand over those views.  It is well to know, and let Deputy Briscoe know, that we are impatient in trying to get better results, and it is only by being impatient that anyone can get anything done.  Let Deputy Briscoe remember that.  When the day comes, and we sit back smugly as Fianna Fáil did for 16 or 17 years, then the policy of our Party is receding in its interest in the people.  It is because we realise the necessity of going full-steam ahead that we are from day to day, both here in the Dáil and in the councils of our own Party, striving for better conditions, <Col N="895" /> and to reduce the cost of living just as well as would be doing it if we were in opposition.</P>
      <P>The Prices Advisory Body was referred to.  I will not refer to it except to say that Deputies heard Deputy Jim Larkin pointing out how necessary it was to get improved machinery in order to try and deal with prices.  The answer has been given by many Deputies, that it was the present Minister for Industry and Commerce or some other Minister in the inter-Party Government of 1951 who set it up.  All right, we are not denying that.  What we have always admitted &mdash; and Deputy de Valera I am sure will admit&mdash;that when some measure is introduced into this House it is only when it is put into operation that we see its shortcomings.  Let us be honest enough to admit its shortcomings, and if we are prepared to try to improve the machinery of State let us do it.  I believe, and every member of the Labour Party believes, that it is urgently necessary to do so.  How will this problem be tackled?  In so far as we are convinced it will be done by an improvement in the type of machinery introduced for such important measures, and it will, in itself, help us to achieve what we need, and that is the solution to the problem of prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let Deputies in the Opposition Benches understand that we are not just satisfied in speaking about the reduction in the price of tea, sugar, bread and butter.  We are interested in every item and every commodity affecting our people in their everyday lives, whether it is food, clothing or shelter.  We cannot afford to divorce ourselves from any set of problems which our people may have.  There again we are completely at variance with the policy of Fianna Fáil.  I am convinced at any rate it is because they realise the progressive attitude we are taking of tackling these problems that they are complaining.  I know they would be happier and more content in attacking us if tea were to go up by 1/4 per lb.  Deputy Briscoe would come into this House and say, perhaps, that many people in Dublin were using margarine, if butter had <Col N="896" /> not been reduced.  His complaint, of course, would be that they had to resort to margarine, because the price of butter had shot so high.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so.  The consumption of margarine is rising.  I eat it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few items which I would like to pinpoint again.  Some little while ago a question arose in connection with the publication of price lists in the various shops. This was introduced I think, in 1938, by Deputy Lemass, the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, but it was most amazing how quickly it was put back into a cupboard, as it were, and how quickly it was that everyone forgot that there were ever such regulations made.  I am glad to say, in answer to this question recently, the Minister for Industry and Commerce informed the House that this matter was being attended to again.</P>
      <P>After all, there are many members on my left and on my right who individually believe in the importance of free trade and in the importance of the success of private enterprise.  If that is so, what is wrong when we have the right through regulations in the House in helping the housewife, the person about whom everyone here is so much worried, what is wrong with having a system in operation whereby she could see from the footpath outside the shop the prices of the items inside? It is no use in saying that she could wait until she asked for a pound of rashers and a pound of butter, and then find that the price was higher than she thought.</P>
      <P>There are many places in the country where this system is vitally important.  I have been informed that the law at present in parts of the suburbs of Cork City can compel a trader in Patrick Street or Princes Street to publish this price list, but evidently under the regulations as introduced by Deputy Lemass, while he was Minister for Industry and Commerce, it seems that the same regulations could not compel a trader to do so in, say, Gurranebraher.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We want no special treatment.  We want a fair crack of the whip for everyone, <Col N="897" /> whether it is in the cities or towns.  We want prices publicised in the shops and this will give the traders something which perhaps will benefit the people.</P>
    <P>There is another very important point.  I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to tell the Minister for Industry and Commerce to tackle this problem of weights and measures.  I do not know whether it may be possible to go into this matter as a separate item or not, when we are speaking of prices.  I believe it is bad enough for a housewife to go in and buy 1 lb. or 2 lb. of rashers, and pay high prices, but it is worse not getting a fair weight for her money.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Except that it is very important that protection be given to the consumer, not only in the matter of prices but in the matter of weight. I and many other Deputies are very anxious to know what will happen in connection with the reports of the Fair Trade Commission and when it will happen.  The very fact of setting up such a commission has been a great benefit if, but only if, the Minister is prepared to act according as the reports come in.</P>
      <P>In regard to the problem of prices, views are expressed by people who set themselves up as very highly educated economists.  Whether or not they are of the Manchester school of thought is immaterial to me.  I do not care who they are.  It is quite obvious to the man in the street and the man on the country road that in many instances prices are being held at a high level by reason of something which must be dealt with.  In fairness to the Minister, I do not intend following that line except to say that, not only are we eagerly awaiting reports of this body, but we are eagerly awaiting any development which may help to alleviate the position created by pressure groups who use the terms &ldquo;black-marketeers&rdquo; and &ldquo;cut-throat&rdquo; in respect of persons who offer certain items and commodities to the housewife at lower prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="898" /> The discussion on Supplies and Services is not just a game of politics here.  Deputy Briscoe may rest easy now that he has eased himself of the terrible burden, the pressure on his brain space, of all he was going to show from quotations throughout this debate.  We do not worry about that. What we worry about is the present and the future.  Is Deputy Briscoe aware that Deputy Lemass, the highlight of his Party&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not wasted time in quoting what anyone said about that.  I concentrate on quoting what has been said by people who, I believe, are very careful in their approach. Does Deputy Briscoe know that not once in the course of his contribution to this debate did he even mention the word unemployment?  Our approach to this whole subject is that, not alone must prices be regulated, but prices must be regulated to suit present requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a rule, a certain latitude is allowed in the debate on the Supplies and Services Bill.  On many occasions it has been termed a miniature budget, indicating the policy of the Government. It is cool for any Deputy to come in here and speak in this debate in an academic manner and forget the problem, not of those who can pay, but of the thousands who cannot pay. Deputy Briscoe drew attention to the fact that there may be 7,000 less unemployed now but let Deputy Briscoe know that it is because the problem confronting us is that there are still 70,000 that we are not prepared to continue in an easy manner.  Let Deputy Briscoe believe from me now that it is because of our firm conviction that we have the solid support of every other <Col N="899" /> Party in this inter-Party Government, not alone in trying to achieve improvements in the standard of those who are working, but in trying to secure a decent future for the unfortunate unemployed that we are in this Government. Let Deputy Briscoe realise that it is because of the common understanding, the common belief of every group in this inter-Party Government, that such can be achieved that we have offered ourselves to form part of the Government.</P>

When we make mistakes we admit them.  We are not ashamed to come into the House and criticise when it is necessary but the criticism that is offered by us and which will be offered on every necessary occasion is criticism of a constructive nature.  We are not prepared to adopt the system of sitting in the back seats behind the Government and doing nothing, as Deputy Briscoe and his colleagues did for three years.  The cost of living went up in a matter of a few months, in 1951, from 109 to 124 points.  What did Deputy Briscoe say then?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>The theme of the speeches in support of this Bill has been in the main &ldquo;what would you do&rdquo; and a new version of the ten-thirty call: &ldquo;Time, gentlemen, please.&rdquo;  Appeals have come from every second speaker here for time and patience.  Why was there not time and <Col N="900" /> patience available to the Fianna Fáil Government?  Why did you say last May: &ldquo;Do not mind bringing in your Budget.  Go out.  We will bring in a Budget.  You are discredited.  The people do not want you.  Get out as quickly as you can and we will do these things mighty quickly?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister for Health said here last night that he wished the people could listen in to the debates here.  It is a pity they cannot because the cries of last May are still ringing in their ears and it would be a pretty disharmony to mix them with what has been heard from Labour and Fine Gael Benches in the last few weeks: &ldquo;Give us time and have patience.&rdquo;&ldquo;What would you do?&rdquo; is the cry now.  This &ldquo;<i>tu quoque</i>&rdquo; way will not solve the problem.</P>
      <P>You all claimed that we were discredited in the last election.  Will you tell us why, if we were discredited, that you have not agreed to a similar discrediting of our Budget, how is it that you have been operating under that Budget and how is it that you claim that under that Budget which you took over you have been able to give a reduction of 5d. a lb. in butter?  You confess quite candidly that you have not been able to give under that Budget the money necessary to stabilise tea, but I want to remind the House that, under that same Budget, we provided £7,000,000 to stabilise the price of bread and flour and it was good enough for you to come along and reduce butter at a cost of £1? million afterwards but it has not been good enough to enable you to stabilise the price of tea; you have had to borrow for tea.</P>
      <P>There is no logic at all in the comparison which Deputy Desmond made between borrowing for tea by Tea Importers, Ltd., and borrowing by the community in the person of the Minister for Finance.  We are drinking borrowed tea and there is no question of doubt about it.  It is not a subsidy in the sense which the Labour Party said they would insist on.</P>

      <P>Deputy Murphy is working a Budget which he took over from us and which he now, quite conveniently and very inconsistently, accepts as not having been discredited although the Party that brought it in was discredited in the last election.  He is working our Budget and that same Budget enabled us to give the people £7,000,000 or £8,000,000 to stabilise the price of bread.  Whatever other money it would have provided, had we got back in May, would probably also have been put on bread and not on butter. They chose to do it differently to show they were doing something new. They put it on butter because they wanted to do something different from Fianna Fáil and for no other reason, and if we had not put £7,000,000 on bread, it is on bread they would have put it.  They know themselves that it would have suited them better to put it on bread, even in the circumstances which existed.</P>
      <P>I was reading an article in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> last Sunday week which had to do with a gentleman called Sir John Kotelawala.  I do not know whether I have the proper Cingalese pronunciation, but I am sure Deputies have all seen the name and Deputy Murphy will admit that, if I have not got it, I have at least staggered it.  The heading on the article was that this statement was definitely not Mr. Lemass's cup of tea. There is one thing Sir John Kotelawala said which I took particular note of, that he blamed the high price of tea in England very largely on the middleman's profits.  He did say something about producers in his country, but I understand that it is not from there that we get our tea at all.  We get only one-tenth of it from there, but that is beside the point.  He blamed in the main the middleman for the high price of tea in England and the Six Counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that we are importing tea through an agency which makes no profits and if it is possible, in Sir John's words, to reduce the price of tea to the consumer in England by reducing the middleman's profits, it is quite obvious that we cannot do that, if the importing agency is making no profit.  I have heard speakers opposite <Col N="902" /> saying they would remove Tea Importers altogether and allow people to import quite freely as they did in pre-emergency days.  However strongly we may have heard those views expressed before the present Government was set up, they now have thrown them overboard and are going to accept this emergency method of doing it.</P>
    <P>There are two speeches which I think must get particular attention. They are the speeches made by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Government, on the one hand, and by Deputy James Larkin, on the other. I do not suppose it would be proper to say that these two speeches give a composite picture because there is nothing composite about them, but one of them warns us about the dangers of inflation and, in the other, Deputy Larkin would justify borrowing to keep prices static, not to talk about reducing them, for any purpose under the sun.  I think it is very interesting to quote what he said in that connection. Deputy Cunningham has been taken to task for having made a remark about &ldquo;tea on tick&rdquo;, and at column 596, Volume 148 (4) of the Dáil Debates, Deputy Larkin quite plainly admits that it is on tick and he goes on to ask:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Why do you not talk about industrialists who are establishing their industries under the Trade Loan (Guarantee) Bill as doing it on tick? Why do we not talk about the whole of trade and industry that works on overdraft as working on tick?  Why do we not talk about the farmers who are provided with loans as carrying on their industry on tick?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Is it not stretching things very far to compare the money provided for the development of industry with the money that goes to buy the tea which will have been drunk by the time we come to pay for it?</P>
    <P>We had that same process before. We had it from 1948 to 1951.  We borrowed for this same purpose and I think that one of the most unworthy remarks which Deputy Larkin made in his speech or in any other speech by him to which I listened was that all the difficulties and all the hardships inflicted on the people here were <Col N="903" /> inflicted on them in the 15 years prior to the Coalition coming in.  It is certainly a very poor reward, a very poor appreciation of the effort of the people who fed us and clothed us and gave us fuel during the war and enabled us to stay out of that war, to say that they did not contribute at all as they should have to the welfare of the people.</P>
    <P>Deputy Larkin might for comparison's sake compare the two war situations which we experienced since 1939.  He must know that with a war raging all round our shores and in the skies above us and with great Powers threatening us almost monthly, we stood the storm politically, militarily and economically, and that the outfit he backed for three years collapsed when war broke out in Korea.  That fact is, in itself, sufficient commentary on the fitness of these two political set-ups to minister to the needs of the Irish people.</P>
    <P>I was referring to an article about tea and I am referring to this now because apparently backers of this Bill, particularly on the Labour Benches, seem to take a very poor view of a Fianna Fáil speaker offering any word of criticism at all, and if I offer them criticism from some source other than a political source, perhaps they may pay a little more heed to it.  We have the president of the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union.  He did not use the word &ldquo;promises&rdquo;&mdash; he said &ldquo;solemn promises&rdquo;.  &ldquo;We will see,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that they will carry out their solemn promises,&rdquo; and he did not say that they were promises to keep the price of goods static &mdash; they were promises to bring them down.  We know from their speeches that Labour value more a reduction in the price of goods and in the cost of living far more than an increase in wages.  There they show a great deal of wisdom.</P>

But now the Transport and General Workers' Union &mdash;and no one can suggest they went out campaigning for Fianna Fáil in the general election&mdash;have despaired of the <Col N="904" /> Coalition carrying out their solemn promises and apparently from the statement issued at the Limerick meeting the promises were not meant to be on the Kathleen Mavourneen system. Apparently they believe in the ability of the Coalition to do something in quick time.  Now, what they cannot get in the way in which it was promised to them, that is, a reduction in costs, they are now going to get by an increase in wages and apparently they are going to strike if necessary to bring that about.  Let the Labour or Fine Gael Deputies examine that criticism and give it a little more attention than they are giving to what we say.</P>
      <P>We have been charged here &mdash; and particularly Deputy Lemass&mdash;in trying to put a wedge between various components of the Coalition.  In regard to tea, Deputy Lemass's opening speech was interpreted as being a wedge driver between Labour and Fine Gael.  I think we can quote people who do not support Fianna Fáil, we can quote political commentators and parliamentary journals writing for papers that never have supported Fianna Fáil, as engaging in this same practice which has been objected to. I am quoting from the <i>Connacht Tribune</i> of the 5th February, the Dublin correspondent&mdash;who, if I do not make a mistake, is also the political correspondent of the <i>Independent</i> to whom I have referred already.  He says that &ldquo;a subsidy of £2,000,000 per annum for rates is being demanded, even with a threat to the life of the Government.&rdquo;  Who can threaten the life of the Government?  It is not Macra na Feirme or Muintir na Tíre or a Fianna Fáil Cumann outside in the country.  It is only a Party in here or those on that side of the House that can threaten the life of the Government. There is quite obviously an attack there by one of the Coalition components, by Clann na Talmhan, who promised derating to the farmers in the election and who, like honest politicians, were trying to carry out promises to the electors that were going to cost £2,000,000; and the writer of the article is&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I accept your ruling, although I find it very difficult, if you do not mind my saying it, to accept the view that a professional commentator on public affairs is not in much the same category, for the purpose which we are now discussing here to-day, as an elected Deputy or a Senator. However, if that is your point of view, I bow to it.  I know there is ample evidence that people who do not support this Party of ours have very much more cause for criticism than we have.  They believe that the promises were not made on the Kathleen Mavourneen system, that when we were told last May to get out&mdash;not to bother bringing in a Budget, that those opposite would bring in a Budget that would do the job&mdash;that that was meant and it was expected that a Budget would be brought in.</P>
      <P>It is quite obvious that there are people of importance over there who believed that they could do two things at the same time, that they could keep the subsidies on and even increase them and by that very process bring down the cost of Government.  I am afraid I do not appreciate the line of argument or reasoning, but at any rate it is here in cold print, uttered by no less a personage than the Minister for Health.  At column 649 of Volume 148 he says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;And the very moment prices of essential foodstuffs went up a series of wage increases had to take place. That, in turn, led inevitably to increased taxation and we find now, some two or three years later, that because of the abolition of subsidies in 1952 the cost to the State has been much greater than the amount saved.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think his most ardent supporter will have to read that half a dozen times, take it to bed with him and after a long night's rest read it again in the morning when his mind is fresh, to see if there is not something in this argument of Deputy O'Higgins, the Minister <Col N="906" /> for Health, that you can pile on the cost in the way of subsidies and at the same time bring down the cost of Government.  If it is true and if he believes it, why did they not do it? Why did they not put back the subsidies if they could benefit the consumer of goods by doing so and at the same time bring down the cost of Government? Why in the name of common sense and Party advantage was it not done?  Why have they clung to the Fianna Fáil Budget?</P>

      <P>There was no provision in the Fianna Fáil Budget for a reduction in the price of butter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Murphy knows that in 1948 he hung out the nameplate of the Republic and did not require to bring in a Constitution&mdash;we had given him one ample for the job.  In this case he has reduced the price of butter by 5d. a lb. but has done it under our Budget.  I say that if we had not already come to the succour and the aid of bread and flour he would have had to put the subsidy on those things and not on butter.  It would not have been noticed if he had put it on there and therefore they chose butter, which did not give nearly the same political advantage as bread would give.  He knows very well that the comment about the butter is that the large consumers of butter like catering establishments have done pretty well out of it, but the margarine eaters have not.</P>
      <P>In any event, this method of doing things is, on the face of it, a mark of incompetence.  Money has been taken from the farmers to be given to public servants.  We have two broad classes of public servants &mdash; the official public servants and the unofficial public servants, the producers of our food who fed us during the war and kept us nice and cosy.  These are the people we are taking the money from, and Deputy Murphy now can justify reducing the income of a farmer with £400 a year who grows wheat and stabilising the price of tea at his expense and giving what he takes from the £400 a year farmer to the official public servant of a £1,000 a year upwards.  Does Deputy Murphy think that is fair?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="907" /> When we came in, we gave the increase to the public servants which had been awarded to them by the Arbitration Tribunal, but we told them, quite frankly, that we could give it to them only from the 1st April as the money was not there.  When this Government came in, they admitted it was not there, because they had to take it from the farmers to find it for those public servants.  We think that it was most unfair and unjustifiable to penalise the man with £400 or £500 a year down and subsidise the man with £1,000 a year upwards.  That is what this Government has done, and Deputy Murphy knows that very well when he asks me: &ldquo;What would you do?&rdquo;  He knows what we did.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>One might compare Deputy Murphy's handful of judges with the handful of wheat speculators who were used to justify the cutting down of the subsidy on wheat.  The wheat growers of this country are the men who kept us and fed us during the war.  They have been sacrificed now. The unofficial public servants, the producers, are the people who kept us out of the war, and they are being sacrificed now to subsidise the others.  We have shown no hostility to the others. If Deputy Murphy and the Labour Party can justify subsidising people with £1,000 a year up, at the expense of people with £400 a year down, then I think he is in the wrong Party.</P>
      <P>Deputy Murphy knows what we did. We accepted the situation that was handed over to us in 1951 by the then Coalition.  We increased social services and we let the wage earners get an increase in wages to meet the new situation.  I take it that the working out of that was a fairer arrangement than stabilising the prices of commodities for a man with £1,000 a year up, which is what the Government are now doing.</P>

      <P>I am telling Deputy Barry what we did.  Deputy Barry himself said at one time what he would do about tea, that he would abolish Tea Importers and let everyone import tea.  Apparently, he has changed his mind about that.  We have not changed our mind.  We are not charged with responsibility now, and it is not so easy to find out what is in the mind of those in opposition when they are in opposition.  The ball is at your feet over there now and we are asking you to kick it.  You told us to get out of the way and that you would kick it quickly.</P>
      <P>We catered for the people who were in the lower income groups.  We catered for the people who were depending on the social services and we let prices find their level.  We allowed people to go up in their incomes to meet their costs, those who had the necessity for it.  What you are doing is giving a boost to everyone, to those who do not deserve it as well as to those who do.  I, personally, think that cannot be justified.  It is quite unnecessary. I think it would be far better if the people on the other side of the House were not quite so touchy about our criticisms.  I want to assure the Deputies opposite that our criticisms are not nearly as caustic or as biting as those which they will hear if they go outside this House.  I have never seen a political situation change in so short a time as the change which has taken place in this country since last May.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember when the charge was made against us that we did not enforce penalties during the war on the marketeers.  The present Minister for Industry and Commerce, during his previous period of office, in support of <Col N="909" /> that charge, said that the manufacturers and traders had got away with &ldquo;murder&rdquo;, which, I think, was the word he used.  If there was one thing more than another on which Fianna Fáil lost the 1948 election, it was on this question of enforcing penalties. We turned more people against us for enforcing the law in that respect than we did in respect of any other disability which the war brought upon us. Nevertheless, we were lambasted by people, by policitians, who did their very best, when the law was enforced against those people, to get a mitigation of the penalties imposed on them. They certainly had it both ways.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to point out that we are not the Jeremiahs, the people who are painting the black stories about the present situation.  One will get these stories from people who have been very close and consistent supporters, particularly of Fine Gael.  The stories can be got from the type of journalist to whom I have referred.  I have produced two copies of a newspaper published down the country which has supported the people opposite through thick and thin.  One can find in that paper a black picture indeed painted by a man who has always supported Fine Gael.  His paper also supported them.  You will find in that paper, and elsewhere, much blacker pictures than you will get from anyone on this side of the House.</P>
    <P>I suggest that it might be just as well if those warnings were hearkened to.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Government reiterated them in a speech which he made here yesterday. He told us about inflation being around the corner.  I take it that the concession about tea was to the Labour Party, and that it hangs on this warning about inflation.  Deputy Larkin was able to tell us about the effect of Standstill Orders.  I think that, in fairness, he might also have given us the other side of the picture, and told us what the effects are of not having Standstill Orders.  After all, he has examples of that.  We know what happened in some countries during the period between the two wars where they had not these Standstill Orders. We know what terrible inflation took <Col N="910" /> place and how money lost its value.  In any event, the Government that we had here during the war saved us from that terrible catastrophe even though it did not cushion us against all the adverse effects of a world war. We can claim that during the world war we preserved our neutrality.</P>
    <P>The Government and the political set-up which survived the period of a terrific war between 1939 and 1945, a war which, as I said a moment ago, was all around our shores and in the air above us, have, I submit, a better claim to the support of the people than a Coalition which lasted only three years and then collapsed, because there was a war in a corner of the earth, much farther away from us than any other part of the world that I know of.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carew</NameTxt>
      <P>It is evident, from the course which this debate has taken, that members of the House have the opportunity of speaking upon practically every subject.  At the commencement of this debate Deputy Lemass referred to the cost of living. He referred in particular to the Fine Gael Party as having promised to reduce the cost of living when they got into power.  The Labour Party was also accused of having supported Fine Gael in regard to the reduction of the cost of living.  I come from the City of Limerick and I represent Limerick City.  During the election campaign I stood on the O'Connell Monument with the Taoiseach, Deputy Costello. In his opening statement the Taoiseach declared that he was making no promises.  That is on record and any of the newspaper representatives who were present at that meeting can quote the Taoiseach's speech or quote a copy of the speech he made.  I can speak for what the Taoiseach said in Limerick but I cannot speak for what anybody else said anywhere else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In our campaign in Limerick City we issued a pamphlet and posted it to every elector in the city of Limerick and East Limerick.  On that pamphlet we showed the prices of 1951, when the inter-Party Government went out of office, and we showed the prices in 1952 when I was successfully returned <Col N="911" /> a candidate for East Limerick in the by-election.  We also posted that leaflet to the electorate last year showing the prices that obtained after three years of Fianna Fáil Government. We compared them with the prices which obtained after three years of inter-Party Government.  I think we were justly entitled to put that viewpoint before the electorate. The electors of East Limerick by 6,000 votes supported the inter-Party candidates at that election.</P>
    <P>I speak about my own constituency. In this debate a lot of quotations were used &mdash; practically the whole library was transferred into the House &mdash; and dates were quoted to show the statements made.  It seemed to me that many Deputies wished to score off each other.  That may be, perhaps, good politics.  It may be a justification for some of those people who get their speeches published in the local papers. I feel, however, that the situation should be approached in a far different manner.  After three years of Fianna Fáil Government, we are at least entitled to a reasonable chance to show the country that we are in earnest to do something in the interest of the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>I agree that the cost of living which we inherited from the Fianna Fáil Government has to be tackled seriously.  Speakers in this debate have been lamenting for days the price of wheat.  Is it not a fact that the price fixed for wheat last year was something in the neighbourhood of 20/- a barrel greater than the world price? Many growers of wheat told me that they would expect a reduction in the price of wheat.  They felt that the price would not hold.  I was told that by some wheat growers in the County Limerick.  I agree that Limerick is not as largely interested in grain growing as many other counties.  While I do not want to delay too much on that aspect of the matter, I can say that as a result of that very high price, farmers who in years gone by produced acres of barley, oats and potatoes to ensure that animal feeding stuffs would not run short, have changed over from the cultivation of barley, oats and <Col N="912" /> potatoes.  Many of those farmers were enticed by the extravagant price for wheat.</P>
    <P>As a result of the policy handed down to us by Fianna Fáil, we were short of oats and barley this year and potatoes, a commodity which figures on the table of practically everyone, rich and poor, are in short supply and command a very high price.  We all owe a deep debt of gratitude to the farmer who during the war years produced the food we needed.  Tributes were paid to them by all Parties for all they did in the national emergency.  What has happened to the farmers who have taken to wheat growing?  Granted, they got an increased price for wheat, but is it not taken away from them when they come to buy pollard, bran and meal because of the high price of the wheat which they supplied to the mills and the high price they had to pay for the pollard, bran, pig and animal feeding stuffs?</P>
    <P>Is it not time that these people realised &mdash; as they do &mdash; that the price offered was false economy?  I would describe it as lopsided economy.  On the other hand, it is true that certain speculators, perhaps not many, but they had very deep pockets, were smart to seize upon an opportunity.  Many of these speculators who grew wheat last year refused in emergency times, when this country was threatened, to till their land.  So much so that inspectors had to be brought to their lands to compel them to do so.  Yet when they got this extravagant price for wheat, they turned to growing it.  As a result they gave us dear flour, feeding stuffs and everything that was to be bought by the industrious farmer.  Mixed farming suffers as a result.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil dealt very largely with Deputy Dillon's reduction in the price of wheat.  Is it not a fact that two members of the Fianna Fáil Party led a grain growers' deputation to Messrs. Arthur Guinness &amp; Co. and accepted from them 4/9 a barrel less for malting barley than was accepted 12 months ago?  That is on record.  I have no interest in what Messrs.  Guinness paid for their barley but I think these gentlemen went in and accepted 4/9 a <Col N="913" /> barrel less for their barley than they did 12 months ago.  Yet they considered they did a good job.  If they did a good job by accepting 4/9 a barrel less for barley, then why criticise this Government for offering to the Irish farmer approximately £10 a barrel more for his wheat than the world price?</P>
    <P>I think it is unfair criticism.  It is criticism which is not helpful and it is criticism which is not in the national interest.  We all know that in costings one has to take into consideration the price of wheat, the price of wages concerned in the milling of that wheat and overhead expenses.  We then arrive at a price for the commodity, whether that commodity be the flour which the poor woman has to buy in the shop or the bran, pollard and the pig feeding the farmer has to supply to his stock.  It does not matter.  It will put on these people an extra tax. I hold that is very bad economics.</P>
    <P>We know by recent returns that the cattle population of this country has increased considerably in recent years and yet is is rather strange to find that farmers grew less oats, less barley, and less potatoes last year &mdash; the very items that figure largely in the foodstuffs of cattle in this country.  We all know and appreciate at the present time that we are getting big prices if you like, prices that were unheard of formerly, for cattle.  Farmers are going to the fairs with cattle for the past month and actually getting more than they dreamt of getting.  I think it is good to find in Dublin cattle markets people coming from England prepared to pay very big prices for our cattle and in that way making the industry more profitable.</P>
    <P>As regards another item that has figured very much here, I never thought there were so many tea-drinkers in this House because the common belief outside is that we are not so fond of tea here, but everybody in the Opposition seems to be harping on the price of tea.  To my mind, the Fianna Fáil Party got a terrible disappointment when this Government decided to peg down the price of tea. The Government is being criticised <Col N="914" /> because the poor man or woman living on the dole, or living on bread and tea to a great extent, was not asked to pay 1/4 a lb. more for their tea and did not therefore kick up a row.  I think the Government acted in a Christian way by protecting the price of tea so far as the poor people are concerned. It may be said the rich people can afford it.  That is true, but I think the poorer people are more the concern of this Government and any other Government elected in this country. I think this Government, in which the Labour Party forms a substantial part, is carrying on because there is common understanding by all sections.  It is not a Government for any particular section but I think that is in the national interest, particularly at the present time.</P>
    <P>We are told that we are getting tea on &ldquo;tick&rdquo; and we are told it is bad economics to keep the price of tea where it is, but it is the Government's opinion and the opinion shared by experts, and the opinion expressed by the Prime Minister of Ceylon&mdash;one of the countries from which our supplies are being bought &mdash; that the price of tea is far too high.  We had it stated in the public Press long before the Prime Minister came here that the reason for the increased cost of tea was that speculators were prepared to outbid one another.  There is something wrong somewhere.  I think the Government here were very wise to adopt the attitude they did adopt.  According to the Prime Minister of Ceylon and the indications we see of prices tumbling down in markets in London and elsewhere, there is evidently something wrong and evidently no just cause for the increased cost of tea.</P>
    <P>I hold, and I think it is a fair prediction to make, that in the course of the next few months the probability is that tea will be obtainable at more reasonable prices.  It certainly would be strange if the Taoiseach here were to visit the Prime Minister of Ceylon and tell him they were paying too much for Irish cattle, and there must be something very seriously wrong when the Prime Minister of Ceylon came to this country and stated &mdash; not only here but in London &mdash; that the <Col N="915" /> price of tea was not justified.  I think the Government acted in the national interest in seeing to it that the price of tea was kept to a reasonable level when the increases were really caused by the speculators who were evidently outbidding one another for their own good in the markets, not only in London and Ceylon but in other countries from which we import tea.</P>
    <P>We are eight months in office and we are entitled to ask the Opposition and the people who put us here to give us a reasonable chance.  If we are saddled, as we have been, with wheat at prices far in excess of what they should be, far in excess of what would give a reasonable profit to the genuine farmers, the mixed farmers who were always prepared to grow a crop in the national interest, it is time that we should get a reasonable chance when we come to formulate a Budget and put our policy forward for the coming year.  We should get a reasonable chance of showing the people what we can do.  The people on this side of the House are not people who want to stay in the Government if the people do not want them there.  We are prepared to put our programme before the people at any time we think it is necessary.  I think there has been far too much criticism but I do not want to go beyond the items which I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>I conclude on this note.  I congratulate the Government, and particularly the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who is here as the representative of the Labour Party in this Government, and who represents and has the confidence of the Labour Party all over the country.  I congratulate the Government and the Minister on the stand they have taken in protecting the weaker sections of the community from the deliberate actions of the speculators, whether in London or Ceylon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>As a Deputy from a very large city constituency and as a housewife, I have a great interest in this matter of the control of prices.  I have been persistent in my inquiries <Col N="916" /> from the Minister for Industry and Commerce over a period of six months regarding prices of essential commodities and week after week the same stereotyped replies are served up&mdash;&ldquo;Prices are under constant supervision&rdquo; or &ldquo;what can be done will be done.&rdquo;  We feel on this side of the House that the Government is not giving the public an efficient system of price control.  Housewives are not satisfied that the matter is getting sufficient attention.  There seems to be an inertia such as Deputy Lemass spoke about and which Deputy Larkin agreed existed.  There seems to be inertia in the Government Department dealing with price regulation.</P>
      <P>Basic food requirements have gone up in price since the Government came into office &mdash; flake meal, bacon, cocoa, vegetables and potatoes have increased in price.  Meat has now reached an unprecedentedly high level.  The cost of these commodities has increased so much, and the cost of living has gone up so much, that housewives can provide for food alone and are unable, especially where there are large families, to find in their household purses money for boots and shoes and articles of furniture.  Non-implementation of the Health Act leaves middle-class housewives at their wits' end to know how to provide for doctor's bills and medicines.  Failure to control prices, seems to be the Government's greatest fault since they came into office.</P>
      <P>It is true that tea has come down in price, but I cannot see why it is that there is so much applause on the Government side for tea being at Fianna Fáil level.  It does not require a vast knowledge of economics on the part of the housewife to understand that borrowing to keep the price of tea down is not a very wise procedure or does not make for a balanced economy.  Nor is it a precedent to be followed in national housekeeping methods; it is like borrowing to pay the grocer's bill at the week-end or borrowing to pay the rent.  It looks as if it is the tea-drinking community who will have to bear the cost when the autumn comes round.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last election was won and lost <Col N="917" /> on the cost-of-living issue, and I should say that the housewife contributed in no uncertain fashion towards the gain for the Government and the loss that Fianna Fáil sustained, that 10 per cent. loss that helped to put the Fianna Fáil Government out.  On the strength of the promise of the modern Utopia held out to the housewives, they went to the polls and just gave the Government the 10 per cent. majority they required to form a Government.  Now the housewives feel their benevolence towards the Government has been forgotten; they feel they have been slighted by the Government, and I remind the Minister that &ldquo;hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The reduction in the price of butter seems to be of benefit to big institutions and hotels, but the average household does not seem to benefit very much from it.  As Deputy McQuillan, I think, said, the saving in the average household would not purchase an extra lb. of butter.</P>
    <P>The sky-rocketing of prices in the meat trade is very alarming at the moment.  It is a grim outlook for the Dublin victuallers to be all the time in competition with those £1,000,000 buyers from England who come over in such great numbers every week. Now there are two markets in Dublin; there is one on Tuesday and the buyers are so keen to purchase that the supplies are bought up on Tuesday with the result that on Wednesday when the butcher goes to the Dublin cattle market he is at a complete disadvantage and has to pay the high price.  This adversely affects the trade in the shops; the housewife has gone on strike because she cannot buy any more.  There is a recession in trade&mdash; and unemployment is the result.  In my constituency a few of the butchers have closed down in the past few weeks.  It is a very difficult problem for the Government to solve, but they will have to try to deal with it.</P>
    <P>The impression I have got from the contributions to this debate by Government speakers is that there is complacency about the whole matter of the high cost of living.  They do not seem to be positive at all in their approach to the solution of the <Col N="918" /> problem.  We on this side of the House hope to get from the Minister a clear, unequivocal statement of policy with regard to prices.  We would like to see the Government machine in action.  They have the power and they have the machinery to legislate, so let them deliver the goods.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>As this debate is a rather weary one I do not propose to delay the House for too long.  The most striking feature of the discussion is the unrealistic approach of the Opposition.  During this debate they have offered no constructive criticism whatever.  Their main aim is to make as much political propaganda as they possibly can from it.  While the Bill covers a very wide field the Opposition have more or less confined themselves to this question of the cost of living.</P>
      <P>One big factor to bear in mind is that the cost of living has not increased. It was just as high, if not somewhat higher, during the election campaign and during the by-election campaign.  I listened to Fianna Fáil speakers down in County Cork and they stated clearly from every platform that the cost of living did not weigh heavily on the people.  They counted it a matter that should scarcely be referred to at all.  That was the main theme of Fianna Fáil speeches in the City of Cork during the by-election which was held less than 12 months ago.  Now we have the Fianna Fáil Deputies suddenly feeling very worried as to how the housewives of this country are going to exist.  Who are these people to worry about the housewives of the country?  What help did the housewives of this country get from Fianna Fáil?  The answer is quite clear, that at every opportunity Fianna Fáil got they ignored the housewife.  They increased the prices of commodities at times when there was no justification whatever for such increases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people opposite are trying to adopt a two-sided approach to this Bill.  They know very well that the Government is doing a reasonably good job and that no Government formerly in this country could do better.  But they are taken aback that they are over there and not here.  They cannot <Col N="919" /> understand having any other Government in this country except Fianna Fáil, and even though the election is over eight months, some of them are not yet over the fright they got on the 18th May last.  I would advise them to pull themselves together.  Ireland has managed very well without them as a Government.</P>

      <P>I will answer now as effectively as possible.  We will go back to these boys who have made a great deal of noise here in regard to false promises.  I think it is no harm to ask you to bear with me, as it is relevant to the Bill, to remind some of these gentlemen of the promises they made in the past.  Is it not quite clear that Fianna Fáil would never have got into power were it not for the false promises they made to the people, promises they had never any intention of keeping or which could not be implemented?</P>
      <P>In 1932 they promised the people that if they were elected as a Government they would turn Ireland into some place like a heaven on earth, that we would be all doing very well, that all the emigrants would be brought back, employment at big wages would be available for everyone and that farmers, workers and all other sections of the people would benefit generally from their policy.  Another clear-cut statement which was made by the Leader of the Opposition was that this country could support more than five times the present population if the people gave Fianna Fáil a chance of ruling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people did give them a chance of ruling and how did they honour their promises?  Everyone knows they were responsible for almost completely wiping out the agricultural industry. As a result of the economic war there were many farmers and their families who had to emigrate and they are away up to this day.  Another main feature of their policy which was discussed at length early in this debate to-day was their campaign of slaughtering calves. <Col N="920" /> In the 1930's that was a most noticeable feature of Fianna Fáil policy. That clearly indicated to the people that it was the belief of Fianna Fáil that it was bad policy for any Irish Government to rear cattle and pigs or any other animal of that sort for export to feed our so called ancient enemy, England.</P>
    <P>Was not that their policy &mdash; to cut out all relations, economic and otherwise, with Britain?  And what did we find? We found that when their policy was implemented and that when they had stifled industry in this country, particularly the main industry of agriculture, and that when the people had no cattle, no pigs and no stock of any kind to export to England, our young people, our boys and girls, had no alternative but to go to England.  That type of export began in the 1930's as a result of Fianna Fáil policy.  Instead of sending over cattle and pigs as we were wont to do up to then, they sent over human beings.  I want to be as brief as possible.</P>

      <P>And that it was unknown what would happen.  The people did not accept that and as a result of their votes in 1948 we had an innovation in this country; we had a new system of Government, a system of Government which Fianna Fáil has never got over and never will.  The greatest shock Fianna Fáil ever got was that an inter-Party system was installed.  That was the greatest shock they ever got.  Mark you they tried to blame and find fault as much as possible with such a system.  But I believe that it is a good system.  It has worked for more than four years <Col N="921" /> and has given a good Government to the people.  We have here on this side of the House to-day members of different Parties representing all sections of the people.  They have pooled their resources and they have adopted a common policy which they believe to be generally beneficial to the Irish people.  They have adopted that policy because on the 18th May last the Irish people, in no uncertain terms, gave them a mandate to adopt that policy. They are here for five years by the wishes of the people.  They are here to carry out their policy.</P>
      <P>After the bungling of affairs which took place from 1951 to 1954 it is quite unreasonable for the Opposition to say that the Government, in the eight months of their reign, could fulfil all the points of their policy.  It is quite evident to any impartial observer that they are moving in the right direction and that they will do the best they possibly can to meet the different problems that confront the Irish people at the present time.  We have been accused of having made promises to the people that we would reduce the cost of living and the Fianna Fáil Deputies have adopted that line of thought during the course of this debate.  Did not the Government reduce the price of butter by 5d. in the lb.?  And Deputy Mrs. Lynch said that this reduction was of no benefit to the people.  What does she or any other member of the Fianna Fáil Party want?</P>
      <P>The Government reduced the price of butter and yet Fianna Fáil Deputies have been saying it was of no benefit to the people.  How then can they complain that we have done nothing to reduce the prices of essential commodities? The Government have reduced the price of wheat and there has been an uproar throughout the country from Fianna Fáil supporters because it has been reduced.  Still they charge the Government that they are not reducing the cost of living at a time when effective steps are being taken to reduce the prices of essential commodities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not read the speeches made by some Deputies during this debate but I have read the speeches made by the <Col N="922" /> former Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Lemass.  It is quite evident from his contribution to the debate that he is most perturbed that the price of butter was reduced and that the price of tea was kept at its present level.  That was clearly the trend of his speech as reported in Volume 148, at No. 2.  It is clearly indicated there that Deputy Lemass is most perturbed that the price of butter was reduced and that tea should be kept at its present price.  That means that the people opposite are completely dishonest in their approach to this problem.</P>
    <P>We find Opposition Deputies also complaining that the price of cattle has increased so very much of late. We had Deputy Briscoe complaining that now beef was gone beyond the limits of what the housewife in Dublin and in other parts of the country could afford and suggesting that the Government should take some effective measure to reduce beef prices.  I wonder what Deputies Moher and Corry from East Cork have got to say to that question?  Would Deputies Corry and Moher and the other farmer Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party like to see the price of cattle tumble down?</P>
    <P>From the Opposition you have two voices speaking &mdash; one urban and the other rural.  One side wants the price of commodities brought down and, if I interpret them correctly, the other side wants it to go upwards.  I think that in dealing with this question of the cost of living we must bear in mind that most of our goods are produced here at home.  We had complaints in the course of the debate on this measure that the prices of meat, milk, potatoes, butter and so on were too high.  What Deputies should bear in mind is that all these commodities are produced here in this country so that it is within the competence of the Government &mdash; of any Government for the time being in office &mdash; to regulate the prices.</P>
    <P>Any Government must take cognisance of the fact that the producer is entitled to a reasonable rate for his output irrespective of what it is &mdash; whether it is milk, meat or any other such commodity.  Indeed, speaking on <Col N="923" /> behalf of the Labour Party, we have always maintained that a producer is entitled to a fair and square deal, but we also think that there should be a close relationship between the price the producer gets and the price the consumer is asked to pay, and I think that is where we are slipping up at present because to my mind that close relationship does not exist in so far as some commodities are concerned.</P>
    <P>I think there is an obligation on the Minister for Industry and Commerce to inquire fully into the disparity in prices of commodities produced in this country as between what the producer gets and what the consumer has to pay. The most notable commodity that I can call to mind is bacon &mdash; the price of bacon.  We have farmers throughout the country complaining about the economic factors governing the price of bacon.  We have them complaining, and rightly so, of the rigid grading system imposed by the bacon factories. Despite that rigid grading and the reduction in price to the producer the consumer has to pay as much now for bacon as when it was £2 per cwt. dearer.  That is one field in which the Minister could make a closer inquiry than he has already made.  When such a position obtains, as undoubtedly it does in the bacon trade, there is an obligation on the Minister to ascertain the causes.  I realise that it is somewhat difficult to approach such a problem properly.  My opinion is that so far as the price of bacon is concerned, about which we have many complaints from the consuming public, it is largely due to the fact that the bacon industry is in the hands of people who have formed themselves into rings and cartels. They are making excessive profits from this industry at the expense of both the producer and the consumer. I hope the Minister will go more deeply into that question and bring before the people in time some report on the unseemly disparity that exists in relation to prices in the bacon trade at the moment.</P>
    <P>The cost of living is one of the matters that can be discussed in this debate; likewise, it is open to Deputies to suggest the implementation of more fundamental price control.  The <Col N="924" /> constituency which I represent goes in largely for pig production.  I do not believe there is a higher pig population anywhere else in the country than there is in West Cork.  A reduction in the price of bacon could be brought about if some of the unnecessary costs were removed.  Even though we in West Cork produce more pigs than anywhere else in the country we have no means of processing the pigs there. We have no bacon factory.  Consequently the pigs must be brought to Tralee, Limerick, Waterford or Cork City &mdash; a distance, on an average, of 100 miles.  If we had a bacon factory these excessive transport costs would be eliminated and the savings effected could be passed on jointly to the consumer and the producer.  That is a matter with which the Department of Industry and Commerce could concern itself.</P>
    <P>I am a firm believer in the decentralisation of industry.  The present position is that all industries are centred here in Dublin, Waterford, Cork, Limerick and a few of the big provincial towns.  Rural Ireland is forgotten.  Unless something more effective is done in that regard we will find ourselves in time having to deal with a much bigger cost-of-living problem than that which confronts us at the moment.</P>
    <P>The farming community has been mentioned in this debate.  I have the highest regard for the farmers.  Now, unfortunately, more than 50 per cent. of our holdings are small and uneconomic. In the course of the debate yesterday my colleague, Deputy Mrs. O'Carroll, referred to the farming community and suggested it would be a wise policy to impose a tax of £2 per acre on arable land.  I want to make it quite clear that I disagree entirely with such a suggestion.  I believe Deputy Mrs. O'Carroll is too close a student of the economic theories propounded by a former Minister for Finance, Deputy Seán MacEntee, who stated here that &ldquo;taxation rests lightly on the land,&rdquo; and I regret that Deputy Mrs. O'Carroll should follow in the footsteps of Fianna Fáil in her references to the farming community.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="925" /> Farmers in general, with the exception perhaps of the big ranchers in the Midlands, find it more than difficult to meet their present commitments either by way of rates or taxes than does any other section of the community. It is not our policy, and it has never been our policy, to impose a tax on arable land.  Our policy always has been to help the farming community to develop their farms and make the best living they possibly can.  That has been our policy in the past and that will be our policy in the future.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, many people living in this city and in other cities have no appreciation at all of the difficulties confronting those who live in rural Ireland, particularly the small farmers.  If these farmers are making the big profits they are alleged to be making, how is it that both Church and State continue to draw our attention to the increased emigration year after year from the rural areas?  That increase would not take place if agricultural Ireland were as prosperous as some people would have us believe.  The bulk of the emigrants from my constituency come from the small holdings. I believe the farmers on these small holdings have enough difficulty in meeting their present commitments without imposing any further burdens on them.</P>
    <P>In relation to the cost of living, despite all that has been said about the Prices Advisory Body, there is really no effective machine for the control of prices.  The Prices Advisory Body has lost the confidence of the people.  I do not think it is doing any useful work and it is certainly not worth what it costs the State annually.  Some more effective machine for the control of prices should be put into operation and the industrialists, such as those who control our bacon factories, our flour and wheat mills and so forth, should have a closer check kept on their profits.  Many people, particularly those who produce wheat, oats and barley, believe that some statement as to the profits of the directors of our flour and grain mills should be made available.  I would like to know how the difference in price comes about in oats, barley and wheat sold for processing <Col N="926" /> to the mills at a particular price and the processed product sold to the consumer.  There is an obligation on the Government to tackle the question of excessive profits on the part of concerns which enjoy a monopoly.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party is quite confident about the present position.  Their ideals, their aims, and their objects have not changed.  Any assurances they have given to the people are and will be strictly honoured.  Despite what anybody says here, I feel sure that the people who supported Labour in the past will continue to support them in the future because we are honest in our political aims, unlike Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to bring home to the Minister the urgency of dealing with the problem of the decentralisation of industry and the necessity for setting up industries in the provincial towns.  This will enable our people in rural Ireland and in the provincial towns to meet the cost of living which obtains at any time.  Some more effective steps should be taken either by the Prices Advisory Body or the Fair Trade Commission to see that all sections of our people are treated with justice and fair play in the question of prices.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOrmonde" hpid="Mr. Ormonde Mr. Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had quite a long discussion on this bill, and it is hardly possible at this stage to add anything new to the debate.  What I noticed most was the complete absence in the opposite benches of the spirit which prevailed less than 12 months ago, and which gave a spate of platform speeches brimful of their promises to reduce the cost of living, to attend to general price reduction, provide work for the unemployed, and to improve our social services while at the same time reducing taxation.  That change of attitude, we must assume, is indicative of their inability and failure to fulfil their promises.  It indicates their despondency and pessimism with regard to the future, and their complete lack of confidence in securing any alleviation of the position which is at present affecting all sections of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During this discussion we might have <Col N="927" /> expected some indication from the Labour Benches, in any case, of their intention to fulfil their promises in regard to unemployment and the reduction of prices.  There is an absence of purpose or intention which leaves one with the conviction that they have arrived at a realisation that all they can do in regard to the reduction of prices is to maintain them at the present level.  It is even very doubtful if they feel they can do that.</P>
    <P>Mr. Norton, in his 14-point programme issued to the electorate in May of last year, promised a reduction of food prices, and the use of subsidies on essential articles of food to achieve that aim, while my colleague from Waterford, Deputy Kyne, said that a reduction in the prices of essential foodstuffs was a cardinal point in the immediate programme of the Labour Party.  During this debate all Deputy Kyne was able to say in regard to the present situation was that the Government was far from satisfied.  This is evidenced by the fact that they are seeking continued controls from this House.  No one knows better than Deputy Kyne how ineffective controls are in reducing existing high prices.  I would like to remind the Deputy that he promised reductions, not controls.  So far, we have had no serious attempt by the Labour Party to implement their promises in regard to prices nor have we had any assurance from An Tánaiste, or from the Deputy who made them, of an implementation of those specific promises to reduce the cost-of-living burden.</P>
    <P>The only commodity on which we have had a reduction in price in the past 12 months is butter, which will be more than offset by the inevitable increase in the price of tea.  The Government has succeeded in postponing increased tea prices by the rather questionable tactics of authorising Tea Importers to incur an overdraft of £1,250,000 in the banks.  The public will eventually have to pay this subsidy on the price of tea, and in addition to that capital sum they will have to meet the interest which the banks will charge on the overdraft, which I am sure will be <Col N="928" /> in the region of £60,000 per year.  This whole transaction to me savours of political expediency, a slick evasion of an unpopular duty, putting off the inevitable in the hope of a windfall, or manna from Heaven.  The simple fact remains that £1,250,000, plus interest, must be paid by the people in taxation.</P>
    <P>I am one who believes in cushioning the people against sudden and steep increases in prices, but I feel my objection to this transaction in regard to tea is influenced by the fact that we do not know where the money is to be got to pay for this putting off of price increases.  I am rather intrigued to learn whether this sum of money is to be secured or provided by extra taxation in the next Budget, or whether it is to be brought forward as a recurring debt, or given to a future Fianna Fáil Government to deal with.</P>
    <P>We have been promised a reduction in prices by the Labour Party.  So far, their promises have not been put into effect.  Are we to assume that their failure to do so indicates that they have given up hope in this regard, and that this point has been wiped off their 14-point programme?  Are we to assume that Deputy Kyne ceases to look upon a reduction of essential food prices as one of the cardinal points in the immediate programme of the Labour Party?  Is it not a fact that the downward trend in the cost of living which was prevailing prior to the advent of the Coalition Government has changed about, and has resulted in the highest cost of living figure ever recorded?  I felt it was ridiculous to hear the Minister for Health last week claiming that they succeeded in reducing the cost of living by two points in seven months.  That statement was reiterated yesterday by Deputy Declan Costello.  I wondered who did they think they were fooling? It was certainly not the housewife. The Labour Party have failed to implement their promises, and surely when they were making those promises they had some plan of action in mind by which they hoped to implement them?</P>
    <P>Subsidies were mentioned by An Tánaiste.  What has happened to those <Col N="929" /> plans in the meantime?  Have they been abandoned because of non-cooperation by Fine Gael?  If so, what has become of Deputy Dunne's determination not to participate in a Government which did not immediately bring about a reduction in the price of bread, butter, tea and sugar, cigarettes and tobacco, and of course the poor working man's pint?  What has become of Deputy Kyne's determination as expressed at a Labour Party Conference in Wexford of which he was chairman, to use all his power to effect an immediate reduction in the prices of essential foodstuffs?  Is it any wonder that there is uneasiness in the rank and file of the Labour Party that trade union labour is beginning to assert itself, and that the poorer sections of the people about whom Labour Deputies professed to be concerned feel, and rightly so, that they have been let down by the Labour Party?  Perhaps An Tánaiste has some plan of action in mind which he has not yet disclosed, by which he hopes to reduce the cost of living?  If so, I can assure him that we on this side of the House will be quite satisfied if he succeeds in maintaining prices and costs at their present level.</P>
    <P>This Bill provided a very wide scope for discussion on many aspects of Government policy which are not strictly within the control of An Tánaiste, but which may be relevantly brought up for discussion.  I know there is a limit to which reference to other Ministers' responsibilities may be made.  Keeping that in mind I now propose to discuss the recent action of the Minister for Agriculture in reducing the price of wheat in its relation to one of our chief sources of food supplies, and unemployment, which is undoubtedly the responsibility of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>I view with concern the impact which the Minister's wheat price reduction will have on the nation's most essential supply of food and the effect which a considerably reduced wheat acreage, which must inevitably flow from the Minister's action, will have on employment on the land and elsewhere.  I do not know if the Minister's action was <Col N="930" /> actuated by his prejudice against native grown wheat but I do know that its effect will be to kill wheat growing to a great extent and leave us dependent to that extent on outside sources for our food supply.</P>
    <P>I understand that farmers, having planned their tillage programme for the coming year, must of necessity grow wheat but that a continuation of the price reduction for the second year will ensure that they will omit wheat growing from their programme for that year.  Many farmers with whom I discussed the matter are of the opinion that that is one of the main purposes of the Minister's two-year price declaration. Farmers will not grow wheat at a price which is 16 per cent. less than it was last year and, with the enhanced prices now prevailing for cattle, they will naturally turn to grass and to cattle, which is perhaps what the Minister for Agriculture desires since he has always shown himself far more anxious to feed Britain than to feed ourselves.</P>
    <P>The present state of the nation's food resources is not a matter for complacency, while the present world situation is such as to convince any reasonable man that the farmers should be encouraged to grow as much as possible of our most essential foodstuffs.  The maintenance of our present production of wheat&mdash;I am sure the Tánaiste will agree &mdash; will ensure greater national security and will effect a saving of much needed dollars and bring about a healthier trade balance.</P>
    <P>One of the aims of any Minister for Agriculture should be to increase employment on the land and to keep the level of farm prices and costs such as to ensure a maintenance of conditions which will enable farmers to provide continuous and well paid employment for farm workers.  The price of wheat has been reduced in complete disregard of the fact that production costs have not gone down.  Decreased price and increasing production costs hold out only one prospect, that is, a drastic reduction in the acreage under wheat, and consequent laying off of thousands of workers, both agricultural and industrial. Wheat growing is a many-sided industry.  Its cessation will affect <Col N="931" /> not only workers on the land but in the towns and cities.</P>
    <P>Surely the effect that the Minister's wheat price reduction will have on the livelihood of thousands of workers on the land, on road and rail transport, in the mills and elsewhere, should be a matter of grave concern to the Tánaiste and his colleagues in the Labour Party.  One could understand their complacency in the matter if this wheat price reduction were being passed on to the consumer in the shape of a cheaper loaf or cheaper flour but there is no suggestion that that will be done.  I can see only one benefit accruing from the Minister's action in this matter.  It is a saving of subsidy to the Exchequer.  Its evil effects are many.  Responsibility for these evil effects on employment and on the nation's food resources is not entirely that of the Minister for Agriculture. It is the collective responsibility of the Coalition as a whole and of the Minister for Industry and Commerce in particular.</P>
    <P>The Government has also fallen down on their undertaking to ease the unemployment problem and to reduce appreciably the figures of unemployment within a short time.  They boastfully point out that unemployment is on the downward trend and that the registered unemployed figures for this month show a reduction of some 7,000 on the figures for the corresponding period last year.  They are at pains, however, to conceal the true picture. They do not tell us that the position is not nearly as healthy as it was when they took over from Fianna Fáil, when the registered unemployed figures showed a reduction of some 10,000 on the figures for the corresponding period of the previous year.  They have not maintained that gap between the figures of the previous year and the present year that prevailed when they took over from Fianna Fáil.  If you add to that the unprecedented emigration in the past seven months, the position is not nearly as healthy.</P>
    <P>I do not need statistics to satisfy me that the position in my constituency is not as good as it was.  I know that the employment content in my constitutency <Col N="932" /> has deteriorated in recent months.  Very recently, some 60 workers were thrown out of employment in the glue factory in the small town of Dungarvan and there is very grave danger of a complete closing down of Irish Tanners, Portlaw, where a considerable body of workers have been on half-time since June of last year, due, I understand, to the importation, under licence issued by the Tánaiste's Department of synthetic rubber heels and soles, which are seriously affecting the output from all leather factories.  This is a matter which should engage the attention of the Minister as soon as possible.  We do not wish to see a concern which is providing employment for people over a very wide area go out of existence, as it surely must unless something is done, and done very quickly.</P>
    <P>For those in employment and those out of employment the prospect does not appear to be too bright and certainly the Government cannot be complimented on their zeal and energy in endeavouring to deal with the unemployment question.  The Government were returned to power on three specific undertakings: to reduce the cost of living, to reduce unemployment and to extend social services.  So far, there has been no serious attempt to fulfil these promises nor can we hope, from the discussion on this Bill, for their fulfilment in the future.  We have only to conclude that when Deputies on the opposite benches were making these promises they were talking with their tongues in their cheeks and with an eye to votes, and they themselves must admit that the Government, in regard to these specific promises, has been a dismal failure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate has roamed over a number of courses and has tended to become somewhat subjective. I think it is no harm to realise at the outset in approaching this debate that there are certain economic factors at work in regard to the matters which we are discussing under the heading &ldquo;Supplies and Services.&rdquo; Broadly speaking, in the question of price, whether to a producer or to a consumer, there are certain over-all economic factors at work, some <Col N="933" /> of them internal and perhaps susceptible to some degree of control, others of them external and susceptible to very little control by us in this country.  I think I have made a statement on which, without being facetious at the Chair's expense, I could say that I could nearly get unanimity in the House, but there was a time when I could not.  Be that as it may, I think it is a very important point to realise in dealing with this&mdash;we are something more than a mere debating society anxious to score points off one another in debates&mdash;that there are serious problems in issue here, problems to which there is no clear-cut solution, very often.  I know that I am talking a series of platitudes almost in saying this, but, having listened to the way the debates roamed in many regards, a reminder of these platitudes is no harm at all.</P>
      <P>There are serious problems here affecting people in their daily lives in a very serious manner, problems which are complex and, generally speaking, not susceptible of a clear &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; answer, problems in the solution of which there will be disadvantages, which very often leave us with these matters, as to what should or should not be done, or as to whether it is wise to have done something that has been done or not, as questions of judgment and sometimes one might say almost personal judgment.  It is in that sense that legitimately this question of what is policy for us should arise.  Some groups or people will think one approach is best, and other people will think another approach is best, and there you have a difference in policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I came into the Chamber during this debate, it had been my intention to comment in some detail on the speech made by Deputy Larkin.  I have singled out Deputy Larkin, not by any means because he would be what I would call an easy target in the political sense, but because however violently one may disagree with him &mdash; and I do not agree with him in certain matters of principle in approach&mdash;one will still find that there is a certain consistency of policy and <Col N="934" /> approach there, whatever about the externals, and one will find some effort at serious thinking, if the Deputy will pardon my putting it at that seemingly low level.</P>
    <P>Before I deal with some of the matters he raised, more by way of comment than of demolition, I have to dispose of the challenges that have been made, even to myself personally, and some of the things that were bandied about the House about what people said or did not say and about promises made or promises not made. Leaving the serious part of the approach to this problem for a moment, let me clear the ground and start with the invitation which the Minister for Agriculture extended to me to answer a variety of questions, of which I took voluminous notes but which I find are difficult to decipher now.  I will deal with them as best I can from memory.  The Minister impressed and sought to drive home the point that no promises were made by the Fine Gael Party.  He started off by saying that there were two Parties to be considered.  He was not ashamed or in the least bashful about saying that they were Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil, lumping everybody in the Coalition behind Fine Gael.  Then, on the basis of what he and the Taoiseach said during the election, he proceeded to state in effect: &ldquo;We made no promises and we were very vocal in emphasising that.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The record is the best way of dealing with that matter.  There is no doubt about it that the Taoiseach&mdash;I have the record here, and, though I have not got the record in his case, I accept that the Minister for Agriculture did exactly the same thing&mdash;did come out and did say and say very definitely that they were making no promises. That I accept, but, in view of the things that have been said here, my complaint is that, while those two leading Deputies of that Party launched forth with that approach, there were other Deputies of that Party who very definitely made promises in the by-elections before the general election.  The cry &ldquo;Back to 1951 prices&rdquo; was the slogan for these by-elections &mdash; I grant you, trimmed for <Col N="935" /> the general election by this promise of no promises.</P>
    <P>For the purpose of the record, we can take the actual election addresses and advertisements of members of this Party, and I am dealing with these for this reason, that the Labour Party, whatever our differences with them, did say certain things and did say them definitively and unequivocally, and there are Labour Deputies who are saying the same thing to-day.  They do not come within the scope of this particular form of criticism.  I have here files which, as Deputy Briscoe said, show that the whole tenor of the election advertising of Fine Gael was to hold out the implied promise of a reduction in the cost of living, but if there was any doubt about that, there are specific instances.  For instance, Deputy Esmonde is a member of the House and the propaganda in his constituency set out: &ldquo;We reduced the cost of living, unemployment and emigration before and with your vote we will again.&rdquo;  I find also in the case of the candidates Giles, Farrelly and Patrick Dillon &mdash; not the Minister: &ldquo;The wage earner should vote for Fine Gael because Fine Gael will reduce taxation and the cost of living.&rdquo; That advertisement appeared in the <i>Drogheda Independent</i> on 15th May.</P>

      <P>No.  I am merely dealing with the statement that was impressed with some vehemence on me by Deputy Dillon who, incidentally, is advertised in that very same advertisement as addressing meetings &mdash; presumably in support of that policy &mdash; at Trim at 8.30 and at Navan at 9.30 on Saturday, 15th May.  I think that is legitimate.  I could multiply these instances, but the point is that here we have official Fine Gael propaganda over the Fine Gael name and couched in terms of specific promises.  The word &ldquo;will&rdquo; is used and if I were to find only one of these, I think it would have been sufficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here is a selected file of Fine Gael advertising material.  I would ask any impartial set of people did not the impression created by that propaganda <Col N="936" /> from start to finish contain an implied promise that there was a positive policy to reduce the cost of living? In the previous by-election they were even more explicit still.  These remarks are addressed in reply to Deputy Dillon.  Was that not the Fine Gael policy?  We are quite clear on the Labour policy, what it was and what it still is.  If success can be achieved along those lines, as someone else said, objectively it is a very good thing to see.  Far from an attitude of disappointment on anybody's part that that should be so, there should be an attitude of congratulation.</P>
    <P>This particular approach is not one I would have taken by choice, but so much has it come into this debate that it calls for an answer.  There was the manifesto that the Fine Gael Party issued after the election and before they formed the Government.  It ran:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Recognising that the main issue in the general election was the question of prices, the Parties forming the Government are determined to reduce the cost of living in relation to people's incomes and in particular to effect a reduction in the prices of essential foodstuffs.  As an earnest of their intention in this respect, it is proposed to reduce the price of butter in the near future.  A detailed announcement of the Government's proposals will be made in the course of a fortnight.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is no doubt about it: in regard to butter, they did.  That statement said: &ldquo;Recognising that the main issue in the general election.&rdquo;  There is an admission in the official document of the Fine Gael Party &mdash; which incidentally purports to speak for the other Parties in the Coalition as well.  It says: &ldquo;The main issue was the question of prices,&rdquo; and it voices its determination to reduce the cost of living. These are quite laudable aims.  My purpose is to answer some of these points.  We are entitled to approach this on the fact that the main issue in the last election was the issue of prices.</P>
    <P>The propaganda of the Fine Gael Party in particular and also of the Labour Party &mdash; I do not think they will <Col N="937" /> deny it &mdash; was that under the Fianna Fáil Government, because of what that Government had done, the cost of living had risen intolerably on the people's backs, specifically that the subsidies should not have been removed.  &ldquo;Removed&rdquo; is not quite the word, because a considerable volume of subsidy was left and is still there. The propaganda was that the subsidy should have been maintained and that there was an explicit and implied promise to reduce the cost of living. I do not think I am being either unobjective or unfair when I say that. At least the Labour Party said something definite and unequivocal.  The Fine Gael Party &mdash; with the facility for succumbing to the political expediency of the moment which I regret to say appears to have been the weakness of that Party from its inception &mdash; had some of its members saying: &ldquo;We will make no promises,&rdquo; while others were making promises as fast as they could and trying to have it both ways.  Whatever the result was, I think I am not exaggerating or painting an untrue picture when I say that particularly the housewife element, as Deputy Mrs. Lynch said, that voted for the Coalition Government thought they were voting for a reduction in the cost of living.</P>
    <P>To complete the record and, as a corrective to some things said in the debate, I want to make a couple of small points.  There is the Labour attitude, in case I am challenged as to the Labour Party programme.  It was printed on the back of a number of its candidates' election literature, always headed: &ldquo;The Labour Party's Programme.&rdquo; It contains a paragraph &ldquo;Reduction in Prices&rdquo;, and this or a very similar phrase in practically every case&mdash;I am not accusing them of inconsistency; there was nothing inconsistent in their attitude:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A reduction of food prices and the provision of subsidies on essential articles of food to achieve this object.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The present Tánaiste, as a candidate, emphasised that amongst other things. There is a circular letter which he sent out in the course of the election <Col N="938" /> to certain people, signed &ldquo;W. Norton, T.D.&rdquo;:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A Chara,</P>
    <P>As you are an elector in the County Kildare Constituency, I take the liberty of enclosing herewith a copy of my election address and would kindly invite your attention in particular to the portion of the programme set out in page 3 under the heading &ldquo;Reduction in Prices.&rdquo; In view of the serious effect of increasing taxation on cigarettes, beer and spirits &mdash; which no doubt has had an injurious effect on your trade &mdash; I trust that you will find it possible to give me your Number One Vote in the forthcoming election and kindly ask your relatives and friends to do likewise, so that with the aid of the Labour Party I may advocate in the new Dáil a reduction of the taxes which so adversely affect your business and the consumers generally.</P>
    <P Just="Right">Mise, le meas,</P>
    <P Just="Right">W. Norton, T.D.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>All that picture means one thing, that it is futile for us to say the main issue in the general election was not prices.</P>
    <P>It is natural that the main issue in this debate here is a matter of prices. It is a very difficult question.  I am not for one moment going to attack the present Minister or the Government to which he belongs for not working miracles.  No Government can do it. You cannot work miracles, but I have, I think, a legitimate cause for complaint and the cause of the complaint is precisely the cause of complaint that I and other Deputies had in 1950.  We have, I think, more justly cause for complaint now in that I think I can say to Deputy Norton, the Minister and the Tánaiste &mdash; I think I can say legitimately to him &mdash; you had experience of this kind of thing when in Government before and was it the best thing and the wisest thing in the country's interest for you to adopt the same tactics?  When I say &ldquo;you&rdquo; I am speaking generally of the whole Coalition, because I think as regards what I have said to describe the preelection picture that it was all of one picture in regard to the main issue. I am asking, was it good tactics from <Col N="939" /> the point of view of the country as a whole, to have taken this approach, particularly in the experience of 1948 to 1951, and if you like in the experiences of 1951 to 1954?</P>
    <P>Deputy Larkin, in the course of what was, as usual, an interesting speech, said that the people were &ldquo;cynical&rdquo;.  I do not think I am misquoting him, because what he said was:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;They have had, during those years, a very bitter experience, and it is not unreasonable that they are somewhat cynical, that they have become somewhat tired trying to hold the tide out, as it were, between prices and their incomes, and they have become impatient with whatever Government is in power.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That quotation is taken from column 595 of the Dáil Debates of the 17th instant.  I am afraid I have to agree with Deputy Larkin and, what is more, I am afraid that that is not a good situation for the country to be in.  I would further like to see if we can get clear of that situation as fast as we can.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go back into past history, but there are Deputies in this House who even went back to the slaughtering of calves in 1932.  Let us come a little closer up.  I want to refer just slightly, with the permission of the Chair, to the period from 1948 to 1951, and I do so for two purposes: one is that I have been challenged to answer certain things on more than one front during this debate.  I want to reply to these.  The other is because it will help to show up to us certain factors that are at work in the situation in regard to prices that should prompt all of us to try and see what this problem is: to debate or try to analyse the actual steps that have to be taken like one step which was taken recently with which, I hope, before I finish, to deal as reasonably as I can with the Minister.</P>
    <P>What was the position?  I, personally, came in for some criticism because it happened to fall to my lot in 1950 in this House &mdash; I have the actual records here &mdash; to point out where the <Col N="940" /> previous Coalition had fallen down on their promises.  We have to-day the same Coalition in office as we had previously, if I may put it that way, because with the exception of one Party, which has virtually vanished from the political scene, it is the same Coalition as that which found itself in difficulty over prices at the end of 1950. They had, as a major plank of their programme in 1948, an urgent reduction in the cost of living.  I have no doubt that there was a sincere desire to reduce the cost of living.  Leaving sincerity out of the matter, I cannot conceive of any Government which could do as useful or as popular a thing as to reduce the cost of living neglecting to do it if it was in their power.</P>
    <P>They got into difficulty.  We criticised them at the time.  Incidentally, I take this opportunity of putting in what was then my defence and is now my defence.  At that time, I was careful to point out &mdash; I have my own election literature here where the phrase occurs and it occurred in practically everything I said&mdash;that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;They are indicted now not for failing to do the impossible but for false promises, pretence and drift.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a quotation from the actual literature that was issued at the time by myself personally, and that particular approach will be found in all our pre-1951 literature.  We pointed that out as fairly as we could.  I grant you that we are not going to try to pretend that, in the heat of an election, any political Party is, shall I say, judicial, but we were careful in 1951. I challenge anyone to produce a statement of mine where I undertook to reduce the cost of living.  I was talking for this Party at that time and so were others, and you will find constantly a reiteration of that statement that &ldquo;they are not indicted now for failing to do the impossible, but for false promises, pretence and drift.&rdquo; We did say that there were false promises, particularly by Fine Gael, because they should have known that in regard to the undertakings which they were so freely making at that time.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="941" /> Lest there should be any doubt about those undertakings, and seeing that, presumably, they have changed their policy since and their talk about the cost of living, let me recall what Deputy Mulcahy, as the Fine Gael Leader, said in January, 1948.  His statement is reported in a newspaper friendly to the Fine Gael Party.  He spoke as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;But Fine Gael is prepared to make one promise on a matter quite central in all our affairs.  The high cost of living is the pressing problem of the day.  Fine Gael proclaims that the problem can in a great degree be solved.  Fine Gael promises to increase the purchasing power of the people's money.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Costello, the present Taoiseach, at approximately the same time, is reported in a newspaper as saying: &ldquo;Fine Gael had a policy which could deal with the urgent problem of the cost of living,&rdquo; and so on.  Now, it so happened that during that term of office, for a variety of reasons, the cost of a number of commodities went up and the cost of a number of articles &mdash; I still have the list here &mdash; went up.  The point that I want to make on that is that there was a lesson.  There was something that should make any prudent or thinking person hesitate before he gave undertakings.</P>
    <P>At that time, we realised that it would be quite unreasonable to attack the present Minister, who was then Minister for Social Welfare, and his colleagues, for not doing the impossible. I have a vivid recollection that when Deputy Cosgrave, who was then Parliamentary Secretary and is now Minister for External Affairs, made certain statements in this House and that when some of us answered him with a detailed list of prices, the present Tánaiste, although he was then Tánaiste and Minister for Social Welfare, rushed in and made a declaration about price control and the setting up of a body which was to control prices.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that stimulated by the apparent urgency of the situation then &mdash; I think some of us called it panic at the time &mdash; there was a sincere intention to get a grip on this thing. <Col N="942" /> The record shows it was completely nugatory and that the factors at work were out of control.  I have the whole record here, that is, if it is necessary to put it on record because much of it is on record already.  The nugatory effect, the cancelling out of one factor against another, made the whole effort at that time futile.  As I said, I am emphasising these things not by way of futilely going back into history, as that is no use, but by way of saying to the Minister that he should have known better when he was facing this problem this time.  Secondly, I emphasise these things in answer to some of the things that were said in criticism of us.</P>
    <P>It has, completely and consistently for you might say three years now, been represented that we promised to keep down the cost of living before the election.  We did not.  Let me be equally frank and honest.  After the election, there was a statement about subsidies which, if you like, you can very well criticise.  You are entitled to do so.  If we were aware of all the implications at that time, as we were not, perhaps some blame could have come this way.</P>
    <P>In the last election this same Government was formed very much on the basis as before &mdash; promises to reduce the cost of living.  Frankly, I think they were very unwise.  I do not think there is any use telling the ordinary people and the housewives now: &ldquo;Oh! we will hold it as it is&rdquo;, or: &ldquo;We have to deal with the situation as it is&rdquo;.  That, unfortunately, is the position in which you find yourself and the position in which the whole country finds itself.  Much of that is without any fault of theirs any more than it is your fault or anybody else's fault in the country.</P>
    <P>There is a large body of people and housewives outside who thought that they had got such a promise.  Deputy Dillon may be right.  It all depends on one's interpretation of the facts.  After all, the Labour Party are not the majority in the Government.  They committed themselves but they are not the majority.  Fine Gael disclaimed having made promises as I pointed out but whether they disclaimed or not <Col N="943" /> these people at the time they cast their votes were very much under the impression that they had got such a promise or were expecting to get a reduction in these commodities.  Instead they find the situation going on in another way.</P>
    <P>I might, perhaps, be pardoned if I again refer to the quotation I have already taken from Deputy Larkin's speech and make the further remark that that is the reason they are cynical. But it will not help anybody to take that line in regard to it.  Was it for a policy of keeping things as they were that this Government was elected? That is the next question.  Was that why they were elected?  Did the housewife vote to keep things as they were and show her disapproval by putting us out?  There is a certain Deputy who is in the House at the moment who is fond of saying that they voted to put us out.  That may be his view.  Did the electorate who gave the votes that made the difference &mdash; 10 per cent. it has been reckoned by some &mdash; merely use their irritation over the 1952 Budget or did they do it in the expectation that they would put in some people who would go back to 1951?</P>
    <P>Whatever promises were made in the general election, the by-election campaign was all worked out in the city of Cork on the cry of: Back to 1951. Therefore, the question arises, can we get back to 1951?  If we can and if the present Minister and Tánaiste can get back to 1951 prices without doing serious damage in any other vital direction, then I think we would be very discourteous to say the least of it not to congratulate him.  It would be a petty attitude not to congratulate him. That is the question we should be discussing here.</P>
    <P>After all, in theory he can.  He has the power.  He says in his own election literature that he will reduce the price of food commodities by subsidies.  All right.  That is easy.  He could go back to 1951 prices in the morning.  Take that fundamental commodity, bread.  By simply putting on the required subsidy he and his Department could calculate how much money he would require to put on that particular subsidy.  Then, <Col N="944" /> of course, another problem arises and that is where the whole crux is.</P>
    <P>There is nothing to stop this Minister or any other Minister taking the millions of pounds required out of the Central Fund and allocating them to food subsidies and reduce the cost of bread and any other commodity you like right back to 1951 as far as that part of the operation is concerned.  It is a perfectly simple budgetary operation. There is money there.  I do not make any suggestion for a moment that the money is there when everything is taken into account.  Generally speaking, there is plenty of money available to the Minister and the Government compared with the requirement under any single heading. They have only to give the appropriate sum for wheat or anything else and you are back to 1951.</P>
    <P>Naturally, any thinking person will say that this is elementary and the Minister may feel rather bored with my elementary approach to it if you like but a lot of clear, elementary thinking is no harm sometimes.  Why does not this Minister or any other Minister do it?  This Minister and this Government do not do it only because of one reason.  The money has to be found and the money available to a Government can only come from the people's pockets in some form or another.  If you are going to give more subsidies you will have to collect that money in some other form.</P>
    <P>Is not that the simple answer?  Is not that the difficulty and the problem of this Minister and of any other Minister and Government that is there?  Is not that the problem?  Is not that the difficulty?  At this stage, let me hasten to say that I am not criticising this Minister and Government for not working miracles.  They cannot do it but I think I am in order if I say that after your experiences before, you should have known better and it was somewhat irresponsible of you, to put it mildly, whether by implication or explicitly, to promise the impossible.  It is on that basis that I would put the indictment on that point. However, apart from indictments, let us just come to the specific problem of going back to 1951.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="945" /> What can be done this year in regard to bread?  After all, that is what matters and a realistic approach to such problems may help to get away from the cynicism which tends to bedevil the minds of the people &mdash; the cynicism to which Deputy Larkin refers.  What can be done about this?</P>
    <P>We have a situation where the Minister for Agriculture reduced the price of wheat.  Wheat was reduced in price and the farmer is getting less for his wheat.  I think that the foreign price in regard to wheat would be favourable from the point of view of purchasers.</P>
    <P>Is is possible &mdash; those of us outside the Government and its advisers will not know the answer to the question until Budget time&mdash;is it possible that the Minister will be able to find the subsidy he promised from that source? In other words it is possible to increase the subsidy on bread to the towns and cities, say to Dublin City, by reducing the price to the farmers or by having the advantage of a reduced external price?  As I say, I can only pose that as a question.  It may be that intermediate costs will rise but we must assume that having Deputy Norton as Minister for Industry and Commerce and in view of the statements of Deputy Larkin and another Deputy who emphasised that Deputy Larkin spoke authoritatively on behalf of the Labour Party, we can assume that profit-margins or anything of that nature do not enter into the picture, that there is going to be no absorption of differences in profits but there may be absorptions in costs of another nature, but taking everything into account, by and large, the question of the moment in regard to bread is this: If the foreign price of wheat is down, if our farmers are to get less, will it be possible to give the consumer in the towns the benefit?</P>
    <P>No doubt, if Deputy Mrs. O'Carroll were to have her way &mdash; I do not know whether she spoke authoritatively for the Labour Party or not &mdash; that would be an approach, but I do recognise that the Minister has stated in answer to questions that were relevant to this matter, that the matter does not clarify itself until harvest time of this year and that it is premature to make any <Col N="946" /> statement on it now.  I have just gone over that ground to emphasise that I think it is in terms of such approaches we should be talking about things here. Quite obviously when it would come to that time we would be perfectly entitled to join issue on this again and some of us might legitimately, have differing views on it, and the ultimate answer might depend on a question of judgment, but a problem of this nature would pose itself then: Where is the just balance as between the price to the farmer of the wheat and the price to the consumer of the bread?  People who would be purely concerned with the farmers would, no doubt complain &mdash; and no doubt have already complained &mdash; very bitterly about what the Minister for Agriculture and the Government have done about wheat.</P>
    <P>Senator McGee in County Louth &mdash; and he is no friend of this side of the House &mdash; has made no bones about that part of the issue, but on the other hand, if there was a benefit, if the reduced price to the farmers were to show itself in benefit to the consumers what would be the amount of the subsidy and therefore the effective reduction in the price of bread?  Then it is a nice arguable point if you want to strike a balance.  But again I think it is on such a level and on such matters we should be debating in this House and not sliding, as we so often do, into the subjective approaches of &ldquo;you said that&rdquo; or &ldquo;I said this.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If there is a subjective approach here, again I say it is, to a certain extent, in self-defence.  There are Deputies, and I could name a row of them, who start off their argument and try to turn it into a completely subjective type of attack on this Party. Very good.  I think I am in order if I retaliate.  If the level of things has sunk to that and if people outside are cynical, they have sunk to it because of the tactics &mdash; and I use responsibly the word &ldquo;irresponsible&rdquo; approaches of the Parties which form the present Government while they were in Opposition.</P>
    <P>Getting away from the question of bread, we come to the question of butter.  The way in which some Deputies talked here would suggest <Col N="947" /> that we were sorry that this Government had reduced the price of butter. You would think if you were to listen to them that we had some desire to keep prices up.  I am afraid it was the desire of the Fianna Fáil Government to do the right thing by the country that earned them the unpopularity that undoubtedly they did earn.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear Deputies say &ldquo;hear, hear,&rdquo; because when our Government did what it thought it should do, it came in for a measure of unpopularity.  There is no doubt about it, and the propaganda which led up to the election largely hinged on that.  But that was done because the Government at the time believed it was its duty to do it, because the Government found there was a financial position there which was becoming increasingly dangerous. I know the way in which we were attacked at that time.  I was sitting over on those benches and I saw the glee, you might say, the joyful rubbing-of-hands, as they heard one burden after another coming out on the people in that Budget.  Do you think we enjoyed it?  I think I was one of the first speakers to get up and support that Budget.  I think I was one of the very early speakers to follow the Minister and support him. Do you think I enjoyed it?  Do you think I or any other member of the Government that framed that Budget enjoyed it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were suggestions from the present Taoiseach and others here at that time that we were sadistic in rubbing it in, and I think the present Minister now listening to me rather indulged in that approach too, that we were enjoying it.  There was also talk about a surplus of £10,000,000 unnecessarily put on, all of which proved to be so much hot air in the end, and so much so that if all the things that had been said at that time were correct, if everything that Deputy Costello and Deputy Norton at that time said were correct, there would be absolutely no excuse for them now that they are <Col N="948" /> Taoiseach and Tánaiste respectively for not having prices back to the 1951 level already.  The trouble is that what they said was not correct and now they find themselves facing reality and their predecessors had to face reality.  And the reality their predecessors had to face was the reality which arose from the drift in co-ordinating &mdash; the drift in the same Government that is there now &mdash; when in office before.  I will excuse them inasmuch as it was their first experiment in inter-Party Government, and we know the stresses and strains that are there, but I do not think a repetition of such a situation would be so easily condoned now.</P>
    <P>I was talking about butter.  That is what led me to say: Do you think that any responsible people are going to deplore the advantage that is given? I will give the Minister and his Government full credit for that in one sense. In another, I am wondering is it wise for a Government to do the type of thing they did?  They simply hit on butter as one item before they got into office.  It was taken in isolation without reference to the fiscal and other problems involved.  It would be a very good thing if it could be done and if it could achieve the results it was designed to achieve.  Nevertheless, I question whether it would not have been better to have co-ordinated that move in a general programme.</P>
    <P>The same remark goes for Deputy McGilligan's promise to give the back pay to the civil servants.  I am not quarrelling with that in itself but, again, it was a thing done in a disjointed way &mdash; and we should have had some definite policy if definite policy there can be.</P>
    <P>Could there be a definite policy to deal with this question of prices, this question of the cost of commodities, the balance in regard to the consumer, which reminds me of a most significant and important part of Deputy Larkin's speech, the problem of the balance of incomes and living costs?  Is there any policy by which we could approach this?  Has the Government any positive policy to offer on this or is it going to be a question of dealing with problems as best we can as they arise?</P>
    <P>Has the Government got a definite policy for dealing with this question of <Col N="949" /> price control and the question of costs? For instance, the checking of the rise in the price of tea, the decrease in the price of butter, the giving to the civil servants of the back money, the reduction in the price of wheat to the farmers &mdash; are all these actions co-ordinated in pursuance of any particular policy?  When I say definite policy, it is not enough to say: &ldquo;Our policy is to reduce prices.&rdquo;  I could demolish that statement very quickly.  Is there a definite programme, a well-thought-out line of approach?  If there is such a policy, could it be clearly defined so that we could grapple with the problems as they arise?  That is a very relevant question.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael said they had a policy which could deal with the urgent problem of the cost of living.  Just before the formation of the present Government, the Fine Gael Party issued a manifesto in which they purported to speak of a policy.  Where is this policy?  Is it going to be a repetition of 1950 all over again?  I am beginning to wonder.</P>
    <P>On the policy in regard to prices, Deputy Larkin talks about the Prices Advisory Body and price control. What is our experience of price control? I know the Deputy is present and will correct me if I am wrong in the impression I got from his speech. I got the impression from Deputy Larkin's approach that he has come to the conclusion that the way to deal with this problem, as far as the actual level of prices is concerned, is to have some machinery such as a Prices Advisory Body or some quasi-judicial tribunal which will investigate the cost to the consumer and ensure that the consumer or public interest is adequately represented and in that way, strike the fairest balance that can be achieved between the consumer, the producer and whatever middle element there may necessarily be in the chain. I further got the impression &mdash; and again, if I am in any way misrepresenting the Deputy I would be only too eager that he should correct me &mdash; that the Deputy has come to the conclusion and that it is his approach that that would have to be a State body, a body governmentally controlled.</P>
    <P>If I am right in that, is it not fair <Col N="950" /> to ask just what has our experience been in regard to such controls in the past?  We know that during the years of the emergency there was price control, that that, coupled with price control, there was wages control, but neither of these two controls proved very popular to say the least of it, that neither of these controls was altogether effective in their ultimate object and that by the end of emergency and particularly in the immediate 1946-47 transition period, we were all as anxious as we could be to get away from those controls.  The co-operation of the organised trade unions had enabled the wages control end to be worked fairly smoothly and it was taken off smoothly with their co-operation. But the controls having been taken off, the prices problem became even more aggravated and the whole cry was for decontrol.  Fine Gael were most vociferous in that regard.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture, then Deputy Dillon, intervened in debates on that question to say that he did not want Government interference or control. I confess that perhaps I am one of those who would be bracketed amongst those who are anxious to avoid central and governmental control as far as possible.  The whole outcry was against it.  The system did not work satisfactorily.  There was a torrent of complaints that certain people were being penalised and only certain people were being caught. There was the abuse of smuggling.  I think some Minister objected to a reference to that in connection with tea.  Unfortunately, that is a problem that has to be taken very much into account and is one of the abuses that can occur.</P>
    <P>One of the big problems about control is: How can you make that control justly effective and ensure at the same time that it is not tyrannical and that it is generally fair?  It will never be popular nor am I am going to put popularity up as an argument to Deputy Larkin.  However, I will say this to Deputy Larkin &mdash; I am addressing my remarks rather to him than to others because I think he takes a more responsible approach than many <Col N="951" /> others.  I would ask him, what system can you devise?  How can you devise a workable system here that will be free from the abuses and the objections that attached to the efforts at that time?  There was a policy of decontrol for which Deputy Lemass up to 1948 was severely attacked.  My records show here very clearly that although there was talk about better price control in the 1947-48 General Election and as the policy of this Government when in office before, the whole trend of the policy of the Tánaiste and his colleagues in that Government was away from control.  I think commodities were taken out of control by Deputy Norton's Government &mdash; it was Deputy Morrissey who was Minister at that time &mdash; just as fast as ever they were taken out.</P>
    <P>I asked a question at that time and in the answers that were given, I think, to other Deputies, there was a kind of suggestion that the Minister had no function now because during the past three years Deputy Lemass had decontrolled certain commodities. Whatever the fine points of this argument may be, we have the fact that when Deputy Norton's Government was in power before, and right up to date, the tendency has been towards decontrol.  And I do not see Deputy Norton showing any particular desire to invoke a tight price control system and I am sure it is not for want of the desire &mdash; I would be doing him an injustice if I were for a moment to suggest that he was being merely indolent about it. The principal factor governing this thing is that there are very good reasons why such problems cannot be dealt with as facilely as they can be talked about.  We remember the 1950 thing which I recalled already involving Deputy Cosgrave, Deputy Lemass and myself.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave said the cost of living had not gone up and we gave him the list and there was a certain amount of furore.  Deputy Norton, who was then Minister for Social Welfare, rushed in next day with proposals about price control.  They had still six months to go as a Government at that <Col N="952" /> time.  Did price control result from that?  Deputy Norton knows &mdash; I grant he had not the power that time since it was outside his Department and I could not fix the particular immediate responsibility on him &mdash; that he was a member of the Government and he obviously had the weight to force his will if he wished to do so and I am sure he did wish to do so.  But why did it not happen?  Deputy Norton still had six months left but they still kept going in the opposite direction so to speak.  Why?  Certainly the proposals for control were there and I can recollect having treated the resulting situation a little bit lightly and humorously because it really was rather funny to have had such a dramatic declaration in December, 1950, and to come along later and to compare the declaration with the results.</P>
    <P>Now we come to Deputy Larkin's talk about price control.  I do not want the Deputy to misunderstand me.  This is a problem we should tackle, but I ask both him and Deputy Mrs. O'Carroll is the way to tackle this problem the way of the Prices Advisory Body?  Up to a point, yes.  But will it solve the problem?  I am afraid from experience I have had that I do not think it will.  I do not think any tribunal will solve this prices problem unless the whole overall State structure is overhauled.  In fact I cannot see any such body solving the problem of prices unless the whole of the productive and distributive aspects are, so to speak, mobilised or regimented in some way under the State and, therefore, controllable by such a body. I do not know whether that is what Deputy Larkin had in mind, but that is where my logic would bring me.  As long as we have the present system of private enterprise &mdash; the present system which we are trying to operate, and I shall not go into its merits or demerits &mdash; we shall always be up against this problem.</P>
    <P>That is the problem which in broad terms boils down to this: At what price can a producer economically produce his product &mdash; whether it is wheat by the farmer or boots by the industrialist. By economic price I mean a price that <Col N="953" /> will pay the cost of wages and everything else connected with the output of the product, plus, if you like, the little bit extra that is required in order to give a reasonable profit and to provide for depreciation and so forth.  After that you have the costs of distribution.  Mark you, if you have the answer to those things you will be in a fair way to getting the answer from the consumer's view point, because quite obviously the price the consumer must pay cannot be less than the algebraic sum of the two &mdash; the cost of production and the cost of distribution. I am simplifying things very radically; I think that from the point of view of the student of economics I am indulging in over-simplification, but I think it is not a bad way of putting it. In other words, when dealing with the price chargeable to the consumer you are dealing with something that is already largely determined &mdash; almost completely determined &mdash; by two other groups of costing which have to be added.  There is, of course, the point of going below the economic cost by adding something in the form of subsidy.</P>
    <P>Now the function of a Prices Advisory Tribunal operating without interference or compulsion of the State is to sit down and say: &ldquo;That article costs so much at the factory. It costs so much to put through the distribution chain.  Is its present price fair &mdash; in other words is too much profit being made on it?  Is the margin maintained at a level regarded as reasonable and no more?&rdquo;  If so there is nothing the tribunal can do.  The Advisory Body cannot go any further. And that is the position that holds at the moment.  All the body can say at the moment is that they have got the cost of production and whether it is fair.  They have also got the cost of distribution and they regard that also as fair.  Then they come to the price of the retailer and they say he is entitled to the margin of profit he has claimed.  Having done that the Prices Body finds a price below which it cannot go and it then becomes a certifying stamp to the Minister and the unfortunate Minister is in the position that there is nothing more he <Col N="954" /> can do as things are at the moment except act as a rubber stamp.</P>
    <P>Let me make the qualification that this happens as things are at the moment.  I grant that the Prices Advisory Body would be a most useful thing if it were a case of investigation of excess profits &mdash; in other words if there was a profiteering ramp.  Deputy Larkin did talk about profits both this year and before and I think we joined issue on this, but I should like to point out that if there was anything really substantial in the suggestion contained in the part of Deputy Larkin's speech in relation to profits it would have shown up long ago even under the present prices advisory method.  The Prices Advisory Body are able to find the costings. Maybe Deputy Larkin would say that the present method is not sufficient and so forth and so on, and there I would join issue with him again.  But if he says that I have to examine his argument to see whether he is right or wrong.</P>
    <P>Under the method the Prices Advisory Body has been operating to date there has been a lack of evidence of excess profits which seems to be proof positive that margins are reasonable and that they will be maintained and even the Minister, in admissions made here to-day, referred to these profit margins and by inference I take it that the Minister is satisfied that the profit margins in question are both maintained and reasonable.  Anyway he has made no move and it is within his powers to make a move.  He has not done so about these profit margins and Deputy Norton is the leader of the Labour Party for whom Deputy Larkin talks authoritatively.  I, therefore, assume that Deputy Norton as the Minister responsible has assessed these profit margins and has found them reasonable.  That, I would suggest, leads one simply to this conclusion: that the Prices Advisory Body is fulfilling as much of its function as is possible under present conditions and that the crux of this whole problem is the cost of production and the cost of distribution &mdash; what I might call the economic costs of the <Col N="955" /> various commodities and articles concerned.</P>
    <P>It is that more than anything else which is determining the price to the producer.  That being the situation, to my mind the Prices Advisory Body, or any similar body or board, cannot do very much to alleviate the burden that the people and the present Minister have to carry at the present time.  I say that specifically in relation to present circumstances.  I certainly grant to Deputy Larkin that under another system of organisation, if we could, for instance, organise a strong central government of the type in some other countries where one would have a strong central control which would brook of no contradiction and where one would have power to draft labour and control labour, and so on and so forth and where everything would be integrated into almost a totalitarian State, then the role of such a judicial body would be correspondingly enhanced and more effective.</P>
    <P>For instance, if the present Prices Advisory Body was in a position to say that a particular labour unit should work at a particular rate &mdash; in other words if you integrate with the Prices Advisory Body the functions of the present Labour Court and give that body authorative powers for controlling labour costs and the purchase of raw materials; and in the case of raw materials, the purchase price is largely dictated by outside, as the Tánaiste told me at Question Time to-day &mdash; if one takes that approach, then perhaps one's Prices Advisory Body may mean a lot more.  But, as things are, I fail to see that that can give the present Minister any real, or any great, relief in this problem which is vexing him and has vexed his predecessors; indeed, if I may be pessimistic enough to say so, it will probably vex his successors and, perhaps, all of us for as long as we live because it is one of the fundamental problems of living that we can never quite satisfactorily solve for, if we did, we would have Eden on earth once more.</P>
    <P>So much for the suggestion about the Prices Advisory Body.  In relation to this factor of prices, I think it is no <Col N="956" /> harm to face up to something else; that is, the cost in the production of these commodities.  Now these costs &mdash; and with them, the price to the consumer &mdash; are dictated by both internal and external factors: internally, because we have to consider that cost in relation to goods produced at home from materials grown at home, and, externally, it is dictated by foreign factors or external prices.  In the case of something that is purely within the home economy we have much more scope to argue and, perhaps, more scope for adjustment.  In the case of a commodity like tea, however, the price paid by the community is dictated completely by something outside our control, dictated by something completely outside this country, and we can do nothing about the price of that commodity in bulk to us.</P>
    <P>All we can hope to do, if we can do anything at all, is to alleviate or distribute the burden to the individual consumer recipient.  But we have to face the problem that, taken as a community as a whole, if we want tea or oil and the price of tea and oil goes up to us abroad on the world market, we, as a community, will have to pay a higher price for that tea or oil, and there does not seem to be any escaping that.  Ultimately we, as the community, will have to pay that price.  Mark you, we will have to pay it on the nail as far as the community is concerned and that burden will ultimately fall on the individuals, be it on all the individuals in the community, if it is completely distributed, or only on some.  We will have to bear that burden.  It is a question then of what is the best way of bearing that burden?  What is the best way of bearing the burden in a case like that?</P>
    <P>To revert for a moment to the internal situation before I come to deal with the external constituents; in relation to the cost of bread, in forcing the farmer's price down we have to take into account such varied factors as the increased costs of production, if fertilisers, for instance, go up in price at home.  The farmer will have to grow the wheat; if, at the same time, the price of fertilisers goes up while the price he will get for the wheat he produces goes down, quite apart from his <Col N="957" /> profit margins there is a business problem for him.  That has to be weighed up and one has to determine in the overall position what is the best thing to be done in the interests of the community as a whole.  The farmer's labour costs may go up.  One of the problems in regard to agriculture in the past has been labour.  Indeed, that has presented itself as a vicious, double-headed problem because of one particular factor, namely, the increase in the cost of agricultural labour to the farmer.  That has meant an added burden to the farmer's already heavy costs and naturally reflects itself in increased costs to the consumer ultimately.</P>
    <P>From that point of view, therefore, there is a strong argument to keep the farmer's costs down and an equally strong argument to suggest that, as far as possible, wages and the cost of labour to the farmer should be kept down.  On the other hand, as soon as one attempts to keep down the cost of labour to the farmer, the labourers simply refuse to stay.  Who can blame the agricultural labourer for not staying to work for the farmer when he can do better for himself elsewhere? The result is the flight from the land. But the flight from the land in turn tends to have a further adverse effect on the situation.  However, I will not attempt to unravel that but merely use it as an indication of the complex reactions of these problems, one upon the other, where the just, and the very just, right of the agricultural labourer to get the highest standard and the best standard he can have finds itself in conflict with the interests of the community as a whole in relation to this fundamental industry.  That is the type of problem that has to be resolved.  It is not an easy problem to resolve.  Sometimes one is between the devil and the deep blue sea and when a solution is ultimately found, there is always someone to say that the solution is wrong and someone to argue the other way, if so minded.</P>
    <P>The same is true of many industries. Take the cost-of-living problem. Deputy J. Larkin in the course of his speech &mdash; mark you, I am not complaining about this statement because it is <Col N="958" /> a statement I feel I should make myself if Deputy Larkin had not made it &mdash; pointed out that it is the relationship between costs and wages which renders the problem a difficult one where the ordinary worker is concerned.  I hope I have not misquoted the Deputy.  If I have not completely quoted him perhaps he will indicate that and I shall be glad to read the whole thing verbatim.</P>
    <P>Deputy Larkin made the point that wages always lag behind increased costs.  Income tends to lag behind costs.  That is only too true and, consequently, it is the weaker sections of the community who too often suffer in such circumstances.  He said it is better to have stability and, if the situation is not corrected, inevitably the workers through their unions &mdash; and the unions are the only protection the workers have &mdash; will move for higher wages and another reorientation of the whole economic condition. Let us face that.  I think Deputy Larkin is quite right in pointing that out.  When we want to keep down the cost of living the Minister wants to keep it down also.  If the cost of living still goes up, as it is going, and nothing is done, as Deputy Larkin pointed out, you will have this movement to increase wages, and this means another spur to an increase in the price of commodities.  If wages in a boot factory are increased, and unless there is a much larger production, and a bigger market found, it is hard to escape an increase in the price of boots.  The same trend will be there, I believe, and it means in effect that it will shove up the cost of living much higher.</P>
    <P>As a Deputy said, if a race starts it will be to the detriment of the workers concerned.  That is why I am pressing the Minister in order to know what his policy is.  Is it the policy of the Minister and his Government &mdash; if I can put it that way through the Chair &mdash; to implement a policy of stabilising essential prices at the moment by a subsidy, as the Labour Party's programme stated?  Is that the Minister's policy?  It is not the policy that we operated.  We took a somewhat different view in 1952, and you are entitled <Col N="959" /> to take that view and implement it.  Let us say that, and let us then join issue on the other matters.  Is it the policy to try and deal with these things as they arise?</P>
    <P>To-day I had answers to a number of questions.  I asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he had sanctioned the increase in the price of chocolate.  Other Deputies asked similar questions, and all the answers were: &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  In other words, the Minister did not sanction any increase in these prices.  The Minister must be aware, as well as we are, that in addition to such essential commodities as bacon and things of that nature, and cocoa and coffee, that these other commodities have gone up in price.  Is the Minister disclaiming responsibility for that?  I think I can find in his answers the suggestion that they were decontrolled by his predecessor.  I think I can quite legitimately say to the Minister: &ldquo;Look, you are there now.  It is not good enough to say that your predecessor did such-and-such. You are there now.  What are you going to do?&rdquo;  Do the answers given to us to-day mean that these prices went up without the Department being even concerned?  Is that what it means?  Or if it does not mean that, is the Minister bowing to the inevitable and saying: &ldquo;Well, these prices have to go up, and we cannot control them.&rdquo;  Mind you, it is not that I do not sympathise with the Minister in this problem, because he cannot do on every occasion what he did in the case of tea.  We must realise that.  The funds are not inexhaustible.</P>
    <P>Let me come to the question of tea with which I was earlier challenged to deal.  I think, Deputy Dillon, the Minister for Agriculture, gave me an awful lot of questions to answer, but I have mislaid the sheet of paper on which they were written.  I think I have answered one, and that is on the question of tea.  What is the situation? Deputy Norton, and in this particular case I think it was Deputy Norton who was responsible for the action, not his Fine Gael colleagues, saw that the price of tea in Ceylon had gone up. Left to itself it meant an increase in <Col N="960" /> the price here to the consumer.  There was no escape from the effect it had in this country.  Tea Importers had to buy the tea and had to put up the price because of current world market prices.  If I understand the Parliamentary Secretary's résumé of the situation, the position is this: The Government then assumed that probably the price of tea would go down again, and they would average the thing out, so to speak, the reduction at some future date would compensate for that, and if they took a long enough period, things would average out all right.</P>
    <P>The whole thing was purely a question of judgement.  One has to say that it is a question of whether the Minister's judgement was right or wrong. The serious question is: is it likely that the price of tea will go down soon enough to wipe out the overdraft and interest created in that way, or to put it more realistically from the point of view of the consumer, can this adjustment take place say in whatever form, whether it is taxation or an increased price, or anything else from which the consumer can be insulated in the net? If there is a likelihood of the price coming down, then we would have no hesitation in saying, if it works out in that way, that the Minister was right. But if he is not right, supposing the price of tea was to stay at that level indefinitely, or worse still, increased in price, then the Minister will find himself in very serious difficulty.  If it were to stay for any considerable time at that level, or worse still, increased in price, then one is faced with a mounting charge about which action of some sort will have to be taken.  That is the problem as I see it.  Was it wise that the Government should have taken that gamble?  In other words, it is a gamble.  We had gambles before. We had gambles before when the Coalition Government was in office, gambles on various things happening which did not happen, and the result was that in the 1952 Budget, in one form or another, became inevitable.</P>
    <P>If we are raising questions on the price of tea it is not because we are in any way sorry that the price cannot be kept at its present level.  We very much welcome that.  It is because we <Col N="961" /> want to see that there is no build-up that can result in another 1952 Budget becoming inevitable.  We have had our experience of the 1952 Budget which was to a large extent inevitable as a result of the 1948 Budget brought in by Deputy McGilligan as the Minister for Finance.  Is a certain technique being used again that Deputy Dillon has already referred to in regard to wheat, in the course of this debate?  It was the averaging out and the non-realisation of certain expectations which resulted in the 1952 Budget.</P>
    <P>It is the desire to see that a 1952 situation and Budget will not result from the present Government's policy that evokes references to that matter in this debate from these benches.  But, if we can with due safeguard of the future and, particularly, if the Parliamentary Secretary's view of the situation is correct, then I should imagine the Minister has considerable justification for the course he has adopted and it is a very good thing to see some positive action being taken in regard to the matter of prices anyway.</P>
    <P>That is the fairest and straightest answer I can give Deputy Dillon when he asks me a certain question about the price of tea.  That, I think, is the only sober way of looking at this problem of the price of tea.</P>
    <P>The Minister and his Government may, when it comes to Budget time, bring us back to 1951 in regard to bread prices.  The first move appears to have been made in that regard, the reduction of the price of wheat both in the world market and to our own farmers and the consumers in the cities particularly are hoping that that is what will result.  There is one thing that a Party like Deputy Larkin's should bear in mind and that Deputy Larkin and myself should bear in mind, that the approach to these problems must be balanced, that the interest of the nation as a whole must be balanced in this matter, that looking at it exclusively from the farmer's point of view or the townsman's point of view will not give us a useful solution to the problem.  We have to look at it from the point of view of balance and the claims of the farmers and of <Col N="962" /> the townspeople have to be balanced in these matters.</P>
    <P>I have said the main things I want to say, with this exception: what of the future?  The Parliamentary Secretary Deputy O'Donovan, is free to commit himself to certain views of the future.  I would not be at all too keen on committing myself.  I think there is a certain question mark about future trends over all.  He has mentioned inflation.  I fear that he may be right in that.  There are corrective financial measures being taken in England. What their repercussions here will be remains for the future.  I am referring to the bank rate.  There are internal factors as well.  I think the evaluation of these should take up our time rather than throwing the type of stuff that has taken up most of the time of the debate in this House.</P>
    <P>The Government should give us a lead in this.  There was a Deputy talking about policy and what Fianna Fáil did in 1932.  Well, Fianna Fáil and the Labour Party, in 1932, started off with a positive policy and I will pay the present Tánaiste and the older members of his Party the tribute of having played a very important part in initiating one of the successful eras of our history but there was a definite, positive policy there and there was a Government there that was giving a lead, not only politically, against a stagnant and somewhat reactionary Fine Gael Party here at that time.</P>
    <P>There was a positive political lead. I do not want to go back on all that. What I want to point out is that there was a policy, a political policy, from the getting rid of the Oath to the ultimate that was achieved but it was definite.  There was an economic policy.  We were going to do certain things in regard to bogs, in regard to tillage.  There was something definite about the policy.  There was a lead being given by the Government. During the war years there was a lead being given by the Government and, whether we were popular or were not popular, there was a definite line taken by the Government in 1952.  Whatever you can say about that Government in 1952, at least it made up its mind as to what should be done and did it.</P>
    <P>Now, we want a lead from this <Col N="963" /> Government in a situation which is difficult and, reading Deputy Larkin's analysis of the situation, I would almost say menacing.  Can we have something definite to clinch on in this matter of policy?  There is no use in saying: &ldquo;Our policy is to reduce prices&rdquo;.  Very good, if you can achieve that in individual things.  I do not want to be small and take away whatever credit is due in this matter of tea or butter but, over all, this problem is big.  The answers to questions here to-day were not encouraging. What is the policy of this Government? When I ask: &ldquo;What is the policy of this Government&rdquo;, a blanket answer, &ldquo;We intend to reduce the cost of living&rdquo; is not enough.</P>
    <P>We want to know how will you do it, what is the line of approach.  Is it to be through the Prices Advisory Body, as Deputy Larkin suggests, and all that implies, as I suggest, from the organisation of labour and production and everything into a nicely tight-fitting State controlled scheme, or is it some other approach or will it be done within a private enterprise economy and, if so, how will we do it? All these questions are questions of the moment and the whole field of discussion in this House could be narrowed down very much if the Government came out positively and gave us a line. Then we could say whether we agree or disagree.  Perhaps much of it would be a question of judgment.  Fair enough.  The trouble at the moment is that we appear to be drifting in a way that is to some extent rather reminiscent of three years of drifting before.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mrs. O'Carroll last night made certain statements in regard to Fianna Fáil and mentioned a number of commodities that went up in price. I have a certain amount of sympathy for Deputy Mrs. O'Carroll.  Deputy Mrs. O'Carroll undoubtedly committed herself up to the hilt.  She said she was talking on behalf of her Party.  She committed herself up to the hilt to reduce the cost of living for the housewife.  I am not at all challenging or impugning the Deputy's sincerity in the matter but I am just wondering how it will work out and I <Col N="964" /> am wondering if she is talking authoritatively for the Labour Party, as-authoritatively as Deputy Larkin is stated to have talked authoritatively, in the words, I think, of Deputy Desmond. If she wants to tax cosmetics &mdash; if you could do it &mdash; I have not looked into the figures &mdash; I do not know &mdash; there are all the administrative difficulties &mdash; she is honest enough to say so.  If she wants to put £2 an acre on land, she is honest enough to say so but I, for one, question whether that would give the result and the money that is necessary.</P>
    <P>Perhaps it is more from chagrin and a feeling of frustration that she says it, but she mentioned a number of commodities that she says went up in the time of the Fianna Fáil Government. I am sure they did.  I am asking her and the Minister and all Deputies here to take the hard facts of life and to see what commodities have gone up under successive Governments and what the prices problem is and to grapple with it realistically.  It is very interesting to compare Deputy O'Carroll's list with the list for this Government when in office before and when in office at the moment.  I find that, on my pre-1951 list, the Coalition had effectively increased the price of tea through the off-ration device to 6/6.  Coffee went up then and I think it has gone up since.  She mentions butter as having gone up.  Butter went up under them before.  It has gone down now by specific action, but when they were in office before, it went up. Cheese went up, and sweets and chocolate.  Chocolate has gone up again.  She chose to mention chocolate last night and apparently it has gone up again, though the Minister says to-day that he has not sanctioned it.  I have a list here of commodities&mdash; sweets, chocolate, jam, butter, petrol, oils, all of which went up under the inter-Party Government before and it is a rather curious parallel to her list which is: sweets, chocolates, peas, beans, paraffin and cocoa.  It has gone up again.  What is she talking about?</P>
    <P>She talks about public inquiries. Has a public inquiry or a private inquiry made any difference in any of these matters, of itself?  No.  In the case of tea, the Minister directly intervened, <Col N="965" /> but, in the case of these other commodities, no.  I could waste the time of the House talking about these matters, but we are out of office and that list of hers is dead and gone. They were in office before, but I can match and cap and crown her list with the performance of the inter-Party Government before.  What is more, when the Deputy was talking in that way, securing votes in that way and making these promises, that record was there behind her and now she can ask for herself what is happening now and what is her position in this.  From her point of view, it must be: &ldquo;A plague on all your houses&rdquo;, but that is poor consolation.</P>
    <P>Is it not better to say: &ldquo;We have enough of this propaganda about prices merely to get into office or to keep in office.  There is enough of this talking about it in that sense&rdquo;?  Can we not get down to dealing with these problems realistically, as I admit Deputy Larkin has tried to grapple with them, which in all their ramifications are complex and difficult to deal with?  So much for that end of it.  I am very much afraid that when it comes to a question of the polls again, if certain people who are talking about promises continue in that way, there will be people saying at the next general election, as we said at the last but one: We are not indicting them or criticising them for not doing the impossible.  They, any more than we or anybody else, cannot work miracles, but we are indicting them and legitimately criticising them for false promises, pretence and drift, because the promises now alleged, if made wittingly, and persisted in, in the light of our experience, must be assumed to be false, unless something positive can be done at this late hour after at least six years' talking about them.  If the pretence is going to be kept up that we can do something that we cannot do, people are leaving themselves wide open to attack on that ground.</P>
    <P>Lastly, if there is going to be drift which can only result in damage to us all, again I think I can take it where I left off and condemn them.  No matter what you can say about the Fianna <Col N="966" /> Fáil Government, at least you cannot say that they drifted.  They faced the problem and tackled it.  They were beaten hard enough and round about by all the Coalition Parties, but at least they did not drift.  Let this Government do likewise and we will try to remember our own experience and be kind to you, but, for goodness' sake, do something about something.  That is the way I would put the plea.</P>
    <P>One last point which is a matter of correcting the record, and I want to do it as politely and as nicely as I can, seeing that the Minister and I, according to the record, were not as polite to each other as we might have been at an earlier stage of the debate. There was a little interchange between us about cocoa and coffee, to the effect that Deputy Lemass had approved the recommendation of the Prices Commission. I interjected that he did not approve, and I think the facts will be found to be as the Minister subsequently stated, that the recommendation was before Deputy Lemass, but that he did not approve of it, and that it was left for the present Minister to deal with on the change of Government. Is that not the position?  That is, as I am informed, the position.</P>
    <P>I am coming back to it merely because of the reiteration by the Minister for Health at a subsequent stage of the debate and, in the interest of accuracy, I should like to ask the Minister am I correct?  If I am, let us record it on the record and leave it there. If I am not correct, I am not correct, but my information at the time was, and it has not been changed since, that the recommendation was before Deputy Lemass, as Minister, that he did not approve it and did not decide it, so far as I know, but that it was left to his successor.  I hasten to add that I am not suggesting he would not have done so.  I do not want to put the thing so far &mdash; he probably would &mdash; but, in the interests of economy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This debate has gone on now for two parliamentary weeks and, quite frankly, I do not know whether the debate is part of the Fianna Fáil campaign to reorganise the defunct branches of its organisation up and down the country or whether it is just an attempt by the Opposition to conceal their obvious disappointment at the extremely competent manner in which the affairs of this State have been handled by this Government for the past eight months.  One can see quite clearly that noise has been substituted for intelligent thought and Deputy de Valera, while purporting to be a reasonable man, introduced quite an element of heat, though we did not get much light from anything he said in the course of a speech which lasted for two long hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This debate has ranged over all varieties of Government policy and has been more reminiscent of a Budget debate than of a debate on a Supplies and Services Bill.  There are some matters with which I should like to deal, but in case Deputy de Valera leaves the House &mdash; I agree he wants some rest after that marathon speech &mdash; let me put him right on one thing. In the House the other day, when it was alleged that I, and I alone, was <Col N="968" /> responsible for the increase in the price of cocoa, I asserted that my predecessor had received a recommendation from the Prices Advisory Body and that he had accepted that recommendation. Deputy Briscoe asked for proof the other day; and I promised to supply the proof.  Deputy de Valera returns to the scene of battle this evening, feeling that the proof would not be available.  Deputy de Valera has stated, by way of underlining what he believes, that his information was that my predecessor had not accepted the recommendation.</P>

      <P>On the 4th May 1954, a recommendation was received from the Prices Advisory Body to increase the price of cocoa.  The official file shows that, having considered this recommendation, it was decided that the recommendation should be accepted. The proposal was approved and it was further decided that a draft letter informing the company should be prepared and submitted for approval. On the 4th May&mdash;is it not as clear as daylight?</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister presided at it.  The decision was the Minister's. Subsequently, the letter was presented to the Minister for signature in the terms in which he directed, namely, that the increase in the price should be <Col N="969" /> authorised &mdash; and the Minister decided to leave it over to his successor to deal with.  The Minister approved the recommendation, the Minister directed that the letter should be issued, the letter was prepared as directed by the Minister; and then the Minister said: &ldquo;The general election is over; we have lost the general election; leave it to my successor.&rdquo;  I am not saying that the Minister in that case acted improperly in facing up to the recommendation which then confronted him.  What I am objecting to is Deputies on the opposite benches alleging that they would not have accepted the recommendation for an increase in cocoa prices, when this file shows that their own Minister on two occasions accepted the recommendation and ordered that a letter be drafted to the effect that cocoa prices should be increased.  I hope that hare has been run to earth.</P>
      <P>We had another reference the other day to coffee prices.  It was asserted that I increased the price of coffee.  I did not such thing.  Coffee prices were decontrolled by the deliberate act of the Fianna Fáil Government on the 5th September, 1951.  There were increases between then and when we came into office.  There has been no increase since we came into office and no increase has been approved by me. Just like the questions to-day, this thing has backfired on the people who thought to make political capital out of it.  Decontrol of coffee prices is a Fianna Fáil act.  The increase in the price of cocoa was accepted on two occasions by the Fianna Fáil Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I put this information on record to disprove the statements which were made from the Fianna Fáil Benches and which, by a noisy interruption the other day, Deputy de Valera sought to prove, that the Fianna Fáil Minister had not done any such thing.  The records are there.  I will put these documents on the Table of this House if I am asked to do it and I ask the Fianna Fáil people now to request them to be put on the Table if they are dissatisfied about the accuracy of the information I have given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me get back to some of the <Col N="970" /> matters which have been raised on this Bill &mdash; but only to some of them, as it is not possible to deal with all the issues which have been thrown up. Deputy Lemass complains that in a period of eight months we should have been able to obviate the necessity for the reintroduction of this Supplies and Services Bill.  But to do that would have necessitated our being able to get through this House in the past eight months&mdash;some of them being months during which the Dáil was in Recess&mdash; no less than ten Bills, through five stages of this House and four stages in the Seanad.  Does anybody believe that we could have done that and kept current legislation going as well? We could not do it in eight months; it would have been daft to attempt it.  If we had to listen to speeches of two hours' duration, as we had this evening, we could not have got two Bills through in eight months, with three of them months during which the Dáil has been in Recess.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Would not they have been agreed measures?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Do you imagine prices mechanism would be an agreed Bill, seeing that we have now spent two parliamentary weeks during which prices and price mechanism have been the main subject of discussion here? We could not get through in eight months &mdash; with only four or five months of effective parliamentary time &mdash; the ten Bills necessary.  It is for that reason that we came before the House and asked that this Bill be prolonged for a further 12 months, so that in the meantime we could get down to the problem of producing the alternative Bills which will be necessary when the Supplies and Services Bill lapses.  No less than seven of these Bills have to come from the Department of Agriculture. Even facing up to a programme of getting ten Bills through in 12 months is not going to be an easy task.  I do not want to mislead or misguide the House.  While we will attempt to do it in every possible way, it may be physically impossible &mdash; if this is to be a deliberative Assembly and if people's rights to participate in the debate are not be curbed &mdash; to get <Col N="971" /> through these ten Bills plus the ordinary Estimates plus the financial business and the current legislation within the next 12 months.  We will try to do it.  The problem is the problem of trying to do it within a particular period of time.</P>
      <P>When I remember that Deputy Lemass could have repealed this Bill in 1947, that he could have done so again in 1951 and 1952 and in 1953 and 1954, it is not a little surprising that he should appear in this debate in the role of saying that this Bill would be continued because people love power and that we are reluctant to shed that power.  From Deputy Lemass, that was the most amusing contribution that was made in this debate because during the emergency, and subsequent to the emergency, Deputy Lemass, as Minister for Industry and Commerce and Minister for Supplies, wielded more power than Georges Malenkov, and wielded more power, and with less control over him, than has been wielded by dictators in other countries.  For Deputy Lemass to appear here and say he does not like people hanging on to power is a bit humorous, even for Deputy Lemass.</P>
      <P>I did my best to follow Deputy de Valera to try and find the philosophy of whatever policy he was trying to put over, but I must say that I failed ignominiously in that task.  I could not find out what the Deputy was driving at, but so far as I could get any coherence from what he said it was something like this.  It is true, said Deputy de Valera, that we imposed taxes on beer, cigarettes and tobacco in 1947, that we panicked and introduced an emergency Budget and that you people in the inter-Party Government repealed these taxes in 1948 and put back into the people's pockets the £6 million which we took out of their pockets in 1947 and intended to take out of their pockets every year that we were in office. Deputy de Valera's attitude is, we know&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I said I gathered <Col N="972" /> that from whatever your philosophy was when speaking, but that is what it all totted up to in my mind.  You acknowledged that in 1947 you imposed an emergency Budget and that you lifted £6,000,000 out of the pockets of the people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>You did, and do not run away from the ghost.  I know that the ghost of the supplementary Budget is not a pleasant gentleman to meet, but he is your ghost, not mine.  You raised, by means of that supplementary Budget, £6,000,000 in additional taxation.  In March, 1948, we repealed the supplementary taxes and we gave back to the people the £6,000,000 which you took out of their pockets the previous year and which you intended to keep out of their pockets every year you were in office.</P>
      <P>We came along, says Deputy de Valera, by implication, and in 1952 we had another crack at the people in 1952.  We slashed subsidies on bread, butter, tea, sugar and flour; we increased the price of beer, spirits and tobacco.  Now, Deputy de Valera says we are out of office because the people were outraged with us.  He says now in his simple, innocent way, &ldquo;will you please do now for the people in 1955 what you did for them in 1948 when we raided their pockets in 1947?&rdquo;  The simple attitude of Deputy de Valera is that every time he wreaks vengeance on the people by taxing their resources and leaves office he expects the inter-Party, when they come into office, to undo all the things which his Government has done.  By fire brigade methods of administration, he wants us, in a period of eight months, to undo in that period all the ravages which he wrought on the people in the way of taxes and on the nation's economy in the savage Budget of 1952.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that is a compliment by Deputy de Valera, though it was not so intended, to the inter-Party Government in power&mdash;to rescue the people from what they have suffered under a Fianna Fáil Government.  I do not shirk from the task of endeavouring <Col N="973" /> to do that.  I do not think that, so far as we have gone, the people are worried about our desire to do that if it is humanly possible to achieve it.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera asks, what about the promises you made?  Fancy people being paraded in this House by Fianna Fáil speakers for not keeping promises. I could go through a litany of promises that were made by Fianna Fáil.  What about the famous promise to bring back the emigrants and of the intention to comb the cities of America to bring back the men and the women to do the work that was to be made available for them?  It is a sad and sobering reflection that, since that promise was made, 500,000 of our people have left the country.  What about the promise to solve the unemployment problem, and the declaration made by the former Taoiseach that unemployment need not exist here?</P>
    <P>What about the declaration that was made that unemployment was easier to solve here than anywhere else, and what about the fact that, after being in office for 19 years, you left 80,000 unemployed people on the register although 500,000 people had been forced out of the country to earn a living in Great Britain?  To be upbraided about keeping our promises, after being eight months in office, by a Party which made these promises and made the welkin ring with these promises is a bit thick.  I am sure that on sober reflection, Deputy de Valera realises that whatever other accusations can be levelled against this Government, it is politically unwise to criticise this Government on the basis of broken promises, having regard to the number of fractured promises that have marked the career of the Fianna Fáil Party in this House.</P>
    <P>Some questions have been raised to which it might be desirable to make a reply.  The question of unemployment has been raised.  Some doubt was expressed by Deputies on the opposite benches that the unemployment figures have fallen in the past 12 months.  What are the facts?  On the 5th February of this year, the number of unemployed <Col N="974" /> persons was 7,135 less than it was on the 5th February of last year.  On the 12th February, 1955, the latest date for which I have figures, unemployment was down by 7,192 as compared with the same date in 1954.</P>
    <P>I ask Deputies to bear this in mind, that in February, 1954, when the Fianna Fáil Party got the taste of by-election defeats, there were panic measures adopted to try to put people into employment because they knew that the general election was not far off, and money was spent like water in the hope of buying itself back into office. These figures will talk more eloquently for this Government than all the vapourings and rantings that we have got from the Party opposite in this debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I turn now to the question of employment because Deputy Colley seemed to be bewildered by the fact that employment had increased. Take the number of persons employed in the industries making transportable goods.  The number in June, 1954, was 140,900.  The number in September, 1954, was 143,400, an increase of nearly 3,000 in a period of three months.  In the figure of 143,000 employed in industries producing transportable goods we have reached a level of employment which has never before been attained. Is that anything to the credit of this Government or is it to this Government's discredit?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us look at the question of industrial production.  Taking the base year 1933 as 100, the quarterly index of industrial production in June, 1954, was 190.9.  The figure for September, 1954, the last figure I have got, was 195.2, again showing a substantial increase in the index figure of industrial production during the short period of three months that the inter-Party Government was in office.  So that you have unemployment down.  You have employment up, you have industrial production up, and all that in a period of three months.  Is there any clearer evidence that this Government is handling the affairs of the country in <Col N="975" /> a much more competent manner than its predecessors because these figures were not revealed during the last year of the Fianna Fáil Government?</P>
    <P>Let us turn now to prices because they formed a large part of the discussion on this Bill.  The Government decided, when tea prices were rising, that the effect of a substantial increase in the price of tea would have a disturbing effect on the public mind; that it would affect the cost-of-living index figure and that, as the price of tea had risen, due to a variety of what might be described as unusual and, perhaps, extraneous circumstances, it would be better in the public interest to avoid putting an additional burden on the community.  We decided therefore, to hold the price of tea at the level at which we found it when we came into office.</P>
    <P>We recognised that a stable price level was something to be commended and we decided deliberately that we would hold the price of tea at its present level until we could see what the tea prices were likely to be in September of this year.  Was there anything essentially wrong in that?  I can imagine, judging by the questions on increased prices that have been raised here in the last few months and on this debate and by parliamentary questions to-day and week after week, the delightful, exultant howl that would go up from the Fianna Fáil Benches if we had increased the price of tea, as we were advised to do from the 1st October last.</P>
    <P>The Prices Advisory Body recommended an increase in the price of tea from October last.  We did not accept their recommendation.  The matter was examined again by the Prices Advisory Body and it recommended a further increase in the price of tea from the 1st January.  We did not accept the recommendation of the Prices Advisory Body.  The position is that, although we have had two recommendations from the Prices Advisory Body that tea prices should be increased, we have not acted on these recommendations.  We have held the price of tea steady. Instead of being glad we have done <Col N="976" /> that, the Fianna Fáil Party have not been able to conceal their sense of frustration and disappointment that we were able to hold these prices steady, because they would make political capital if we had increased the burden of tea prices so far as the consumer was concerned.</P>
    <P>All the noise we heard about tea in this debate was a noise made by disappointed men that they were not able to gloat in this debate over the fact that we had increased tea prices when we had promised, as part of our election policy and as a Government policy, to endeavour to reduce the cost of essential articles of food.</P>
    <P>It was said that we are carrying the additional cost of tea on an overdraft. Is there anything wrong with that? Fuel Importers have been carrying an overdraft since the year 1940.  They have been carrying an overdraft over 15 years.  They carried that overdraft during the period the Fianna Fáil Government were in office and, when Fianna Fáil left office at the end of 1953, that overdraft of Fuel Importers was being carried by the banks and it was £2,685,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a stock of coal against it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised at the Deputy saying that.  What was the value of the stock of coal against the overdraft?  Does not the Deputy know perfectly well that the coal in the Park is being subsidised at the rate of £3 per ton, which will have to be paid for by the Exchequer to get rid of the quantity of coal?  The Deputy says he does not know it.  It is in the Estimates this year because he put it into them. I am surprised he does not know it. What is wrong, therefore, with carrying the price of tea on an overdraft if we were so virtuous and saintly to do that with Fuel Importers since 1940? Is it not quite clear that it is not worry over the overdraft being carried that the Opposition is concerned about?  Is it not perfectly clear that their main concern is that tea prices have been held, and their annoyance is that they cannot upbraid this Government with the fact that it has increased the price of tea?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="977" /> This question of subsidies has been raised and Fianna Fáil Deputies are blowing hot and cold on that.  The wise men of the Front Benches kept away from subsidies but the political lambs who roam the back benches were allowed a little freedom to talk about subsidies.  Where does the Fianna Fáil Party stand on this question of subsidies?  Will anybody tell us what their policy is?  Is it their policy to abolish subsidies or is it their policy to subsidise essential articles of food when necessary by the imposition of subsidies?  Nobody answered.  Not even Deputy de Valera in the course of a two-hour speech could be induced to go near the rock of subsidies at all. If anybody would talk on subsidies for the Fianna Fáil Party in this debate, let the chief assassin of the subsidy policy in this country talk for himself.</P>
    <P>Speaking in this House on the 2nd April, 1952, at columns 1137 and 1138 of the Official Debates, Deputy MacEntee, the then Minister for Finance expressed these views on subsidies:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The whole system is a wasteful and cumbersome means of conferring an indeterminate net benefit on some classes only of consumers. Because of the rigid controls that go with it, it tends to stifle enterprise, and it fosters inefficiency in industry and trade, because there is no incentive to reduce costs when they can be passed on to the taxpayer.  But for the subsidies, rationing, with all the inconvenience and waste of effort which it entails, could be dropped.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Is not that clearly the mentality of a man who had made up his mind that so far as his Government was concerned he was going to annihilate subsidies as a method of keeping prices lower?  Is not that the statement of a man who clearly had no use for the continuance of a subsidisation policy? Every word which he uttered during that speech is an attempt to justify the abandonment in large measure of the subsidisation policy which had held the field up to that.</P>
    <P>I said in the last election that, having regard to the way in which the Fianna Fáil Party slashed the food subsidies in 1952 and having regard to <Col N="978" /> the speech by the Fianna Fáil Minister for Finance in 1952, I was satisfied that if Fianna Fáil came back to office in 1954, staking my belief on that utterance by the Minister for Finance, Fianna Fáil would have slashed the subsidies on flour and bread.</P>

      <P>Will anybody on the Fianna Fáil benches deny now that Fianna Fáil will slash the subsidies on flour and bread if they get back to office?  There is no denial, of course, because you know perfectly well that that was the way the whole policy was shaping.  Even if you did say it, I still would not believe it, and for very good reasons.  We had from Fianna Fáil a declaration of policy in the form of a 17-point statement in 1951.  One of the points reads as follows: &ldquo;It is the policy of Fianna Fáil to maintain food subsidies, to control the price of essential foodstuffs and operate an efficient system of price regulation for all necessary and scarce commodities&rdquo;.  That was a 1951 promise to the people.  What happened?  In the following year's Budget you slashed the subsidies on tea, bread, butter and sugar although you <Col N="979" /> promised to maintain them.  You increased the price of cigarettes, beer and tobacco and you made various other raids on the pockets of the people by your high-price policy of 1952.</P>

      <P>Is it not clear now from the silence of the Party opposite on the question as to whether they would abolish the remaining subsidy on bread and flour and the subsidies which we have granted in respect of butter prices, that if the Fianna Fáil Party came back to office these subsidies would be abolished?  Even if, for policy reasons, you said now you would not do it, you could not be trusted because of the way in which you betrayed the people when you promised, in 1951, that you would increase and maintain subsidies, and in 1952 shamelessly tore up that promise and reduced some subsidies and abolished others you had promised to maintain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe, who, I think on the whole, argued pretty fairly for his point of view, could not, however, conceal his embarrassment at having to participate in this debate and rambled wide and far.  I tried to find out exactly what he wanted done about bread, with which he played a good deal in the course of his speech. Finally, Deputy Briscoe came down to something like this: he thought it would be better to reduce the price of bread than to reduce the price of butter.  His preference would be for a reduction in the price of bread rather than in the price of butter.  I told him that, in fact, we had spent twice as much in reducing the price of butter as we had in reducing the price of bread to the level we wanted to reduce it to.  What was a bit ironic was to have Deputy Briscoe telling us to reduce the price of bread by a ½d. or 1d. when his own Government had increased it from 6d. to 9d. when it <Col N="980" /> could have been left at 6d.  Is it not a bit humorous that we should be asked to listen to such pleas to reduce bread by ½d. or 1d., by a member of a Party which had itself increased the price by 3d. in 1952?</P>

They had been in office for three years and the cost of living had risen to 124.  In other words there had been a rise of 15 points in the cost-of-living index during the Fianna Fáil Party's three-year term of office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>We will come to that. I have here a leaflet issued by Fianna Fáil during the General Election of 1951 headed: &ldquo;Specially for You, Women of Kildare&rdquo;, and it alleged that the inter-Party Government had given the people dearer butter, dearer bread, dearer flour, dearer sugar, and dearer turf and it went on to say that the Government was excusing itself on the grounds that the Korean war had brought a lot of stockpiling and that had been responsible for increased prices.  The leaflet finished up saying that there was war in Europe, in Asia and in Africa when Fianna Fáil was in charge, but Fianna Fáil had kept the cost of living lower than it was then under the Coalition Government and urged the people to vote Fianna Fáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a clear indication from that leaflet that if Fianna Fáil got back to office in 1951 they would lower prices. But they were not concerned with trivialities such as the war in Korea. <Col N="982" /> They could face a global conflict with the utmost confidence and everybody would feel that, once there was a Fianna Fáil hand at the helm, prices would go down.  What a mockery of the truth to issue a leaflet of that kind while, at the same time, the Party responsible for its issue was also responsible for increasing the cost-of-living index figure by 15 points in such a short period as three years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that was a very good letter.  They thought so, too, because your vote dropped substantially in that constituency and in the whole election.  I have tried in this debate to fathom the mentality of the Fianna Fáil Party's approach to the current problem of prices.  Not a single member of the Party opposite offered any indication as to what the Fianna Fáil policy was in respect to prices.  All we know is that their record during the last three years of office was to send prices 15 points higher than they were when they took office in 1951.  Is this a fair question or an unfair question? What would Fianna Fáil have done if they were returned to office last year?</P>

What would the Fianna Fáil Party have done faced with the rise in the price of tea in the auctions and in the gardens in the different exporting countries?  We were faced with the problem that tea was going up.  We decided definitely and deliberately to hold tea prices in spite of two recommendations from the Prices Advisory Body.  Tea prices are held now, but I say this &mdash; and I challenge contradiction on it &mdash; that if the Fianna Fáil Party had been in office they would have increased the price of tea when they got these two recommendations from the Prices Advisory Body and when tea was going up in the auctions and in the gardens.

We have held tea down when you would have pushed it up.  The cemetery-like silence on the Opposition Benches on the question of tea clearly indicates that you would have allowed tea prices to go up.  The high priest of finance in the Fianna Fáil Party, Deputy MacEntee, had declared he was going to make war on subsidies and did so in 1952.

These are two substantial items in the domestic economy of the ordinary people of this country.  There is no reason, therefore, why the people should regret the fact that Fianna Fáil have decided to take a holiday on the Opposition Benches and, as regards food prices, the longer they stay there the more money will go into and stay in the pockets of the people who have to use butter and have to use tea.</P>

      <P>Deputy de Valera asked <Col N="986" /> with monotonous repetition what was the Government's policy on prices generally.  The Government's policy was stated plainly when it was elected to office.  On Monday, May 31st last, before it was elected, it declared itself in the following terms:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Recognising that the main issue in the election was the issue of prices, the Parties forming the Government are determined to reduce the cost of living in relation to the people's incomes, and in particular to effect a reduction in the prices of essential foodstuffs in relation to the people's capacity.  It is proposed to reduce the price of butter in the near future.  A detailed announcement of the Government's proposals will be made in the course of the next fortnight.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is what the Government is committed to.  That is the Government's policy.  That is the Government's programme and the fact that we have reduced the price of butter by 5d. in the lb. and that we have kept down the price of tea to a level which is 1/4 less than the people would have to pay if Fianna Fáil were still in office is evidence of the manner in which we are endeavouring to implement the programme which we issued before we took office after the last election.  For my part, and for the Government's part, I shall strive and they will strive, every one of them, to stand on that policy and to implement that policy in so far as it is possible to do so.  Is there anything wrong in striving to reduce prices?  Is there anything wrong in exercising all the ingenuity at the Government's disposal to get down the prices of essential commodities? Is is not far better to fail in the attempt than not to try at all? We are trying to get the prices of essential commodities down.  That is our policy.  That is the policy with which we shall continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The base catcalls of the market place and the shallow reasoning of minds skilled only in economic quackery will not tire or dismay this Government or prevent its doing its best in the matter of price reduction.  Every effort has been and <Col N="987" /> will continue to be made to reduce prices.  But let me say this &mdash; and I say it with great frankness &mdash; that if through pressure of world conditions, if through inflationary tendencies elsewhere, or if through deficiencies in our own economic fabric we find it is not possible to do it, I for one will not have the slightest hesitation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>And during his speech I thought Deputy Briscoe was driving towards him rather rapidly and doing his best to keep himself back.  Deputy Larkin said that this Government has committed itself to an effort to get down prices.  I accept that as does Deputy Larkin.  Every member of the Government accepts it and we are all doing our very best to get them down. We have got some of them down, we have got vital prices down and in other cases we have been able to hold prices at their present level.  Deputy Larkin posed the question also of the possibility of our running into a situation in which for some reason or another, in spite of all our efforts, we might not succeed in keeping down prices and he then asked a most pertinent and intelligent question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>How will you talk yourself out of it at all?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>What Deputy Larkin asked was what might be done in circumstances like that.  It is quite clear that a price level is a relative term &mdash; that which can be charged by the producer having regard to the measure of the purchasing <Col N="989" /> power of the people.  For instance you can cite very low prices in Japan and China but does that make them economically more important when the wages of the workers there are so very much lower?  If prices are at a certain level and if it is not possible to get them down as far as you would desire then it is not unreasonable to approach the problem from the point of view of improving wages so as to put a better buying power into the hands of the people.  Is there a business man or an industrialist who does not realise that his main problem is to see that a sufficient buying capacity is in the pockets of his customers?  Is any business man better off by impoverishing his customers and by knowing that his customers have not the wherewithal to buy his goods or to use the services which he provides?  Does not our whole economic stability and our only hope of ever attaining prosperity rely on the people's ability to buy and in our ability to put more and more purchasing power into the hands of the people whose money keeps the wheels of industry and commerce going?</P>
      <P>I see nothing wrong with Deputy Larkin's point that if is not possible to solve the problem by the one method of approach, it may be solved by the other, because if we do not put into the hands of the people, either by lower prices on the one hand or by greater purchasing power on the other, the wherewithal to buy what is produced in industry and in agriculture in this country, then we will have stagnation, recession, bankruptcy and ruin for many people.  We could manage to keep the country in a prosperous condition only if we give the people the necessary purchasing power to buy the goods which are produced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our policy, at all events, will be to endeavour to implement the promise which we made there.  If that is not possible I, for one, will not hesitate to say so at the appropriate time; and, if that situation should arise, then the problem will have to be tackled in another way by other methods, but all the time by methods which will give the masses of the people rising standards of living.  They will not get that from the Fianna Fáil Party with its <Col N="990" /> wage freeze mentality, on the one hand, and its subsidy slashing policy on the other hand.</P>
    <P>The question of price control machinery has been raised in the course of this debate.  For my part I do not take exception to the criticisms which have been uttered because I think the evolution of a satisfactory prices control machine is something which has an interest for each and every one of us.  I would like to correct certain misunderstandings or misconceptions as to the position of the Prices Advisory Body.  The Prices Advisory Body has all the powers it cares to exercise to investigate prices on its own and, when requested by the Minister, it has an obligation to undertake such investigations.  Let me say, too, that the Prices Advisory Body has been much more active in the last six months than it was in the previous three years.  In 1952 it dealt with only four cases of public inquiries.  In 1953 it dealt with one and in the first half of 1954 it dealt with one; in the second half of 1954, however, it dealt with seven. Therefore, so far as the Prices Advisory Body is concerned it is being used and will continue to be used to the best possible advantage in the interest of the consumers.</P>
    <P>That body is representative of producers and consumers and I think it is only right to emphasise here that the consumer representatives are two well-known trade union officials who are in touch with the consuming masses, who have all the facilities at their disposal for expressing their views, who suffer no inhibitions from the point of view of giving utterance to their views and who know perfectly well that they are there as the watchdog of the consumers.  That is their function.  They have no other function because other interests are represented there and will presumably look after the interests of those whom they represent.</P>
    <P>I notice it has been alleged that the Prices Advisory Body does not appear in the published reports of the hearings to be actively engaged in defending the public interest.  I have caused inquiries to be made in that connection <Col N="991" /> and I have been informed that the inadequate publicity which is given to public hearings of the Prices Advisory Body in no way reflects the interrogations which take place at its sessions.  I have no means of checking on that myself personally, but I have the assurance from members of the body that the published reports do not reflect their zeal in extracting all the information they can so that they can protect the consumers' interest in every possible way.  Suggestions have been made that the members of the tribunal are not perhaps the best persons to undertake the skilled questioning and cross-examination of the applicants for price increases, which is necessary if the facts are to be brought to the surface, and it has been suggested in the course of the debate that the consumers' point of view is not being adequately put in the public sessions of the Prices Advisory Body.</P>
    <P>It may well be that our approach to this problem will have to be somewhat different in the future.  I have been reviewing the position for some time to see in what way the machinery of the Prices Advisory Body could be strengthened by putting at the service of the body some person or persons sufficiently qualified to ascertain the facts relating to an industry, or industries, and to ensure that all the materials necessary to enable the body to come to a fair judgment are made available to the Prices Advisory Body by means of question and answer.  As I have said, I have been examining this matter for some time and I propose to continue that examination with that object in view and with the desire, which I hope can be achieved with reasonable speed, of making the Prices Advisory Body a still more useful instrument in the matter of protecting the consumers' interests.  I do not want to go on any further.  I think I have reached the stage now at which we can sum up.</P>
    <P>This Government has been in office for eight months.  During three months of that period the Dáil has been in recess.  But eight months is a very short time in the life of a Government; <Col N="992" /> not even our opponents will deny that.  Even judging this Government on its eight months' record and contrasting it with the three years of the last Government, I would not be afraid of the test.  What have we done?  I have said already that we reduced the price of butter by 5d. per lb.  We protected the people from having to pay increased tea prices, which they would have had to pay under a Fianna Fáil Government.</P>

Industrial production increased between June and September and I hope that the next index figure will show that that position has not only been maintained but has shown a still further improvement.  Since June last 60 new industries or extensions of existing industries have been established.  Government stocks, although issued at a lower rate of interest than when Fianna Fáil was in office, are standing higher than comparable Fianna Fáil stocks.  The Minister for Social Welfare has introduced a Workmen's Compensation Bill against the provisions of which the Party opposite voted when they were in Government.

You have to ask your own Party for the answer to that question, and you could probably get no answer to it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Dillon) James M. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Dillon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>This Bill is designed primarily to repeal and replace the Fertilisers and Feeding Stuffs Act, 1906.  The objective of that Act was to prevent and suppress the sale of inferior and unsuitable fertilisers or feeding stuffs.  It aimed at making the sale of such articles financially unattractive by reason of the civil liabilities which purchasers might invoke against the sellers in the form of claims for damages for breach of warranty.  The main features of the Act were as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>On the sale of any artificially prepared article as a fertiliser or a feeding stuff, the seller was required to give to the purchaser a written statement containing specified particulars of the composition of the article.</P>
      <P>The written statement given by the seller of the article was to have effect as a warranty by the seller.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purchaser of such an article was entitled, on payment of the required fee, to have a sample of the article taken, within a specified period, by an official sampler and analysed by an agricultural analyst, who would send to the purchaser of <Col N="997" /> the article a certificate of analysis indicating, <i>inter alia</i>, whether and, if so, in what respects and to what extent the article was found to differ, to the prejudice of the purchaser, from the particulars thereof given in the seller's written statement.</P>
    <P>Every county council was required to appoint one or more official samplers and an agricultural analyst for the purposes of taking and analysing samples under the Act.</P>
    <P>When put to the test, the Act proved here, as in Britain, to be defective in a number of respects; and prosecutions for breaches of the provisions of the Act were found to be difficult to pursue successfully in the courts.  The Act's principal defect here, however, was the local machinery for the taking and analysis of samples.  The county councils in this country fixed the fees payable for the sampling and analysis of articles taken under the Act at the request of purchasers at levels so high as to cover fully the analyst's fee for carrying out the analysis in each case. The high cost to purchasers of having articles sampled and analysed under the Act proved prohibitive, and requests by purchasers to have such articles sampled and analysed soon ceased to be made.  Eventually this situation resulted in neglect by county councils to appoint agricultural analysts under the Act.  For many years past the local machinery provided by the Act has ceased to function, in consequence of there being no demand for its use, and in all but a few counties that machinery has ceased to have even a nominal existence.</P>
    <P>The lack of any effective power to prevent and suppress the passing off of inferior and worthless articles as fertilisers and feeding stuffs became a matter of major concern early in the &ldquo;emergency&rdquo; period.  The widespread shortage, at that time, of good-quality fertilisers and feeding stuffs and of materials suitable for their manufacture created conditions favourable to the production of inferior fertilisers and feeding stuffs which could be readily disposed of at fancy prices. The situation necessitated the making of Emergency Powers Orders giving <Col N="998" /> the Minister for Agriculture powers to control and regulate the manufacture and sale of fertilisers and feeding stuffs.  Separate Orders were made in respect of fertilisers, feeding stuffs and mineral mixtures.  The relevant Orders now in force are:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;1.  Emergency Powers (Manufacture and Sale of Fertilisers) Order, 1944 [S.R. &amp; O. No. 49 of 1944]</P>
    <P Just="Center">as amended by the</P>
    <P>Emergency Powers (Manufacture and Sale of Fertilisers) Order, 1944 (Amendment) Order, 1950 [S.I. No. 263 of 1950].</P>
    <P>2.  Emergency Powers (Manufacture and Sale of Mineral Mixtures) Order, 1944 [S.R. &amp; O. No. 50 of 1944].</P>
    <P>3.  Emergency Powers (Feeding Stuffs) Order, 1944 [S.R. &amp; O. No. 196 of 1944]</P>
    <P Just="Center">as amended by the</P>
    <P>(a)  Emergency Powers (Feeding Stuffs) Order, 1944 (Amendment) Order, 1953 [S.I. No. 130 of 1953]</P>
    <P Just="Center">and the</P>
    <P>(b)  Emergency Powers (Feeding Stuffs) Order, 1944 (Revocation of Article 6) Order, 1954 [S.I. No. 260 of 1954].&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The present Bill is designed to bring together in one enactment provisions replacing the Act of 1906 and provisions conferring on the Minister for Agriculture powers similar to those at present vested in him by the several Emergency Powers Orders cited. Those Orders are intended to be revoked when the Bill is brought into operation as an Act.</P>
    <P>In replacing the Fertilisers and Feeding Stuffs Act, 1906, the Bill follows the main lines of that Act in requiring sellers to give to purchasers written statements having effect as warranties by the sellers as to the particulars stated and in entitling purchasers to have samples taken and analysed, on payment of the required fees &mdash; subject to the modification that entitlement to have articles sampled and analysed under the Bill is restricted to purchasers who propose to use the articles in the course of their farming operations. <Col N="999" /> The machinery for sampling and analysis proposed in the Bill is however, very different from that which was set up by the 1906 Act and which led to the partial failure of that Act. The Bill provides that application to have a sample of an article taken for analysis shall be made to the Minister, that the amount of the required fee shall (with the sanction of the Minister for Finance) be prescribed by the Minister, that the sample shall be taken by an officer authorised by the Minister, and that the analysis shall be performed by or under the direction of the State Chemist.  In effect, therefore, the Bill provides a State service whereby any farmer who has doubts about a fertiliser or feeding stuff which he has bought may, on payment of a moderate fee, have the article sampled and analysed. If, on analysis, the article is found not to be of the quality and composition stated by the seller, the purchaser is enabled to obtain redress from the seller by means of a claim for damages.</P>
    <P>While it is highly desirable that individual farmers should have a clear-cut legal remedy for losses suffered by them owing to the inferior properties of fertilisers and feeding stuffs which they purchased in reliance on misleading descriptions by the individual sellers concerned, it is also important that the manufacture and sale of fertilisers and feeding stuffs should be subject to supervision and regulation designed to secure that articles which are manufactured for sale as fertilisers and feeding stuffs are of satisfactory quality, of suitable composition, and conform to the descriptions under which they are offered for sale.  Supervision and regulation directed to those ends have been for several years past, and are still, exercised under Emergency Powers Orders.  Those Orders are of temporary duration and are due to expire in the near future.  It is accordingly proposed, under the Bill, to give permanent effect to the powers now vested in the Minister by the Emergency Powers Orders.  These Orders will be revoked when the Bill is brought into operation as an Act.  The powers to be given to the Minister <Col N="1000" /> under this part of the Bill are, briefly:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  Power to prohibit the sale or manufacture for sale of a specified fertiliser or feeding stuff (including mineral mixture) or of a specified class of fertilisers or feeding stuffs.</P>
    <P>(2)  Power to restrict manufacture to persons licensed by the Minister and to attach conditions to licences granted to such persons.</P>
    <P>(3)  Power to prohibit, limit or regulate the use of any specified article in the manufacture for sale of a fertiliser or feeding stuff.</P>
    <P>(4)  Power to require the production of books, etc.</P>
    <P>(5)  Powers of entry, inspection and taking of samples by an authorised officer.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill because I know how necessary it is for the farmers to know the analysis of feeding stuffs, and compound feeding stuffs particularly, and also the analysis of compound fertilisers.  Under the 1906 Act, manufacturers were obliged to give an analysis of the fertilisers they were selling and also of the compound feeding stuffs.  Where there were more than two ingredients in a feeding stuff, an analysis was to be given.  As the Minister pointed out, it was very difficult during the war period, and even outside the war period, to have a proper check kept on the quality of feeding stuffs.  Many millers throughout the country did supply the analysis, but there were millers who did not do so, and I would say that, during the war period in particular, meals came on the market which were of a very inferior quality. As a matter of fact, I think it is true to say that there was very little regard paid to much of the filling that was put in the compound feeding stuffs.  For that reason, I welcome the Bill, because it will ensure that the farmer or feeder if he is not satisfied with the compound fertiliser or compound feeding stuff which he purchases, will have his remedy by having a sample taken and analysed.</P>

    <P>There will be a few points on which <Col N="1001" /> I should like clarification, particularly in relation to Sections 4, 5, and 6, which deal with prohibitions and restrictions regarding the manufacture of both fertilisers and feeding stuffs. Amendments may possibly be put forward on Committee Stage to ensure that there will be no ambiguity in the analyses given.  In the case of fertilisers, phosphatic manures or fertilisers, let there be the soluble phosphates analysis.  Let it be either a water solubility or a citric solubility.  There is no sense whatever in trying to confuse people.  We find even at the present time fertiliser manufacturers giving two analyses&mdash;water solubility and insoluble phosphates, with possibly the citric solubility.  It is confusing enough for the ordinary farmer to get one, but let us not have him trying to find out what is the citric solubility, what is the water solubility and what quantity of phosphates in the manures are insoluble.</P>
    <P>As regards feeding stuffs, I believe that the analysis should contain the albumenoids, the oils and the fibre, which is more important than all the others.  In the case of compound meals, there is nothing to prevent a miller or <Col N="1002" /> compound manufacturer including an excessive quantity of fibrous material. For instance, if a pig meal is being manufactured and oats go into the mixture, oat hulls are too fibrous, and the farmer should know what quantity of fibre that compound contains.  If, in giving the analysis, the compound manufacturer would give the albumenoids, the oils and the fibre content, it would be of great value to the feeder.</P>
    <P>Section 4 contains provisions which enable the Minister to prohibit the sale or manufacture for sale of fertiliser, feeding stuff, compound feeding stuff, or mineral mixture.  This applies to lime, and lime in particular.  We have a standard of fineness in this country which is largely accepted, but there are people who believe that our standard of fineness is not the correct one.</P>
