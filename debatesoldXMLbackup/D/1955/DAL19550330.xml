      <P>The only relevant statistics available relating to the insurable employment of males and females during each quarter of 1954 are those for social insurance stamps sold during each period.  I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to circulate in the Official Report a statement giving estimated figures of the average weekly numbers of such insurance stamps sold in each quarter in respect of the employment of males and females.  I must point out, however, that the period during which the stamps are sold does not necessarily coincide with that during which employment is obtained, and further that the allocation between males and females of the sales of stamps of certain denominations is tentative.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement:&mdash;</P>
      <P>ESTIMATED average weekly numbers of Social Insurance Stamps sold during each quarter of 1954 in respect of employment of males and females.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state <Col N="987" /> in detail the method of computing the subsidy payable to flour millers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The amount of subsidy payable to flour millers is computed by determining, from the audited accounts submitted by millers, (1) the overall cost of making the quantity of flour produced and sold during the year; and (2) the total amount realised by the millers from sales of flour and wheaten offals.</P>
      <P>The price of flour as fixed by Order is, of course, substantially below the full economic price.  From the figures determined in the manner I have described it is possible to calculate the difference between the millers' actual receipts on the basis of the fixed price and the amount which they would receive if the flour were sold at its full economic price.  This difference represents the amount payable to the millers by way of subsidy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that it is the practice of the E.S.B. to do as the Deputy states.  On the contrary, I am informed by the board that, in all cases in which the provision of supply at the normal rate of fixed charge would be uneconomic, the householders concerned are given the opportunity of obtaining supply if they are willing to pay an extra charge known as a special service charge which will be sufficient to make the provision of supply economic.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The information as supplied in the question is correct.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands how many conacre and grazing lettings, respectively, were made by the Forestry Division of his Department at Ross Hill last year; whether 20 of those who had conacre have been refused tillage plots this year, and offered grazing instead; whether the reduced number of tillage plots is being provided on inferior quality land, and whether the rents are being considerably increased; and, if so, if he will investigate the matter with a view to restoring the facilities provided last year.</P>

      <P>The number of conacre lettings made by the Forestry Division at Ross Hill, Cong Forest, last year <Col N="1004" /> was 27.  The question of renewing the lettings has been receiving my active consideration since it was brought to my notice on Sunday last.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>It was only on Sunday last that I became aware of this and I want to tell the Deputy that the plot holders have conacre plots for 14 years so that the plots they are using are practically exhausted because farmyard manure has not been supplied to them except in a few cases.  I am trying to come to an alternative arrangement with them whereby they might get fresh land in a neighbouring estate and I hope to be able to do that for them by the end of the week.</P>

I might point out to the Deputy that as well as the 21 acres of conacre used by the 27 tenants in that particular field, there were 82 acres over which they had free grazing.

    <P>However, it was deemed desirable to delay the offer of the vacant post to the existing clerks pending the outcome of negotiations which had been taking place on certain claims submitted by the District Court Clerks' <Col N="1006" /> Association for improved conditions of service.  Since it seems unlikely now that it will be possible within a reasonable period to reach agreement with the association on the matters at issue, it is proposed to proceed with the filling of the vacancy as soon as practicable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that the position is as stated by the Deputy. The home market for soft fruit is protected and, as there are no restrictions on export, growers are free to dispose of their produce at the best possible prices obtainable either on the home market or abroad.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that raspberries were being sold in that district at 1/- per lb. from 1949 and that the price paid by the jam manufacturers last year was 10d. a lb.? In view of the higher production costs and in view of the fact that the people in that area, being small growers, are not in a position to export the fruit themselves, will he take some steps to remedy the position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as I know the price paid by the jam manufacturers last year was £93 a ton, that is about 10d. a lb., but at that time the jam manufacturers could have purchased raspberry pulp in Great Britain at £77 10s. a ton.  The problem is this. Are we to raise the cost of the pulp used by the jam manufacturers with a corresponding increase in the cost of jam to the consumers in this country, or what are we to do to get an increased price for raspberries for the growers in County Meath?  If the Deputy&mdash;and I am not saying this in a derisory way&mdash;has any suggestion to make to me as to how we can help, I would be very glad to consider it.  But I find myself in this dilemma, that I cannot raise the price of raspberries artificially without raising the price of jam.  Should we then raise the price of jam?  If the Deputy and his colleagues press that course upon me, I shall be very glad indeed to pass the benefit on to the raspberry growers of County Meath.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister not <Col N="1009" /> aware that raspberries were imported from Sweden at a much higher price than that at which they were imported from England?  In view of the fact that the jam manufacturers are apparently willing to pay a much higher price for foreign raspberries, will he not agree to reconsider the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy his information is not correct there. The import of foreign raspberries or fruit pulp is strictly prohibited until the domestic crop has passed into consumption. As to the price of Swedish pulp, I am not in a position to say because I do not know, but I cannot imagine that any rational jam manufacturer would buy pulp in Sweden at, say, £100 per ton when he could buy it in Great Britain at £77 10s.  The Deputy can rest assured, however, that the practice has always been to allow the domestic soft fruit crop to pass into consumption before any fruit pulp is admitted from any quarter.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 9:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 6 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Sub-section (2) of Section 6 of the County Management Act, 1940, is hereby amended by the substitution of &ldquo;a majority&rdquo; for &ldquo;not less than two-thirds&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is to provide for the amendment of sub-section (2) of Section 6 of the County Management Act, 1940.  Section 6 of the County Management Act, 1940, deals with the question of the removal or suspension of a county manager and the 1940 Act provides that the manager shall not be suspended or removed save by resolution passed at which not less than two-thirds of the members of the council voted for the motion.  In other words, under the 1940 Act, a majority of two-thirds of the members of the council is required before such a resolution can be passed.  This amendment is designed to substitute a simple majority for the passing of such resolutions instead of a majority of two-thirds.  It is felt that it would make the manager more susceptible to the views of the majority of the council if the majority required to suspend him was a simple majority. Where a two-thirds majority is required, by taking sides with any substantial body of opinion in the council, the manager is pretty well assured of being immune from any form of action by the council.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It might seem odd that I should not favour this amendment because I could see no reason why we should not fully support other amendments where extra powers were suggested.  The case made against similar amendments in other sections was that it might not be good to have certain powers that might be used in a political direction.  I believe that the maximum powers should be entrusted to the elected representatives because, if they are worthy of being elected public representatives, they will exercise those powers properly and fairly, but I do not believe in giving the powers sought in this amendment. I believe we would be going a bit too <Col N="1028" /> far in leaving the manager's tenure of office to depend on a simple majority. I am very much afraid, human nature being what it is, that the fact that the manager would be depending on the support of a particular Party in a council would not have a salutary effect on the manner in which he might be disposed to carry out his duties.</P>
      <P>It is quite possible that the power might never be used, but the fact that it would be there would not tend towards the impartial performance of his duties by the manager.  It would weaken the position of the manager considerably if he knew that a simple majority of the council could remove him from office at any time.  I do not believe it would tend towards the impartial conduct of a manager's duties and, as distinct from other amendments, I believe this is one case where the tenure of office of a manager should not be left to depend on a simple majority of the elected representatives.</P>
      <P>I can visualise cases where the whim of a particular member of a council might lead to the removal from office of a manager as a result of a heated position where the decision of the moment might lead to a division being taken.</P>

      <P>It would not tend towards the better conduct of affairs by the manager if he knew that he was in the position where a simple majority of the council at any time might remove him from office.  That is the entire objection I have.  It is purely a personal view.  I would be inclined to vote against that amendment despite the fact that I supported <Col N="1029" /> similar amendments on the grounds that they gave more power to the elected representatives.  I believe this is going a bit too far and places the manager in an untenable position where his tenure of office would be entirely subject to the simple majority of the council.  It would not make for the impartial conduct of affairs by the manager.</P>
      <P>I am expressing a personal view when I say that I am opposed to the amendment for that reason.  I could visualise cases where a particular Party on a council might be able to exercise undue influence over a weak manager, if such exists, by the mere fact of that power being vested in them.  It would not be politically wise or in the interests of the best management of local affairs to leave the manager's position depending on a simple majority of the council.  These are personal views and I would not be prepared to support the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KathleenOConnor" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputies who are also members of local authorities should support this amendment and the Minister can show the value he places on the elected representatives of local authorities by granting this power.  I would say that the elected representatives on local authorities are more representative than are the members of this House because each man is known intimately by the people who elect him.  I cannot see why a county manager should be granted what is tantamount to immunity by a two-thirds majority.  Since the inception of the County Management Act it has never been known to have a county manager suspended by a two-thirds majority even though there are county managers who would deserve suspension. But the power was not with the local authority to suspend them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is one reason why this House should accept this amendment.  There is the further reason that we here should have confidence in the local representatives.  Deputies have confidence in themselves.  Why not have confidence in the local representatives that they will use this power fairly and <Col N="1030" /> only as a last resort?  This amendment only seeks for power to suspend. County managers are not popes.  They are not infallible.  They have their own ideas.  I think power should be given to local authorities to keep these bureaucrats under proper control. Remember, the Minister will have power to reinstate.  I believe that if this power is given there will be more co-operation in future that we have had heretofore.</P>
    <P>A simple majority is sufficient to put a Government out of office.  Deputy J. Brennan complained about a majority of one.  A Government can also complain that a majority of one is sufficient to put it out of office.  But a Government has no complaint, and equally county managers should have no complaint.  Are the elected representatives in local authorities responsible people or are they a group of irresponsibles?  That is what it boils down to and, if this House comes to the conclusion that they are a group of irresponsibles, then they should not give them this power.  I hold they are responsible people rendering valuable service to local administration and they should not be treated as people who would wield this power in a wrongful fashion.  I appeal to Deputies to give this amendment very serious consideration.  Local authority representatives are devoting a lot of time and attention to local affairs and this amendment would give them a power, which, we hope and trust, they will use only when it is absolutely necessary to do so.  I would like to hear the views of other Deputies on this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">

      <P>I have some sympathy with this amendment.  There is a lot to be said for it and there is a lot to be said against it.  I would like to get the views of the House on it but very few Deputies appear to be interested in it.  If the mover of the amendment examines it closely he will see that it applies only to county managers and not to city managers.  I presume he wants uniformity.</P>

      <P>I cannot see anything in this amendment from the point of view of principle.  Most of the councils are composed of 21 or 27 members.  Take the 21 member council: under the law as it stands, it takes 14 members out of 21.  If this amendment is carried it will take 11.  On the 27 member council it takes 18 members at the present time; if this amendment is carried it will take 14.  A seven day notice must be given to members before such a resolution can be moved and whether it is 50 per cent. or two-thirds does not matter very much, because local authorities are responsible people and they do not put down frivolous motions to suspend managers unless there is absolute necessity for them.  Indeed, I hope no irresponsible representative will ever take his seat on any local council.</P>
      <P>I cannot see much in this amendment one way or the other.  I doubt if it is needed.  The position is secure as it is.  It would be very foolish if councils got it into their heads that they wanted an easy way of suspending managers.  The Minister has suggested there should be half the council.</P>

      <P>The County Management Act has been in operation for 12 years and it was in the first four or five years of the operation of that Act that there was likelihood of friction arising or necessity to suspend a manager.  As time goes on, except for some very serious reason, it is most unlikely there will be any such motion before a county council as one aimed at suspending a county manager.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am somewhat surprised at the ease with which the Minister gave way to this amendment.  I do not suppose, as has been stated earlier, <Col N="1033" /> that there is very much in it, but I look upon this amending Bill as a further attempt to segregate the functions of the elected body from those of the manager.  My approach to this would be that if this House feels certain functions now performed by the manager should be transferred to the council, they should transfer these functions in this amending Bill.  But I say that as regards those functions that we decide to leave with the manager we should give him full authority to discharge as his responsibilities. Now it can be contended, of course, that the difference between suspension by a majority of the council and by two-thirds of the members of the council gives the manager all the security and moral authority that he wants and I am prepared even to suggest that in many cases the councils would abuse their powers in this respect.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that it would be fair and that it would be better, if we decide here to rearrange the functions, that we should give the manager reasonable security.  There are many officials who are employed here in the services of this House whose tenure of office is controlled by this House and I think that in many of these cases it requires a two-thirds majority of the House to have them removed.  If some member of this House were to place an amendment on the Order Paper such as that which the House in its wisdom has just defeated, aimed at giving the power to the council to make temporary appointments, and if such an amendment proposed to relieve the manager of powers which he now has or will have in the future, I could understand that, but my approach would be that when this Bill becomes an Act there would be complete clarity afterwards where the authority of either the council or the manager was concerned&mdash;where it began or ended.  My approach would be that the manager would have the sort of security and protection that is provided by a two-thirds majority of a council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not regard an amendment of this nature as giving further powers to the elected representatives because we <Col N="1034" /> have decided to give to the manager certain powers to be exercised by him, and if we decide now that he should not have them we should take them from him; giving to the manager powers and responsibilities and then threatening to take them away, as appears to be the aim here in this amendment, seems to me to be unfair and unwarranted.  In view of the attitude adopted here by the Minister, and of the ease with which he has indicated his willingness to accept the principle of the amendment, it is very hard to say that one is prepared to resist the present procedure, and I do not feel, in view of the general attitude, like putting it to a vote.  I would like to vote against this because I think no change should be made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say that I find myself almost in complete agreement with everything Deputy Smith, the former Minister for Local Government, has said on this amendment. What we should get clear here is the question of the powers which the county council or local authority should have and to segregate those in our minds from the powers the manager has or will have in the future.  If there is a majority of the Deputies in this House whose wish it is to take away certain powers from the county manager, then that is their right and it would be a decision of the House which would be very welcome to many people; but I do not think the public would be quite so willing to accept that, when the manager has certain powers and when we in this House gave him authority to exercise those powers in face of the risk of pressure and undue influence which could be exercised on him by a simple majority of a council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall give an extreme case, a case which might never arise, but the danger exists of its arising if this amendment is accepted.  The Minister has suggested he is willing to accept the idea of the amendment providing city managers are included.  He has said he will bring in an amendment on the Report Stage covering such a situation. Supposing we had a local authority where a political Party had an overall <Col N="1035" /> majority and that for some specific purpose that Party decided to give seven day's notice of motion for the suspension of a county manager. There is not an earthly chance of the remainder of the council holding up or thwarting this action.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>The possibility of a two-thirds majority is very unlikely to occur.  The position is there at the moment in which political Parties have simple majorities&mdash;of one Party having a simple majority, and actually I think Deputy Smith was speaking against his own Party in that regard because they have the overall majority on a number of local authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Supposing that after the local elections next June a political Party, for political capital, on some popular issue at a meeting of a county council three weeks before the local elections occurred, put a popular motion before the council, knowing that it could not be carried in view of the opposition of the manager, and followed up this motion with one to suspend the manager because he failed to carry out their wishes.  That is a way in which a political Party could get a grand issue to put before the electors in the county council elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope I am consistent, but I believe if the manager is given certain powers he is given them here in this House with the understanding that it is his duty to carry them out.  If we are going to give powers to the manager we should, as Deputy Smith has said, give him full protection for the carrying out of these responsibilities.  As Deputy Smith has said also, certain officers of the State or of the Oireachtas cannot be removed by a simple majority.  I think that is a very fair comparison with regard to managers. Let us be clear that what we are trying to decide is to take more powers off the manager, but let us also <Col N="1036" /> be clear that whatever powers we leave him, we do leave him, and let us hope that he will carry these out in a proper manner.</P>

For technical reasons I understand that it was impossible for me to move an amendment to delete sub-section (1) as well.  If I asked to delete the three sub-sections, the whole three amendments would be ruled out of order.  Consequently, I found that in order to be able to speak on the matter at all it was necessary for me to deal only with sub-sections (2) and (3).  The main information I want to get from the Minister is what is his intention in future with <Col N="1038" /> regard to providing arbitration for the employees of local authorities.

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 13:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add to the section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(4)  Where a local authority has refused to sanction any proposal made by the manager under the provisions of this section the manager <Col N="1039" /> may appeal to such Minister as may be empowered to sanction such proposal, and such Minister may with the sanction of the Government make an Order empowering the manager to carry into effect such proposal in whole or in part.</P>
    <P>This amendment deals with the position which might arise where a local authority refused to sanction proposals made by the manager.  It provides that the manager may appeal to the Minister who may then require the manager to carry into effect the proposals which have been rejected by the council.  The position the amendment seeks to deal with is this.  By statute local authorities are required to carry out various duties with regard to health services and social services generally.  We visualise a position where a local council, on grounds of economy or other grounds, might decline to make available to the county manager the staff required to enable the county manager to discharge the statutory obligations imposed upon him.</P>
    <P>A rather difficult situation could arise where a manager would be placed in the position of having to take the rap for his failure to carry out certain obligations imposed upon him by reason of the restrictive view, if you like, of a council.  In other words, this amendment is really intended to protect the county manager from finding himself in the position where the council may refuse to give him the necessary staff or facilities to discharge the duties which are imposed upon him by law, and, in that eventuality, to enable the Minister to act as a final appeal between himself and the council on the question of staffs that he may require to discharge his obligations.  I do not know whether the Minister has considered the amendment or whether he is in a position to accept it but I think it would be a useful provision to have. Unlike our other amendments, it is increasing the powers of the county manager and the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister <Col N="1040" /> speaks, may I urge very strongly that he will not accept this amendment? I am reasonably in favour of the managerial system but bad and all as it is and dictatorial as it may be from time to time, I think that if Deputy MacBride is listened to it will have gone beyond the limits entirely.  I think that already the Minister has quite enough directive powers over the local authority to make them carry out functions that are imposed upon them by law without making anything as precise as this.</P>
      <P>Where the elected representatives of the people&mdash;because that is what local authorities mean in this case&mdash;disagree with the manager, the manager may appeal to the Minister and between the two of them they may tell the elected representatives where to get off.  As I say, I am in favour of the management system, but if this innovation goes any further than the existing position it is certainly going in a direction which is very undesirable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry I cannot accept this amendment because it cuts completely across the entire principle behind this Bill.  I set off to give more power to the local authorities and, having consulted local authorities all over the country, the one thing that they did tell me was: &ldquo;We have no power or control, other than at the estimates meetings, over increases in salaries&rdquo;. That was the one thing they all complained about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I set out to give them some power and control over wages and salaries. Deputy Allen knows very well that this does give them a considerable amount of power, but if I am going to give power to veto proposals, the managers can say: &ldquo;That is all right; you may veto, but I may appeal to the Minister&rdquo; and it comes back to the Custom House.  That is what we are trying to <Col N="1041" /> do&mdash;to shed ourselves of some of the power which we have.</P>
    <P>I think this is a very good section. It is a section which every member of a local authority that I consulted wanted.  Remember it is a section similar to a section introduced by my predecessor, a section which the present Opposition were in favour of.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we have discussed the Bill in a very fair way up to the present.  We did not try to obtain any political kudos from the debate and if a section was introduced by my predecessor I gave him credit for that.</P>
      <P>I think it would be very foolish to accept the amendment.  I am sorry I cannot accept it for the simple reason that I know that the mover of the amendment is endeavouring to do something for the employees of local authorities.  He thinks he is endeavouring to protect them, but they are protected. As I said on Deputy McQuillan's amendment, the Tánaiste has given an undertaking, and has actually introduced a Bill, to extend the Industrial Relations Act to employees of local authorities and they will be protected by having the sphere of that Bill extended to them and also to individual officers who at the moment have the right of appeal to the Minister if they are dissatisfied with conditions or scales of salaries laid down.  Individuals have a right of appeal to the Minister, but when it comes to giving to the Minister the right of hearing an appeal turned down by the local authority, I could not accept that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder is there a really clear understanding of the problem that the amendment is intended to deal with?  Under the general system, certain duties are cast upon the county manager in regard to the administration of health and social services and so on.  That responsibility is cast upon him, but under the provisions of Section 6 of the Bill which the House is considering, he cannot decide that he requires additional employees <Col N="1042" /> or additional officers to carry out the duties that are cast upon him without the sanction of the council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>They have to provide the money.  He has, by law, certain obligations cast upon him either in regard to the Department of Social Services or the Department of Health and he has the duty of carrying these obligations into effect provided he has adequate staff.  I can visualise fairly easily a situation arising where in certain areas possibly through a fit of economy or a niggardly attitude on the part of a particular county council they would say: &ldquo;No, we will not give you any more staff.  You have sufficient. In any case we do not like health services,&rdquo; or, &ldquo;in any case we do not like social services.  So you may want further additional nurses but you will not have them.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>That has happened repeatedly.  I can see many sets of circumstances in which you will have rather restrictive public bodies and the actual operation of the services which are being delegated to the local authorities will be hampered because the local councils may unreasonably refuse to give adequate staff to the manager to discharge his obligations or pay a staff an adequate wage.  In those cases, and in those cases only, the Minister should have the right to say: &ldquo;It is unreasonable of the council not to allow additional staff or increase wages&rdquo;.  For those reasons, I think this amendment is well worth considering.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a wonder Deputy <Col N="1044" /> MacBride did not move an amendment to delete the section from this Bill altogether.  That would be a more direct way of getting at what he is aiming at.  If the section were deleted and the old Act left as it was, the position would be that the manager would have the power.  Deputy MacBride now suggests that the power should rest in the Minister for Local Government or in the Government of the day. He suggests that they should have the power to dictate and to use the big stick and the big foot on the local authorities to make them do whatever they think fit.  I should prefer to see local authorities abolished altogether than to accept this amendment and hand over all this business to the Custom House and let them, if they like, employ as many persons as they choose and pay them whatever standard of remuneration they please.</P>
      <P>That is what Deputy MacBride suggests in this amendment and in my view it is an absolutely silly amendment. In the local authorities at the moment the manager has the power to decide on the numbers that are necessary to administer the services. He also decides&mdash;subject, in some instances, to the sanction of the Minister&mdash;the scale of remuneration of all the employees.  Now, if he needs to increase the scale of remuneration he goes to the council.  If the manager justifies the proposed change in the scale, I am sure that in 99 cases out of 100 the council agree to provide the funds.  I have never yet heard of a council which refused to provide the funds when the manager justified his proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to numbers, Deputies may take it as certain, from the experience up to the present day, that the manager is not a bit behind the door in having sufficient staff for himself.  I suppose that, as compared with premanager days, the clerical staffs of local authorities have gone up by 400 per cent.  If there is a justification in respect, say, of increased health or social services and if the manager can make a case to the members of the council, and has their confidence, there <Col N="1045" /> is not the slightest doubt but that they will agree to his request.  In my view, Deputy MacBride should withdraw this amendment and let the House get on with the work.  It is a most undemocratic and, I would say, foolish amendment and it is the type of amendment that would be put down by a person with the mind of a dictator.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>While I do not agree with the amendment, I think that Deputy Allen's outlook is fantastic. Deputy MacBride explained his case and we may presume that he had in the back of his mind an instance of where, in the past, this type of abuse has taken place.  I notice that many members on both sides of this House get very touchy when we speak about local authorities.  I, too, am a member of a local authority and I would just remark that not all of the members of local authorities are saints.  The biggest difficulty we have had up to the present in local authorities is in connection with certain staffing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For instance, we take up a local paper and read in it that, on the <Col N="1046" /> recommendation of the Local Appointments Commissioners, a certain person has been appointed to an engineering post in the county.  The position is that we knew nothing about the vacancy until we read in the paper that it had been filled.  I realise that Deputy MacBride did not insert this amendment just for fun: probably he knows of something that is happening or has happened in a certain county. However, as the abuse does not occur in our areas the amendment is not one I could support in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>There is the danger that the manager may appeal to the Minister. While, at times, we may have doubts about some members of local authorities, the position might turn out to be that the Minister to whom they would appeal would be a lot worse than the people themselves.  We should then find ourselves thrown from the frying pan into the fire.  Let us, for the moment, put the present Government and past Government out of our minds and just look to the years ahead.  I think it would be far better to keep the Minister out of it.  The span of life of a county council is only five years and that period passes quickly. At the local election, the outgoing members have to answer for their actions during their period of office as county councillors.</P>
    <P>In my view, that would get over the difficulty.  It is obvious that there are dangers at the present time, particularly in regard to the staffing of engineering and other posts.  I believe that at times there is justification for an increase in staff but under the present arrangement the members are told nothing about it.  The manager can look for as many as he wants and get them through the Local Appointments Commission.</P>
    <P>If this amendment goes through, we may still be in the deplorable position of having, in certain instances, staff appointed for duties that we may know nothing about and get no satisfaction from the manager as to why they should be there.  That is the weakness I see in the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>But for the fact that there is a very definite promise <Col N="1047" /> that the Industrial Relations Act is to be amended in order to allow the employees of local authorities to have their cases tried by the Labour Court, I should be very much inclined to support this amendment. I think I know what Deputy MacBride has in mind.  Take, for instance, a council which, last year, gave no increase in wages to its employees.  This year, as a result of representations by the trade union representatives who recommended an increase of 9/6 per week to bring the wages up to the same level as those obtaining in neighbouring counties&mdash; not above them&mdash;the county council, because the local elections were coming off, decided to give only 4/-.  That is something that would have to be remedied.  However, as the Industrial Relations Act is being extended to employees of local authorities, I could not agree to support this amendment.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Desmond.  There are far too many cases of engineers, particularly, being wished on a council, arriving there without notification and who cannot be removed for a certain period.  If a county manager, when the local authority stated that the staff was not to be increased, had the right of appeal to the Minister, who might not be the perfect person to decide, the matter could get out of hand again.  After listening to the debate on rate collectors, I have been nearly convinced that the local authorities are very competent men who never make a mistake but I would not be able to support the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely intervene to say that some of the arguments advanced in support of this amendment are fallacious.  Up to the present time the position as I understand it is that the manager has the legal responsibility placed upon him for the recruitment and determination of remuneration of staff, which includes the types of workers to which Deputy MacBride and Deputy Tully have referred.  If the manager is to consult his council in order to obtain an indication of what is in their minds, it does not mean that the manager is <Col N="1048" /> bound to accept any recommendation that the council make.  I merely want to make it clear that it is no excuse for a manager to say that his council would not agree.  He is entitled, if he so desires, to consult the council but, where the legal responsibility is his, he is entitled, having received a recommendation from them, to reject it <i>in toto</i> and he is entitled to make his own recommendation based upon his own common sense.  If a manager should fail in the discharge of his legal responsibility, the case should not be made here that that is the fault of the council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of explanation. I am afraid Deputy Smith is not correct when he says that it is entirely the responsibility of the manager because, in regard to the question of remuneration, the council must provide the money and in the particular case I am referring to the council is Cavan Council.  The council there have refused to find 9/6 and have offered to find 4/- and there is nothing at all the manager can do about it.  That is the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation is certainly more complex and complicated than Deputy Tully pointed out.  I am afraid Deputy Smith must not have read the Bill which is now before the House and the section which is being discussed.  The section provides that the manager shall not submit any proposal to the Minister for increased staff or for increased wages without a resolution passed by the council.  The position that Deputy Smith outlined is the position as it exists at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>The position at the moment is that the county manager has no power to fix either remuneration or the staffs that he requires without obtaining a resolution from the council first.  The truth is that the present situation was found unsatisfactory for the reasons indicated by Deputy Desmond and Deputy Tully and this section was brought in in order to amend the position and, if you like, to clip the wings of the county managers in the appointment of staffs.  There are many arguments in favour of that and probably we are all agreed on that, but I am afraid that in the clipping of the wings of the county managers in those particular respects we are creating a difficulty.</P>
      <P>It was in order to avoid the alternative unsatisfactory position that we suggested this amendment which would at least put an additional brake, if you like, on the council who was inclined to act unreasonably, by giving a right of appeal to the Minister in those cases where the council acted unreasonably. Deputy Tully is probably right in the instances mentioned.  That is one of the cases I had in mind that, if the question of the road workers' wages was left entirely to the council in that particular case, they would get no increase whereas the county manager, I think probably quite properly, took the view that they should get an increase to the level of the neighbouring counties and presumably the Minister would side with the county manager in a case of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can visualise many other similar circumstances arising.  I visualise a particular difficulty by reason of the fact also that the county manager is being given many additional statutory duties under the Health Act and that he will not be able to discharge those duties effectively unless he is given the necessary staff to discharge them. I can see the natural, if you like, tendency of many public bodies, particularly near local election time when they want to be able to get the rates down, to say: &ldquo;You will do without <Col N="1050" /> nurses; you will do without additional attendants in your mental hospital; you may require them but you will remain as you are; we will not allow you to employ any more.&rdquo;  In a case of that kind I felt the county manager should be given some right of appeal to the Minister who could then decide whether the council acted unreasonably or not in refusing to sanction an increase.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that nobody else in the House agrees with our viewpoint.  I am quite certain that the difficulties that this amendment was intended to deal with will arise and will create a serious problem very shortly after the Act comes into operation, but I withdraw the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I was perfectly conscious of what this Bill now proposes&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry.  I thought the Deputy was not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and of the new situation that will arise as a result of this Bill, but I was anxious to make it clear that the law as it now stands places completely upon the manager the responsibility for the fixation of wages and also gives him the power to create new offices.  Over the years since the managerial system was extended to the country I have known of many cases where the manager, without consultation, recruited through the Local Appointments Commission, or otherwise, a number of new officers who had to be provided for from the rates.  He did that in a perfectly legal fashion and, having done it, he was able to secure the approval of the council for the provision of the moneys necessary to pay those officers.  I think that statement is unchallengeable. Where then is the use in saying that they have not the same authority and right to discharge their legal functions in regard to the fixation of wages?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When this matter was being considered by me, I introduced into this House a similar provision in the Bill I piloted here.  One of my reasons&mdash;it was the main reason&mdash;for doing that was because, when the managerial system was extended to the country, the managers proceeded, in some <Col N="1051" /> cases at any rate, to regard themselves as little gods and they did not have the good sense to consult the local bodies, even though the matters with which they were concerned were matters in which they themselves were legally responsible.</P>
    <P>After all, even though the managers were legally responsible for discharging certain functions, there was no reason why they should not consult experienced public men to find out what they thought.  That would not in any way have changed the legal position or relieved the managers of their legal responsibility.  But, as a result of the attitude adopted by the managers, it was felt necessary by the then Minister for Local Government to issue a circular to all members of local authorities and to all county managers suggesting strongly that there should be consultation even where the legal responsibility was clearly placed upon the manager.  In some cases then the managers went to the other extreme. They proceeded to give effect to the suggestion in the circular and when matters, especially matters of remuneration, and questions that were unpopular and not easy to handle arose, they were then prepared, not to shed their legal responsibility because they could not do that, but to push it aside a little and consult the local body and, having got what should only be regarded by them as a recommendation, they proceeded to make their own proposal to the Department as to what they wanted done.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, councillors were, of course, sensible solid men.  They knew what the legal position was, even though they were not legal men.  They knew that while they were being consulted they really had no responsibility for making a firm decision and they naturally said: &ldquo;We are not going to make bad fellows of ourselves in matters like this because we know that the legal responsibility is not ours.&rdquo;  It was because of that playing from one to the other that I thought it would be better to come straight here to the House and clamp down the responsibility for determining these matters <Col N="1052" /> on those who had to provide the money.  It was not for the sake of quibbling; it was not for the sake of the kind of quibbling that is now going on here as to what is actually in the County Managerial Act at the moment, and before the Bill becomes law.</P>
    <P>I realised that managers who said they could not secure the money to give effect to a particular decision would have some trouble in satisfying me as to how they were able to secure the approval of the council for the provision of the money to meet all the liabilities they incurred in recruiting officers to posts that were never known in the counties ten or 12 years ago.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to have this position clarified, I wonder could we have an answer from the Minister as to whether or not the present position is that the county manager has authority to increase employees' wages, road workers and so forth, without referring to the council?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Allow me to finish. At the moment the manager will make application to the council for the provision of the money with which to pay increased remuneration.  I have been given to understand that the rule is that if the council refuses to find that money the manager will not recommend the increase for two reasons: first, because he feels that there would be a reduction in the amount of work which could be done as a result of the increased remuneration and, secondly, because there is a definite rule that sanction will not be given for increased wages unless the council makes the necessary provision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it correct that the Department issued a direction to managers on this point or can I take it that, if the manager recommends a reasonable increase in wages, that increase will be granted whether or not the council provides the money; because it has happened in more than one county that such an increase has been turned down.  In fact, that has happened quite recently in Cavan; the council has refused and the manager has informed me that though he recommended, in agreement with the trade union, an increase of 9/6, the council is only prepared to provide 4/-.</P>

We want to dovetail the two, let the county council make the proposal and the local authority will then have the right to sanction, or otherwise.

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">

    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to have to butt in again, but in view of the attitude of Deputy Smith I should like to say that it is all right for the Minister to point out what is the legal onus as against what is the practice.  Is the Minister aware that we had a case in Cork during the time in which Deputy Smith was Minister for Local Government in which, as far as I can recall, the majority of the members of the county council passed a certain increase for carters which I believed at the time was not sufficient?  The manager at that time&mdash;he has since retired&mdash;being progressive in his views as regards the wages which workers should get, recommended to the Minister and his Department a higher increase than that granted by the county council.  But Deputy Smith, the then Minister, and his officials decided that because the majority of the county council members, in their narrow-minded view, did not provide what would meet the manager's recommendation, the carters would get only the increase granted by the council, and there was just a polite letter from the Custom House to the manager saying: &ldquo;Nothing doing, boy&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy MacBride referred to a county and said the view there was <Col N="1055" /> that it was the responsibility of the manager, but of what use is it to say to the manager: &ldquo;Give bread and butter to everybody&rdquo; if the cupboard is devoid of bread and butter?  In the county referred to by Deputy MacBride if the treasure chest were devoid of the wherewithal to give increases to the workers the manager, with the best intentions in the world, could do nothing and I think it was a disgrace not to provide the manager with the necessary funds.  Deputy Smith has mentioned that the county council gave the necessary money for other services, whether for engineering staff or anybody else, but not for the workers.</P>

I think that situation should not arise at all. I believe that we would get over all that if we had a flat rate of wages for all the workers employed by local authorities in rural Ireland.</P>

      <P>I object to that kind of thing.  Deputy Tully is trying to portray the members of elected representatives as people who are opposed to the workers always and that is not so.  Actually they are the friends of the workers and in most cases have had to fight against officialdom for the benefit of the workers.  It is no use making political propaganda out of a thing like this&mdash; trying to portray the people's representatives as being a lot of people who are opposed to the rights of the workers.  Deputy Desmond referred to one particular case but we all know that that kind of thing should not be made apply generally because it does not apply generally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>They can be elected, too, under my system.  I want to suggest <Col N="1059" /> that as a long-term policy councils will get better committees all over through a system of proportional representation. You will get better committees in that way.  It has happened in the past where some political group had a bare majority of one on the council out of 40 or 30 or whatever it might be.  They gave the opponents, the minority group, no representation on any committee of that particular council.  It was done in the past by councils that had a majority of Fianna Fáil and it was done by councils that had a majority of Fine Gael.  It has been done on a number of occasions and I believe myself that you create a lot of friction in a local authority as a result.  A council giving no representation on the committees to other than the majority group is bad for local authority administration.</P>
      <P>I want to safeguard against that and provide that every group on the council, according to their strength, will get representation on this finance committee. It should apply to every committee selected by the local authority whether it is a vocational, an agricultural or any other committee.  I have been advocating that for a good number of years and this is the first opportunity that came my way to make suggestions to the House.  Whether the system of the non-transferable or transferable vote is used, I think the result will be the same.</P>

      <P>I am not an absolute authority on it but, according to what is written by people who have studied proportional representation, you could. They are able to show facts and figures where a small electoral college can have proportional representation by the single non-transferable vote.  I am indifferent as to whether the vote is transferable or non-transferable.  However, I found the non-transferable was simpler than the transferable but I <Col N="1061" /> have an open mind on the matter. What I am concerned about is getting the House to accept the principle of selecting committees by a system of proportional representation rather than by the straight vote of the council where some group with a majority of one takes all and leaves the others with no representation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the Minister to give further consideration to the spirit of Deputy Allen's amendment. I think there has been friction in general in the past in councils by reason of the ruthless majority machine going to work.  I am not sure how it can be done with regard to proportional representation because that could be troublesome.  The Minister intervened jocosely with regard to the manner in which the Government was set up.  If you had a situation where the different groups got seats in proportion to their strength a certain amount of justice would be done.  We must ensure that the small groups would not be obliterated and kept out of the committee work altogether.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>To begin with, I do not think this is feasible, nor do I think it is necessary.  I am a bit shocked at the two Deputies who have just spoken, because only yesterday they were belabouring Deputy McQuillan and myself for casting aspersions on the reasonable men on the county councils who, they said, could safely be trusted to select rate collectors.  Now they are only a bitter crowd who&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>They are people who think in different ways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>There are different aspects of it, I admit, but it does seem rather inconsistent to say that those whom we are told could be safely trusted to select the best rate collectors can now not be trusted to elect a committee among themselves.  My own experience is a very happy one in Donegal County Council.  This does not arise at all.  Every group has representation.  Under this system there is the safeguard that what is good for the goose is good for the gander and I think that is a good safeguard, for the majority, we must remember, can easily become a minority after the next election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1063" /> I think that is just as good and is much more easily worked than proportional representation.  It sounds very well, and something possibly could be said for it, but I think it is much more important that every county electoral area should be represented on these committees.  There is a proportion of the various political groups on the committees and if any aspect of the council is important enough to demand a committee, then it is very important to each county electoral area to have a voice in it.  Then, as Deputy Allen says, these two systems are mutually exclusive.  You cannot have both at the same time and, of the two, I think it is better that each local electoral area should have representation than that the political groups should be represented.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>In framing this particular sub-section, I was thinking of rural Ireland.  I was thinking of local authorities such as the one which Deputy Sheldon represents.  I was thinking of the small uneconomic holdings of West Donegal, and of the representatives of East Donegal who represent a completely different type of taxpayer and I want to see all these come together on the estimates committee. I thought the fairest thing I could do was to give each electoral area representation on the committee. I did not want the estimates committee to be a committee of the entire council because it would be too unwieldy and would have to report back, anyway, to the council.  I thought this a better system.  It is all very fine to say that the big political Parties will crush out the Independents.  There is no place where politics are more bitter than in this House and yet you have subcommittees of this House presided over by Independents under different Governments.</P>

I am anxious to see the electoral divisions including the islands such as Schull represented on the estimates committee.  If you leave it to a vote of the council to elect <i>en bloc</i> on to the estimates committee, these isolated areas will receive no representation, I fear.  It is for that reason that I am opposing the amendment.</P>

      <P>I see a certain amount of good sense in Deputy Allen's amendment.  I believe some Deputies have made a case that councils could be trusted to make appointments fairly and without any political bias.  I would remind the House that this refers to a somewhat different set of circumstances to that which pertains with regard to the appointment of officers or employees.  One can imagine a new county council meeting for the first time and after a very hot contest in the hustings with now all Parties fighting as a political unit.  They will have to appoint two representatives from each electoral area.  There are already six elected representatives from a particular area&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If you are going to make it on a majority vote, on a straight vote, I do not see that there is any likelihood, particularly in the first elections after an election is fought, but that you will probably have the Independents ousted from representation by some of the councils whose representatives have spoken here.</P>
      <P>Even if things are perfect in Donegal there is no indication that Cork follows suit.  From complaints I have had it is clear that all cannot be well in the south.  I would advise that we support the amendment.  It is trivial, if you like, but it is a safeguard.</P>

      <P>This gives effect to an amendment which I suggested to the Special Committee and which the Minister undertook to consider.  It is really a matter of substituting one word for another.

      <P>I think the Deputy will agree that at the Special Committee I was of much the same view as himself. We thought the expression &ldquo;multiple factory&rdquo; might meet the situation.  I have looked into the matter since and the position is that the word &ldquo;tenement&rdquo; has been used in factory legislation for over 50 years and has a legal significance now in case law.  In the circumstances, it might be better to leave the expression &ldquo;tenement factory&rdquo; there.  It <Col N="1067" /> has acquired a tradition of usage over 50 years and has established its significance in case law.  I have not much feeling one way or the other in the matter.  Having regard, however, to what came to light following my efforts to arrange that the factory should be described as a &ldquo;multiple factory&rdquo;, I think the best thing to do is to leave the expression &ldquo;tenement factory&rdquo; stand.</P>

    <P>The Special Committee, having considered an amendment tabled by Deputy Larkin, agreed that there should be written into the section a requirement that, where a piped water supply is in a factory, all sanitary conviences would be individually flushed water-closets and a provision that sanitary conveniences shall not communicate directly with the workplace. That is done in the amendment which I have tabled to sub-section (1) of Section 16.  (a) and (b) of the amendment are the additional pieces which it was agreed by the committee should be inserted.

      <P>At the Special Committee Deputy Lemass suggested that the Minister should have power to require the provision of a device which would give workers prior warning of the starting up of machinery and I took the view that that was a desirable precaution to take.

      <P>In page 19, lines 8 and 12, to delete &ldquo;woman or young&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, this is a question of the desirability of making generally applicable safeguards which the Bill proposes should extend only to women and young persons.  Section 30, as the Minister is aware, prohibits the employment of a woman or young person cleaning any part of a prime mover or any part of transmission machinery while in motion or cleaning any part of a machine if by doing so they are exposed to risk of injury.  Again, it seems to me that that is the type of provision that should be generally applicable, that the safeguards suggested here for women and young persons <Col N="1072" /> should be in fact extended to all workers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will recollect, we had a pretty long discussion on this matter on the Special Committee.  There are certain classes of machinery which have certain functions and which, in fact, can only be cleaned effectively when in motion and it is quite the practice to clean them while in motion and even to test them while in motion.  I think that is the general practice, as those who have visited factories from time to time will have observed.  The section here seeks to ensure that probably the most vulnerable class of workers, that is, the woman or young person, should not, however, be permitted to undertake cleaning when the machinery is in motion.</P>
      <P>It is one thing to say to an experienced craftsman or technician that he, with his familiarity with the machine, may run it at a certain momentum and clean it while it is running, as being the only way, probably, to get at some parts.  That is done every day in the week and nothing very much comes from it.  It might be more risky, of course, to permit a young person or a woman to undertake the same operation.  The Bill seeks to protect the more vulnerable type of worker, namely, the woman or young person, while it does not prohibit the seasoned male worker, who has a long familiarity with machinery, from undertaking the cleaning of the machinery while in motion.  I think the difficulty about accepting Deputy Lemass's view is that in fact it would not be possible to ensure compliance with it, human nature being what it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two parts in this section.  The first part prohibits a woman or young person being allowed to clean a prime mover or any transmission machinery while in motion.  The second part prohibits a woman or young person from cleaning any machinery if when doing so there is a danger of injury.  Even if it is true that it is necessary for a trained competent worker to clean a prime mover or transmission machinery when in <Col N="1073" /> motion, the second part of the section could be made generally applicable, that is, the prohibition upon cleaning any machinery while in motion if by doing so there is a risk of personal injury.  The next section, of course, imposes a prohibition upon the employment of anybody in connection with a machine who has not been fully instructed in its use and that would apply, presumably, to women and young persons as well as to male workers.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister might consider&mdash; he does not have to do it now&mdash; between this and the Bill going to the Seanad, the division of the section into two parts, the prohibition on women and young persons cleaning prime movers or transmission machinery while in motion and then the prohibition on any person cleaning any machinery in motion if by doing so there is risk of injury.  I mean serious risk of injury.</P>

      <P>(10)  In the case of a hoist or lift which does not comply with the requirements specified in sub-section (7) of this section (not being a continuous hoist or lift or a hoist or lift not connected with mechanical power), there shall be marked conspicuously on the hoist or lift a notification that it is not to be used for carrying persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Special Committee considered an amendment which was tabled by Deputy Larkin and which would make it an offence to permit a person to be carried in a hoist or lift which was not intended for carrying passengers.  As the section stands, there would be such an offence in effect because any lift <Col N="1074" /> which is used for carrying passengers, whether together with goods or not, must comply with the provisions of sub-section (7) of Section 32 and to carry persons in a lift which did not comply with that sub-section would amount to an offence.  However, to emphasise the point that was made, I agreed to table an amendment providing that any lift which is not for carrying passengers must be marked conspicuously to that effect and this amendment is tabled to give effect to that undertaking.</P>

      <P>(2) In any premises which is used partly as a private dwelling, the owner thereof shall provide such reasonable safeguards in case of fire for the persons dwelling therein as may be prescribed by the Minister in regulations under this Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will remember that I raised this point at the Special Committee also.  There is ample provision in the Bill for ensuring that factories will be equipped with means of escape in case of fire for persons employed in the factory but there are premises which are used partly as factories and partly as dwelling-houses and, in fact, since the Special Committee met, there were two cases reported in Dublin in which families had a narrow escape from death from fire which broke out in factories in the premises in which they were also dwelling. There is no obligation upon the factory owner as the Bill stands to make provision for escape in the case of fire for persons who are not employed in the factory but who are nevertheless dwelling on the factory premises.  I think it is desirable that there should be on the owner of the factory premises an obligation to ensure that means of escape in case of fire are available for persons who are dwelling in the premises; and the two instances <Col N="1075" /> reported in Dublin since the Special Committee met point, I think, to the need for some provision of this kind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I looked into this matter in the light of views expressed by the Deputy in the Special Committee. The position is that the local fire authority will have to inspect the factory in the dwelling-house and issue a certificate of safety.  The precautions and arrangements which the local authority will specify in the certificate will depend upon the circumstances of each case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, no.  The certificate must merely indicate that there is a means of escape in the factory for the persons employed therein.  The certificate is limited to the safety of persons employed in the factory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be so, but I have no doubt that the arrangements and precautions will take note of the fact that there are persons dwelling in the same premises as are occupied as a factory.  In any event should it be found in the future that the local authority is negligent or not careful enough there is power under Section 45 for the Minister to make regulations as to the means of escape in case of fire to be provided in factories, or any class or description of factories, and it should be the duty of the responsible authority to enforce such regulations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so sure about that.  The Minister will look up the two cases reported in the Press during the last month, both of them in Dublin, <Col N="1076" /> where families were endangered because of fire breaking out in factories in the same premises in which they were dwelling; and it does not seem to me there is any obligation on anybody to protect families in that situation. My suggestion is that we should put upon the man who elects to establish a factory in such premises an obligation to look after the safety of everybody living in these premises, as well as those employed by him.</P>

      <P>(5) The contents of each first-aid box or cupboard shall be inspected at least once in every week, and if necessary replenished after each occasion of use.  Every first-aid box or cupboard shall contain simple and readily understandable instructions to be followed in emergencies and such instructions shall be kept legible and clear.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to amplify to some extent the provisions of sub-section (1) of Section 55.  The amendment seeks to ensure that not only will there be a first-aid box in such factories but that the contents of such boxes will be examined at regular intervals, and the interval stipulated is each week.  The sole purpose of this proposal is to ensure that first-aid materials will be available in case of accident.  Sub-section (1) of Section 55 does not appear to me to provide sufficient safeguards and the amendment seeks to ensure that not only shall the contents be inspected and replenished but also that there shall be simple instructions for those who may require to use the first-aid box for the treatment of injured workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter was discussed at length with the Special Committee and the main point then was that it should be somebody's job to <Col N="1077" /> inspect the first-aid box each week and see that the prescribed requisites were there.  At that time I resisted the amendment on the ground that I thought the present section of the Bill better than the amendment.  The section provides that &ldquo;There shall be provided and maintained so as to be readily accessible a first-aid box or cupboard of such standard as, after consultation by the Minister with the Minister for Health, may be prescribed&rdquo;. To stipulate that the first-aid box shall be provided and maintained is to ensure that at all times, every second of every day, the necessary requisites are there.</P>
      <P>There is nothing tighter that I could prescribe than his phrase &ldquo;provided and maintained&rdquo;.  It is a continuous process.  The amendment weakens the section of the Bill inasmuch as it prescribes that the box must be inspected every week to see if there is anything missing.  The section is better because it places an obligation on those responsible to maintain continuously the requisites in the first-aid box.  I consulted the Parliamentary Draftsman in this matter and the advice I got is that there is nothing stronger from the point of view of ensuring that the box has equipment provided in it continuously than the Bill as it now stands.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Minister that the wording of the Bill is preferable to the wording of the amendment.  We are all agreed, I think, that if the law requires a first-aid box we mean a first-aid box containing the requisites for first-aid.  It is merely a question then of which is the surest method of achieving that result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second part of the amendment raises a different point.  I think the Minister was impressed by the case made for the need for having posted on the cover of the box or cupboard, or placed within the box, some simple <Col N="1078" /> instructions governing the use of the appliances or apparatus provided for rendering first-aid where necessary in cases where the person in charge of the first-aid box or trained in first-aid work might be absent when an accident occurred.  I think everybody knows of such instances where accidents have had serious consequences which could have been avoided if the proper treatment had been prescribed at the very beginning. It may be that the Minister has power to prescribe under the section as it stands for the keeping of instructions in the box but, if not, I think it should be expressly stated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 15:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1079" /> In page 37, before Section 56, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  In all factories a room, where meals may be taken, shall be provided which shall be adequate for that purpose.  Such room shall be completely separate from the workroom and reserved exclusively for the purpose of taking meals.</P>
    <P>(2)  Covered receptacles shall be provided for disposing of waste food and refuse, and such receptacles shall be emptied at least once each day.</P>
    <P>(3)  Where required, suitable and adequate facilities for preparing or heating meals, including the heating of water, shall be provided in such room or convenient to it.</P>
    <P>The amendment is in the name of Deputy James Larkin.  It was put in in order to ensure that in all factories a separate room is provided where workers can take their meals.  In many factories where big numbers of workers are employed there are no proper canteen facilities at the moment.  At the present time workers have to take their meals in parts of factories where work goes on.  They feel that is objectionable.  I submit that the room in which meals are taken should be separate from the work-rooms and should be reserved for the purpose of taking such meals. I think the Minister has discussed this matter with the committee but nevertheless I feel that the Minister should have made some provision in this regard before the Bill came back to the House and I accordingly move the amendment.</P>
    <P>In the second part of the amendment the House will probably agree that surely it is essential that where there is a question of disposing of waste food or other such refuse the factory owner should be asked to provide covered receptacles and should be required to see that these receptacles are emptied when necessary.  The third part of the amendment deals with the question of the provision of facilities for heating meals, including the provision of hot water.  In present-day <Col N="1080" /> circumstances an increasing number of workers are compelled, because of the distance of their homes from their places of work, to take some form of meal during the day at their place of employment.</P>
    <P>I think it is only proper that these workers should be provided with proper facilities for warm meals. There have been complaints in many cases that factory workers have to make do with sandwiches because of the lack of any proper place in which to consume warm meals or in which to make even a cup of tea.  The Bill before the House at the moment has been brought in for the purpose of improving the conditions under which workers are asked to perform their normal duties and I think one of the necessities is to provide facilities for proper provision of meals for workers. I would ask the Minister in all sincerity to consider the amendment with the view of incorporating it in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid this amendment has been tabled with an eye on the situation in large cities like Dublin so that sufficient cognisance has not been taken of the effect of the amendment as it would apply to factories elsewhere.  I think we can get the same effect in another and more efficient way.  This amendment requires that the occupiers of every factory, irrespective of the number of workers employed there and irrespective of the wishes of the workers in that particular factory, must provide a room separate from all work-rooms, equipped for the preparation and the taking of meals. That is a pretty wide obligation to write into this Bill, particularly when it is not related to the number of workers employed in the factory and when it is not related to the location of the factories.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Larkin has proceeded on the assumption that a very large number of workers must take their meals away from home.  That reveals the Dublin approach to the problem but if the factories were in Athlone, or in Thurles, or in Dundalk, or in any of the smaller provincial towns, I think you would have objections to the <Col N="1081" /> provisions of the amendment.  I think you would have objections from the workers if the employers sought to compel them to have their meals on the premises and accordingly sought to reduce the period of the meal intervals because they provided facilities for the meals, and because they made provision for cooking the meals.</P>
    <P>I think in such a case the employer would be inclined to impose such compulsion having regard to the fact that he provided the room in the first place and secondly, that he equipped the room.  I think this amendment has been tabled without having regard to the provisions of Section 56 of the Bill. I would prefer to see this matter dealt with by the trade unions and the managements of the factories and there is no reason why the trade unions who have members in factories should not deal with a matter of this kind through negotiations with the management of the factories concerned.</P>
    <P>If workers want canteen facilities I think their unions are quite capable, by negotiation, of getting agreement and in 1955 I think the employers would not insist for a minute on depriving workers of facilities for cooking on their premises.  The enlightened employer would realise that if his workers could not go home for meals it would be good business to see that they got a meal which would sustain them for their operational activities afterwards and therefore I think that it would be far better if the unions whose workers were concerned would negotiate with the separate employers.</P>
    <P>If that is not successful&mdash;I would venture to say it would be a complete success in the large centres of population where these facilities are necessary&mdash;then there is provision in Section 56 to meet the case.  I think it will be agreed that such provision is not necessary in the smaller places where workers prefer to go home for their meals, firstly because they get better meals in that way, and secondly, because they get more variety.  But there is provision in Section 56 which enables proper facilities to be provided in certain industries and all the power necessary to ensure that the provision <Col N="1082" /> of the facilities Deputy Larkin asks is written into Section 56, so that between Section 56 and the work that the trade union, by negotiation, will be able to do, you have a better and more efficient way of getting these facilities than through the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. D. Larkin Mr. D. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says that the amendment was applicable to large cities.  Possibly, therefore, the Minister may or may not agree that even in small towns the workers have to travel considerable distances to their work.  In such cases, the provision of canteens is very necessary.  It simply asks that they will be required to provide a place where the workers will take a meal.  The meal may very well vary; it may very well mean a question of eating the lunch they bring with them under some ordinary decent conditions, not either out in a yard or some outhouse or in some part of the factory proper, but in a room.  The Minister referred to a small factory. Very obviously if there is only a small number of persons employed in a factory no one is suggesting you would require a room 20 feet long by 20 feet wide.  All the amendment provides is that there should be reasonable facilities.</P>
      <P>I would draw the Minister's attention to part (3) of the amendment which refers to the heating of water.  The heating of water in many cases means purely facilities for workers to make a cup of tea to take with their lunch when they cannot get home.  I think it is true to say that many good employers will, in negotiation with the appropriate trade union, agree to provide the facilities, but the Minister is aware that even with good employers it frequently takes many long months of negotiation and persuasion to get the good employer to realise the ordinary necessity and justice of providing a separate place for the worker to have a meal.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1084" /> (a)  It shall be a function of the safety committee to assist in securing compliance by the occupier of the factory and by the persons employed therein with the provisions of this Act and of the Orders and regulations made under this Act,</P>
    <P>(b)  upon the request of the safety committee, the occupier shall make an entry in the general register noting&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  the establishment of the safety committee, and</P>
    <P>(ii)  if the safety committee has nominated one of its members to be the safety delegate for the purposes of this section, the name of the safety delegate,</P>
    <P>(c)  the occupier shall be entitled to be represented, by at least one person nominated by him, at each meeting of the safety committee,</P>
    <P>(d)  the occupier shall consider any representations made to him by the safety committee on matters affecting the safety and health of the persons employed,</P>
    <P>(e)  the safety committee shall consider any representations made to it by the occupier on matters affecting the safety and health of the persons employed,</P>
    <P>(f)  an inspector shall consider any representations made to him by the safety delegate and, for this purpose, may inspect any records of the proceedings of the safety committee,</P>
    <P>(g)  an inspector shall be entitled, should he so wish, to have the safety delegate accompany him on his tour of inspection of the factory or any part of such tour.</P>
    <P>(2)  If the Minister is satisfied that there exists in the factory a committee or other body which is not a committee such as is referred to in sub-section (1) of this section but which is so constituted as to be capable of discharging the functions of such a committee, he may, on application being made by the committee or other body and with the consent of the occupier of the factory, <Col N="1085" /> issue a certificate recognising the committee or other body as a safety committee for the purpose of this section and, while such certificate is in force, the provisions of sub-section (1) of this section shall apply to the committee or other body.</P>

      <P>So far as my amendment is concerned I think the only thing I need do is to explain that the committee considered alternative proposals for the establishment of a safety committee which were tabled by myself and tabled by Deputy Larkin. Some sub-amendments were tabled by Deputy Lemass on the establishment of the safety committee in factories. That matter was discussed at considerable length at the committee and having regard to the views on the subject which were distilled in the course of the discussion, I circulated revised proposals for the setting up of a safety committee and the appointment of a safety delegate, and prescribed the functions of the safety committee. The revised proposals which I submitted to the committee were accepted in principle and the amendment which I have tabled here gives effect to the amendment as it was examined by the committee.  I think it represents the viewpoint of the different Parties who participated in the examination of this matter at the Special Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceEDockrell" hpid="Mr. M.E. Dockrell Mr. M.E. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to this ministerial amendment, unfortunately I was not in the country when the meeting of the Special Committee took place.  I have, of course, read very carefully the findings of that committee but I think when we look into this proposed amendment we will see that, whilst the views of the Special Committee have a great deal behind them, nevertheless there are dangers which become apparent when this amendment is studied, dangers which <Col N="1086" /> were not present to the minds of the committee.  I say that in the light of those discussions and of the general way in which those discussions took place.</P>
      <P>This amendment does introduce a very novel element into our legislation in this country.  It is setting up a safety committee in, if necessary, every factory in the country and giving that committee very special powers.  Now I think everybody would quite agree that any committee or indeed any body of persons in a factory or workshop who can help the workers to safeguard themselves from the point of view of general safety and can help the occupier of the factory to ensure that these safety regulations are carried out, has the good wishes of every man of goodwill in this country. I wish to say quite clearly before I go any further that I think the idea of safety in a factory is one which we in this House want to see carried out to the fullest possible extent and which I think every good employer would want to see done as well.</P>
      <P>When we look into this proposal for the safety committee, it has certain provisions which, as I said, are unique and which will not necessarily lead to the most harmonious way of bringing about the greatest degree of safety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first thing that strikes me in connection with this amendment is that there is no question of the approval or the goodwill or the consent of the occupier.  There is no word at all about him.  Surely it would be advisable that the occupier of the factory should know something about the setting-up of the committee.  To go further, some of us have put down an amendment to the effect that it should be the duty of the safety committee to assist the occupier of the factory in so far as compliance with the provisions and Orders and regulations made under this Act is concerned.  That is intended to give the safety committee a duty towards the occupier of the factory, because, broadly speaking, as it is proposed here in the ministerial amendment, it starts off by proposing to set up the committee, as I said, without any mention of the person or <Col N="1087" /> firm in whose premises the committee is going to work.</P>
    <P>It then says, in the next part of the section, that it shall be a function of that committee to assist in securing compliance by the occupier of the factory. It goes on and then says that the occupier shall make an entry in a general register.  Then it says the occupier shall be entitled to be represented by at least one person nominated by him at the meetings of the safety committee.  It then goes on to say that the occupier shall consider any representations made by the committee on matters affecting the safety and health of persons employed.</P>
    <P>Then it goes on to say that the safety committee shall consider any representation made to it by the occupier, and finally, that an inspector shall consider the representations made to him by the committee and that the inspector shall be entitled to have the safety delegate accompany him on a tour of inspection of the factory or on any part of such tour.  But it does not say that the occupier of the factory should go round too.  I think, again, to ensure smooth running and harmonious relations, not to mention common courtesy, that the occupier of the factory should take part in such a tour.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>He does, in fact.  He has that right at present, but the worker has not the right to go round.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceEDockrell" hpid="Mr. M.E. Dockrell Mr. M.E. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but this would be a very special journey.  It seems as if on this journey, as the amendment is, the occupier would not necessarily be with them on that tour of inspection.  Furthermore, it is introducing a very new principle into our legislation and one to which I might say the Minister made reference a few minutes ago in arguing on Section 56.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this Bill there are inspectors, whose duty it is to see that the safety regulations are all that they ought to be and to see that they are carried out and, further, to make representations to the Minister for any new regulations regarding the health and safety and welfare of the workers; but under this amendment it seems as if we do not trust our own inspectors to carry out <Col N="1088" /> these regulations or requirements and that the committee must report on these matters.  Surely we have faith and trust in the regulations set out by the Minister and approved by this House?  Surely we have faith in what our own inspectors have done in the past and will do in the future?  I would feel that in the circumstances in which this amendment is made out it should be considered in the light of what I have said and a new section brought in instead of this section.</P>
    <P>I am afraid, as it stands, I would be very much against it because I think it is not going to have the effect that the Minister and the Special Committee thought it would, and it would only lead to trouble and is, as I say, a type of legislation which we should be very chary of putting forward in this House.  After all, if the inspectors are capable of dealing with general matters arising under Section 56, they should also be equally capable, and we should put the same trust in them, in dealing with matters which arise under Section 57 and in Part V of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. D. Larkin Mr. D. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to compliment the Minister on introducing this amendment to the Bill because, as I read it, the general purpose of the amendment appears to be to encourage workers in factories, and particularly where there are conditions which are dangerous to themselves or possibly harmful to health, to take an intelligent interest in the Acts which protect them against dangers to health and dangers of physical injury.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dockrell seems to be worried about the position of the occupiers and as to whether or not the occupiers should give approval.  The difficulty of the workers in this matter for a very long time has been that, in too many instances where the conditions were not satisfactory, if they left their place of employment to have a look at the provisions posted up in the factory or to go and look at a machine or to consider the conditions affecting their general state of health, they would be liable to discipline.  In too many instances it became a question of workers possibly making a report to <Col N="1089" /> the trade union and then of the trade union representatives not being able to get access to the factory to examine the position and having to ask the Department to send an inspector down to examine the situation.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that, from time to time, the workers have had to complain that the factory owners appear to know when an inspector is coming.  I am not making any suggestion against factory inspectors but, from my own knowledge, the suggestion has been made on many occasions that where there were breaches of various Factory Acts and attempts were made to remedy the position then, by some peculiar set of circumstances, somebody in the factory seemed to know that an inspector was due on a particular day with the result that steps would be taken to remedy the situation for that particular day.</P>
    <P>The important part of the amendment is that not only does it give the workers some powers to try and protect themselves but it encourages the workers to take an interest in the conditions in their factory.  I do not believe any employer would be penalised by the setting up of such safety committees.  I feel that many employers would welcome a committee in their factory formed from its workers&mdash;a committee of persons who would take an intelligent interest in the safety regulations and, as provided in the section, meet representatives of the employers and draw their attention wherever the provisions of the Acts were not being complied with and the workers were being exposed to danger.</P>
    <P>I think, further, it must be admitted that there are times when workers will not take full advantage of the safeguards provided for them.  In such circumstances, it would be particularly valuable to have a committee formed among the workers themselves who would impress upon their fellow workers the necessity of using the safeguards provided for them.</P>
    <P>This amendment appears to me to seek to ensure that, within any factory or workshop covered by the Act, it would be possible for the employers and the workers concerned to operate the provisions of this Act by being intelligently interested in its provisions <Col N="1090" /> and by ensuring that all the safeguards which are considered necessary for the health and safety of the workers will be available to them.  I do not think any reasonably good employer will feel in any way that the setting up of a safety committee, and the functioning of that committee as outlined in this amendment, will prejudice the enterprise, the management or the control of the workers employed there.</P>
    <P>Surely&mdash;and there are many good employers&mdash;an employer would welcome a report by a representative of the workers whenever, for instance, a machine lacks a safety guard, as is provided for in the Act?  Surely an employer would welcome efforts by the workers to ensure that where protective clothing, protective masks, and so forth, are called for in any operation, the workers themselves will utilise the protective apparatus and will realise that it is there for their benefit? Surely it is desirable, from the point of view of an employer, that a committee composed of representatives of his workers will draw his attention to the fact that he is committing some breach of the Acts governing the safeguarding of the health and welfare of his workers?</P>
    <P>In my view, the provisions of the amendment are reasonably simple and can reasonably be carried out without interfering with the management in any serious way whatsoever.  They are provisions which, if utilised by all concerned in industry, will tend, I feel sure, towards a better safeguarding of the workers employed in industry.</P>

      <P>The suggestion I proposed to make was that if the Minister could give an indication of his reaction to the later amendments it might influence the approach of Deputies to the ministerial amendment. I feel a lot of sense has been spoken by Deputy Dockrell and Deputy Larkin.  In my view, you cannot look at this novelty&mdash;because, to a great extent, it is a novelty which is being imported into this legislation&mdash;as being either all good or all bad.  Deputy Larkin suggested, and I think it is probably true, that people who might be classed or described by him as reasonably good employers have nothing to fear, so to speak, from the activities of a safety committee.  That is probably so.  I think that what is in the Minister's mind and what was in the minds of the members of the Special Committee was how to deal with factory occupiers who do not measure up to the standard of being classified as good or reasonably good and whose own slackness in the control and general management of the factory leaves it open for employees to disregard the safety regulations.  I agree that that is a point of view. However, I am not entirely satisfied that this amendment is necessary, even in those circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I follow, and I am quite satisfied with it.  I was making the case that, even in circumstances such as were outlined by Deputy Larkin, I am not entirely satisfied that legislation such as is contemplated in this section is necessary because I believe there exists already with any factory employee an absolute right to complain with regard to any infringement of safety regulations or Orders or with regard to any infringement of any law or anything having the effect of law.  Deputy Larkin has indicated that there are some factories where, when an employee remonstrates with those in charge as to lack of safety precautions or to departure from safety regulations, that employee is incurring the risk of disciplinary action being taken against him.  That seems to me to be an argument that has to be met and it might be said that this amendment meets it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is one way of meeting it but I <Col N="1093" /> would far prefer, talking personally, if that argument were met by putting into this Bill a section imposing extremely heavy penalties on any employer who would in any way endeavour to victimise an employee who made a complaint either to a factory inspector or to his trade union officials with regard to breaches of safety regulations or lack of safety precautions. It might well be more effective to legislate in that way.</P>
    <P>There is something not very desirable, from one point of view, about a committee of this sort.  I do not believe it will be popular with the employees, although their trade union leaders may feel that they require the assistance of a committee of this sort in order to enforce regulations.  I cannot imagine it being popular with the general body of factory owners.  A number of them will probably have no strong objections; others will welcome it but, by and large, I do not imagine they will show any great enthusiasm for it because it is a committee which, if not handled properly, might very well lead to discord and trouble inside the factory. It may get the name of being, for want of a better word, a kind of tell-tale committee, and if there is any stigma of that sort attached to the individual representatives on the committee or the committee as a whole, it will not do any good, particularly as the individual employees already have the right to make their complaints either through their trade union channels or direct to the Department and the Department inspectors.</P>
    <P>Unless it is extremely well handled &mdash;and, of course, it may be well handled&mdash;I cannot see that a committee of this sort would make for harmony in the running of the factory or make for co-operation in the carrying out of safety regulations.</P>
    <P>Deputy Larkin has mentioned another fact which I think is important and which is a valid argument in favour of this committee, namely, that very often the people who are the offenders are the employees themselves, that you do have cases, and probably quite a number of them, where the factory occupier gives strict instructions with regard to the carrying <Col N="1094" /> out of safety orders and regulations and where the employees find that the precautions they are required to take hamper them in their work and, in order to get ahead with the job, are inclined to disregard the precautions. It may be a question of fencing around machinery or something like that and the employee would prefer it to be out of the way.</P>
    <P>I think it is true to say that if word gets around that there is an inspector or possibly the factory owner himself visiting the premises, the employees rush to get the fencing back in place, and so on.  These are cases where the employees are at fault, where they are disregarding the safety regulations because they believe they are unnecessary and are slowing them up.  I agree that, if you have a nominee of the employees whose task it is to see that the regulations are complied with, such a person would probably have influence with his colleagues in seeing that, whether the regulations hamper the worker or not, they will be carried out.  I believe that is a valid argument in favour of a committee of this sort but, by and large, I cannot see the thing working well unless it is operated on the lines suggested by Deputy Dockrell and Deputy Belton in the later amendments and I would urge the Minister to give very careful consideration to the viewpoints expressed in those amendments.</P>
    <P>Taken by and large, my own view is that this committee is unnecessary. Influenced by the recommendations made by the Special Committee that in their judgment such a committee is not only desirable but necessary, I am prepared to accept that recommendation, but I would urge that the matter should be further considered by the Minister along the lines indicated by Deputy Dockrell and Deputy Belton.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>This committee is very desirable.  Its object is to make those who work in factories both health and safety conscious.  If one can promote a spirit in a factory of inducing workers to take an interest in preserving their health whilst employed in the factory, and many of our factories are far from being drawingrooms, and inducing them to take an interest in protecting themselves against the risks of employment in such factories, then I think you are doing two very worthwhile things.  The purpose of this committee is to enable workers to deal with all matters arising out of this Bill which are concerned with the health and safety of the workers.  They are not concerned with managerial policy. They are not concerned with factory policy.  They are not concerned with the direction of industry or the method of processing different commodities. They are concerned only with health and safety.  I can see nothing wrong with that.</P>
      <P>Is there anything wrong with selecting workers in a factory to come together and select a few of their members to sit down with representatives of the employers? Remember, the employer can have a number of representatives if he so desires.  I would hate to see any matter coming before this committee decided by counting hands or heads.  One representative of the employers and one representative of the workers might work quite well but, in order to avoid suspicion and possible difficulties, I think it is desirable to have a small team of workers and a small team of factory executives as well, if necessary, to represent the employer; and let them discuss the provisions of this legislation in so far as they operate in the factory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is there anything wrong in the workers' representatives saying to that committee: &ldquo;We think a better device <Col N="1096" /> could be used for operating that machine and providing greater safety&rdquo;, or &ldquo;We think that particular operation is a dangerous one and something will happen one of these days; it is desirable there should be better protection&rdquo;; or &ldquo;If you could manage to put in another window to ventilate this particular room it would be of considerable benefit to the health of the staff&rdquo;?  I think this is a very desirable committee.  I see nothing wrong in it. I see nothing revolutionary in it.  I do not understand the fears that have been expressed by Deputy Dockrell.</P>
    <P>Many large and excellent industries here have what are known as working committees at which the employers and workers sit down once a month and discuss various problems affecting the factory and dealing with the whole gamut of production.  Employers have in many cases testified publicly to the fact that these committees have proved very useful from the point of view of promoting an excellent spirit of co-operation and developing a sense of unity of purpose in industrial objectives to be achieved.  They have brought home to the workers a kind of factory conscience which has redounded to the benefit of industry.  A body of that kind can do the particular job I have in mind in this amendment. There is no need to set up a special safety committee.  The existing works committees can take on these functions.</P>
    <P>I met a deputation recently of a very responsible employers' organisation. They discussed this matter. When I explained the provisions all five or six&mdash;there was one exception&mdash; agreed that it was quite all right.  To the managing director of one very important industry I said: &ldquo;I understand your factory has a works committee, and I have read speeches of yours in which you pay tribute to the usefulness of that committee.&rdquo;  He said: &ldquo;Yes, it has been an excellent committee.&rdquo; I said: &ldquo;That committee can discharge these functions.  Why are you worrying about this amendment of mine?&rdquo;  He said: &ldquo;I am not worrying in the slightest.  The present committee will take on this function.  In fact, it is doing that under existing legislation.&rdquo;  I said: &ldquo;Even if you do <Col N="1097" /> not provide for this committee this is the kind of job your works committee can do.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Why these fears?  With regard to the other amendments, when I went to the Special Committee my proposition was a different one.  But there was a useful and fruitful discussion there and, as a result of the views expressed, I came back with a draft amendment and asked if that would meet their point of view.  The committee unanimously adopted the agreement and I put it to the House in accordance with the agreement reached at the committee.  This amendment did not shock anybody on the committee. There was none of the fears that have been expressed here.  There was a general recognition that in the long run this was the right and prudent approach to the problem.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dockrell's amendment seems to give this committee a completely lopsided function.  I hope he will not mind my saying that.  It would convert the safety committee from a freely formed body working in friendly co-operation with the owner of the factory into a body whose sole function would be to keep a watch on the workers and report their misdemeanours. I accept immediately that it is the function of a safety committee to assist the owner by ensuring compliance with the factory laws, but that is only one function.  They have been given that function under my amendment. I think it is reasonable to give them that function.</P>
    <P>If provision is made that the employer must approve the committee before it is established a recalcitrant employer may refuse to consent to the setting up of such a committee.  One can imagine the kind of employer who would adopt that attitude in 1955.  A good employer would not adopt that attitude.  One can imagine a certain type of employer, if the right of veto is there, who would willingly kill this committee.  Broadminded employers who know the value of co-operation will have no objection to such a committee. The main objection to the second amendment is that it would limit the functions of the committee to those of acting as an agent for the <Col N="1098" /> owner in getting the workers to comply with the provisions of factory legislation.  I would hope that on such a committee there would be an impact of reason on reason.  If the proper spirit can be injected into the operatives and the management there should be a sufficient community of interests to put right any little deficiencies that may arise under this Bill.  I cannot understand Deputy Dockrell saying we should have faith in factory inspectors. I would hope the factory inspector would find in all cases model factories. Faith in a man whose function is really that of a civil policeman under factory legislation is not the kind of objective I would aim at if I was an employer or a worker.  I would prefer to create conditions which would render detailed inspection quite unnecessary because of the spirit of harmony and co-operation existing in the factory.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>It was a good one but it happened in other places.  Immediately after an election, as Deputy Brennan has said, you have that heated feeling in the council where people are going <Col N="1101" /> to get their own back, so to speak. That goes on until 12 months later when things settle down.  The system I have mentioned was in operation in County Cork.  I know it because I invoked it below and the chairman of our council, Mr. Broderick, a fair-minded man, said that all the representatives of each Party would get together and that we would have a proportion of each Party&mdash;a proportionate number of members&mdash;on each committee.  He insisted on that and carried it.  The same might not happen in other counties and we are here to make law for all the counties, and I suggest to the Minister that on the Report Stage he should go back to the 1925 Act.  It might be his own people he would be serving; it might be us; it might be the Labour Party he would be serving.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I am putting up is that the groups from the different electoral areas should be allowed to nominate their own representatives.  In the particular case I mentioned, Labour had seven representatives on a county council of 46 members and I personally was anxious to see Labour represented on the committee, but under the kind of heated feeling that was there at that period the difficulty arose and we invoked that special section of the 1925 Act.  I suggest that the Minister and his officials would look it up and bring it in here on the Report Stage as an amendment.  I think it would ensure that all Parties, no matter how small, would get representation on these committees.  I do not want to see any particular political Parties ruling the roost in local committees of this kind where the first interest should be that of the rate-payers. I certainly would make that suggestion to the Minister now.</P>

I can appreciate the point of view put forward by <Col N="1102" /> Deputy Allen, Deputy Brennan and by the speakers on this side.  I was going to make this suggestion and offer to consider it between now and the Report Stage.  Would it suffice if the elected representatives of each electoral area elected the two?</P>

      <P>This is a county management we are dealing with and it is a new body being set up.  I would like to have the views of the House on this.  It would be unlikely that a political Party would have a majority in all electoral areas and that would ensure that minorities would be elected to the estimates committee.  I have an open mind on this and I am putting it this way.  Supposing you have five electoral areas in a county. Each electoral area is going to elect two to the estimates committee, I think that number is accepted.  Supposing we left it to the elected representatives from each electoral area to elect those two, would that meet the position?</P>

For instance, I mentioned that we had, I think, three <Col N="1103" /> Independents out of 46 in the Cork County Council.  Those three Independents have not a hope of getting on the board of assistance, on the mental hospital committee, on the sanatorium committee or on the county committee of agriculture.</P>
      <P>It is natural that if I am an elected representative in any Party I am going to try to act on it and so is every comrade of mine.  The wrangling will be between us to know which of ourselves will get on it rather than anything else.  I am speaking fairly and I am speaking from 30 years' experience of this kind of thing.  Under the Act of 1925, any of those members could invoke the group system, under which, if there were three Independents, with members of Clann na Poblachta, Labour or Fianna Fáil, those five or six could come together in a group and appoint one of that number as their representative on any one of their committees.</P>

      <P>I cannot see why those Deputies who are afraid of the methods which will be employed in giving representation on this committee feel so strongly about it.  I consider the Minister's idea of two representatives from each electoral area as being an extremely fair one.  When Deputy Corry appears in his remarks to be extremely concerned about the possibility of three Independents in, say, a large body such as Cork County Council with 46 members having no representation, I would remind him that what he fears could not happen under this idea of giving representation of two to each electoral area.  I would point out&mdash;I am giving an example, I am not naming the occasion&mdash;where a Party conceded a seat so as to give representation to an Independent. What happened subsequently did not bring any joy to the hearts of the people who conceded the seat but, nevertheless, they made it possible for him to go on the committee.</P>
      <P>It was adverted to here earlier this afternoon that here in this House it is possible for Independents to secure representation and, in fact, to be appointed chairman of some committees of this House.  We know that in local authorities when we get away from the little bit of Party strife that obtains around election time there are more geographic boundaries than there are Party boundaries.  Deputy Corry is quite aware, of course, that in his County of Cork, at least in two of the bodies, when it comes to&mdash;if I may use the expression&mdash;&ldquo;ganging-up&rdquo; it may be west of Mallow Bridge or it may be some other geographical division, but it is not&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has pointed out to his colleague, Deputy Brennan, the advantage of having representatives from different areas. When you give representation to each of the electoral areas then you <Col N="1105" /> guarantee that each part of the area which is concerned has representation on committees.  I feel that it is a fair method, that it will prove well worth a try and in the long run will give to our local authorities a type of finance committee which will prove to be a useful one.  Consequently, I feel that nothing definite has been put forward in favour of the amendment which could possibly improve on the suggestion put forward by the Minister.  As he has pointed out they can apply all the principles of proportional representation if they so desire in securing the representation in each electoral area of the two representatives.</P>
      <P>I am afraid, so far as I can judge from my experience, that it is not really possible to combine giving representation to each electoral area and proportional representation.  You have to settle one way or another because I suppose it is a matter of arguing from the particular to the general.  It is dangerous, but it is what you are doing.  In our county council there are four, five or six&mdash;I think it is four in one, and in the others, six&mdash;in the county electoral areas.  How are you going to elect two, proportionally, and give representation to the small groups?  I do not know.  If that is done, I think the two large groups will get all the membership if they bring it to the bitter end.  I do not really think they will do that.  It has never happened in our county and I think we can be as bitter as anybody else.  The system has always worked out reasonably in practice.  I am speaking as a member of a small group on a county council, and the big groups on both sides have been very liberal to the small group in giving it representation on committees. We already have a committee where each electoral area is represented by two members and there was never any difficulty about getting small groups represented on that.</P>

      <P>I think if we attempt to be too precise, as some of us argued from what we know of our own particular bailiwick, that inevitably some other bailiwick which has not quite <Col N="1106" /> the same set-up is going to be injured and I think the broadest possible terms are the best ones.  If a county council desires, it can, under the present Bill, opt for the proportional representation system of election in the county electoral areas.  Personally, I would be sorry to see that.  I think it would mean squeezing out the smaller groups if continued to the bitter end.  But at least there is an option there and if it was felt that it would give better results in any county, that county could apply it, but I think the direct vote and, if you like, a bit of bargaining&mdash;&ldquo;you support me in that electoral area and I will support you in the other area&rdquo;&mdash;works best.  That is what happens, and it gives reasonable results.  Any attempt to close it down and secure every nut and bolt will end only in a system which will not produce good results anywhere and will only embitter feelings. I think there is a natural inclination to find ways round legislation and the phraseology used and the tighter the Dáil attempts to frame things like this, I imagine the more industrious members of local bodies will be to find some way out which will suit their own ends.  If it is left loose, a reasonable view will be taken of it in local bodies.  As the Minister points out, if in the heat of the moment something occurs in a local body and one Party sets out to ride roughshod over everbody, well that, I think, will only last a few weeks. Personally, I do not think it would be as bitter and intense as all that.  So far what heat there has been is usually cooled off&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Now, there may be a bit of hullabaloo on the first couple of appointments but very often the difficulty is to find someone willing to go on to these committees.  Everyone will not dash madly on to committees and I have seen cases where it was necessary to bargain and to say: &ldquo;Well, if you are going to bother with such an <Col N="1107" /> area, I had better bother with such another.&rdquo;  Not everybody likes to spend a lifetime charging from one committee to another.  Generally speaking, I would suggest that the legislation be left reasonably open so that it would meet the situation in the various local bodies.</P>

      <P>There has been a good deal of discussion all around this amendment.  I suppose it was an advantage to have it put down so as to provoke the discussion.  What I was aiming at was to provide that when a council is elected as a result of any local election that council will provide machinery which will work smoothly. That was my only objective.  I know from personal experience, and representatives of other counties know, that when an election is over, especially in the South where we are all a little more hot-blooded than the hard northerners who settle down on the night of the election when the ballots are declared, that a council does not start off so well.</P>

A group of the councillors of which I happened to be a member had 49 per cent.  of the representation and two other groups together had 51 per cent.  On a committee of 16, the vocational education committee, they gave the 49 per cent. one representative, on the mental hospital committee, none; and on the county committee of agriculture, four out of 16.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Limerick, Kerry or Clare, where Fianna Fáil might get a majority or where some other group might get a majority, and they took all the committees. I think that is bad as a long-term policy and gives bad local government machinery.  Everybody in the House will admit that, and if it can be avoided it should be avoided.  But once an election was over, I never saw any friction in the council when it got going and settled down.  There is no such thing as politics and the council works away without reference to anything of that kind.</P>
      <P>At the first meeting of a council after an election you have the election fought all over again and if there is a majority of one on a council they take all.  That is very bad and it is in order to prevent that that I put down this amendment.  I was not too satisfied with it.  I did think of putting in as an amendment here the formula set out in the Schedule to the 1925 Local Government Act for the appointment of boards of health.  That was the formula I had in mind.  In the first instance, each electoral area elected one representative and then these formed into groups and elected the balance.  It was an involved formula but it worked out quite satisfactorily and gave representation to any group that had three or four members on the council on the board of health.  That is the formula I had in mind to incorporate into this and to put it before the House.  But many members might not understand it, members who had not been members of boards of health, and we might have discussed it for a long time here before everybody could be got to understand it.  That is why I put down the formula of proportional representation by nontransferable vote.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Sheldon that, under the formula I have here, it probably would not give a representative to every district of the same number.  It is possible to get them but it could happen that they would not get them.  The &ldquo;nontransferable&rdquo; is the most simple type of proportional representation, according to anything I have read about it. That is why I mentioned &ldquo;nontransferable.&rdquo; However, that does not arise.  It is the principle that I want to embody in this Bill, if possible.  The Minister has suggested that it is always feasible for any council, when setting up these committees, to adopt proportional representation, if they so desire. If there is a majority of one particular group on a council, and they want to fill the committees with their own nominees, they will not adopt it.</P>
      <P>Once, on my own council, I tried myself but they refused to adopt it.  I have in mind all the different committees&mdash;committees of agriculture, mental hospital committees, and so forth&mdash;and I believe some form of proportional representation should be in operation.  If you have that system you will get the best type of committee and you will have less friction on the council.  If the Minister will give an undertaking that he will consider this matter further and, if possible, provide some formula in that connection, I shall be satisfied and I shall withdraw this amendment now.  If he comes back later and says that he cannot do as I request then I can put down an amendment on the Report Stage.  Will the Minister agree to consider it?</P>

      <P>The idea behind the amendment is that it is only after an election of councillors that you will elect the finance committee and not, say, next week when this Bill becomes law, just on the eve of an election.  In my view, when you select a finance committee after an election the same committee should be left there during the lifetime of the council.  It will take probably six to 12 months to train the members of the committee.  There may be new men coming on that committee and it may even be a couple of years before they are fully efficient members of it.  In the Bill, the Minister proposes to have an election of a committee immediately after this Bill becomes law and to have another finance committee elected after the coming election.  I want a finance committee elected only after each local election.</P>

Let me now refer back to sub-section (1).  It is as follows:</P>

Why should I dictate to the local authority as to when they <Col N="1112" /> should elect their estimates committee? There is the law.  You have the appointment of it as often as you want to.

      <P>Under this Bill, the estimates committees will be appointed by the local authority.  For that reason, as well as for many other reasons, it is undesirable that one committee should remain in power for the entire duration of the term of office of the local authority.  I can easily visualise a situation where a committee composed of certain members would not be acting in the best interests of the elected representatives as a whole and such a situation might only be discovered after the election of the committee. It would be well if it were laid down in the Bill that, each year, the committee would be elected at the annual meeting.  Then there would be no doubt whatsoever about the position. It is quite possible that, because the Minister is leaving the matter subject <Col N="1114" /> to sub-section (2)&mdash;&ldquo;A local authority may by resolution revoke the appointment of an estimates committee&rdquo;&mdash;some councils may not decide to have the annual meeting and may learn later that they have not gone the right way about it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>As the section stands, they can revoke the authority of the estimates committee one week after the appointment but, as the Deputy wants it, they must remain in office for 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I am not asking for the deletion of sub-section (2). They still will have power to revoke but I am asking the Minister to make certain that it must happen each year and leave the power to revoke as well. They can revoke the committee the next day, if they wish, under sub-section (2).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely it would be superfluous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing superfluous in that, in so far as the Minister states that it might be found necessary after a few months to revoke the committee, but it should be statutory that the committee would be formed each year at the annual meeting of the council and thereby give an opportunity for rotation of members to serve on that committee, to make better appointments, to fill gaps, to get the best type of worker.  There may be people who will not pull their weight.  There may be a committee who will not act in the best interests of the council, in the opinion of the council as a whole and, instead of some person at some particular stage in the life of the council stating that he is not satisfied with the work of the committee and thereby casting a reflection on it, the annual meeting would give a quiet opportunity to re-elect the committee without giving offence to anybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, it will afford an opportunity to other members to serve on the committee and thereby gain the experience which they are entitled to have because, in my opinion, that committee is the council.  The functions and powers which, under this <Col N="1115" /> Bill, are vested in that estimates committee mean that virtually they are the local authority and, for that reason, it is important that there should be rotation of membership and that a provision for annual re-election should be inserted in the Bill and that it should not be left to the rather vague sub-section (2).</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">

      <P>I can easily visualise a position where the estimates committee would be elected on the formation of the new council and all the executive work of the council will revolve around that committee. The people who are not on the committee will be put in the position of blaming those who are on the estimates committee for any ill-effects that accrue from their working over a period and those on the committee will be put in the position of defending themselves and you will have two sections in the council, one an executive council and the other acting only in an advisory capacity.  That position should not be allowed to obtain longer than one year.  Any member who has had experience of the committee may decide to resign from it and any member whom the council consider should be elected to the committee should be afforded the chance of being elected. All that could be done at the annual meeting.</P>

      <P>I am not satisfied that sub-section (2) is definite enough in that respect.  The Minister states that councils may take it on themselves at the outset by resolution to revoke the committee each year, to have annual re-election of the committee, but I doubt if the section referred to explicitly gives that power to the council.  That clause is absolutely essential, I agree, in so far as certain councils may at times find it necessary to revoke a committee&mdash;it might be found that the committee was not working to their satisfaction.</P>
      <P>It should be made absolutely compulsory that the council would re-elect the committee each year and thereby prevent a situation arising where a certain section might hold on to the most important committee of the council, a committee which, from my reading of the Bill, is virtually the executive committee of the local authority and which will have all the powers that the local authority has and can make the council, irrespective of the other elected representatives on it, a good working council or otherwise. For that reason it is important that they should not be allowed to cling to that committee for the entire life of the council.</P>

      <P>I must say that I profoundly disagree with Deputy Brennan. Deputy Brennan wants to impose on every local authority his views.  If Deputy Brennan is re-elected, as I hope he will be, to the Donegal County Council, it is open to him, under the Bill as it stands, before the council elects the estimates committee, to say, &ldquo;I want to warn you that every year I shall move to revoke this committee. You are not going to be there for five years,&rdquo; but, if the county councillors of another county are quite willing&mdash; Deputy Allen has already indicated that he thinks the estimates committee should last as long as possible&mdash;why should they be put to the farce, as it very often is&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>I see the Deputy's point of view.  There is something to be said for it but I think it is unnecessary. He himself suggested that the only reason he is suggesting why the committee should be turfed out is that they are up to something or that some members are not pulling their weight. If a situation like that arose, it would be much better honestly to get up at the council and move to revoke the committee because it was not carrying out its functions rather than pretend that everything was all right but knock them out at the next election. I do not think that is fair.  It would be much better to get up and say openly to the council: &ldquo;This committee are not doing what they should do and for that reason I think it ought to be replaced.&rdquo; I do not see any reason why it should not be done in that way.  It would be much better.  These things should be made known to the public. If they have elected people who were bad, the sooner they find out the better.  There does not seem to me to be any great argument there.</P>
      <P>As to the annual election of an estimates committee rather than allowing it to last for several years, there are two points of view.  I admit that if there is annual election, it is possible, if they are doing their work well, just to re-elect them, but I think the way it is in the Bill, that they are appointed and each council can decide for itself how long it wants the estimates committee to last rather than that they should be forced to re-elect every year, would provide the better system.  There need be no bad odour attached to revoking the appointment of the estimates committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there are members of any particular county council who feel that the committee should be annual, it is quite open to them after the election at the first meeting of the county council to say: &ldquo;My view is that a committee of this kind should be an annual committee. I want to warn everybody now, that I will move to revoke at the end of the year and my proposed revocation does not necessarily cast <Col N="1118" /> any slur on the members of the committee; it is merely because I think this should be an annual committee&rdquo;.  If any county council does not want to do it that way, I do not see why they should be made to do it annually.  I think the Bill as it stands with the two methods open to every county council is preferable to all county councils being forced to adopt Deputy Brennan's point of view.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Sheldon does not foresee, as I do, the situation that would arise immediately after an election in which a particular political group may appoint a committee composed entirely of their Party.  Possibly the situation might change the year after.  As I said, this is an important committee and all the powers of this Bill really centre round it.  Deputy Sheldon states there is nothing to stop some member putting a proposal that the committee be revoked each year. There is nothing to prevent any member proposing a direct negative to that and, by means of the same majority which selected the committee and brought it into being in the first instance, rejecting the proposal that the committee be revoked and reconstituted annually.</P>
      <P>All the powers of the council will be focussed in this committee and I can foresee the members of a political Party wielding their power as a Party throughout the entire lifetime of the committee and negativing all proposals to revoke it.  That means that the committee will remain in power, despite sub-section (2), for the entire life of the council.</P>

      <P>The Minister and some of the members were inclined to come in here during discussion on the last few amendments and say that after an election the blood of local authority members would be more or less at boiling point.  It seems to me now, from the attitude and the expressions of some of the Deputies, that the very fact of our moving for a division <Col N="1122" /> on the section has brought about the danger of their blood coming to freezing point at the thought of their losing another one of the plums that they are trying to persuade the Minister to give to the local authorities.  A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I should like some guidance which might save a lot of repetition in this debate.  As Sections 7, 8 and 9 are directly related and as there are no amendments to either Sections 8 or 9, could I at this stage include the three?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I was only looking for guidance in order to save repetition. As regards the section, it states that a local authority shall, by resolution, appoint a committee.  Deputy Allen, and he is justified, tends to approach this section from the point of view of his own experience in his own county.  So does Deputy Brennan, so does Deputy Sheldon and so do I. I think I am entitled to draw attention to the position as I see it.  We are asked to set up this committee and in Cork alone, where there are seven distinct areas, it would mean this committee would have 14 members. In Cork this year the estimate was for over £4,000,000 and are any of the financial geniuses who are so enamoured with the idea of this committee going to tell us here that a financial committee of 14 members in County Cork can go through the accounts of the Board of Health, the Board of Assistance, the Mental Hospital Board and of the county council itself with its engineering sections and so forth, and are they going to be expected to give the returns which they are supposed to give?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is this committee supposed to be?  According to what the section tells us they are supposed to give the financial position of the local authority in such detail and at such intervals as the local authority may, by resolution, direct.  Therefore, if the Cork County Council decided that the committee should give a financial statement as to its incomings and outgoings for every month of the 12 months, these 14 financial geniuses are <Col N="1123" /> supposed to trump up a statement in front of them and tell them the exact position and we all know that the figures in such cases must be good to satisfy some of the astute members of the county council.  The 14 warriors will have to go and study all these figures.</P>

      <P>If Deputy Brennan wants to pontificate on this let him study the section and he will see that it says that irrespective of the officials, of the manager himself and of the solicitor, the committee must go through the figures.  I believe there will be very few sincere members anxious to go on these committees. The wall-flowers&mdash;the members who never open their lips on a constructive issue that may come before the council &mdash;are the boys who will be anxious to be put on these committees, and in a county where the annual estimate is something in the region of £4,000,000, I can see these 14 warriors drawing in twice a week, every week of the year, and I can see some of them travelling as far as 60 and 70 and 80 miles to do that.</P>
      <P>What are they going to do?  Surely every member knows here in his heart that there must be some way of checking the accounts of the county council; surely we all know that anybody purporting to do what this committee will be asked to do must have some small knowledge of accountancy.  What would Deputy Brennan or Deputy Allen or myself do if we went into a council office once or twice a week for an hour or two each day?  We might have a pet subject of our own and maybe we would have some knowledge of expenditure dealing with our own locality, but that will not help us to get at the root of the problem of the finances of the council for the whole 12 months. The members of the council are entitled to put queries to us on all the problems that we are supposed to have examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this section were not included in the Bill at all, it still does not prevent a county council from setting up an estimates committee to go into the <Col N="1124" /> estimates for a couple of weeks once a year with the manager and his officials, but the very wording of the section&mdash;&mdash;it says this committee shall be appointed&mdash;imposes on the council the duty of appointing this committee. It imposes on the Cork County Council and on the other county councils throughout the country the duty of setting up a committee which may sit one or two days every week of the year. That is why we consider that it would be fantastic to place such a responsibility on the councils.</P>
    <P>I would go so far as to say that if the councils were free in the matter and if it were optional and that if the Cork County Council had an option in the matter, irrespective of Party interests, when they reasoned the proposition out and when they looked about them to find 14 financial warriors, their tendency would be to bypass this committee and to decide not to pay expenses to these fellows for coming in and signing their names on a roll book.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I read this section originally in the Bill and at that stage I was personally rather enamoured with it.  I felt that it was a proper provision to have in the Bill.  However, we can all learn.  I have learned in recent weeks as a result of further reading and I have changed my opinion.  I would now urge upon the Minister to consider whether this section is desirable.  When I say I have learned, I should like to mention that there is another Deputy in the House at the present moment&mdash;I do not know whether he will agree with me&mdash;who has had the same experience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am a member of a local authority and in order to examine the expenses and the income of that authority, certain decisions were made last year. One of the decisions was to have the estimated expenditure and income for the forthcoming year examined on a departmental basis by the financial committee.  Subsequently the result of their examination came before the council.  Many of us attended various departmental committee meetings and, on the facts and figures presented to us, we did very little.  We noted that it was proposed to spend a certain <Col N="1125" /> amount under a large number of different headings.</P>
    <P>We noticed that certain sums of money would be required to provide certain services.  We noticed that under certain headings economies might be made but we did not do anything about it.  We examined the situation and we passed on after spending, I think, under one departmental heading, that of housing, a total of at least eight hours' examination.  After examining this particular estimate we then went through the finance committee but there we were meeting in the full glare of publicity.  We proceeded to do there what we could have done in committee.  We proceeded to reexamine the estimates which already had been examined and had not been interfered with.  But on this occasion it proposed alterations in the estimates.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I regretfully reached this conclusion that, aside from every other fact, if an estimates committee as such is appointed by any local authority they can spend hours and hours examining the estimates and examining the general position each year to see whether expenditure under all headings was justified, to see whether there was any possibility of economies, but when the report would then go to the council the situation would be re-examined and the members of the estimates committee might well find that after spending hours conscientiously trying to carry out the duties of membership of the estimates committee, the members in full council were going to decide&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is only a few minutes.  I have learned something in recent weeks.  I was not aware of this particular peculiarity previously; I was innocent you might say and I honestly <Col N="1126" /> considered when I read the section of the Bill that it would be a good section, that it would be a useful and a wise section.  But I had the experience, like some of my colleagues, of going at least on two afternoons and spending hours examining an estimate in detail, doing nothing about it and two weeks later going in together with the same colleagues and doing a lot about it.  I am afraid the reason why action was not taken in the first instance is because each and every member was of the opinion that the estimates of expenditure and income were going to be subject to further examination, that that further examination would be a public examination and consequently if there was any value to be obtained by proposing alterations in the estimates it was better to defer action until the value could be obtained by proposing the alterations in the glare of publicity.</P>

      <P>This section is a section to which I referred when speaking on the Second Reading of this measure. Frankly I cannot understand the attitude of some members, even of my own Party; not that they were enthusiastic about it but that they did not seem to see in it the futility that I saw there.  I was even trying to look around in my mind for some justification for its being there at all.  I cannot understand the officials of the Department, the Minister and the <Col N="1127" /> draftsman making themselves responsible for a section like this and the only excuse I could think of was this amending Bill was going to be a bare kind of an affair.</P>
      <P>I had the responsibility of preparing another more or less similar Bill and I thought it was a very skimpy looking article entirely and when I threw my mind back on the talk we had been listening to I was almost ashamed of coming to the House with an instrument that was so delicate.  Then I said: &ldquo;My successor must have felt just like me&rdquo; and with the assistance of his officers he said: &ldquo;We will get a section like this that appears to throw on a cloak of responsibility on proposals that were already there.&rdquo;  The cloak is, as I tried to explain on the Second Reading, that a finance committee is to be set up and what you never heard of before in relation to any business concern&mdash;and I take it the work of a county council is as much a business matter as that of any commercial organisation&mdash;you placed upon this finance committee responsibility for the preparation of the estimates moryah in consultation with the manager.</P>

      <P>Just think of bringing together an estimates committee to sit down with the manager, wading through the different provisions that have to be made and making themselves responsible for the sheaf of estimates prepared, making themselves by their presence responsible for these estimates before their colleagues and the public!  Even looking at it from the point of view of business, it is not done in any other commercial concern. Surely as I said on the Second Reading, it is the duty, the function of the manager or if not, it should be, because it is really the most important function that the manager of any concern must have, the preparation of the annual estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1128" /> I do not disagree with the setting up of an estimates committee by a local body because estimates committees have been set up for far longer than I can remember.  Some local authorities do it still without any compulsion of any kind.  Some of them do not do it and those who do not set up those committees do not set them up for some of the reasons that have been given by Deputy Larkin.  What does this section boil down to?  An estimates committee to prepare the estimates, and after all the rigmarole as to how this is to be done, if they do not do it the manager will do it, and those who drafted that section know as well as I do that it is the manager who will do it and who should do it.  When the manager has done his work, it is a matter entirely for the county council to set up its estimates committee to examine the estimates if it so desires.</P>
    <P>I was a member of a local body and we had no estimates committee at all, and I will repeat here the reasons why we had none.  There are not, I suppose, a half-dozen experienced people in this House who do not realise that, not only in the area of which I can speak with some experience, but it also happens in every area where a local authority functions, that if you have a local authority composed of 20 members and you appoint seven as an estimates committee they spend a week, a fortnight, or a month as conscientiously as ever men did in examining the proposals that are submitted by the manager and his staff as to the amount of money they want for hospitals, roads, water, sewerage, housing, home assistance and so on.</P>
    <P>They conscientiously sit themselves down for whatever time is necessary to examine in the most thorough way these proposals for local taxation and when they come back with the agreed recommendations to the whole body, is it suggested that the other 14 members of the council which elected them will accept the recommendations of these seven men?  Not at all.  They will have to get every one of the reasons that were given to the seven. They will have to get these stated by the manager or the secretary of the council or by some official of the <Col N="1129" /> council and there will have to be a public discussion and this will all be done in the full knowledge that the rate will have to be struck and that they are dealing with a public which has its eyes on them at this particular time.  They know that to whatever extent they are anxious to remain in public life they depend on public goodwill and they know that the public does not take kindly to having taxation unnecessarily imposed on them, be it local or not.</P>
    <P>Do they not know that in all this public discussion even the members of the estimates committee, if they hold themselves hard and fast through proposals that may afterwards be altered by the whole council, are exposing themselves to general criticism inasmuch as the electors will say: &ldquo;If that committee or the members of it were to have their way we would have to pay higher rates&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>I do not want to be unduly critical of my successor.  I do not want to attribute any ulterior motive to him.  It is not a very serious one even if I did do it in this case, but I repeat my argument now because I find I have support from parts of this House where apparently the implications of this section were not detected at the time of the Second Reading.  I could not understand why when the Second Reading went through, nobody seemed to take any notice of them, whereas it is clear that this section is completely window-dressing, just a massive effort to give this Bill a sort of respectable appearance.  I am not saying that the Bill itself without this would not be a very useful piece of legislation and effect useful changes in the managerial system, but how on earth anybody came to think that this sort of section should be thrown into a measure like this I cannot understand.  It never made sense to me and never can make sense.  I believe that I would not make it a statutory matter by saying to a council: &ldquo;You must have an estimates committee to examine the proposals of the manager,&rdquo; but here you have an actual proposal that they prepare the estimates.</P>
    <P>I do not want to continue in my enthusiasm&mdash;not <Col N="1130" /> for the section&mdash;in my desire to pour ridicule on it because, as I have tried to say, I do not think if the Minister had some association during his period of public life with a county council or local body he would come into this House and take responsibility for a section like this&mdash;not that it is very harmful but because it is so absurd.  I would not like to be associated with it or made responsible for it.</P>

      <P>Deputy Smith endeavoured to amend the County Management Act.  He introduced a Bill here some 12 months ago and I accepted every section in Deputy Smith's Bill and incorporated them into the present Bill, but I added to it Sections 2 and 4 and I added this section under discussion at the moment.  We are discussing a Bill here for the past ten hours and during the greater part of that time Deputy Brennan has been the spokesman of the Opposition, and in the presence of Deputy Smith not more than one hour ago he said that this section was the most important section in the Bill.  He said it was the main section in the Bill.</P>
      <P>Deputy Brennan has considerable experience of local affairs and has served on an estimates committee.  He is a man who appreciates the importance of the section.  On the other hand, I do not blame Deputy Smith for getting up and criticising me for introducing this section which his own spokesman said was a most important section, despite the fact that there is incorporated in the Bill every section he had in his own Bill.  Deputy Smith said that I would never dream of introducing it.  I want to put this on the record.  I was solicitor to a local authority for a period of 20 years, and I think I can claim to be familiar with the procedure adopted at local authority meetings.</P>

      <P>May I repeat what I said on the Second Reading Stage of this Bill?  In the Dáil reports, column 705, 23rd February, 1954, I said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Criticism has been made here of the proposed estimates committee. I found that one of the complaints which I received was that local authorities were ignorant of the financial matters of their councils during the year.  They knew nothing about the finances until the estimates were produced by the county manager at the end of the year.  This section will enable local authorities to keep in touch during the entire year with the financial position of their councils.  It is ridiculous to suggest that under the section the estimates committee will be required to sit down and prepare the estimates. They will do no such thing any more than a Minister prepares the Estimates which he presents to this House.  The estimates committee will have the assistance of the manager, the secretary, the accountant and all the clerical staff of the local authority.  They will have that assistance just as a Minister has the assistance of the Civil Service in preparing Estimates.  They will <Col N="1132" /> require to meet no more than they are meeting at present in some of these financial committees to which references have been made in this House.  The estimates committee is being set up to give the local authority an opportunity of keeping in touch with the financial situation of the council during the financial year.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>One of the complaints which I received from local authorities was this: &ldquo;We know nothing whatever about the finances of the council until the annual estimate meeting when the county manager comes along and presents his estimates.  But things have happened possibly nine or ten months ago in regard to expenditure.  We know nothing about them.  We might have discovered them at the time in the orders of the county manager, but he only gives us information about matters on which he wishes to give us information.&rdquo;  My idea in setting up this committee was to enable the councillors to keep in continuous touch with the finances of their own council.  They could meet once a month, they can demand the accounts of the council and keep in touch with its finances.  Most Deputies here told us that in actual practice that was what was happening in their councils. But unfortunately there was no statutory power for the establishment of an estimates committee.</P>
    <P>I was very impressed by what Deputy Desmond said with regard to Sections 7, 8 and 9.  I am prepared, between now and the Report Stage, to consider making these sections optional.  I am prepared to consider that, and if it is possible at all, I will make them optional for local authorities.  That should meet any criticism that has risen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the position was clarified for most Deputies here when the Minister suggested that he would consider making it optional with regard to the appointment of these finance committees.  I was rather interested to hear the Minister say that, when he met members of local authorities throughout the country, one of their complaints was that they did not know what was happening until <Col N="1133" /> after the event took place.  I was interested to hear that the Minister desires to keep them in touch with financial matters.  If this finance committee is going to work as the Minister envisages, and will keep councils in touch with the spending, and give them, shall we say, the means of halting the county manager in the spending, then it is necessary for this committee to meet, not once a month, but daily, in order to carry out the idea the Minister has in mind.</P>
      <P>When this Bill was going through the House on the Second Stage I made one criticism in connection with this section in a very brief contribution, because this section is the heart of the matter.  I think the idea of this Bill is to give local authorities more power. This section gives more responsibility to the local authority, but gives them no more power.  Up to this the position that had arisen was that county managers would present estimates to the county councils, and naturally the position with each member of the local authority was that he criticised any abuse that might be envisaged in the estimates.  The county manager became an annual cockshot at the estimates meeting.  This move by the Minister is a shrewd one.  Local councils can no longer shelter behind the county manager's back&mdash;I was going to say skirts, because that would be the operative word.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the same thing. Under the section in connection with the finance committee the Minister is putting to the councils his ideas: &ldquo;You are going to have a part in the preparation of the estimates, and it will be no longer possible, at the end of the year, to suggest that the local authority had not a certain amount of responsibility for the coming estimates.&rdquo; That may be desirable.  It may help to cut out in future a lot of this unfounded criticism of the Managerial Act as such.  I do not like the idea put across in this House that this is restoring power to the local authority.  It is not.  It is giving them <Col N="1134" /> more responsibility for spending during the year.</P>

      <P>It is not making the position any easier for the rest of the councillors who are not members of the finance committee.  They have to turn to the finance committee when they could have got this information, possibly, directly from the county manager if he was a reasonable man.</P>
      <P>I was not here for some of the other contributions and what I am saying may have already been said, but, in case it has not, I should like to say that where a committee is set up&mdash;a committee of a council or any other committee&mdash;if it is to function in a business-like way, it is necessary that the meetings be held in private.  If the meeting is held in public, there will be a discussion at that meeting which will be repeated at the later meeting of the entire body and all you are going to do is double the amount of time being taken up with council work, without bringing about any more efficiency. The only committee that I should like to see set up in connection with a local authority is a committee composed of all the members of the council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let all the members of the local authority be present.  If the Minister <Col N="1135" /> is anxious to set up such a committee, let it be optional in that respect and let it also be optional, so far as the setting up of the committee is concerned. Let each local authority set up a finance committee, if it so desires.  Evidently, in the beginning, it was considered a matter of great importance by the Minister to make the setting up of this committee mandatory.</P>

      <P>It is quite correct, as the Minister said, that many members down the country were claiming that they wanted certain knowledge and I believe that the Minister, in providing Section 4, is putting these members in a position to secure that information. There is no need for me to say any more.  If Deputy Allen or Deputy Brennan or a majority of their respective councils, wished to set up this committee in their counties and if they were really interested in local government, I believe it would not be right for us to deny them the right to <Col N="1136" /> do so.  I am quite satisfied if the Minister is prepared to make this section optional.  In a true spirit of local government, we can then approach the problem and I know how we will approach it in our county.  I am prepared to withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>I have a different mind on this from most members of my council.  The Minister was not even correct when he spoke about a majority of the council.  I am speaking from experience, because, within the past seven months, I proposed that a finance committee of the Cork County Council be set up and I was seconded by a Labour Deputy, Deputy McAuliffe.  The chairman called on the advice of the legal adviser who told me it would be illegal to set it up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give one instance of the manner in which estimates are brought up.  I saw an important estimate discussed recently, and, as a kind of experiment, I moved that the estimate be cut by £30,000 in one item alone.  Another member proposed that it be cut by £20,000, and the assistant county manager accepted it.  If neither of us had said anything a sum of £20,000 would have been paid by the ratepayers for fun.  These are facts that can be borne out.  That is the manner in which estimates are presented. I can take my mind back a long way.  The first training I got in local government as such was on a <Col N="1137" /> finance committee of the Cork County Council, and it was a good training, a training which saved the ratepayers many thousands of pounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is too thick to understand.  That committee was able to carry on, was able to examine figures and ascertain exactly what was happening, and it was not necessary for them to meet every day to do it. We found one meeting a fortnight for the first 12 months sufficient and afterwards one meeting a month as soon as we had things cleared up.  That committee was appointed after each election in the Cork County Council until the Management Bill came in, and it functioned well, saving the ratepayers a large sum of money.</P>
      <P>The most amazing thing I have seen here is that the people who were growling about the Management Act are the people who want to leave everything as it is.  Not alone would I suggest that the county council should have the power to set up such a committee, but I suggest that the power should also be given to the other autonomous boards in a county.  I would suggest further that, if they wished, that finance committee should consist of all the members of the council and that they should set aside a finance day on which all the members of the council would consider financial business.</P>
      <P>One thing on which I do not agree with the Minister is this basis of two representatives from each area.  Each county councillor is elected by a certain body of ratepayers to represent their views and, instead of committees of eight, ten or 12 representatives, I would have the full council as this finance committee and then nobody could say afterwards that these four or five did it.  We know that every estimate brought before a county council, a board of assistance or any other body at present is a padded estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the members of the council are not cute enough to cut enough off they have an excuse for spending more.  I even saw a board of assistance having <Col N="1138" /> credit of £55,000 at the end of the year, a sum which should be in the ratepayers' pockets but the fact that the £55,000 was there as a credit balance left after the year was a temptation to spend more.  After all, we got the money off them and we might as well spend it.</P>
    <P>I am in favour of a finance committee&mdash;absolutely in favour of it, but I would suggest that if the Minister is going to leave it optional for the council to set up a finance committee or not we should also leave it optional for the council to have that finance committee composed of all the members of the council or whatever number they consider right.  Why pick out of every electoral area two cockshots?  If they do not turn up, all the better.  If I had my way I would have one special day at least every month set aside on which the council would resolve itself into a finance committee and go into the finances of the council.</P>
    <P>In my opinion, it would be worth it and it would save them a lot of money. I served on one from 1925 until the County Management Act deprived me of the power of being on it.  I do not think the finances of any local authority have improved by getting rid of the finance committee and leaving the whole thing in the hands of officials.  If we are going to have a country run by officials for officials, well then let us do it openly and get rid of the elected representatives.  If we get rid of the elected representatives at all, let us get rid of them in the Dáil as well as in the county council.</P>

They now uphold the right of the elected representatives of the people to have a direct say in local government affairs. If that contention were honest, I would be entirely in agreement with them but these people were in office for 19 years and they were the people who withdrew the powers from the elected representatives of the people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already stated that it makes little difference because the Minister is in agreement with the viewpoint of the Fianna Fáil Party in withholding any worthwhile powers from the elected representatives of local authorities.  It is quite in order, in spite of what the previous speaker stated, for a county council to set up any sub-committee.  They could set up a committee dealing with the estimates just as well as they set up special committees to deal with housing, health, roads or any other matter. We have all these committees in Cork.</P>
      <P>This section does not give us any extra powers because we are fully entitled to question any expenditure the council makes at any time.  If wanton expenditure has taken place in any county heretofore I believe the fault lay with the members of that particular body for not questioning that particular type of expenditure.</P>
      <P>This Bill is, as I stated here on a number of occasions during the discussion on it, a worthless measure or very nearly so.  This so-called estimates committee that we are now giving power to set up is of no value because we had power to set up such a committee before.

      <P>I believe that any estimates committee or finance committee set up by a local authority should comprise the whole council. That is one point on which I agree with Deputy Corry, even though he does not make many worthwhile suggestions. I do not agree that such a committee should comprise one-third or one fourth of the members.  If it is dealing with financial matters it should comprise the whole council&mdash;let it meet once monthly, once quarterly or half-yearly as may be required to deal with the business.  This discussion is completely worthless so far as local authorities and the elected representatives on them are concerned.  It gives them no power&mdash;good, bad or <Col N="1143" /> indifferent&mdash;that they have not got already.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am rather amused at the manner in which this Section 7 is approached by various speakers.  I am sorry Deputy Larkin is not here.  We do not require this particular Section 7 in the City of Dublin, because so long as we have the managerial system&mdash;and it is subscribed to by the majority of the House, otherwise it would cease to exist&mdash;the manager must function in a certain way.  Now, some of us have a great deal of experience of the financial side of a local authority.  The manager is bound to be responsible for the &ldquo;essential services&rdquo; and the maintenance of them.  He is not responsible for what one might call &ldquo;policy spending&rdquo;.  If a committee of the Dublin Corporation or of a local authority decides to spend more money on additional services&mdash;not, in the opinion of the manager, &ldquo;essential services&rdquo; but within the rights of the elected representatives to create and make provision for&mdash;and if that decision comes before the council and the council as a whole adopts it, then the council is responsible for it and not the manager.</P>
      <P>Over and above these two different types of expenditure, one has to make provision for expenditure of what is called the &ldquo;statutory demand&rdquo; type. Deputy Larkin apparently admits he has learned a little in the last two weeks, but I would suggest that a little learning is sometimes dangerous.  Consequently, I take it he made his intervention, having that little knowledge and that little knowledge being dangerous.  The procedure introduced by the local authority this year to which he referred was quite simple. Previously the finance committee held a couple of meetings before the adoption of a rate.  They attempted in maybe two sittings to plough through every item of all the different sections of the estimates and every member complained that they did not know as much about the financial spending side as they should.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year I introduced a new method. I suggested that each committee should, towards the end of the year, <Col N="1144" /> have its own meeting to examine its own estimate and that they should satisfy themselves that they wished that figure to go forward&mdash;consisting, as I said, of the estimate of the manager under various sub-heads for &ldquo;essential services&rdquo; with, in addition, whatever they decided on on the policy side by a majority and having had sanction from the council for it over and above any demand from the city manager.  It was agreed that then the chairman and vice-chairman of each such committee would meet together to get a full picture of the total required.</P>
    <P>What Deputy Larkin has confused here to-night is this.  He refers to the housing committee having its two-day session and going through its break-down of all the figures making up the total estimate.  There was nobody there to reduce the expenditure, or at least those who were most vocal against reducing it did not realise that when the full total of all the different sections would come to be examined, some section would have to forgo some of the expenditure which the council themselves were responsible for.  They could not be responsible for and could not reduce the bare minimum required by the city manager for &ldquo;essential services&rdquo;.</P>

Each little section&mdash;from the lowest members up to the senior members and the head officials of the section&mdash;must come to the city manager and give a statement of their requirements; and for that <Col N="1145" /> type of expenditure the city manager is fully responsible and must be held responsible.</P>

      <P>Deputy Desmond always intervenes to the effect that no one can speak on anything unless he has put an amendment down to it.  I wonder would the Deputy like to be paid back in the same coin?  He always speaks to amendments to sections to which he had no amendments. I am trying to make it clear that when you come to a meeting of the local authority to examine the expenditure, the elected representatives can only cut down on matters for which they are themselves responsible. There is no sense in suggesting that even if this is made optional it will have any effect because the areas that will not adopt it will be in no worse or better position than they are to-day. The county councils who may adopt it under the optional section will find themselves, as Deputy Smith has remarked, in the position that they can prepare estimates but that the manager can reject them.  They can refuse to make estimates and the manager can himself prepare them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, I think the Minister would be well advised to remove Section 7 from the Bill rather than <Col N="1146" /> make it optional.  The position as it exists to-day from a finance committee point of view is that it has all the details and powers it requires.  There is a big difference between a finance committee and an estimates committee. I agree with Deputy Smith that it is the manager who prepares the estimates, in the main; he prepares the vast bulk of them, together with his requirements and Statute requirements.</P>

      <P>I am not at all against the present city and county management system.  I want to see certain powers restored to local representatives. I do not want to abolish the manager but I want to make him more responsible to them, as elected representatives, and less responsible to the Custom House.  That is the difference between what we are talking about.  There is no use in saying that a dictatorship introduced the managerial system.  If it is wrong, Deputy Murphy now has the means&mdash;as one of the majority that composes the Government&mdash;of abolishing city and county management.  He will not do that.  It is satisfactory for him to pretend that he is against it, that it is a horrible thing and that he blames Fianna Fáil for it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>He wants to have it six ways.  Deputy Smith made the position quite clear.  I am saying that a finance committee can get all the information it requires.  In the production of the estimates, it can get from the manager a break-down of every item.  What we want is that the manager should not have powers to take in additional staffs without consulting the local representatives, that he should not <Col N="1147" /> engage in this additional expense without their consent, but, once having got it, it is his business to prepare the estimate and it is nobody else's business.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister to consider whether making it optional meets the situation or whether, in fact, it does not make it more farcical.  I have yet to see an Act of Parliament which has been thought out for the welfare of the community and which says: &ldquo;This is what you will do but if you do not like it you need not do it.&rdquo;  This is the first time I have ever seen an attempt in legislation&mdash;not legislation mandatory, not legislation putting obligations on people or authorities&mdash;to say: &ldquo;You may do this if you like and if you do not like to do it you need not.&rdquo;  I repeat, why have such legislation?</P>
      <P>If the optional position is reached then I do not think, on examination and on getting to understand what it means, that any one of these sections will be adopted by a single county council.  If, by any chance, I am wrong in that and one or two do, then you will find they will change from the position after the experience of a year or two.  What does it mean?  Do the Deputies know what it means?  An estimates committee is not to be confused with a finance committee or the duties of a finance committee.  An estimates committee has the responsibility of framing estimates for the requirements of the coming year.  Having done that, how are they going to sit in judgment of themselves if they find that, in the preparation of certain estimates, the doing of a certain amount of work will have a very serious reaction on the rates?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present position is that the manager must be responsible for the preparation of the estimates.  In his estimates he must include charges that will come in course of payment in the following year for commitments which the elected representatives have, by way of policy, undertaken and he must make provision as best he can for the statutory requirements.  Then, having done that, a finance committee of the whole council can judge themselves whether they agree with his management <Col N="1148" /> or disagree with his management. They can judge whether they wish to alter decisions previously made by themselves for added expenditure or whether they want to make representations to the central Government to lighten the burden of statutory payments which fall on them by Acts of this Oireachtas.</P>

He should take the decision of the House on it.  If, on the other hand, he is so afraid of it or so doubtful about the section that he thinks it is good policy to say that each county council can opt as to whether they will apply it or not, when it has been pointed out to him here in sufficiently strong language that it cannot be implemented&mdash;it cannot be implemented&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am sorry.  If one feels very strongly about a matter one has to try to argue it from as many angles as possible, even if each argument amounts to the same thing. <Col N="1150" /> I am asking the Minister to take the line that, whoever was responsible for this idea, it does not fit in.  The manager should be responsible for the preparation of the estimates.  I agree with Deputy Desmond on that.  The local authority should be responsible for examining, scrutinising and adding to or taking from the estimates as they in their wisdom see fit.  There are certain things they cannot do. Improvement of local affairs will take place only by the restoration of power to the local representatives, power under which the manager will be responsible to them for his decisions and will seek sanction from the elected body in a particular situation.</P>
      <P>There is no use pretending that this particular section gives the local representative any additional power whatsoever, except an opportunity to make public confession that it is impossible for him or the local body as a whole to carry out this work because that is the work of officials.  It is the work of officials who are supposed to be there every day on the job. Take, for instance, the lighting section of Dublin Corporation.  The city engineer puts in an estimate of the cost. He says that there are so many lamps to be lit at £1 per lamp.  If there is electric lighting in the area represented by Deputy Murphy, are we to ask him to go around the area with his colleagues to count all the lamps and then come back to the estimates committee and say: &ldquo;We have so many thousand lamps to be lit.  Therefore, we will require so much money?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Is not that the responsibility of the officials?  Is it not a silly suggestion that the local representatives should go around and count the number of houses from which the corporation take ash-bins and the number of lamps we light and all the other details of the services given by the local authority? I hope the Minister will go a step further and will say, on reflection: &ldquo;I am prepared on Report Stage to remove Section 7.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I still say that it is the most important section in this Bill. I will go further and say that if the estimates committee visualised in that section were to attempt to exercise the powers conferred on them by the section they would usurp the entire powers of the local authority.  That is exactly what the position is.  In order to do that, they might have to meet three times a week.  I agree with Deputy Smith when he says that this section is put in for the purpose of leaving very important powers in the hands of the local authority in the knowledge that it is not a practicable section, that it is a section which they could never fully operate.  That is exactly what the section means.  I can visualise the situation where two members from two electoral areas, having power to keep continually in touch with the expenditure of money on the council&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can easily see an estimates committee, where two elected representatives from each electoral area were members of this committee. I have discussed this with people before now, as the Minister knows. They can easily scratch one another's backs.  Deputy Murphy can say: &ldquo;If you agree to the expenditure of the £30,000 on the water scheme in my electoral area, Deputy Corry, I will agree to an expenditure of £30,000 on a sewerage scheme in your area&rdquo;.  It is perfectly open to that.  In fact, the estimates committee can exercise complete control over where and how and when the resources of the local authority will be expended.  By every test, it is the most important section in the Bill but the Minister is careful to have a saving sub-section in which <Col N="1152" /> he says that if the estimates committee do not perform their duty, the manager will and the manager must.</P>
      <P>That is exactly what is likely to happen.  I can see councils trying to perform the duties and to exercise the powers conferred on them by that section. The Minister is now going to amend the section, to say that the council may appoint an estimates committee. As the Bill stands, he says the council &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  He now proposes to change the &ldquo;shall&rdquo; to &ldquo;may&rdquo;.  There will be councils who will try to appoint an estimates committee to carry out the powers conferred on them in that section and I am perfectly certain that I would not want to be a member of that estimates committee because if that committee tried to exercise the powers conferred on them by the section they would require to meet in the council office at least three times a week.</P>

    <P>I want to make one reference to Deputy Murphy's last statement with regard to this section and the Bill generally.  The Labour Party must be either one thing or the other in relation to this Bill.

Fianna Fáil has been blamed for the Managerial Act.  We have listened in the past to Opposition Parties telling <Col N="1153" /> us about the powers taken away from local authorities because of the dictatorial attitude of Fianna Fáil.</P>

He condemned the attitude of Fianna Fáil and he is obviously going to proceed in that attitude of blaming Fianna Fáil for the Managerial Act, I want to point out to Deputy Murphy that this Act was agreed to by his Government, a Government in which his Party has four Ministers, one of whom is an acting member of a local authority.  Nevertheless, he will now persist in going to the country and saying this Bill does not go far enough in amending the Managerial Act and that it is Fianna Fáil who are to blame for that.  The Deputy cannot have it both ways.  We must all agree that we have now reached a stage here where every Party is loud in its support of the managerial system.</P>

      <P>It is rather amusing to listen to a Deputy when he is under the Whip and compare that with his views when he is not under the Whip. Deputy Brennan came in here on the Second Stage and he made a very interesting contribution and one which, in my opinion, was an honest one.  Here are a few of the things he said on that occasion:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;There has been contention regarding the section which requires an estimates committee to be set up. Personally, I am not inclined to take the same view as some Deputies have expressed with regard to these powers.  I agree that it is not necessary to have the section worded as it is but I do not take the view that the estimates committee will have to get down to it with their coats off to prepare the estimates each year. They will use the council's staff to <Col N="1155" /> prepare the estimates, as has been done in the past, and will go into them to see where they can be curtailed or increased and their word will be the last word so far as the estimates are concerned.  That is my view about the estimates committee. At a glance one might think that it was imposing a burden on the committee which it would not be capable of performing and would not have the time to carry out.</P>
    <P>I may on Committee Stage ask the Minister to amend that section somewhat. I do not think it is right that an estimates committee should be formed on the formation of a new council and allowed to continue until the expiration of that council's life. The estimates committee should be appointed annually and should be constituted each year at the annual meeting so that membership of the committee would rotate and members would have a chance of serving on the estimates committee.  In that way all members of a local authority would have the experience of acting on the estimates committee.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am quoting from Volume 148, columns 394-395 of the Official Report. Now, there is an honest opinion given by Deputy Brennan.  He read the section. He discussed the estimates committee. He did not agree with the gentlemen who said one would have to spend all one's time on the estimates committee, and that it would have to meet every week.  He agreed the officials could do the work and that very good work could be done by the estimates committee.  He said he did not agree with the section and he would bring in an amendment.</P>
    <P>He did bring in an amendment&mdash;the only amendment he did bring in&mdash;not to delete the section, but to have the estimates committee appointed annually. He made a very fine speech to-day in support of the section&mdash;a convincing speech, so convincing that I interrupted him on at least ten occasions to say: &ldquo;Hear, hear!&rdquo;  But then the Whip came on.  Deputy Smith entered the House and set the headline, and Deputy Brennan had to follow suit.  The ex-Minister put the <Col N="1156" /> Whip on.  Did anyone ever see such a complete switch over?  I understand there is a road in Cork&mdash;Deputy Corry knows it well&mdash;from Cork City to Cobh; a predecessor of mine in the Department of Local Government once described it as the &ldquo;politician's road&rdquo; because there were so many twists in it.  We have had a remarkable example of the &ldquo;politician's road&rdquo; this evening, one of the most remarkable I have ever come across for a long time, when my friend and colleague, Deputy Brennan, first gave his honest view&mdash; not only to-day, but also on the 16th February&mdash;and then, the Whip being put on and the spur dug in, he had to change course.</P>

      <P>The whole of this evening has been spent discussing amendments to Section 7.  Arguments have been advanced relative to the methods by which this committee should be elected, and all the rest of it.  The Minister, who first insisted on this, now comes along and talks of twists and turns on the road to Cobh. The Minister, first of all, approved of the special method by which the committee would be selected and he spent to my knowledge, from six o'clock this evening until ten minutes past ten on that.</P>

      <P>The Labour Deputies then said they did not want the section at all.  The Minister gave a look round; Deputy Smith got up, and then the Minister gives a complete twist and says: &ldquo;Let every council have it the way it wants it&rdquo;.  It is the worst commentary on legislation I have ever heard in my life&mdash;and in my time I have seen a lot of queer legislation. The Minister says: &ldquo;It is all right; do as you like lads&rdquo;.  He brings in this section and he counts heads and he knows he is gonged.  He says any council which does not want it can leave it.  It is the worst piece of legislation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I put down a motion in Cork County Council and Deputy Murphy opposed it, but as I said, I have every sympathy for his state at the time.  The law adviser stood up when queried by the chairman and said it was illegal for us to appoint a committee to go into the council's finances.  I want the Minister now to straighten out the twist.  I want to know from the Minister if this section leaves it optional for the council or whether it gives power to the council to appoint such a committee at all.</P>

I am trying to hold the Minister on the road he should go on.  In fact we are all anxious to do that because the less politics there are in local government affairs the better for everybody, particularly for the ratepayers.

      <P>It is a good bit of a change, but if we are all agreed I would be anxious that the Minister, in bringing in a Bill of this kind before the House, would endeavour to act in a non-political way.  I never heard of a Bill brought in and passed by the Dáil before which left it optional on any authority to do a certain thing for which provision was made in a Bill.  I have never seen a provision before which was passed by the House and which could be ignored or adopted by the local authorities.  What is the idea of leaving the local authorities in that position?</P>

I did not expect it from the Minister, I must say frankly.  I did not expect that the Minister would come along here after solemnly bringing in a Bill and after spending four hours this evening endeavouring to insist on the constitution of this committee and prepared to go into the Division Lobby on the manner in which this committee would be constituted, <Col N="1159" /> and then come along and say that any council could take it or leave it.</P>

      <P>I was very interested to hear the few reasoned arguments put up on this section, particularly by Deputy Joseph Brennan, and I have no doubt at all that he was very sincere when he tried to give his opinion as to the best way of setting up this committee.  I also heard Deputy Corry and a number of other Deputies, among whom was Deputy Allen, who is now not here, and now they suddenly turn round for a very obvious reason and say that the committee should not be set up at all but that the section should be thrown out of the Bill.  I believe they are right that the section should be thrown out of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Maybe when I am as long in the House as Deputy Corry I will take more definite steps than he did to have it thrown out.  I believe the Minister is going a long way towards meeting our wishes.  When he proposes to leave it optional I think he is already going a long way to meet the wishes of Deputies on the opposite benches.  I would like to point out this one fact which is apparently being overlooked.  Not one Labour Deputy spoke on the Opposition amendments because we believe they were a waste of time, and when we were speaking on our own amendments we were amazed to find such an interest being taken by people who did not seem to think it worth while to put down amendments themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Minister has agreed to change sub-section (1) from being mandatory to being optional.  I think a large part of the time of the House has been wasted in discussing this section.  It is completely futile to create this type of committee if that is going to be left optional, in view of the provisions of Sections 8, 9 and 10.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I said I would leave Sections 7, 8 and 9 optional, that I would consider that between now and the Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us get this clear. The law as it stands, as far as I know it and as far as the practice of county councils is concerned, is that if they wish they can have their committee, but every member of a local authority knows quite well that when they did, in fact, appoint committees to go into estimates, they discovered they had a rehash of the whole thing over again when the committee came back.  It did not save any time because the committee's recommendations would not be accepted.  Furthermore, there was strong objection taken by members of councils who did not happen to be on those committees to their duties being taken away from them and their being forced to accept the opinions of other people on the estimates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill and this particular section are supposed to be restoring power to <Col N="1162" /> local authorities but in fact this section proposes to take away the powers of a council and concentrate them in a committee.  The thing is unworkable as I believe the Minister well knows. I was rather amused to hear the Minister belabour his colleague, Deputy J. Brennan, about the Whip being put on Deputy Brennan who, the Minister alleged, had changed his mind as between what he had stated earlier on this section and what he stated later.  I think it is fairly clear to the House and the country that the whip was put on the Minister by the Labour Party to produce this document we have before us and no man in Ireland except the Minister could have done it so adroitly.  He brings in a section like this meaning nothing, purporting to confer powers that are already there, dressing them up in this long way in this section, saying that this is restoring power to local authorities, and, in the very same section, saying that if any local authority does not like to set up this committee, that local authority can do what they wish.</P>
    <P>The Minister may pretend there is something in this section but he knows himself he is purporting to give power that is already there.  He knows that this is not going to make one iota of difference to any local authority in Ireland.  He knows that the members of every local authority in Ireland will insist on having the few important days in the year on which they, as a whole body, go into every item of expenditure suggested by their officials, let it be the manager or any other official of the council, and they will endeavour to cut down their rate for the ensuing year.  Reading this at a first glance it would appear perhaps that something is being done but that, of course, is not the case.</P>
    <P>I do not accept what my colleague, Deputy Corry, says about the legal advisers in the local authority in Cork. Knowing the good Deputy Corry, I can quite visualise his bringing forward a motion down there purporting to be a motion to set up a committee but having a tail end to it that means something completely different.  I do not accept as correct the interpretation of the legal adviser as given in this House <Col N="1163" /> by Deputy Corry.  I am quite sure there is much more to it than Deputy Corry tells us here.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows and I think the members of local authorities know there is nothing in the world to prevent them from doing as they have done in a number of councils, that is, getting a committee of the councils to examine the estimates.  They discovered what I am telling the House, that it was a complete waste of time and that what was done in that committee would not be accepted by the majority of the council.  If the Minister made the decisions of the estimates committee statutory and binding on the council it might be said that there would be some time-saving in connection with the matter.  I cannot accept that either.  If this section went through, No. 1, I agree with the Deputies who say it would not be accepted by 99 per cent. of every local authority, and No. 2, if it did go through, it would be cutting across the principles the Minister asserts are written into this Bill, that is, it would take away the power of the local authority as a whole.</P>
    <P>As far as the Labour Deputies who <Col N="1164" /> have spoken on this matter are concerned if they say, as I heard at least two of them say, this section should not be there at all, the section should not be there.  Let us cut it out if we feel the section should not be there.  It is not long since we heard a lot of talk from platforms all over the country about savings in Government Departments and the tremendous whip-up there was going to be in every department of State.  Here is a method of saving and I seriously make this contribution to the saving of the national finances.  If the section is cut out there will be a saving of two pages in every statute that will be printed and in every copy of this Bill when it becomes law.  The time of the printers will be saved, it will take less binding, and so on.  Here is a method of saving, and it is as good a method as some of the methods I have heard suggested by the Opposition as to how they are going to bring down the cost of living and the cost of Government.  I move to report progress.</P>
