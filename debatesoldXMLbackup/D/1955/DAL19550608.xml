      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Blowick):</NameTxt>
      <P>During the debate on forestry yesterday evening the hint I gave the House about a Bill to assist the furtherance of forestry caused some comment.  I hope I shall not be blamed for anticipating the Bill when I give an explanation of some of the points that were raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Moylan seemed to be under the impression that the Bill was one to further the compulsory acquisition of land.  I want to clear the air on that point.  It is not my intention to bring in a Bill along such lines because we have under the 1946 Act all the <Col N="880" /> compulsory powers we want for that purpose.  I will say a word of explanation now about the Bill.  Many useful offers of land are held up and have been held up, some of them for years, owing to the fact that title to the land is not clear.  Naturally enough it is absolutely essential that the Minister for Lands should have full and clear title before operations are started.  Any Deputy can easily visualise the kind of situation that would arise if some person, or a number of persons, could walk in and claim a plantation four, five or ten years after it was planted.  That may seem a somewhat extravagant statement, but it is not beyond the bounds of possibility. It could happen.</P>
    <P>I could imagine people who have gone to the United States, to England or to some other country coming home and finding that a brother, or perhaps a sister, had sold portions of the holding to the Land Commission for forestry purposes.  He would immediately say that he had as much claim to that holding as the person who sold it.  A situation might arise in which the Department would find itself involved in a host of claims of that kind.  Such a situation would be a very messy one for any Government Department to permit to arise.  It is towards that end I propose to introduce the Bill.  I hope it is within the bounds of possibility for the draftsman to produce a bill which will give the Department a good title and at the same time give the person who is selling the land a reasonable measure of security without endangering in any way the claims of persons who may be abroad.</P>
    <P>That is what I have in mind.  I come from a county in which I think I am safe in saying title to 90 per cent. of the holdings is in a pretty bad way. That is holding up the acquisition of land for forestry purposes very, very seriously.  I want to make my intentions perfectly clear.  The Government has approved a Bill along the lines I have adumbrated.  Deputy McQuillan is anxious that the Bill should be introduced very shortly.  There will be no delay.  I am at least as anxious about this as any other Deputy, the reason <Col N="881" /> being that it is quite clear to everybody that the acquisition of land is the whole trouble in forestry.</P>
    <P>When the land is acquired, and it is only right here to give a pat on the back to the technical staff, the provision of young trees and the work of fencing is fairly easy.  It is only in a very few areas that we have any difficulty in getting labour.  There are some areas in which we have to bring men some distance to do the work.  I am very proud and glad that the House does appreciate that the acquisition of land is the greatest difficulty.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies seem to think that we should take extraordinary powers to take over land but we should not forget that the land the Forestry Department is forced to fall back on is very often the poorest quality of land owned by the very poorest of our farmers.  In my opinion it would be a shocking abuse of the authority the people have given us to trample on that poorer section of the people. Sometimes I have almost lost my temper myself in dealing with people who have useless strips of mountain and who say they will not part with it.</P>
    <P>I can understand their point of view because their income is very small and they have to live very frugally.  To part with some of their property is quite a big thing for these people.  It is all right for us to talk about it, but we must take their point of view if we can.  Even the poorest of these is a citizen of this State just the same as anyone in this House and is entitled to the same protection.</P>
    <P>I want to see forestry going ahead and I intend to push it ahead and I believe that we can push it ahead without trampling on any section of our people.</P>
    <P>As a result of experiments which have been carried out by the Forestry Department and which have proceeded very well I think the time has come when we can push a little bit further into what has been described, even now, as unplantable ground.  I do not want any big set-back or failure in any large area which might damn forestry altogether in the eyes of those who do <Col N="882" /> not understand it, but I still think that we can push further ahead into what has been regarded as unplantable land. The experimental plots carried on in Galway and in North Mayo on land which has been described as unplantable have done very well, even though the trees have had to get a little nursing and coaxing.  In most of these areas experiments have been carried out with different types of fertilisers, the principal one being basic slag.  An ounce or two applied to each tree has given very good results but we cannot say with certainty that they will continue to do well.</P>
    <P>In Ballyhowra, County Cork, there is an instance where the forest started very well and flourished to a certain point and then the trees failed and as much as 20 acres have had to be felled and planted with different types of trees.  I think that difficulty has now been overcome as machinery has been able to break up the hard pan underneath the soil which prevented the roots going down.  Up to the present when the roots went down as far as that pan the forest wilted away.  We do not want that to happen again and if it did we might give forestry a sudden death at the present time.</P>
    <P>In dealing with forestry we are dealing with something that belongs to the public and it is vital to proceed very carefully.  We do not want any wild spring into the unknown that might result in disaster.  If the House gives me the Bill I have in mind the intake of land can be stepped up so as to please the most enthusiastic Deputy in the House.  I am not holding out hopes that will be misleading.  I do think that it will happen. Negotiations for most of the land that has come in since this Government took office were started as far back as three years ago and in some cases as far back as five or six years ago. While we may chafe and grumble at the slowness of the Department I want to make it quite clear that the Department must get full title to the land they acquire.  We must avoid having claims come in at the last moment and holding up everything. <Col N="883" /> That is my purpose in bringing in the Bill I am talking about.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moylan mentioned that home-grown timber is not fully appreciated or regarded in a proper light by our own people.  He suggested that a stand of kiln dried timber should be sent as an exhibit to various towns and cities so that our people would get to know its worth.  I entirely agree with that suggestion.  I am afraid that the way our native timber was handled has a lot to do with the present feeling about it.  It was cut and sold to the customer with the sap running out of it.  Then when it dried it was warped and twisted and found faulty.  That has given a bad name to our home-grown timber.  My information is that Irish home-grown timber, if treated in the same way as imported timber, would be as good, and possibly better, than any foreign timber.</P>
    <P>Deputies who come up against the argument that home-grown timber is no good should be able to reply that that is not true.  It is no good in the manner in which it had been mishandled up to the present and that is one of the reasons that the drying kilns were established and not to compete with the timber merchant.  They were established to show the way the timber should be treated&mdash;what can be done, and what ought to be done with it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Derrig seems to be under the impression that we should use compulsion for the acquisition of land and Deputy Moylan says that we should not.  I take the side of Deputy Moylan. I do not think that we should use compulsion because the Department has had a very bitter experience of taking over land in an area where we had not the goodwill of the local people.  I could quote one particular instance where a man took it into his head that the land we acquired should have been his.  It should not have been sold.  He could make better use of it for sheep raising than the Forestry Department could for growing timber.  He burned it out systematically several times but that could <Col N="884" /> not be brought home to him.  A forest is very vulnerable.  One match in the month of March could destroy hundreds of acres.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Was he prosecuted for that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick:</NameTxt>
      <P>All we could do was to suspect.  He was too careful to allow himself to be caught.  Possibly, a match was thrown in in the early hours of the morning and that was that.  The forest was destroyed but the man was saved.  We had no proof that the fire was malicious.  It might have been accidental but the circumstances surrounding the case were a little bit too suspicious.  A plantation is very vulnerable up to ten, 11 or 12 years of its growth.  We must have control of the locality and there must be a spirit amongst the people of the locality that the forest is something for their benefit even though it does not belong to them.</P>
      <P>We must create among our people a pride in the forest wherever it is&mdash;a watchfulness and a carefulness which people have for practically every other thing.  That is one of the reasons that while ample powers of compulsory acquisition are enshrined in the 1946 Act they have never been availed of. You might get away with it in regard to one or two forests while ten or 15 more forests are burned out.</P>
      <P>Having regard to all the expense involved, we do not want to see four or ten years' work go up in flames because of the malice of some individual who feels he has a grievance against the forest or the centre.</P>
      <P>There was a point made by some Deputy that Mr. Cameron in his report said that a forest should not be established unless there was a bloc of 3,000 acres.  Reading over what he said, I think what he meant was to build up a forest bloc to 3,000 acres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride:</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick:</NameTxt>
      <P>Some Deputies seemed to think that it is the policy of the Government and the forestry people not to start with anything less than 300 acres.  Such is not the case.  I am willing to start on 30 or 40 acres in the <Col N="885" /> hope that it would ultimately he built up.  Taking thinning operations and all the rest, the best way to build up a forest is not as Deputy Blaney suggested by doing the whole year's planting in one particular place and then moving on and doing 15,000 acres in another place another year. That would be bad management. It would mean that thousands of men would have to be drafted in in lorries to do that area and that would not be half the work because when you would come to the thinning and subsequent operations there would be a really bad mess.</P>
      <P>No Minister or Government could deal with a situation like that.  The best thing is to have as many centres as we possibly can dotted throughout the country and do a reasonable amount of planting within the capacity of the local men to handle.  Again, I think Mr. Cameron meant to build up to a 3,000-acre centre.  With that I fully agree.</P>
      <P>Deputy Tully was concerned about forestry in Meath.  Meath being a very arable county, I am afraid that there is not much scope for forestry in Meath, except in a few scattered places.  Forestry will never be built up to the same extent in the County Meath as in Wicklow where you have a high percentage of land of doubtful agricultural value.  It would be bad national policy to use the good land of Meath for the purpose of forestry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully:</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not think of using the bad land in Meath?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan:</NameTxt>
      <P>You are giving that to the migrants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully:</NameTxt>
      <P>They would not take it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick:</NameTxt>
      <P>As a matter of fact, we are starting in Summerhill to pick up any areas we possibly can.  Even the worst land in the County Meath is excellent forestry land.  Any pockets of what the people in County Meath would regard as fairly poor land would make excellent forest land.  No opportunity will be lost of making use of <Col N="886" /> such but I cannot see a big acreage being built up in the County Meath.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully:</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the cut-away bog?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick:</NameTxt>
      <P>Fair enough.  Both Deputy Seán Collins and Deputy Derrig were anxious to know what is happening in Glengariff.  Negotiations are completed there but, once again, there is some delay in regard to clearing up title.  There is no major obstacle in the way.  I do not see why possession should not come about inside six or eight months at the outside. That is the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride:</NameTxt>
      <P>When did negotiations begin in Glengariff?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick:</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite a while ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride:</NameTxt>
      <P>Twelve years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is quite that far back but it is going on for a long time.  As regards the slowness in negotiation, the Department is sometimes blamed for it.  In very many cases it is the vendor or the vendor and solicitor combined who start to take things easy.  Once they know that negotiations are through and the prices are fixed, they appear to me to take it easy.  Perhaps, they have their own difficulties and, perhaps, I am criticising them unduly but on some occasions at least I get the notion that they could help us out.  Once it comes to that stage that is a thing over which we have no control.  If the vendor starts to take things easy we can only prod him now and again with a letter and an occasional threat to terminate negotiations altogether.  That does not frighten him very much as he knows we will scarcely do that since we are anxious to get the land.</P>
      <P>Deputy Collins mentioned Kil-lacloghane. The total there is 87 acres.  Fifty acres were planted last year.  We hope to plant the remainder this year.  Even that is not very large but there are other offers coming in in that particular locality.  There is reasonable hope of building up a forest block of fair size as time goes on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me sum up the whole situation. Deputies were correct when they said that the acquisition of land was the <Col N="887" /> big snag.  I hope that the Bill I have in mind will clear up a lot of the difficulties. We hope that it will at least give the Department clear title in a very short space of time instead of the old method of waiting for every claimant to relinquish his claim so that a person living on the land could give us clear title at home.</P>
    <P>Seeds are available quite plentifully and the situation in regard to fencing material is not the same as it was during the war years.  It is quite plentiful.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully:</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no rabbits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick:</NameTxt>
      <P>The rabbits were a nuisance but we have sheep and neighbours' cattle and also a few hares and they can do immense damage.  In order to protect plantations it is absolutely necessary to fence them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan:</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the birds?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick:</NameTxt>
      <P>Keep down to earth and do not go up in the air.  Fencing material is plentiful and labour is plentiful.  I present an accurate picture to the House when I say that, given land, there is nothing to stop us from attaining any target.  Mention was made that we have 47,000 acres on hand.  The very minimum we must have on hands is a three years' planting programme.  In other words, it would be bad policy to plant any more than one-third of what we have on hands.</P>
      <P>Take any plantation of 100 or 200 acres that might be done in a particular forest.  It is absolutely necessary to know three years in advance what particular trees will suit that ground best. On any 100 acres there might be five or six or even ten different species to be planted there because there might be a portion of dry, light sandy soil which might suit pines and there might be another portion of sodden ground in which these would fail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For that reason it is just proper management, such as is exercised by every farmer, to know exactly what seeds to sow, let us say, this spring, for the land we will have three years <Col N="888" /> hence.  Otherwise the nursery men would be sowing a quantity of seeds and would not know whether or not there would be suitable land to absorb them when they would be three-year-old transplants.  That is why it is necessary to have three years land in reserve.</P>
    <P>I remember being told by Mr. Cameron, who was a first class expert of forestry, that we should have seven years land in hand&mdash;though I never got the explanation from him.  I could not see the point in that. Definitely three years is a tight fit, but at least you know the seed you will sow and in a year like this when we have something like 35,000,000 transplants in the nurseries it is essential to know if we will have suitable land into which to put them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride:</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it then that we must have 75,000 acres in reserve in order to achieve 25,000 acres?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick:</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct&mdash; 75,000 acres that are plantable in order to have the machine running to best advantage so that there will not be any waste in the nurseries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride:</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the plantable reserve at the moment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick:</NameTxt>
      <P>47,500, approximately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride:</NameTxt>
      <P>That is approximately half what we should have?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick:</NameTxt>
      <P>A little bit more than half, but certainly much below what we would all like to see.  The figure is over 47,000, but not 48,000.  It did happen in the past that the Forestry Department found itself with numbers of trees on hands with no plantable land for them.  I think it was during the year 1950 that we found ourselves with a vast number, something like 3,000,000 of young European larch transplants that had to be swapped with the British people for sitka spruce.  It appears that they had too much spruce while we had too much larch and it suited both sides to make the exchange.  That is not good management and these things should not happen.  We could plant 25,000 <Col N="889" /> acres next year, but if we did we would be running through our plantable reserve and while we would have a feast that year and the year after we would have a famine for maybe five years more, perhaps longer until the reserve could build up again.</P>
      <P>I think that is all I have to say and if there are any other points&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry:</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister considered the education of the public at all through cinemas and so on?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick:</NameTxt>
      <P>No, other than a suggestion that was put forward to me privately inside the last five or six weeks.  I do think our public do not seem to take an interest in forestry&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick:</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of the average farmer the planting of a halfacre or one statute acre for which a grant of £10 is given, this grant is not being availed of&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully:</NameTxt>
      <P>Because he does not know anything about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick:</NameTxt>
      <P>They know about it quite well because it has been mentioned in every debate in this House. I think the reason is that if I myself want to plant an acre of trees I would have to do the fencing and I would have to get in a forestry man to tell me the species that would suit that particular ground.  If he told me it would be suitable for larch I might want to put in sitka spruce.  Even though the farmers know that that £10 grant is perfectly free and that the Department has no claim on the plantation because of that payment, the farmers still do not seem to take advantage of it.  If we increase that grant by 50 per cent. to £15, which would be a very liberal grant for one acre, I do not think it would mean the planting of 20 acres more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it all goes to show that forestry is a thing that the State must handle and that only the State will handle.  The private individual does not seem to care about it.  I have been deluged with requests from time to time by people who got holdings from <Col N="890" /> the Land Commission who want to cut down trees, bring in the land reclamation workers and make arable and of their holdings.</P>
    <P>Their argument is that their holding is so small that they cannot afford to give any of it to timber.  They want to get permits to cut without replanting conditions.  They say: &ldquo;We got 25 acres from the Land Commission which included a couple of acres of timber, but the timber is no good to us.  We cannot make a living out of it because we make a living from agricultural products.&rdquo;  They want permission to fell the trees with the obligation to replant not imposed. Personally, I find it very hard in a case like that to impose the replanting condition; it is different in the case of a person who has broad acres and there the condition goes on positively, and the owner of that land must replant in conditions like that.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why the £10 grant is not availed of to a greater extent.  It cannot be said that those who might be willing to take it fear that the Department might have a claim on the plantation although that notion does persist in regard to the Department of Agriculture's farm buildings grants in some cases which one occasionally comes up against.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride:</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider putting a few advertisements in the papers in order to induce private people to avail of the grant and other facilities which the Department will make available?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick:</NameTxt>
      <P>I could do that.  I think that some kind of education of the public on these matters could and should be done.  It is very nice to see throughout the country the small shelter belts that county committees of agriculture foster in different countries. At least those are a start; there is nothing as bare, barren and naked looking as a nice house, with nice out-offices <Col N="891" /> on a holding without a stick of shelter around it.</P>
      <P>I think that the farmer is used to the annual cycle&mdash;he sows his crops in the spring, they grow and mature and in the autumn he gets the full benefit of them.  The average farmer cannot make his mind up easily to adopt this long cycle which is necessary in forestry, 40 or 50 years.  If a man of 30 or 40 years starts planting, even when he is an old man the plantation will consist only of young trees or poles.  In my opinion it is the very slowness that is a deterrent.  The farmers say: &ldquo;Yes, we will put down some trees, but maybe when they are three years old the cattle will break into them.&rdquo; Then they put it off from day to day because it involves a lot of trouble in fencing.  I shall see if anything can be done by advertising.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill has received Government sanction and is with the parliamentary draftsman but because it touches on title&mdash;a thing I do not understand not being a legal man&mdash; apparently it is presenting unusual difficulties.  What I have in mind&mdash; whether or not the draftsman can produce it, is another question&mdash;is something like this: John Smith down the country is the member of the family who has stayed at home and held the holding.  He wants to sell portion of that but he has six or seven brothers in England or America, each having the same claim on it as he has because the parents died without making a will. What I am aiming at is that we should go in and buy the portion that John Smith wants to sell.  I want the Bill to give the Department full title to that and I am leaving a period of six years available in which any person who has a claim against that holding can come to the Minister for compensation&mdash;not to John Smith and not to the brother at home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is pretty sweeping and I am sure the Bill will provide plenty of food <Col N="892" /> for debate in relation to the matter of title when it comes before the Dáil; but nevertheless, if we do not get something like that it means that forestry is held up because of the mess the title of every holding in the country has got into, because of people dying without making a will or without making an assignment and the fact that the younger generation just live on on the holding and forget all about the title business.  I should not be surprised if I were able to introduce it inside two or three weeks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride:</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister will appreciate that every section of the House will help him with the Bill. As I understand the position, the whole progress of afforestation and land acquisition is at present held up by reason of the lack of the Bill.  Therefore, might I suggest to the Minister that it should receive priority?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick:</NameTxt>
      <P>That is perfectly true. It is really the question of title that is the trouble.  It is not want of goodwill on the part of the Department and not want of willingness to provide the money on the part of this Government or the last Government, or lack of goodwill on the part of people down the country.  Naturally enough, Deputies will appreciate why we must be careful to get full and complete title.  I am proposing to short-circuit that business altogether, that is, provided the draftsman can give me a form of words that will do it and provided the Dáil and Seanad will pass it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig:</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Minister to tell us what is the position as regards the classification of the holdings to <Col N="893" /> which replanting conditions attach.  It has struck me in view of his further statement about this Bill he intends to introduce that it will afford an opportunity to clear up that matter. Probably the Minister will proceed with the Bill on the basis of dealing with the single question of title, but there are various other matters.  So far as compulsion is concerned, for example, I do not want to reopen the discussion, but may I say that, since we have never actually tried compulsion in any case of derelict land or otherwise, we really do not know whether the powers in the legislation are effective?  I have not got the slightest doubt that, even in cases where there is the strongest possible argument for compulsion, you may find yourself up against legal difficulties and resort to the courts.</P>
      <P>I do not agree with the Minister's argument that we want to trample on anybody's rights in the matter, but I want to ask him whether any progress has been made with regard to the sorting out of these holdings to which replanting conditions attach and whether he might not avail himself of the opportunity of seeking sanctions, if necessary, or seeking powers, to deal further with these cases.  The position is, I understand, that the Department have been rather holding their hand in view of what the Minister said about the cost of replanting which everyone understands with regard to these individual holdings.</P>
      <P>I also wanted to ask him whether, if legislation is being introduced, it would not also afford an opportunity to deal with the question of the Bantry commons, a tract of about 3,000 acres in Wexford, which has very special legal difficulties attaching to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick:</NameTxt>
      <P>There has not been a classification of the holdings to which replanting conditions attached in felling licences in the past.  There have been quite a number of replanting conditions, but they must take their place in the queue, that is, people who got a felling licence and were obliged to plant must take their place in the queue in the matter of the supply of transplants from private <Col N="894" /> nurseries.  While there are quite a number of cases on these lines, they have never been classified into holdings of various sizes and various valuations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick:</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true, because the particular replanting is governed <i>inter alia</i> by the capacity of the private nurseries to meet the demand, and all that can be done is to take the older cases first and let them take full advantage of whatever plants are available.  I am not aware of the particular case the Deputy mentions in Wexford, but I will look into it and if a special section is needed to overcome very peculiar title difficulties&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Blowick):</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £142,900 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1956, for Salaries and Expenses in connection with Gaeltacht Services, including Housing Grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current year's Estimate shows an increase of £10,000 net over that for last year.  Being a net increase this does not reflect the total additional amount being provided this year for Gaeltacht Services.  The gross additional amount provided is £61,480, and an estimated <Col N="895" /> increase of £51,480 in Appropriations-in-Aid reduces this to the figure of £10,000 net.</P>
    <P>The gross additional amount of £61,480 is made up principally of the following increases: Salaries, wages and allowances, £3,460; machinery and maintenance, £4,310; manufacturing materials, £44,835; Gaeltacht housing, £10,000.</P>
    <P>The activities of the Gaeltacht Services Division to which I shall refer in this statement are the rural industries, the marine products industries and the administration of the Gaeltacht Housing Acts.</P>
    <P>Sub-heads D (1) to D (8) show an increase of more than £47,000 in the provision for the rural industries, as against the amount provided last year. This increase is almost entirely due to larger provision for the purchase of manufacturing materials for the various industries&mdash;comprising an increase of almost £28,000 for materials for the tweed industry, an increase of £11,500 for materials for the knitwear industry, an increase of £2,500 for materials for the embroidery industry and an increase of £3,500 for materials for the toy industry.  Last year I was able to report satisfactory progress in these industries and this year I am glad to be able to tell you that this progress has been maintained.  The sales of tweeds increased by just over £69,000 for 1954-55, as compared with the previous year and these sales are now more than double what they were in 1952-53 or in 1951-52.  Sales of knitwear products, embroidery and toys also showed satisfactory increases.  In view of this and the fact that we expect continued improvement this year the need for increased provision for manufacturing materials will readily be appreciated.  The Estimate for receipts from sales in the current year is just over £500,000.</P>
    <P>The provision for machinery for the rural industries also shows an increase since it will be necessary to purchase some heavy machinery to enable the Kilcar mill to produce special types of weaving yarns and to put on the tweeds special surface finishes which <Col N="896" /> are in public demand, but which cannot be done at present in the mill. Provision is also made for the purchase of machinery which will enable the blending of various types of wool to be carried out more efficiently and also permit of the production of yarns for special ranges of tweeds which are in popular demand.</P>
    <P>There is also provision for increased purchases of machinery for the toy industry. It has become necessary to replace some machines which are worn out through use and provision is also being made for the purchase of other new types of machinery for more efficient production.</P>
    <P>It may be noted that there is a reduction of £2,000 in the provision for advertising and publicity.  As there is a heavy demand for the products of the rural industries intensive advertising is not required to the same extent as last year, and the current provision of £6,000 is considered sufficient to meet requirements in this direction.</P>
    <P>The wages of workers employed in the rural industries are paid out of receipts, and provision for this is made under sub-head H, where an estimated expenditure of £131,300 is shown.  This sum of £131,300 is the largest ever provided for wages for workers in the rural industries.  It exceeds last year's provision by nearly £20,000 although last year's provision itself exceeded that of the previous year by the same amount.</P>
    <P>Sub-head E makes provision for the marine products industries which comprise the purchase of sea-rods, carrageen moss and other seaweeds from gatherers around the western coast. These seaweeds are sold to the firm of Alginate Industries (Ireland) Limited. The State has a controlling interest in this company and the accounts of the company for the year ended on the 30th of September, 1954, were laid on the Table of the House in April last together with a report on the working of the company for that year.</P>
    <P>Deputies will remember that an Act which was passed by the Oireachtas last December authorised the Minister for Lands to acquire an additional 37,900 shares of £1 each in this company.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="897" /> The additional capital sought by the company was required to enable it to produce sea-rod meal with greater efficiency, to equip itself for the handling and marketing of carrageen moss, and to provide facilities for the production of seaweed meal for cattle food.</P>
    <P>This Estimate covers the purchasing of the seaweeds from the gatherers, and transport and handling costs prior to delivery to the company.  This year's provision of £28,750 shows an increase of £750 on last year's figure.</P>
    <P>Sub-head F shows an increase of £10,000 in the provision for grants to be paid under the Gaeltacht Housing Acts.  Housing activities have shown a continued increase since 1953 when the last amending Act was passed.  The number of new houses completed during the year which ended on the 31st of March last was 192 as against 134 completed in the preceding year and 191 houses were improved or extended as against a total of 134 improved or extended in the preceding year.  In addition, 24 households utilised the new sanitation grants provided under the 1953 Act, and installed piped water and sewerage in their houses.  At the 31st of March last the number of houses in course of erection or improvement was 1,107 as against a total of 807 cases in progress a year earlier.</P>
    <P>It will be seen, therefore, that in all the activities that I have mentioned&mdash; rural industries, marine industries and housing&mdash;the Gaeltacht Services Division of my Department is showing satisfactory progress and it is hoped, and in fact the present indications would lead us to expect, that during the current year this satisfactory progress will be maintained in each of these spheres of activity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig:</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a boom in the tweed industry and I agree with the Minister that the development has been most satisfactory.  While congratulating ourselves on the advance that has been made and the progress shown, there is always the question whether, in fact, we have taken the greatest advantage of our opportunities. There is no doubt but that, for the past few years, tweeds have been in the forefront in the fashion world.  Previous to that, as the Minister knows, the tweed industry had its ups and downs.  When the Minister left office and I came in, the tweed industry was really in the doldrums.  There were heavy accumulations of stocks which there was difficulty in disposing of.  After that, things began to improve.</P>
      <P>It would seem as if tweed has now got a fairly good innings.  I hope that situation will continue.  The fashion world is unpredictable and we cannot say whether we will be as fortunate as we hope.  We should not, therefore, be in any way complacent or rest on our oars in the matter but we should take advantage of every opportunity to extend the sale of Irish tweeds in the foreign market.  As well as I remember, the sales used to be about 40 per cent.&mdash;I do not know whether I am correct about that&mdash;in the home market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may be able to tell us when he is replying whether the home market has been more satisfactory.  It ought to be.  We had certain sales to the U.S.A.  There were certain firms there who, even if they took only a number of consignments, would be responsible for sales amounting to perhaps £20,000 or more. My recollection is that the prospects in the foreign market were very promising and that, really, we should have expected more support at home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the period of the last Government, and when the Coalition Government were last in office, successive Ministers for Industry and Commerce and Government representatives, as well as the organisations who were interested in the promotion of Irish <Col N="899" /> industries, were doing everything possible to get the Irish public to give first preference to the Irish article.  We know that, in the case of tweed, they are certainly getting better value.  It is almost impossible to wear it out. There should be no need for our women folk&mdash;even if they are fashion-minded&mdash;to have resort to the foreign fabrics particularly when, by supporting the Irish article, they are not alone in the height of fashion at the present time, but they are giving much needed employment in the congested and Gaeltacht areas.</P>
    <P>I come now to the question of the Kilcar factory and the references that were made under the previous Vote to the question of publicity.  I think that if a little brochure were issued with regard to the Gaeltacht industries it would be of great help to Deputies and to the public.  Of course, if they visited places such as Kilcar they would see what is going on there.  However, if they are not in a position to visit these places then, even from the advertising point of view, I think there is something to be said for turning out brightly coloured brochures such as the English Forestry Commission, for example, publish with regard to their different plantations.  They are good publicity and they show the public where to go if they want to see what is going on.  We do not seem to have very much publicity about the Minister's Department and I have always lamented the fact that we have not had more.  A considerable amount of money has been spent in advertising in certain directions with regard to forestry, but there should be more brochures when there are particular works and enterprises which are doing well so that the public may see what is being done.  It is really by way of an invitation to the public to see the place for themselves.</P>
    <P>My attention was called to the fact that in Kilcar, due to the very good employment given there, there was a beneficial effect in stemming emigration. The giving of employment to the young men in the area seems to have had a certain effect&mdash;perhaps natural and foreseeable&mdash;in getting the girls of <Col N="900" /> the parish and the adjoining parishes to remain at home and settle down at home.  I am afraid it will be very difficult to alter the situation in Gaeltacht areas unless we can get regular employment at fairly good wages for the young men.  The attractions of employment elsewhere&mdash;or what they consider to be attractions&mdash;are very strong.  Those people think of the high wages and generally do not take all the other things into consideration.  Their predecessors 40 years ago in Boston and Philadelphia even changed their names to a certain extent and they were writing home telling how well off they were when in fact they were not as well off as they claimed.  When the emigrant goes across he finds that he has to face very many difficulties, not the least of which is that he has to enter into a big industrial organisation and he has to give full value.  He has to work hard and give a good return to the employer or he will not be maintained.  He will not get the high wages if he is not able to fit into the industrial organisation.</P>
    <P>Kilcar is an example of what can be done.  The operations of the mill have meant that employment is given not alone directly through it but in the weaving industry in County Donegal which, as we know, is a traditional centre for weaving and all the ancillary processes.  In that particular mill all the processes from start to finish in connection with the production of Irish tweed are being carried out and we can be assured that there will be no falling off as regards the quality, that a high standard will be maintained.  I hope that employment will continue and that there will be greater output and greater sales from the mill in the coming year.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister particularly how the export trade is doing and whether advances have been made through the organisations that have been set up to assist in securing exports.  I want to ask him also whether the proposals that were there when I left office&mdash;for the improvement of the mill by the provision of additional machinery, additional storage and extensions at Carrick and Ardara&mdash;have been carried out.  The Minister for Finance has been telling the people down the country that he is <Col N="901" /> advancing money from the National Development Fund for somewhat similar purposes.  This particular aspect of the Gaeltacht services is deserving of special consideration.  The industry is flourishing and more employment is being given.  On the technical side, as far as machinery is concerned, one would like to be assured that the full requirements are being provided.  As far as I remember, the proposals envisaged the spending of over £100,000 on the improvement and development of the industry under various headings.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Crolly factory, I would be glad if the Minister could tell us how the employment situation is there.  He refers to increased purchases of machinery and replacements for the toy industry.  I would like to know whether the improvement in sales has been such as to justify taking further steps to improve production on the technical side.  I have always believed that in the matter of our rural industries we could benefit by sending experts, particularly on the machinery side and on the design side, to see what is going on elsewhere&mdash;to go to Switzerland for example, and see what types of machines are used in the smaller industries there and, of course, to visit the German centres also, since there is intense activity going on there. In that way it might be possible, even if we have to introduce a certain number of foreign workers, to develop these centres that we still have in the West, so that handicraft would be brought more into the picture.</P>
    <P>That is possibly a matter that arises more on the Vote for the Department of Education, but I think that if you have to train workers it is really the industry itself in the long run that must do it.  They may use the machinery of the vocational education committees or other machinery, but it is really the industry itself in the long run that has to train them.  We must expect that enterprises like Kilcar and Crolly, now well established, will be able to do more to co-operate with whatever other agencies are in question to get an up-to-date technical training for our young people in these areas and perhaps to induce others&mdash;as has been the case in Donegal&mdash;to start off for themselves.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="902" /> The fact that we have these industries under Government control and running with Government assistance does not mean that we want to monopolise the market or want to be unfair to any others.  We want to encourage those who are in a position to go ahead or who think that they can make good through the assistance that the Government would be prepared to give them &mdash;in other ways, for which the Minister would not be directly responsible, though I hope he would have a word to say in the allocation of capital for other industries in the West of Ireland.  We ought to be able to co-operate with them and build up the industries that we have to the greatest extent possible, so that they can compare with those elsewhere from the technical point of view and encourage our young people to start little enterprises themselves.  I am quite sure that they could do so if they had the technical knowledge.  That is the thing that is lacking, as they certainly have the application and we know the industry that they show elsewhere.  If they had that technical knowledge, particularly in fitting the product to suit the customer's taste, that is where the whole secret lies.</P>
    <P>With regard to the knitwear industry, I want to say&mdash;and it is not to-day or yesterday that I have been anxious about this&mdash;that unfortunately we have been rather behindhand in applying new ideas.  We have not kept trend with the market.  I do not know why that should be.  There is a great deal of talk in the newspapers about fashion topics, matters of design, and so on, but it is an extraordinary thing that new designs and improvements and attractive garments are constantly coming into this country from Scotland or from France.  We know that the Scots, if it suits them, will come over here to see what we are doing in connection with peat, in connection with electricity, or what we are doing with our bogs, because they are alert and they want to take advantage of every possible opportunity to develop their own resources.  But we have not been keeping in touch in regard to the requirements of the market.  We have assumed that because there is a certain boom, if I may call it so, in the <Col N="903" /> tweed industry that is all right, but that boom, as we know, will pass, and even if it does not, we are up against keen competition from these outside manufacturers.</P>
    <P>These things do not change. Although I have suggested early on that fashion is unpredictable, it can be seen well in advance, even perhaps two years in advance, what the trend is likely to be and what the market will be like in two years' time.  Therefore, if the existing premises do not permit of having a showroom to see what our Gaeltacht industries can do with regard to knitting materials, I think a showroom should be provided and that it would be worth while.  I feel also that as regards design and marketing we ought to keep in touch with the trend; we ought to be in advance and we ought not to be in a position that we simply copy what is being done and very well done elsewhere. We ought to be able to say: &ldquo;Here is something new we have produced ourselves.  It is Irish and you know it is Irish.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is how the Scots have gone ahead.  They have not just rested on their oars.  They have gone ahead and produced new things designed to make the customer feel that he or she is getting a greatly improved garment, that the price is satisfactory and that it is new.  You must change in these things and my experience has been that the tendency is to stay too long in the old designs and the old type of product and not to move ahead with market conditions.  If the industry is flourishing surely that is all the more reason why we should step out and give more examples of what we can do in the way of improved designs and up-to-date products?</P>
    <P>If we were in the position that we had been in some years ago, when the industry was in the doldrums, then, of course, it might not appear appropriate to take on these developments but I think the situation is now such that we can look for additional capital development with regard to Kilcar or Crolly, or even the provision of more up-to-date machines in the knitting centres.  But in regard to the problems <Col N="904" /> of marketing and design and putting knitwear garments on the market that can compare favourably and be even better than those that are imported, special attention ought to be given to that matter.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that there is an increase in the provision for housing and that at least 24 householders have availed themselves of the facilities of the Department to introduce sanitation. It is very difficult in some of the Gaeltacht areas to get satisfactory water supplies.  It is a very important matter that people going to the Gaeltacht areas, either as visitors or as students, should be able to get the same type of accommodation as they would get elsewhere in this country or outside it and that there would not be any question whatever, but that sanitation and water would be provided for them.</P>
    <P>Therefore, if it is the position that there are houses that have already got Gaeltacht housing grants, I wonder would the Minister be good enough to say when he is replying whether the special grant or special facilities for the installation of water and sanitation could be made available to them?  I am thinking particularly of visitors and of the fact that they are rather disappointed often because they cannot get the type of accommodation that they like and I think if they could get it they would be prepared to pay the ordinary charges.  It is a very important matter, not alone for the Gaeltacht people themselves to feel that they have proper sanitation and proper comfort in their homes, but for the visitors and particularly for those who visit these areas to learn and study Irish.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the seaweed meal project for cattle food and I would like if he would give us some information when he is concluding as to how this industry is getting on.  A great deal has been written and spoken about the necessity for utilising the land&mdash; such as it is&mdash;in the Gaeltacht.  In that connection I would ask the Minister to take a friendly interest in the projects for the production of grass meal or for reclamation of land for other such purposes in the Gaeltacht areas.  We rather <Col N="905" /> incline in this area, which has such a long coastline, to neglect our sea products and credit is due for the work that has been done in connection with the seaweed industry over the past number of years.  I hope it will continue.</P>
    <P>I would like to have the Minister's assurance that as regards the alginate industries he is satisfied that the amount of employment that is given locally will be continued and maintained. If there are possibilities of further expansion in that industry, of having more of the processes carried out in this country so that it may not appear to be merely a question of exporting the raw materials but that we may be able to do more and more of the processing here as time goes on, I would like, if the Minister has any further information to give us about that matter, if he would be kind enough to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to intervene briefly in this debate in regard to some of the items coming under this heading.  Naturally those of us from the Gaeltacht counties are primarily interested in what employment can be provided for our people. For that reason I want to deal at the outset with something to which Deputy Derrig has already made reference, namely, the present tweed boom.  Those of us who represent the congested areas are inundated even now with appeals from young men asking to be given a chance to weave, to be provided with a loom and given an opportunity of learning. That may seem scarcely credible to some, but it is nevertheless quite true; and that appeal is coming at a time when we can sell every inch of cloth we can manufacture and at a time when we are making provision for the extension and expansion of our present facilities for producing cloth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently we had the pleasure of seeing brought to fruition in Glencolumcille a mart which was, indeed, a long time under way.  But then anything with which the Board of Works is connected must necessarily be a long time under way; however, it does materialise eventually.  The unfortunate position is that we now find <Col N="906" /> it is only half large enough.  We are very grateful to have it and we are not in any way belittling its value to the area but it was scarcely under way before we discovered that it does not provide even half the accommodation necessary if we are to take full advantage of the present boom in the tweed industry.  That is something that ought to be uppermost in the minds of those who are responsible for estimating the expansion of which we are capable and which is necessary to absorb the growing population in these areas and stop the flow of emigration.</P>
    <P>Deputy Derrig says that this has succeeded in a marked manner in stemming the flow of emigration, and our only regret is that sufficient expansion has not taken place at the right time. I am afraid that we are inclined to wait until the boom is, so to speak, full on before we set about taking advantage of it.  There are hundreds of weavers who could yet be employed.  There are weavers across Channel who would be glad to come home if the employment facilities were available.  It would be a good thing to take full advantage of the boom in that respect.</P>
    <P>We do not for a moment deprecate the caution that has been exercised with regard to the quality of the material being produced.  We know it is absolutely vital that it should be the very best quality and I would not suggest too much haste in order to take full advantage of the present expansion because that might prove detrimental to the quality of the product which must essentially, if we are to hold the market after the boom has passed and maintain tweed as an article which can command an export market, be of the very best quality. Irrespective of how fashions may change I believe we will always be able to turn out a product which will find a ready market in many, or some, countries.  The twofold duty which confronts those responsible for undertaking a further expansion is, first of all, to take full advantage as far as possible of the present boom period and, secondly, to ensure that the high standard of quality which is at present being insisted on is maintained, if not further improved.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="907" /> Deputy Derrig mentioned that Gaeltacht Éireann are not the only people producing tweed.  That is very true.  We have in Donegal some private firms that are equally well established, if not better, than Gaeltarra Éireann.  Put oneself in the position of these people for a moment and consider the fact that they find themselves in competition with a State-sponsored concern, subsidised by the taxpayer, and one must realise immediately the vital necessity there is for a liaison between Gaeltarra Éireann and the private concerns. I hope that the Minister for his part will ensure that there is no undue competition between Gaeltarra Éireann and the private producers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should not forget that the private firms do not suffer from the disadvantages the State-sponsored body does.  They can pretty well do what they like and they have not a number of industries scattered over a wide area.  Their industry is all under the one roof, so to speak, and they have that advantage over State-sponsored industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid the Minister is not quite correct.  When he visits Donegal again I would like him to visit, even for a short time, the firm of Messrs. Magee &amp; Co., and he will find there an organisation something similar to Gaeltarra Éireann. Their weavers are spread over the countryside.  They are well paid.  A very high quality material is produced and there is a world organisation to sell it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick:</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but they have only to pay one manager.  We have to pay several.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan:</NameTxt>
      <P>They have agents in Paris and New York.  They have a huge export of cloth to both Paris and New York, where only the highest quality is accepted.  I am not asking for any preferential treatment to be meted out to these people but I think we have the right to demand that they should at least get a fair deal from the State-sponsored organisation of Gaeltarra Éireann.  Some of these private concerns have weathered the storm <Col N="908" /> at times when the State-sponsored organisation could hardly sell a yard of cloth.  The only place from which they are getting any assistance at the moment is from Coras Tráchtála, Teoranta.  I believe they are getting a certain amount of assistance from that body and that body has always been ready to give any assistance it possibly could.</P>
      <P>The Minister may not have been aware that we have such far flung and widespread private organisations for the production of tweed.  Because we know they have come to stay and because their organisation is such as will withstand even a slump period we are anxious that unnecessary rivalry or unfair competition should not enter into the picture.  Some private firms drew my attention last year to a publication in the official organ of An Bord Fáilte, <i>Irish Travel</i>, in which it was insinuated, if not explicitly stated, that Gaeltarra Éireann were the sole producers of Irish tweed.  Now that was detrimental to the interests of certain firms because those people abroad buying from private concerns in Donegal might quite easily come to believe that these private concerns were only middlemen, themselves buying from Gaeltarra Éireann.  I hope articles such as that will not appear again because they are very detrimental to the interests of these private concerns and I appeal to the Minister to ensure that no unfair advantage is taken by Gaeltarra Éireann of our private concerns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister gave us some figures with regard to the amount of material purchased by the home market as compared with that exported. I am very much afraid that if we had the actual figure as to the amount used on the home market it would represent a very low percentage of our textile trade throughout the country for the year. I am afraid that most of the people who buy from Gaeltarra Éireann buy in order to export the material in piece goods or in short lengths. Fortunately for the industry, a great many of the firms in this country are doing an excellent job in exporting, particularly to America, thousands <Col N="909" /> and thousands of pieces each year of Donegal tweed and of other Irish tweeds.</P>
    <P>Their purchases are regarded in the returns here as being for the home market, whereas, in fact, the greater quantity of the tweeds purchased either from Gaeltarra Éireann and many private producers is actually exported in short pieces or sold to tourists.  They are exported in the form of piece goods to other countries, but the amount that we are actually using on the home market is negligible.  One has only to go to a race meeting or come into the Dáil or go to any other place where people who could afford to wear Irish tweeds assemble, to see how little is used by our own people.  There may be a reason for that, but I think that we should not forget the old policy of Sinn Féin.  The least we could do is to provide ourselves with one suit in the year of our own tweeds.</P>
    <P>Now, many people who are far removed from the tweed industry are slightly confused as to what type of industry it is, and at times they mix up the Donegal homespuns with the Donegal tweeds.  Those people fail to realise that the old spinning wheel which was the foundation of the industry is now idle and silent.  The old spinning wheel in the cottage is no longer in use nor is the black-faced wool shorn from the sheep reared on the mountain side, which went on the market in the name of Donegal homespuns.</P>
    <P>That was the tradition that existed in Donegal in the old days when the Donegal homespun made from the black-faced wool shorn from the sheep was scoured and carded by the carders and spun on wheels in the cottages. The thread was sent up to the weaver from perhaps the same cottage and the final article was produced.  The finishing process was carried out at the river bank.  That was Donegal homespun, but that is no longer being produced. It had to give way to the more superior garment made from the machine spun thread of imported wool.  The tweed which is now capturing the fashion markets of the world is no longer manufactured from home produced wool or from threads homespun in the <Col N="910" /> cottage, as some people still seem to believe it is.  That is to be deprecated. I fail to see the possibility of bringing that back owing to the present day vogue.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Department seriously to consider making use of our black-faced wool and of the homespun yarn which we are capable of producing. It could be most successfully used for heavy materials such as rugs, blankets and carpets.  I think that if the officials of Gaeltarra Éireann are going to do a really good job and are seriously to undertake the further expansion of the industry in the Gaeltacht, they will have to turn their minds to some industry which will use the black-faced and spun wool.  By doing that, they will be giving employment to every woman sitting on the hearth in every cottage on the hillsides of Donegal and in many other counties. In that way, the spinning wheel will again come into use and will go into full production.</P>
    <P>I would seriously appeal to the Minister to ask his Department to investigate the possibility of using our own wool and the old spinning wheel to provide an industry such as I suggest. Until we get an industry of that kind going we cannot really say that we have an industry which is 100 per cent. Irish.</P>
    <P>There are other industries which I should like to see expanded.  I would be failing in my duty if I did not exhort the Minister to pay immediate attention to the provision of better premises at Bruckless.  You have there an excellent centre which has gained a reputation over many years.  That, in no small way, is attributable to the efforts of one person who is now due to make her bow and exit from that industry at Bruckless, and who is deserving of passing mention in this debate.  That was a business that was taken over from a private owner, but the amount of expansion which has been carried out is by no means in keeping with the expansion which it is capable of.  When we were in government I think that we provided moneys for further extensions there.  I see a figure here for general improvement <Col N="911" /> and maintenance of £4,500, but possibly that may not be the appropriate heading that I wish to draw attention to.  I should like, however, to see immediate action taken with regard to the provision of better accommodation at that centre.</P>
    <P>The extension of the existing mill at Kilcar to Ardara and Carrick, which was mentioned by Deputy Derrig, is essential in order to embrace the entire area and some provision had been contemplated by us in that connection. There is a very old tradition of weaving and wool working generally in Ardara which could absorb at least three times the number of people who are employed there at the present time.  It is a pity, especially at the present time when we can find a ready market for every bit we produce and when people with the skill are available, that one person should be unemployed there. Short of taking the risk of lowering the high standard of our material, we should not hesitate to ensure that the necessary expansion is brought about in knitting wear.</P>
    <P>I hope it will not be again threatened as it had been, by the removal of quantitative restrictions.  Recently it was threatened by their removal and was staggering for a time, but it is getting steady on its feet again.  It will get on its feet when the people who are clamouring about the cost of living get to know that they can buy in Dublin a dozen pair of gloves made in Hong Kong at the price of one pair made in Glenties.  They will begin to wonder why they cannot afford to buy the home produced article.  Undoubtedly, they would bring pressure to bear on any Minister that would allow them to come in.  If that principle were to be applied to every industry in the country we would soon be left without any at all.</P>
    <P>I am sure the present Minister would never allow mass-produced articles of inferior quality to still the wheels of our little industries in the Gaeltacht. This applies more to the Minister for Industry and Commerce than it does to the present Minister but I am sure that any Minister must take the <Col N="912" /> keenest possible interest in our native industries and I am sure that what I have mentioned will not be allowed to happen again.</P>
    <P>I see provisions made under subheads of this Estimate in regard to marine industries.  We hardly know in Donegal that such exist although we have as big a coastline as any county in Ireland and perhaps bigger than most.  I wonder if the necessary emphasis is being given to see that the most is being made of our carrageen and other seaweed products and by-products.  We have not sufficient technical staff available to fully develop that industry but it is one in which there is a wide field for expansion and every effort should be made to get into that field.  I am glad to see that it is mentioned and I hope that greater effort will be made to extend it further than the western seaboard.</P>
    <P>There is little else that I could deal with without dealing with unnecessary details but I would like to stress the particular note I have tried to sound in what I have said, that greater expansion should be attempted until we are sure that we are taking full advantage of the present boom period. There are other industries which are capable of being developed in Donegal, particularly those which make use of the black-faced wool which is so plentiful.  The development of an industry in this wool would make the spinning-wheel turn again so that the Department ought seriously to consider making a study of that matter so that plans could be put into immediate operation.</P>
    <P>There is another little thing which would be of help to our industries and I think we are entitled to look for it. Certain Government Departments have a good annual market for certain materials.  Take the Army, for instance. I think all the material needed for the Army is produced in some way by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs but there is a very wide field there.  I do not know who benefits by the production of these goods but I am sure that they are produced at home.  I hope they are not imported but we would like that those orders, which it <Col N="913" /> is in the power of the Government to give, should be given to the firms in the Gaeltacht, not necessarily to Gaeltarra Éireann, but if we do not wish to give them to private firms they should be given to Gaeltarra Éireann. There is a huge amount of material needed for the Army such as overcoating, uniforms, knitwear, gloves and blankets and also for the Post Office employees and other governmental employees.  The annual sum spent on this clothing is a gigantic figure and it would considerably help industries in places like Donegal if we could get even a portion of those orders.  I would appeal to the Minister to ensure that we will get our share, if not all of them, and I think we are entitled to all those orders.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister's Department and those officials dealing with the tweed industry are alive to the necessity of making provision for the future.  If the world market is properly organised now during the boom period it would ensure that if fashion left us in the lurch in the morning we would still be able to sell a great amount of material.  The Irish abroad, particularly in America, provide a market that has never been fully tapped and the contacts we are now making with these countries, as a result of the good quality of our materials, should be used to get our Irish abroad, who are generally well off, to spend some extra money and get them to take a greater interest in the products of their own country.  If we could get each of them to buy even a small quantity of our material we would be providing a very wide market for our people.</P>
    <P>I think someone said in this House, or I read it a good many years ago, that if every Irishman in America was to have the button of his cap covered with Donegal tweed it would keep every available weaver in the country employed.  That may be an exaggeration but it is an indication of the wide market that is there.  I hope we will take advantage of the present boom period to ensure that that market is now built up so that when this boom passes, and it will eventually pass, we will still have an expanding market <Col N="914" /> and be able to maintain an increasing output for our own industries.</P>
    <P>If there is one thing that those who come from Gaeltacht counties must be interested in it is the Gaeltacht industries.  We are glad to see that they are prosperous now and their prosperity indicates to us the good they can do in stemming the tide of emigration.  It seems obvious to us that further great work can be done if these industries are still further developed.  I am sure that those Deputies who come from counties not interested in Gaeltacht industries would not for a moment grudge any money this House would provide in order to stem at least the tide of emigration from the western seaboard.</P>

      <P>Aontaím leis an gcaint a rinneadh cheana agus, dar ndóigh, leis na rudaí atá ráite ag an Aire mar gheall ar thionscail na Gaeltachta. Cuireann sé an-áthas orm ar fad go bhfuil rath ar an tionscal seo le blianta beaga anuas.  Tá súil againn go léir gur mar sin a bheidh an scéal go ceann i bhfad agus go mbeidh ar chumas pé Rialtas a bheas ann, nó ar dhreamanna príobháideacha, tionscail níos fearr ná iad a bhunú.</P>
      <P>Tá dul chun cinn inste ag an Aire mar gheall ar beagnach gach rud a bhaineas leis an bhFo-Roinn seo.  I gcás ceann nó dhó acu tá mé ag ceapadh gur ceart dúinn bheith cúramach. Cuirim i gcás, ceist seo an bhréidín. Nuair chonnaic mé an figiúir atá sa leabhar, go raibh £40,000 sa bhreis á sholáthar i mbliana le hábhar a sholáthar don tionscal seo, bhí sort aimhris orm i dtosach gur i ngeall ar an bpraghas níos aoirde a bhí le fáil ar na rudaí seo a bhí an scéal amhlaidh.  Bhí sé sásúil a chloisint ón Aire gur i ngeall ar an méadú a bhí ar an tóir orthu a bhí an scéal amhlaidh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dar ndóigh, tá figiúir eile a thugann lide dhúinn faoi sin.  Faoi Mhír D. 6 tá laghdú £2,000 ar chostas na fógraíochta. Arís, bhí sort aimhris orm go raibh an Roinn seo ag éirí ar nós cuma liom i dtaobh earraí na hEireann agus earraí na Gaeltachta a fhógairt sna tíortha coigríche.  Míníodh é sin arís, gur i ngeall ar an tóir mhór atá ar na hearraí seo atá an scéal amhlaidh agus go <Col N="915" /> bhfuil na hearraí seo beagnach á ndíol féin, as a maitheas féin agus as ucht, bfhéidir, ganntanas earraí de gach aon tsórt.  Arís, tá sin sásúil.  Nuair a bhíonn &ldquo;sellers market&rdquo; ann&mdash;sin focal a chualamar minic go leor i rith na hEigeandála&mdash;tá an baol i gcónaí ann go laghdófar ar fheabhas na déantúsóireachta agus ar fheabhas na margála agus go mbeidh an tAire, an fo-Roinn agus gach duine atá freagarthach, ar a suaimhneas, agus go gceapfaidh siad go bhfuil na hearraí seo a ndíol féin.  Ní dóigh liom go mbeadh sé ceart ná cóir ag na hoibritheoirí, na stiúrthoirí agus na hoifigigh a bhfuil baint acu leis na tionscail seo cúrsaí déantúsóireachta do ghabháil go réidh.</P>
    <P>Ar aon chaoi, is maith an scéal é ag gach taobh den Teach seo nach rud obann é seo&mdash;nach rud é a tharla le fíor-dheireannas.  An scéal maith seo atá innste ag an Aire is breá gur rud é a bhí ag fás do réir a chéile le blianta beaga anuas.  Is fearr an scéal a bheith amhlaidh ná fás obann, ar nós díol na mbeithíoch le tamall anuas, agus go bhfuil an scéal ag éirí níos fearr dá réir a chéile.  B'fhearr liomsa an do-réira-chéileacht sin ná aon fhás obann.</P>
    <P>I wish to endorse what other speakers have said in expressing satisfaction about the steady and continuous improvement in the benefits which are administered by this sub-Department and to endorse the view also that the direction of the services must inevitably earn its own share of the praise for the progress that has been made as well as the other favourable circumstances in relation to easier marketing which have been mentioned.</P>
    <P>With regard to specific services, I would like to support what Deputy Derrig said in relation to Gaeltacht housing, that it is reasonably satisfactory. Some of these households have availed themselves of the sanitary facilities which are now supported by free grant.  In that connection, I should like to inquire whether Gaeltacht Services have ever had any contact or collaboration with the tourist board in relation to a provision in one of the Tourist Acts whereby loans would be provided to enable people in the Gaeltacht areas to improve and <Col N="916" /> extend their houses so that they might take advantage of at least some of the tourist industry and at the same time that the facilities for people living outside the Gaeltacht to spend holidays in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht and improve their children's knowledge of Irish would be increased.</P>
    <P>I am not aware of any extended use having been made in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht or Breac-Ghaeltacht of the provisions which were then provided under the Tourist Act.  Perhaps the housing services of Gaeltacht Services might, in fact, be better able to administer such a service.  Whoever might be chosen to administer it, it seems to me that the idea is a good one, a laudable one from any aspect from which one might look at it, and I would ask the Minister to try, either through the agency of his own Department or through that of Industry and Commerce, to see that it is revived and put into effective use.</P>
    <P>There has been a very satisfactory increase in the number of houses provided under the Gaeltacht Housing Section, but I am sure the Minister, and certainly his advisers, are aware of one governing factor in relation to this matter and that is that the county council gives as much money again by way of grant as is given by Gaeltacht Services.  Instead of a man having to depend on a £250 grant he now gets £500.  The Minister's Department in recent months have in fact sent some of their officials into the various Gaeltachts to clear up whatever arrears of work existed there at the request and for the benefit, so far as I know, of the county council housing schemes. Galway County Council issued a notice about six months ago that they would not entertain any further applications for housing grants after March this year, but would deal with all applications received during the last financial year.  I have not seen any late development in relation to this matter, but the public are entitled to expect from the notice that has been given, that no further supplementary grant will be paid by Galway County Council.</P>
    <P>That being so, the Minister, I am sure, must expect that expenditure on <Col N="917" /> the Gaeltacht Services will drop; I cannot see how it can possibly increase because I know from my own experience that very few Fíor-Ghaeltacht applicants will undertake the building of new houses on a grant of £250 if the county council, as is apparently its intention, is going to stop giving these supplementary grants.</P>
    <P>The increase in the amount provided for grants under this Estimate is to be welcomed, but I hope that the Minister will, by legislation if necessary, see that these moneys will be spent.  What I refer to is this: If in fact the Galway County Council puts into effect a notice it has already given that supplementary grants will cease, that the Minister will increase the grant now payable to Fíor-Gaeltacht applicants so that this desirable work of Fíor-Ghaeltacht housing can be continued. I do not have to tell him that very few people will be able to undertake the erection of houses if the supplementary grant is not available.</P>
    <P>In relation to that, there is one other big difficulty for a number of people&mdash; I do not say it applies in all cases, but it does apply in a number of them&mdash; and that is the ability of applicants to get the initial quantity of materials which enables a man to begin building operations.  They go into Galway and have the official sanction in their pockets and ask to be given on credit a certain quantity of materials.  In recent times the builders' suppliers have been refusing these quantities of materials unless they receive a down payment of £100.</P>
    <P>I think I am right when I say&mdash; although my statement has been denied officially recently&mdash;that the practice used to be that once a man was given a housing sanction an official of the housing section placed the order with the supplier and because an official placed it the goods were sent out to the applicant who was able there and then to start operations. As a matter of fact that was the big attraction of a Gaeltacht housing grant as compared with a local government housing grant and it was not the difference in the amount of the grant which is only about £15.  The <Col N="918" /> real attraction was the facility afforded in the delivery of the stuff on the site on the order of Gaeltacht Services.</P>
    <P>I have been told by some official source&mdash;I cannot recollect which&mdash;that that was not the practice at any time, but I have been inquiring in my constituency, and I have been told by people who have had some contact with this problem that it was so.  However, I do not want to argue on that minor point, but I would like the Minister to say that in the administration of this very useful service whatever improvements have been found in practice to be necessary will be introduced and applied.  That is one difficulty which I have outlined for the Minister and it is a very real difficulty. It seems to me he will have to increase the Gaeltacht housing grants if the county council supplementary grant is withdrawn and it therefore seems that a larger increase than £10,000 will be necessary.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Minister will have any difficulty in having a proposal of that kind adopted by the House.  I commend these remarks with regard to Gaeltacht housing to his favourable and early consideration.  Perhaps he might verify by inquiring from the county manager or the county secretary of Galway and other Gaeltacht county councils what the intention is in each of these counties and he would then be better able to decide what changes, if any, it would be necessary to introduce into Gaeltacht housing administration.</P>
    <P>I have been very interested in the remarks of Deputy Derrig and Deputy J. Brennan about the tweed industry. My only regret in regard to it is that it seems to be concentrated in one area.  Deputy Brennan had a complaint somewhat similar in relation to marine products industries and he seemed to think that we had a monopoly of them down South.  Perhaps Gaeltacht Services may be regionalising their various industries and if that is the case and if they have good reason for it I would not offer too great an objection, but I think, seeing that there is a boom&mdash;as has been admitted on all sides&mdash;in tweed and that there is a good demand which, so far as anyone can see, is likely to continue, the <Col N="919" /> Minister should seriously explore the possibility of extending the tweed industry to other areas and continue the good work, which was more evident in previous years, of training apt and likely young lads in, say, weaving and spinning.</P>
    <P>With regard to the knitting side of the industry, I want to express a complaint on behalf of some of the girls engaged in the industry.  Where there is not a finishing machine, after the girls have spent their day on the knitting, they take home the work they have produced during the day in the knitting centre.  The finishing is done by hand very often up to 11 o'clock and 12 o'clock at night in districts which have not yet got the benefit of rural electrification.  The work is very severe on the eyes of even these youngsters and it does have the effect of extending the hours of operation by anything from 30 to 40 per cent.  I think that is too long and I know that it has had the effect of sending some of these girls off to other employment elsewhere.</P>
    <P>It is the &ldquo;elsewhere&rdquo; that we always object to and the great advantage of these industries was that there was not any &ldquo;elsewhere&rdquo; necessary, that they had it right near their own homes, and that that most undesirable form of emigration, namely, of young girls, was checked to some extent.  I want to appeal as strongly as I can to the Minister to ensure that no one who wears a pair of socks made in a Gaeltacht knitting centre will be able to say that he is wearing a pair of socks produced by sweated labour or labour that is over-worked and under-paid.</P>
    <P>I do not want to suggest that this position which I have outlined is typical or general.  I came across it in just one or two centres and the explanation given is understandable&mdash; that it is not easy to get these finishing machines.  It may have been righted since I last got the complaint, and, if it has, I shall be very glad to hear it, but I would ask that the Department do everything they can to get an adequate supply of these machines as quickly as possible, so that <Col N="920" /> none of these girls will have to work a half hour after they leave the centre unless they so choose themselves.</P>
    <P>In connection with knitting, on one or two occasions, I have asked that home work be provided for girls or for girls who have been employed and who have got married and want to continue their earning, that some system might be devised to foster home work of that kind and that the marketing facilities of the Department be made available to them.  I know that it is not easy for the officials to organise a developmen of that sort without help, but now that Bantracht na Tuatha, the Irish Countrywomen's Association&mdash;and I am sure there are other bodies that would also help&mdash;are in existence in a great many of these areas, their services might be requested to help in the extension of this employment in the knitting industry.  It is well to know that these girls and young married women are prepared to carry on this work and to do it in their own time, without being herded into a centre supervised by a Departments appointee.  Such a development would produce very good results, and, if there is a book in these goods, as has been said, it seems to me that the present time might be opportune to try out a development along these lines.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to say what finished articles are made from the semi-processed raw materials which we send out from our marine-processing factories.  We have only one under official control in Kilkerrin, but none of us not intimately associated with the Department is aware what the final products produced from these raw materials are.  I have no doubt at all that the Minister's advisers have examined the possibilities of carrying on these further processes here in Ireland, and that, if it is possible to carry out all the stages of processing to the final finished articles, the Department officials are well equal to the task of taking advantage of any favourable conditions which would help to bring about that desirable position; but it would be well if the Minister would inform the public, through the House, about the difficulties of having these raw materials processed to the last <Col N="921" /> stage, because there is a good deal of comment on the fact that we half process sea-rods and other forms of seaweed and send out a very useful and valuable raw material to other countries and that they, in fact, reap the big harvest from their exploitation.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister inform myself as to how the Spiddal toy factory is getting on?  One unit of it, which was located at Casla, some miles further west, was accidentally burned down some years ago, and all the activities then concentrated in Spiddal.  I am aware that one part of the process there was dropped and that there is only one kind of toy being made there now, or at least one type of material being used in the making of these toys, and that the lead article has been dropped altogether.  Perhaps the Minister would give me some information about it.</P>
    <P>Under sub-head G, Miscellaneous Services, there is a reference to boat-building and repair, that is, loans for boat-building and repair.  I should like to request that the good offices of this Department be used to try to induce the Department of Education to initiate a scheme under their vocational education services for instructing young men and boys in boat-building and boat-repairing.  Only one stretch of the coast has been brought to my attention in this connection but the educational services in the matter might be of interest in other stretches of the coast as well.  I am referring now to the South Connemara coast, west of Spiddal.</P>
    <P>From time immemorial, there has always been a big traffic in turf across Galway Bay.  Prior to the advent of the lorry, North Clare used to get its turf supplies from Connemara in &ldquo;hookers&rdquo;.  The trade to North Clare has practically disappeared with the advent of the motor lorry but the Aran Islands still depend on the availability of &ldquo;hookers&rdquo; to get their supplies of turf.  We who represent those areas would wish to avoid the necessity of calling in Bord na Móna to supply the Aran Islands with the turf produced in Attymon.  That would mean much longer land transport to the waterside than <Col N="922" /> is now the case and, in any event, the direct personal contact between buyer and seller would undergo a very big change.  Each of these householders in the islands has his own supplier.  They know each other for a long time and the trade is well established by practice and tradition.  Inevitably it must cease if the number of boats along the Connemara coast is not maintained.</P>
    <P>I have been told that the number of boatwrights has dwindled away&mdash;and when I use the word &ldquo;boatwrights&rdquo; I am to include men who are capable of carrying out repairs on these boats.  I have been told that there is a real need for instruction&mdash;which need not be for over a very long period&mdash;in that particular subject along certain sections of the coast.  The matter is apposite because under &ldquo;Miscellaneous Services&rdquo; there is available assistance for the purchase and repair of turf boats.  If the knowledge of building and repairing these boats disappears the desire to buy one of them would also disappear because nobody is going to undertake the maintenance of a boat if, in fact, he knows nothing about it.</P>
    <P>When I was referring to the desirability of establishing the manufacture of the goods marketed by Gaeltacht Services in the homes I should have adverted to item 1 under sub-head G, Loans for the Purchase of Machines and Equipment for Rural Industries. I should like to suggest that the facility provided there would be advertised and made available to as many applicants as possible, if the Department can get the machines.  From my inquiries, I seem to have the impression that it is not easy to get them.  However, if they become readily available I would ask that a serious effort be made to increase the home use of such machines.</P>
    <P>I think I can finish very shortly by one reference to sub-head H&mdash; Appropriations-in-Aid.  Item 1 gives receipts from sales of products of rural industries as £500,030 and under the same paragraph at (a) workers' wages are given as £131,300.  I should like to suggest to the Minister that the gap between these two figures might be reduced.  I think a serious effort ought <Col N="923" /> to be made to ensure that the actual workers get a larger proportion of that £500,030 than the £131,300 which the Minister now reports.  I do not want to offer uninformed criticism now but it does seem to me to be a matter that requires careful and sympathetic consideration&mdash;and sympathetic consideration in so far as these hand workers are concerned.  If the Minister can improve the share which the workers get out of these appropriations he will confer a very real benefit on the persons for whom, primarily, these industries were established.  I commend that matter to the Minister's careful consideration and I have no doubt but that it will get it.</P>

      <P>Níl rún agam cur isteach ró-fhada a dhéanamh ar am nó ar obair na Dála, ach ba mhaith liom cúpla focal a rá ar an Meastachán seo le haghaidh Seirbhísí na Gaeltachta.  Tá a fhios ag achan duine gur ceist náisiúnta í ceist na Gaeltachta.  Má táimid le slánú a dhéanamh ar an nGaeltacht, rud nach féidir le muintir na Gaeltachta a dhéanamh iad féin, caithfimid cuidiú na Roinne, agus cuidiú níos mó agus níos feárr, a thabhairt dóibh go ceann mórán blianta.</P>
      <P>Tá a fhios againne, atá inár gcónaí sa Ghaeltacht agus a tógadh sa nGaeltacht, gur ceist aimhréiteach do Rialtas ar bith í ceist na Gaeltachta.  Ba mhaith liomsa a rá fosta gur dhein achan Rialtas, ó cuireadh an Stát ar bun, a ndícheall leis an Ghaeltacht a neartú agus le cuidiú leis na daoine ansin ar achan dóigh.</P>
      <P>Mar dhaoine atá inár gcónaí ansin, tá a fhios againn nach bhfuil go leor déanta, go bhfuil an imirce ag dul ar aghaidh blian ina dhiaidh bliana.  Tá a fhios againn go bhfuil daoine óga ag imeacht agus, i gcás cuid de na seandaoine atá fágtha sa bhaile, nach bhfuil siad ábalta aon obair a dhéanamh, agus mar sin go bhfuil siad san ag dul anonn go hAlbain nó go Sasana go dtí a ngaolta.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá an Stát seo ar bun le mórán <Col N="924" /> blianta anois, ach tá an scéal céanna ag dul ar aghaidh blian in ndiaidh bliana. Tá a fhios againn nach bhfuilimid ag déanamh go léor don Ghaeltacht.  Tig linn níos mó a dhéanamh leis an cheist seo a réiteach.  Tá a fhios againn gurb é an cuspóir a bhí iomhainn, tráth, an Ghaeltacht a leathnú amach ar fud na tíre, ach tá fhios againn nach ar an dóigh sin atá sé ag dul ach go bhfuil an Ghaeltacht ag éirí níos bige ó bhliain go blian agus nach mbeidh sé i bhfad go dtí nach mbeidh Gaeltacht ar bith fágtha sa chuid sin den tír.</P>
    <P>Is é mo bharúil go gcaithfear comhcheangal níos fearr a bheith againn anseo le obair na Gaeltachta ón Roinn agus ón Rialtas.  Ba cheart iad uilig a bheith ag dul ar aghaidh le chéile.  Tuigimid go cruinn nach dtig le Seirbhísí na Gaeltachta&mdash;maith agus tá an obair atá deanta acu agus maith agus tá an obair atá siad a chur rómpu &mdash;nach dtig leo an Ghaeltacht a shlanú iad féin.  Barraíocht na dtionscal atá ar bun sa tír seo cuireadh sna bailte móra iad.  Dá gcuirtí níos mó tionscal sna háiteanna iargcúlta, sna ceantracha Gaeltachta, sílimse go mbeadh an scéal níos fearr anois.</P>
    <P>Bhí áthas orm go raibh an tAire i ndan a insint dúinn go bhfuil méadú mór ar thionscal an bhréidín i dTír Chonaill.  Ba mhaith liomsa comhghairdeachas a dhéanamh leis agus le oifigigh na Roinne as an dea obair atá déanta acu, le roint bhlian, leis an tionscal a cur ar aghaidh.  Tá súil agam go leanfar leis an obair sin.  Is tionscal a é atá ag tabhairt oibre do na céadta den aos óg i dTír Chonaill.</P>
    <P>Cuireann sé pléisiúir orm go bhfuil na figiúirí i mbliana níos mó na bhí blianta eile.  Tá súil agam go mbeidh an obair seo ag dul ar aghaidh.</P>
    <P>Bheirimse mo bheannacht don Mheastachán seo agus tá mé cinnte go ndéanfaidh an tAire atá anseo againn anois, go ndéanfaidh seisean an obair chomh maith le hAire ar bith eile. Fear é a bhfuil fonn air aire a thabhairt do Sheirbhísí na Gaeltachta agus tá fhios agam go ndéanfaidh sé achan rud le saol na ndaoine a dhéanamh níos fearr.</P>
    <P>This Vote for Gaeltacht Services provides the Deputies with an opportunity <Col N="925" /> of saying a few words on the position of the Gaeltacht.  It provides them with a few hours on one day in the year of expressing their sympathy and of expressing their desire to see the Gaeltacht improved.  However, the speeches which have been made here for many years past have been of the same type as those which are being made to-day.  During that time, Governments have come and Governments have gone, but with all the expressions of sympathy that have been made in the House and with all the good work that the various Ministers and Departments have done to save the Gaeltacht for the nation, unfortunately the position there is worse to-day than any time during the past 50 years.</P>
    <P>I am casting no reflection whatsoever on the present Minister for Lands because I know he is as interested in affairs of the Gaeltacht as any Minister who went before him.  Each one of them in his own way did his utmost to give us a better type of life in the Gaeltacht areas, to help the people there, but the position to-day is not a good one.  We in Donegal have as much migration&mdash;perhaps more &mdash;to-day than we had 50, 60 or 80 years ago.  The young people are going away from their homes in hundreds and, unfortunately, the older people are going also.  They are now setting up homes in Glasgow, Clydebank and various cities throughout Britain.  The migration to-day is of such a magnitude that it should be one question that every Party must consider carefully in order to find out what can be done to save the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>We to-day enjoy freedom in the Twenty-Six Counties.  Men on all sides of the House have contributed much to give us that freedom and freedom has come to us because men were imbued with the love of the language, the love of Gaelic culture and everything else that is to be found to-day only in the Gaeltacht.  If we have our freedom to-day it is certainly due to a large extent to the people amongst the rocks and the hills and glens of the Gaeltacht areas around our coast who imbued those men with the desire to go out and achieve freedom for our <Col N="926" /> people.  It is a sad commentary that freedom having been achieved, those people should have to close their doors, should have to leave their homes and seek work across the water and after so many years of native Government it is a sad reflection on all the Governments that have been elected by our people.</P>
    <P>The people of the Gaeltacht do not want to leave their homes.  It has been said very often that the youth like to go across the Channel and to foreign countries.  That may be the desire of a small number but the majority are as fond of their homes as the people of Dublin, Waterford, Limerick or any other city.  I would go further and say that they have a greater love of their homes than any other people in this country because all down the centuries they have set their roots deep in the rocks and glens and hills and they have held on despite the economic pressure that has certainly been their lot since the first day their ancestors went into those barren parts of the country.  The nation owes much to them and I feel that the nation has not done and is not doing enough to stem the tide of emigration, to give them a better standard of living and to keep our people at work at home.</P>
    <P>Much has been done.  Every Government that has come along has certainly helped, in many ways, in the setting up of small industries in various parts of the country.  The toy industry has been successful, and we are glad to hear from the latest figures of the Minister that this industry is going ahead steadily.  The knitting industry, the homespun industry, and all the others have contributed a good deal and have helped in giving hundreds of our young people work at home.  But I do not think the Gaeltacht will be saved by the establishment of small factories giving work to a handful of boys and girls here and there, and that we must have a bolder outlook than we have hitherto had if anything effective is to be done for that part of the country. In respect of giving work to the girls, desirable as that may be, I think the Department must embark on a bold policy in order to provide employment <Col N="927" /> for the natural breadwinners of the family, the men and the boys. Until that is done we will have the men and boys going across the water to get employment while some of the girls remain at home and work in the Gaeltacht factories.</P>
    <P>During debates in this House Deputies have expressed the opinion that independent boards should be set up to look after various important problems and schemes in this country. That was evident on the Vote for Forestry the other night and I feel that if boards are to be established the Government should certainly consider the establishment of an independent board for the Gaeltacht.  Again I cast no reflection on the officials of the Department who have worked very hard all down the years and have made a success of their venture within the circumscribed limits that have been laid down by this House.  The officials naturally are able to do so much but outside that they cannot go and many people feel the only hope for the Gaeltacht area is an independent board that will grapple with this serious subject in a much bolder manner than it has been grappled with since the State was established.  We feel that if that were done perhaps something tangible would result from their efforts.</P>
    <P>We in the Gaeltacht had hoped that a Minister for the Gaeltacht would have been appointed just as there is a Minister for Industry and Commerce, a Minister for Education and other Ministries.  We were promised that some years ago and it was hailed with satisfaction in the Gaeltacht areas but so far I have seen no indication that the Government intend to implement their promise.</P>
    <P>I welcome the increase in the provision for rural industries; the increase of £28,000 for materials for the tweed industry; £11,500 extra for knitwear; an extra £2,500 for embroidery; and £3,500 extra for the toy industry.  That is a step in the right direction and will help even in a small way in the rural areas and the Gaeltacht areas and I hope that trend continues.  As I have already said we were glad to hear from the Minister that the sales of homespuns <Col N="928" /> are increasing and that there has already been an increase as regards the knitwear, toy and embroidery industries.</P>
    <P>There is just one statement of the Minister's with which I do not agree and that is the decrease of £2,000 in the provision for advertising and publicity. If our industries are going ahead fairly well at the moment, if there is such an improvement in our homespun industry, this is not the time to cut advertising.  It would not be the policy of an ordinary business concern, if their sales were expanding, to cut advertising at that particular time. Rather would it be their policy to add to their advertising commitments because only in that way can we hope to envisage any success over the years.  I would ask the Minister to reconsider that decision of his and to increase the advertising and publicity provision by at least £2,000 and show that we have some faith in the industry and some faith in the future.</P>
    <P>I am also glad that Gaeltacht housing has been so successful.  That is one of the Department's sections that is to be congratulated for doing great work in the Gaeltacht areas, and satisfactory progress has been made all over the country.  The new departure under recent Gaeltacht Housing Acts in regard to the provision of grants for additional accommodation to houses in the Gaeltacht as well as the installation of sewerage and water facilities has been a great help to the people there.</P>
    <P>There is one industry in the Gaeltacht that has not yet been fully implemented and that is the tourist industry.  The efforts of the Department of Lands in providing better houses for the people and providing extra grants for extra accommodation for visitors and for the keeping of students who go to the Gaeltacht, has certainly been appreciated by the people.  It has meant that hundreds of families who otherwise would have emigrated to Scotland and England have remained at home.  Tourist industry is growing in the Gaeltacht because it is in the Gaeltacht we have the most beautiful scenery in Ireland <Col N="929" /> and it is to the Gaeltacht areas the people would go, as Deputy Derrig said in his speech, if those amenities were provided.  It is possible for the people now to obtain grants for the installation of water and sewerage facilities and in a great number of the Gaeltacht areas that has already been done.</P>
    <P>If the Gaeltacht is to survive, and I am sure it is the wish of every Deputy and Party in the House that it should, the Government will have to take the matter firmly in hands to ensure that the running sore of emigration, which has continued year after year, will stop, and so that we in this country will be able to provide work for our people and that the young men in the Gaeltacht will have as much interest in their own country as they have at the moment in the economic affairs of Scotland and England.  It is a sad reflection that so many of our young people grow up, and know more about the economic advancement of cities in Scotland and England than they do about the affairs in their own country. They feel that, having been brought into the world in the Gaeltacht areas, their only outlook is to get out of them as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I suggest that much more effective steps must be taken in the future if the Gaeltacht is to survive.  The position there could not be more serious than it is, and in a few years, unless drastic steps are taken to remedy the present situation, I am of the opinion that the necessity for bringing this Vote into the House will not arise at all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOConnor" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to be very brief in the remarks which I have to make on this Estimate.  I have listened with interest to the debate which has taken place during the past few hours in regard to the position in the Gaeltacht areas.  I was agreeably surprised to learn that in some of the Gaeltacht areas, certain types of industry are flourishing.  Part of the constituency which I have the honour to represent comprises the Gaeltacht areas of Ballyferriter, Dunquin, Caus and Feonagha. There is a definite problem in those areas, and I would appeal to the <Col N="930" /> Minister and to the Department to investigate the conditions there.</P>
      <P>I know from my own knowledge that no attempt whatever is being made&mdash; that is from the departmental point of view&mdash;to maintain the people in those areas.  No attempt is being made to establish industries there.  The people have been left to fend for themselves. From my investigations, I find that they are living principally on the dole, and are fashioning their lives on it. The result of the situation there is that the young people are emigrating. In doing so they are at a decided disadvantage because, although most of them have English, they still find it hard to understand English-speaking people at the other side or to be understood themselves.</P>
      <P>In my opinion emigration will solve the problem in those particular areas. It has solved it to a certain extent.  I think that, with a good energetic approach, what remains of the population there could be maintained if some attempt were made to establish some type of industry.  Deputy Breslin, when speaking of the position in his constituency, referred to the fact that women and girls employed in certain type of industry there were able to earn some money, but mentioned, and rightly so, that as regards the breadwinner of the family no provision was being made to put him into employment. If the Gaeltacht is as important to our nationality as we are told it is, I think that a more vigorous effort should be made to maintain it, even if that involves some cost to the taxpayer.  I do not think the taxpayer would begrudge any expenditure that would have to take place in those Gaeltacht areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the areas which I have mentioned, emigration is a very real problem.  The young people are leaving.  The old people who remain in the family homesteads have, eventually, to be transferred to the county home which is 70 miles distant. At the age of 75 and 80 they are transferred into absolutely anglicised surroundings. They do not live long in those surroundings and die of broken hearts.  At the meetings of our local authority, I have time and again <Col N="931" /> raised the question of establishing a home for these old people in the Dingle area, but I have not succeeded in my effort.</P>
    <P>I want to say to the Minister that I have no solution for this problem.  In my opinion, however, no effort is being made by this Department to solve, or to offer a solution for, the unemployment problem in those areas.  I would earnestly appeal to the Minister that he should make some effort to solve it.</P>
    <P>The people remaining in those areas are obliged to fashion their lives on the miserable pittance which they receive in the form of dole from the employment exchange.  That, surely, is a tragedy&mdash;to see the grand old Gaelic stock reduced to that position.  I have already said that emigration is surely but slowly solving this whole problem. I would say that in five years' time there will be no problem in those areas because emigration will have solved it. If the Minister and his Department have a solution for it, I would suggest to him that he should apply it as quickly as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney:</NameTxt>
      <P>In the statement made by the Minister in moving this Estimate, there seemed to be an air of satisfaction expressed in regard to what is being done and what has been done over not only the past year, but in the years gone by.  While I will give the Minister and the officials of his Department full credit for doing well that which they are doing, like all the other speakers from both sides of the House I am very far from satisfied that we are doing enough, or nearly enough, to remedy the problems outlined or to maintain and expand the Gaeltacht.  I think it is true to say that we are not primarily motivated with the idea of merely maintaining the Gaeltacht; the hope is that in the maintenance of the Gaeltacht and in the building up of the areas that remain we will in time spread out from those areas and gradually make them bigger and bigger until such time as the ideal will be reached wherein these areas will expand in all directions until they have covered the entire country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, while the Department is doing <Col N="932" /> well that which it has undertaken in relation to the Gaeltacht, we are very far from maintaining, never mind expanding, the Gaeltacht area.  Like Deputy Breslin, whom I heard speak a short time ago, my experience is the same as his in regard to the Gaeltacht in Donegal.  We have at the present time a greater emigration, if anything, than we have ever had from these areas.  The most noticeable change in the emigration pattern to-day as compared with ten to 20 years ago is that, in the past&mdash;and I remember this quite well in the Gaeltacht areas close to me &mdash;it was the younger people or possibly the breadwinner of the family who went away and the parents and the wife stayed at home.  Those who went away, too, stayed away only a few months and then returned home again.</P>
    <P>The present pattern is, as Deputy Breslin pointed out, quite different. That trend has changed and we now find, if the breadwinner goes across to England or Scotland, another member of the family shortly joins that first emigrant and, in a very short time, the home is locked up; the locks are put on the doors; the windows are barred and the family has departed, not for a month or a year, but for good.</P>
    <P>That is the picture in the Gaeltacht near where I come from, Fanad and Rossguill.  I know these two areas intimately and have observed the trend there over a considerable time. That is the picture, and a very, very sad picture it is.</P>
    <P>What then, may we ask, can we do about it?  The Minister will say that small factories are being and have been established here and there throughout the Gaeltacht areas and that they have proved successful ventures.  Admittedly, successful weaving industries have been established in certain areas, but could we not get down to establishing the weaving industry in all the Gaeltachts?  Could we not develop the toy industry to the extent where we would have a demand for toys from more factories other than those we have already established?  Could we not give to other Gaeltacht areas which have no industries the factories <Col N="933" /> that would be required to meet that development?</P>
    <P>In my own county I know that, so far as weaving is concerned, there appears to be a demand sufficient to induce private individuals to establish weaving industries, particularly in the Rossguill peninsula; and in Downings we have a man who is doing his utmost to try to get a weaving industry established in the area.  As the Minister and his Department can well understand, there is no tradition of weaving in that area to-day&mdash;if there was a tradition there in the past it has died out &mdash;and his difficulties are almost insurmountable. In the light of that knowledge our local vocational committee has recently endeavoured to establish a weaving class in which, although it may be of short duration, some of the fundamentals and some of the rudiments of weaving technique will be imparted to the people interested in the Downings area so that the individual to who I have referred, who is making an effort to establish weaving in that district, will have hands not completely devoid of technique.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why, since the market appears to be there&mdash;and not only there but expanding&mdash;in such a Gaeltacht area as Rossguill, where there is absolutely nothing to provide employment for the people, the Department could not come in at this stage and make an effort to develop a weaving centre in the district.</P>
    <P>Over the years different Departments have been more or less dabbling in the Gaeltacht.  I use the word &ldquo;dabbling&rdquo; deliberately.  We have had efforts made to preserve the Gaeltacht, such as that made by the Department of Education in giving grants to members of Irish speaking families.  Recently we have had the Undeveloped Areas Act which was directed in the main not only to the Gaeltacht areas, but to the congested areas.  That Act is administered by the Department of Industry and Commerce. If all the efforts and resources of the different Departments interested in the Gaeltacht could be co-ordinated we might achieve some measure of success.  If not alone the experts <Col N="934" /> administering these different measures but the money these efforts are costing the various Departments and the State generally could be brought together under the one head so that all efforts towards helping the Gaeltacht would flow from that head, then we could really make a start which would give promise of a successful conclusion.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that, despite the methods and the manner in which we are doing things at the moment, good as they are in their own way, we shall ever reach the goal which has been the aim of this House for many years, namely, the expansion of the Gaeltacht until it spreads out and covers the entire country.  Working as we are at the moment, I do not think we shall ever attain that ambition.  Even though the work being done is good, the proof is there that all efforts so far have been a dismal failure.</P>
    <P>Should it be our last effort, I believe that we should try now, immediately, to bring all the resources together, resources which in the past have been operated by various Departments of State, properly co-ordinated under either a Minister or a Government sponsored board to look after the Gaeltacht and whose job only it would be to look after the welfare of the Gaeltacht and the people in the Gaeltacht. If such a board or ministry were established many things, in addition to weaving and toy making, could be brought under its purview.</P>
    <P>I see every reason why, for instance, the glasshouse scheme administered by the Department of Agriculture should be in the hands of a Minister solely in charge of development in the Gaeltacht. It is known as the Gaeltacht glasshouse scheme so that it is a name tied up with the Gaeltacht and its functions are centred in the Gaeltacht. There is every reason why that scheme should be taken up by the proposed board or new ministry and it should, and could, be extended in a way that is not realised at the present time by this House.  Such a scheme could give much employment and prosperity to those engaged in it.  All we have got to do is to walk through the streets of Dublin at the moment and look at <Col N="935" /> the cost of lettuce.  That lettuce could be grown in our Gaeltacht glasshouses. We could have our own lettuce plants supplying our own market and in that way we would be getting good money for the Gaeltacht and at the same time repaying the people of Dublin by giving them an adequate supply of these early vegetables in the late spring or early summer.</P>
    <P>That scheme could be extended very much now due to the fact that rural electrification has now become available in those areas.  In the past they had to depend on cold houses, glasshouses without heat, as to provide heat would have been too costly.  With rural electrification going through the country and private houses being connected we now have a golden opportunity for the full development of this glasshouse scheme which should be handled by a board whose sole responsibility would be the welfare of the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>In addition to that scheme there is another scheme which is already being dealt with by the Department for Lands.  I refer to seaweed meal.  So far as I know and can find out, this seaweed meal has turned out to be quite a good proposition, but from inquiries which I made a year or so ago it would seem that not many men in my part of the country, along the seaboard of Donegal, would be induced by the price offered to go in for it in any permanent way.  If it would be possible to give a little more money for the seaweed that is available on the coastline for the purpose of that seaweed meal scheme, I would recommend such an increase.</P>
    <P>I would also be inclined to turn over the question of the fish meal plants and the fish canning industry to this proposed board.  As we see it at the moment, this scheme is being handled by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, and handled well by them, but I think that they are not handling it so well as far as the Gaeltacht is concerned in so far as we find that their bias is away from the Gaeltacht.  Perhaps I should not say that there is any bias, but they are not using the ports available around our coasts in a manner that <Col N="936" /> could be the most helpful to the Gaeltacht, and they have not made any effort whatever to set up either a fish meal plant or a canning industry in any of the Gaeltacht ports.  It is fairly true to say that the fishing ports of our county, Downings and Bunbeg, not only should have lent themselves to this development, but from the point of view of the fishermen would have been ideally situated and would have been much more suitable than where the port was set up, in Killybegs.  That question could very well come within the province of any new board or ministry charged with the welfare of the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>In part of the Fanad Gaeltacht we have very large deposits of granite and, prior to the war, this granite was being worked and exported to Britain and was in very big demand, particularly in London.  Since the war several efforts have been made to get this industry under way again.  I have been very interested in the matter and I know from my investigations that a good market is available for granite in England at the moment, a market at a profitable price.  I got this information by going over there occasionally, but I know that one of the stumbling blocks is that it is impossible to get people with sufficient capital interested in the development of these quarries.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate and sad to see these granite quarries lying idle all through the Fanad Gaeltacht while we have the young men and women either migrating or emigrating and the houses being closed within sight of the quarries. Those quarries have been closed for the lack of finance despite the fact that in England and in London there is a satisfactory and profitable market waiting for their products.  I believe that this is a matter that should be put under the protection of some board that would have the power, control and finance to go ahead and do a good job which would be profitable not only to the people of the Gaeltacht but to the national income and national economy.</P>
    <P>You may well say that the setting up of such a board or ministry would constitute certain difficulties which would <Col N="937" /> have to be overcome, not the least of which would be the question of finance. As I have already said, if the moneys being expended directly or indirectly by the various Departments dealing with the Gaeltacht were all brought together you would find that you would have a fairly substantial sum to work on.  If that was not sufficient you have in the National Development Fund powers enabling the Government to advance from that fund sufficient money to carry on until your next Budget is being considered.</P>
    <P>In addition to that, you would and could have brought within workable conditions the Undeveloped Areas Act. Surely the fruits of that could be utilised to the benefit of the board or ministry?  I could visualise the board or ministry setting up these industries and not merely asking or encouraging private individuals to do so.  They themselves should do it.  They have done so with regard to the toy factories.  The glasshouse scheme could be expanded and extended in all the Gaeltacht areas.  The board could develop the granite quarries in the Fanad peninsula and all other matters which might be found useful.  The board or ministry should be aided and helped by the provisions of the Undeveloped Areas Act.  In that way they would get from the Act the same facilities as a private company or individual who proposed to set up an industry in any of the congested areas.</P>
    <P>If those things were done, and done immediately, there would still be hope that the Gaeltacht could be saved.  I say &ldquo;hope&rdquo; because it is only a hope. We have not been realistic enough.  I think we have not been close enough to the happenings in the Gaeltacht over the years to realise just how the Gaeltacht has been dwindling.  It may not be dwindling so far as area is concerned; it may not be dwindling so far as the number of people in it at any given time is concerned but when one goes to the Gaeltacht one sees that there is a lack of life there and a lack of spirit in the people in contrast to the position which obtained years ago.</P>
    <P>I can remember the manner in which crowds of boys and girls could be found at the crossroads in the Gaeltacht <Col N="938" /> night after night enjoying innocent games and pleasures.  That enthusiasm helped to maintain the Gaeltacht and retain in it the young people.  If you go out to-day to any of the Gaeltachts I know of in County Donegal you will not find, except by accident, more than two people at any crossroads at any time.  That in itself is a much more telling picture than any record that anybody can produce in this House.</P>
    <P>The young people are dispirited.  The young people who can leave have left. They may come home for a few years but eventually all of them are a total loss to this country.  We have got to face up to the fact that the Gaeltacht is dying and dying fast.  Despite what may appear on the surface at the moment, despite the fact that there are houses in the Gaeltacht that appear to be occupied, anybody who knows the Gaeltacht inside out will realise that the Gaeltacht is dying. People should not be taken in by outward appearance.  The final death knell of the Gaeltacht will sound some day and that day may not be very far away unless the Government and all the members of this House get together and hammer out a plan in a last and final effort.  We must put everything we have got into the effort to stem the flood of emigration and bring back prosperity to the Gaeltacht areas.  We have got to do that if we want to save the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the Minister and all members of this House, however remotely connected with the Gaeltacht, or even if they are not connected with the Gaeltacht at all, are agreed that the Gaeltacht should be saved.  We know what the Gaeltacht and all it stands for has meant down the centuries.  Knowing that, we should deal with it in a manner befitting such an important task.  I do not make any apologies for saying that in the past we did not deal with the Gaeltacht in that light.  We have not treated it with the respect, the enthusiasm and courage that we might have.  It is true to say that the many other big problems that had to be solved over recent years since we got a national Government were a heavy burden on the Government of the day. <Col N="939" /> They may have been misled into believing that what they were doing for the Gaeltacht was sufficient.</P>
    <P>It is now clear that it is not sufficient and will not be sufficient in the future.  We must do more.  I commend the suggestion of a board to the Minister.  It is not my suggestion but that of many people who have studied the Gaeltacht problem from A to Z and who know all about the Gaeltacht&mdash;far more than I do.  A board or a special ministry should be set up.  If that course is adopted the various jobs of the other Departments now being carried on either directly or indirectly to help the Gaeltacht should be turned over to this board.  Any legislation required to set the board or ministry going to establish industries in the Gaeltacht should be passed in this House and I believe every Deputy in this House would welcome such legislation.</P>
    <P>The Minister is a West of Ireland man himself and has a good understanding of the problems involved.  In asking the Minister to get his Government to consider the matter I know I am asking someone who is sympathetic to this matter and who understands it as well as it can be understood.  In asking him to bring the suggestion before the Government I know that he will be one of the strongest advocates of the proposed plan.</P>
    <P>If that cannot be done, then some reliefs might be given in the very near future to the Gaeltacht areas in my own county.  Relief could be given to the weavers and dyers immediately under the present system.  I would ask the Minister to do something in that respect and request his Department's officials who are aware of developments to do something about it in Glenfin and other places where there are still the remnants of the Gaelic people.  There are also there public spirited people who are trying to establish a weaving industry in that area to stem the flood of emigration.  There is this question of the granite quarries.  That may not at the moment be the Minister's responsibility.  At the same time I feel that if the Minister could not do something himself he might use his influence <Col N="940" /> with the Department to try and have something done in this connection.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in the Fanad, Rossguill or Glenfin Gaeltachts except what the people scratch from the soil.  The people in those areas have been worked hard in the past.  They have not had life easy.  The younger elements see how easy life is across the water.  Can you blame them if they leave?  I certainly do not.  If we want them to stay we must make their lives at least livable in the conditions in which we put them.</P>
    <P>We can help now because there has been a great godsend in rural Ireland, that is rural electrification which is now being extended in the Gaeltacht of my county and will in itself be a tremendous help to make life more bearable.  In addition to that and the help of extending water supplies and sewerage schemes under the Department of Lands and other Departments and the building of new houses and the extending of houses&mdash;in addition to all those if we cannot find work for the people, them all we are doing in building and electrifying and in giving water and sewerage to the Gaeltacht will be lost together with the Gaeltacht itself and all that it has stood for down through the years.</P>

      <P>Deputy Brennan appears to think the prosperity Gaeltarra Éireann is enjoying at the moment is a temporary boom.  I do not think that that is so.  I would be rather inclined to regard it as being steady in that there is no likelihood of its being a boom and then falling on evil days again.  No doubt Deputy Brennan has in mind the experience that that Department suffered during the war, but these were exceptional circumstances.  The machinery was not available and, above all, replacements of machinery were not available and the emphasis was more on quantity than on quality during that period. Naturally this resulted, in the years following the war, in a building up of material which was easily outclassed in the market by the commercial firms. The position at the moment is very good in all branches of the industry <Col N="941" /> and that, I think, is principally due to the complete reorganisation that took place here some years ago.  It is now that the benefit of that reorganisation is taking effect.</P>
      <P>Taking the tweed side of the business alone, I think that the officials who are responsible for new designs and patterns are completely reorganising that tweed business so that the demand exceeds the supply.  I think that is a very heartening feature.  The same thing applies to every other branch, to toys and to seaweed as well.  The picture is very satisfactory and I think I would be misleading the House if I even hinted that this was just a temporary boom, because while the quality of output is maintained there is no doubt whatever about the success of the whole project.</P>
      <P>Deputy Derrig was anxious to get the percentage of tweeds supplied for home consumption.  At the time he was speaking I interjected to give him the figure which I thought was 50 per cent.  Actually the percentage supplied for home consumption is 58 per cent. against 41 per cent. or a little more supplied for export.  After supplying the home demand not alone for tweeds but for machine knitwear, hand-knitted gloves, embroidery, toys, shopping baskets, rugs and so on we are sending staff as far away as to the Argentine, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Cyprus, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Great Britain, Italy, Kenya, Luxembourg, Mexico, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United States of America.  The United States of America bought £11,100 worth from us last year. When I see Switzerland making purchases of toys it certainly makes me think.</P>
      <P>There was quite a number of queries regarding seaweed products.  The Bill that went through the House here&mdash; last October or November, I think&mdash;to expand the capital of that particular branch of the industry is just now coming into effect and a complete re-equipment and reorganisation of the little factory at Kilkerrin is under way at the present time.  It is hoped that it will be in production in August or in September next.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="942" /> One Deputy raised the question&mdash; why should we not do the whole processing at home?  I think I explained on former occasions that we have not the secret of doing that.  That belongs to a partner in the English side of the company, and apparently the secret of converting the ground sea-rod meal into alginic acid is one which we have not got, and apparently those who have it are guarding it very jealously.</P>
    <P>Somebody asked what articles are made from the ground sea-rod meal and for what purposes it is used.  It is used, for instance, for stabilising ice cream, creaming latex rubber, manufacture of jellies, pastes and lotions, textile printing, dental moulds and surgical blocks, etc.  These are some of the things that are made by this particular branch, and I would like to inform the House that the price of sea-rods and seaweed will be increased, or is increased, this year, and while the quantity that was for sale or gathered last year was small&mdash;due, I believe, to the excessively wet season&mdash;we hope it will be up this year, first because we hope for a dry summer, and secondly, because the price has been increased.</P>
    <P>I want to tell Deputy Brennan that the output at Kilcar has been doubled in the last two years and that the demand is still in excess of supply.  He was anxious that Gaeltarra Éireann should not go into competition with private firms.  We cannot help that.  We want to sell our products to the best advantage.  It is not our wish to go into competition with private firms because we would be very slow to injure them in any way as they are doing a good job of work too, but we must keep our workers employed and sell to the best advantage the products of these workers.  There is no way of getting round that, and if that is regarded as competition we cannot help it.  The only other way to deal with the difficulty is to close down and surely it is not proposed to do that?</P>
    <P>He mentioned the fact that some of Fogra Fáilte's publications had a statement that Gaeltarra Éireann was the sole producer of homespun tweeds. Gaeltarra Éirenn had nothing whatever to do with that particular statement, <Col N="943" /> and I might inform the Deputy that it has been corrected since.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bartley mentioned the fact that Galway County Council has intimated its intention to stop the supplementary housing grants to those who are building houses with housing grants in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht.  I think that is bad and I have not the slightest doubt that if the county council carries out that decision it will mean the virtual cessation, not alone of Gaeltacht, but of local government grant housing all over Galway.  I did gather from the Deputy's remarks that this might not be a firm decision of the council's as yet and let us hope that the new council that will be elected in a few weeks' time will revoke that decision and decide to go back to the old system of giving supplementary grants, because it is quite clear that there will be a steep drop in the building of Gaeltacht houses and local government grant houses in County Galway otherwise.</P>
    <P>In County Mayo, where I am fairly familiar with the conditions that exist, I believe that many houses that are being built or are to be built would not be tackled by the people if they did not get the supplementary grant from the county council.  I would ask Deputy Bartley to use his influence with Galway County Council so that they might reconsider the decision regarding supplementary grants.</P>
    <P>Sanitation grants are being availed of in increasing numbers and it is nice to see people who are building houses taking advantage of them.  As a matter of fact, it is much easier and cheaper to get sanitation and water installed when the house is being built than to have it patched on to the house which is already erected.</P>
    <P>Deputy Derrig said he would like to see an expansion of Gaeltacht Services industries and that there were plans for that in existence before the change of Government last year.  There were suggestions, but no actual sum was sanctioned up to June of last year, but there is a fairly large sum of money <Col N="944" /> available from the National Development Fund.  It will require very careful examination to see how best that expansion can be carried out. Inquiries are going on and have been going on for some time past, but are not yet complete.  I am not yet in a position to make a definite statement on the matter until these inquiries are complete and then I shall be only too glad to give the desired information to the House.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brennan mentioned that he would like an extension to the Bruckless lace centre.  As a matter of fact a considerable sum has been sanctioned for an extension to that particular industry and the work will be put in hands at the earliest possible moment.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Derrig who mentioned that a showroom would be a big advantage for displaying the various products of the Department. A sum of £400 has been sanctioned for the equipment and furnishing of a showroom in the central marketing depot in Dublin&mdash;and personnel are being trained&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We will try to put up finger posts to direct them.  Most of the foreign demand for tweeds is in Germany and Austria with some in the United States.  I think it was Deputy Brennan who asked if we were sure that some of the tweeds that were classified as being for our own market were not exported.  I am not sure; in fact, we know some of them are exported by those who buy from Gaeltarra Éireann but we do not know what quantity&mdash;it has never been checked.  About 58 per cent. of these tweeds are sold at home and 41 per cent. or thereabouts are exported.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Bartley mentioned the &ldquo;old system,&rdquo; as he described it, of the Department's purchasing housing materials for those who want to build houses.  I am informed that the materials were never ordered by the Gaeltacht Services Division.  It was always left to the person who got the grant to deal directly with the builders' suppliers himself or with his contractor. <Col N="945" /> A letter from the Department to the person who applied for the grant to the effect that the grant was sanctioned was usually considered sufficient bail, so to speak, to the builders' suppliers to supply the man with the materials and in certain cases the Department paid the grant direct, on the grantee's instructions, to the builders' suppliers in question.</P>
    <P>I think I have dealt with most of the points that have been raised and I am very glad to be able to report good progress in the work of the past year. I think I am not being over-optimistic when I say it is anticipated that by the time the Estimate comes before the House this time next year there will be a still further tale of progress to be reported.</P>

      <P>The next amount provided for in the Vote is £4,698,170 and represents a net decrease of £227,430 on the provision made in the financial year 1954-55.  There are no individual items of increase or decrease in the several sub-heads of the Vote which call for special mention except the increase of £250,000 in sub-head I (2) in respect of grants to private persons, public utility societies and other bodies for the erection and reconstruction of houses.  The total provision now being made under this head is £2,250,000, and later in my speech I will review the remarkable increase in <Col N="946" /> housing activity represented by this figure.</P>
      <P>The housing output of local authorities for the last financial year was 5,265 dwellings as compared with 5,643 dwellings completed in the financial year 1953-54.</P>
      <P>At the 31st March, 1955, 18 county councils and 24 urban authorities had satisfied or were approaching the satisfaction of the needs on which their post-war housing programmes were formulated.  The figures of completions and housing schemes in progress or at tender at that date indicated the satisfaction of 75 per cent. of the 1947 housing needs in urban areas outside Dublin and 96 per cent. of the corresponding figure for rural areas.  Nevertheless, there has been no substantial decrease in the overall figures of completions because of a considerable improvement in housing progress in Dublin City where 1,922 houses were completed in the year as against a total of 1,353 houses in the preceding financial year.</P>
      <P>In one or two areas, housing progress over the years has not been as good as that achieved generally and special attention is being given to these areas.  Apart from these exceptional cases, the only areas in which there may be some disposition to slow down the completion of the housing programmes are a few of the smaller and more economically depressed urban districts.  In some of these towns the discontinuance of housing activity would, I am afraid, leave unattended the housing requirements of those persons who are really most in need of rehousing as they are the poorest sections who have been unable to pay the rents for the normal type of house built in such places up to the present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the difficult financial position facing these councils and, on the other hand, in view of the permanent necessity for rehousing those classes to which I have referred, I am prepared to consider sympathetically any reasonable proposals for the building of small houses to meet the needs of the smaller families in need of rehousing and of those families in existing council houses who by reason of depletion in their numbers could now be <Col N="947" /> suitably accommodated in smaller houses.  The provision of varied accommodation in council housing estates and the adjustment of tenancies to meet family needs is an ideal principle of housing management for any housing authority to adopt but, in the case of those areas to which I have referred, where housing expenditure represents a disproportionately high burden on the local rates, it is a principle that should be put into practice unhesitantly to as wide an extent as possible.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the encouraging increase in the Dublin Corporation housing output.  I have reason to believe that that position will be maintained in 1955-56 and that the average figure of housing output over the last six or seven years approaching 2,000 dwellings will be attained.  I am, however, unable to visualise any spectacular increases in the present rate of progress, such as was attained for example in the year 1950-51 when over 2,500 dwellings were completed.  In those years the corporation had available a number of fully developed sites on which building work could be started without delay and by far the greater proportion of the resources of the building industry was available for local authority housing.</P>
    <P>In more recent years the building of houses has caught up with the reserves of sites and moreover the city drainage system has been taxed to capacity. Thus the site position and the drainage position have both created the need for a new main drainage scheme on the northern periphery of the city&mdash;the Finglas-Raheny-Howth scheme which is at present in progress.  The building of cottages to rehouse families on the fringes of the city in the years to come will largely depend on the completion of that scheme and the development of the areas which its completion will open up for building development.</P>
    <P>Redevelopment of the central city area has been adopted as a policy by the corporation.  The implementation of that policy will involve a number of complicated legal, technical and planning <Col N="948" /> problems, but I can assure the corporation that any assistance that I can give them in the solution of these problems will be readily forthcoming.</P>
    <P>In the other county boroughs the outlook as regards future housing output is encouraging.  The actual number of dwellings completed by Cork Corporation in 1954-55 was 317 as compared with 229 in 1953-54.  Estimated completions in the two succeeding financial years are, I understand, 477 and 502.  If the Cork Corporation live up to these estimates they will certainly be forging ahead towards the solution of a housing position which a few years ago was the subject of melancholy comment by the local public representatives of all Parties.  In Limerick and Waterford a temporary lowering in the rates of completion is expected to be followed by a substantial increase in output in the years 1955-56 and 1956-57.</P>
    <P>My Department has continued to exercise the utmost vigilance in an endeavour to reduce the level of housing costs.  The question of sanctioning the acceptance of unreasonably high tenders is submitted to me whenever it arises and investigations are made of the factors responsible for high costs. Very frequently the action taken results in reductions in the contract sums.</P>
    <P>I have already drawn attention to the substantial increase for private housing as the only outstanding variation in the individual items in this Vote.  I have ample evidence of a tendency towards greatly increased activity by private persons in the building of houses and, still more, in the reconstruction and enlargement of old houses.  The number of new house grants allocated in 1954-55 was 6,030 as against 5,498 in the preceding year. Reconstruction grants numbered 7,706 as against 7,110 for 1953-54.  The number of reconstruction grants allocated is the highest on record as is also the combined total of new house and reconstruction grants.</P>
    <P>Taking the housing picture as a whole I am very pleased to be able to say that the total number of new houses built and reconstructed during the year by local authorities and <Col N="949" /> private persons assisted by State grants was 14,780 as compared with 14,818 in the previous year.  The new houses amounted to 10,123 as compared with 10,750, and reconstructions 4,657 as compared with 4,068 in 1953-54.</P>
    <P>My review of housing would not be complete if I were to conclude with the record of construction by local authorities and construction and reconstruction by private persons.  I would like to go further and appeal to housing authorities to devote more attention to their powers and duties in seeing that the general stock of houses in their areas is maintained in a consistently good condition.  They have ample power to take action in regard to sub-standard houses either by the serving of notices on the landlords, encouragement of the tenants to proceed with repairs or the carrying out of reconstruction work themselves.</P>
    <P>I would also like to refer to the local authorities' own housing property, particularly the older houses which lack modern amenities.  I appreciate that the housing authorities cannot be expected to carry out all the necessary improvements to these houses at the cost of the rate, but, as the rents are extremely low, I have no doubt that tenants generally would be willing to meet the cost of the improvements.  On this general subject of older houses, whether privately or municipally owned, the time is opportune for a campaign to preserve and improve the national stock of dwellings, particularly in those areas where the pressure to clear the arrears of new housing needs is gradually being relaxed.</P>
    <P>In the last financial year work was commenced on 55 waterworks and sewerage schemes while 65 schemes were completed within the year.  The schemes in progress at the beginning of the present financial year are estimated to involve a total cost of about £4,750,000.  The largest of these is the North Dublin drainage scheme which has been in progress for the past three years and will take about two more years to complete at an estimated cost of over £1,800,000.  In my review of housing I have already referred to <Col N="950" /> the importance of this scheme in making available for housing development and other purposes much land which cannot be used for these purposes until the scheme has been completed.  The laying of the intercepting sewer between Finglas and Raheny has been practically finished and the pressure culvert on the foreshore at Sutton is being constructed under four separate contracts.</P>
    <P>I am glad to be able to report that work on the high level section of the North Dublin regional water supply scheme has been virtually completed and consumers in the Blanchardstown and Castleknock areas are already receiving their water supplies from the new Ballycoolan reservoir.  The low level section of the scheme which is intended to serve the coastal areas has been delayed by inability to secure a reservoir site at Malahide by agreement. Apart from this difficulty other obstacles as regards the supply by the Dublin Corporation of water for county council areas have been removed.  The question of land acquisition is one in which I cannot interfere but the local authority has the promise of my cooperation at any stage at which I can be of assistance to them.</P>
    <P>Work is in progress on the construction of the Dún Laoghaire main drainage scheme and on two sections of a joint drainage scheme being promoted by Dublin County Council and Dún Laoghaire Corporation to serve the Foxrock-Killiney district.  Other regional schemes which I may mention as making satisfactory progress are water supply schemes for Passage West and district, three water supply schemes in County Kildare and a similar scheme for the Lismore-Cappoquin-Ballyduff area, County Waterford.</P>
    <P>In some areas there is a growing tendency to promote regional schemes as being in the opinion of the sanitary authorities the best method of securing adequate and constant supplies for a number of towns and villages in reasonable proximity to each other and for the intervening rural areas.  In a number of cases I have met the local representatives and the sponsors of these schemes and I have not discouraged their being planned and <Col N="951" /> undertaken provided that the potential benefits in public health and local amenities may show a fair return for the expenditure.  The greater part of the rural areas in this country, however, comprise farms whose owners live in isolated houses with little or no tendency to group into villages.  Thus the extension of public piped water supplies, whether by regional or other schemes, to all such holdings is a practical impossibility.  In these circumstances I hope that we will see an increasing use made of the special grants available for the provision and installation of private water supplies and sewerage services in dwelling houses where public sanitary systems are not in operation.</P>
    <P>Another promising factor to assist the provision of localised water supplies will be rural electrification.  Piped water is one of the many amenities and services which may be installed with the aid of electric pumps and other appliances.  Apart from the assistance which electricity offers to private persons wishing to improve the amenities of their household, local authorities may well look to its aid for the provision of small, easily-run, public waterworks schemes designed to serve villages and groups of cottages and in appropriate cases to eliminate the hand-worked pump from schemes involving the provision of wells and pumps.</P>
    <P>In the course of visits to the various local authority areas last summer and on the occasion of numerous deputations from county council areas attending before me, in regard to roads, the need for a more extensive programme to improve our county road system was strongly presented to my mind.  I promised the most sympathetic attention possible to these representations and in fulfilment of that promise when I came to determine the allocations from the Road Fund for the present financial year I increased the grant for county road improvement from £1,700,000 to £2,200,000.  The corresponding grant for main road improvement I reduced from £1,400,000 to £1,200,000.</P>
    <P>I have also allocated a sum of <Col N="952" /> £150,000 by way of grants towards the replacement of a considerable number of bridges which have been proved structurally defective and a further sum of £400,000 for the continuation of the scheme for the improvement of tourists roads in the Gaeltacht and congested areas.  The usual 40 per cent. grant is being made to county councils in recoupment of part of the expenditure on main road upkeep.  A sum of £150,000 has been allocated to the county borough corporations and the corporation of Dún Laoire for road works in their areas.</P>
    <P>In notifying these allocations the usual recommendation was issued to road authorities that they should continue and, if possible increase, the provision for maintaining their roads; otherwise the capital already invested in their improvement would rapidly depreciate.</P>
    <P>I have also recommended local authorities to consider now the planning of county road improvements to take in a wider range of roads than that contemplated in the county council road improvement plan recommended a few years ago.  This is possible and necessary owing to the progress already made with the execution of the original plan and owing to the extra moneys which are now being made available for county roads.  My engineering advisers are co-operating with the county engineers in an effort to secure a sound and at the same time an economic technical basis for the treatment of county roads.  A number of county councils are at present conducting experiments on these lines.</P>
    <P>It is not necessary for me to go into in any detail here the important matter of road traffic.  I have already explained when the Local Government Bill, 1954, was before the House that new powers are required to enable adequate regulations to be made prescribing uniform road signs.  Now that that Bill has been passed, consideration is being given by tests and otherwise to determine the best possible types of signs that can be introduced in due course.</P>
    <P>The county rate collection continues to be very satisfactory.  At the 31st <Col N="953" /> March last 97.5 per cent. of collectors' warrants had been accounted for as compared with 97.7 per cent. in the previous year.</P>
    <P>The increasing levels which local expenditure is attaining scarcely need to be brought to the notice of members of the House, as Deputies, whether in the capacity of local representatives or as private ratepayers, will be aware that local expenditure by the greater number of local authorities is still on the increase.  During the past financial year the total revenue expenditure of local authorities, excluding vocational education committees, committees of agriculture and harbour authorities, was approximately £44.3 million.  The figure for the present financial year has been estimated at £49.2 million.  These figures represent gross expenditure. The local authorities are far from being in the position of being required to bear the burden entirely from rates. Of the £44.3 million the State contributed almost £20 million by way of grants and will be paying a further £1.5 million in 1955-56.  Taking into account other sources of local revenue, the net amounts falling on local rates in these two years are estimated at £17.25 million and £18.5 million respectively.</P>
    <P>It will be seen, therefore, that the State is actually contributing more towards the cost of local services than the local authorities themselves are levying by way of rates.  Furthermore, the increases in the rates which actually have taken place must be to some extent discounted by the fall in the value of money since pre-war times.  Regard must also be had to the improved standards of service and the additional services now being provided by the local authorities.  While I do not wish to see any diminution in these services or standards, I am pressing for such reductions in expenditure as can be achieved by the introduction of more efficient, and the elimination of wasteful or overlapping, methods of work.  Some of my objectives could not be fully achieved except by the aid of amending legislation. The Local Government Act, 1955, contains certain provisions to <Col N="954" /> this end and further special legislation will be introduced, if necessary.</P>
    <P>The library survey conducted by persons engaged for the purpose by An Cómhairle Leabharlanna has been completed and I have received certain recommendations from An Cómhairle in regard to the future of the county library services.  A further series of recommendations will be submitted in regard to the municipal library services.</P>
    <P>A record number of applications was received during the year for appointment as official contractors under the Local Authorities (Combined Purchaseing) Act, 1925.  With one or two exceptions the contractors had no difficulty in meeting the requirements of the local authorities and the steady supply position throughout the year appeared to represent an improvement in and a stabilisation of the sources of supply.  The list of commodities for which contractors are appointed has been further increased and there has also been a welcome increase in the number of provincial contractors appointed.  Practically every county in the State is now represented in the list of official contractors.  The value of orders placed with the contractors has increased by nearly £1,500,000 from £1,260,000 to £2,740,000 in the past seven years.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that the monumental textbook on local government law by Mr. H.A. Street has, after many difficulties, at last been published.</P>
    <P>The preparatory work of consolidation is well advanced in the more important general local government codes and further work on these sections is now a matter for the statute law reform and consolidation office. The preparatory work on two other codes is proceeding in the Department while, in the case of the remainder, the preparatory work has received a sad interruption by the death of Mr. John Collins, former secretary of the Department, who had already done pioneer work on the sections already prepared and who had been retained to deal with this particular section.  I am <Col N="955" /> informed that Mr. Collins' work has been of a most thorough and comprehensive character and it is but right that I should pay this tribute to his memory.  The work is continuing to progress within the limits of time that can be devoted to it by the staff of the Department.</P>

But, as the local elections are proceeding at the present time, we shall have to use this occasion in order to deal with matters which relate to the Minister's Department and to his Estimate.  We hope, too, that, since the Minister has shown some self-restraint in talking about his Department, his supporters will also be induced to show the same restraint.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers:</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope so.  The Minister has mentioned the increase that has taken place in the rates and the fact that rates have now become a very heavy burden on the community. They are particularly heavy in relation to a great number of people in Dublin City; they also lie heavily on other sections of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A great many of the Minister's supporters are going around the country at the present time accusing this side of the House of being responsible for the rate struck this year.  They are accusing us of being responsible although, as the House well knows, a very high proportion of the rates struck is of a mandatory character and must be struck in any event.  About 90 per cent. of all the moneys spent by local authorities is under the direct control and surveillance of the Minister for Local Government.  Yet, this allegation is being made, although in the vast majority of country county councils both the Fine Gael and the Fianna Fáil members are agreed, at the end of a long discussion on their estimates, <Col N="956" /> as to what the official rate should be.</P>
    <P>But, of course, so is the same kind of propaganda going on as proceeded during the general election campaign&mdash; the Fianna Fáil Party being made responsible for the high cost of Government, when, in fact, in cases of the striking of these rates it was frequently a matter of unanimous consent of all the Parties.  And so those who accused this side of the House of being responsible for high rates during the present financial year and the last financial year must be told that the Minister for Local Government has shown no intimation of his desire to reduce the costs as far as his Department is concerned.  He apparently agrees that the many services should continue at high pressure with an inevitable reflection upon the rates, no matter what the grants are from the Central Fund.</P>
    <P>In general, the Minister has taken no steps in relief of rates.  He has intimated no intention of bringing in legislation governing the question of grants to local authorities; he has failed to live up to some of the implied promises made during the general election and before the general election, that if the present Government were returned to office there should be immediate and substantial reliefs in the rates.  The Minister began his address with an account of the housing activity in the last year and I should like to congratulate the Minister on not implying that the fact of his being made Minister was responsible for the recovery in the rate of housing, which had slightly slowed down during the period of inflation, and that he did not attempt to take credit for the satisfactory number of houses built or reconstructed during the last financial year.  As the Minister may well know though, some of his supporters may make use of that fact during the local elections.  I should like to point out, therefore, that the houses built in the year ending 31st March, 1955, were designed or considered and that the money for them was largely found during the period of office of the Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="957" /> I should not have mentioned that were it not for the fact that when I go down the country on Sunday, as, I am sure, will the Minister himself, I shall hear from the hustings speeches made by people already taking credit for such things as the high prices of cattle on the British market.  They are also likely to take credit for the statement of the Minister that more houses were reconstructed during the last financial year.  We on this side of the House have got to counter that propaganda as best we can.</P>
    <P>In connection with housing I should like to ask the Minister whether he believes that enough is being done in the country in general and in Dublin in particular for our young married couples.  I am quite aware that there is a social and moral obligation on us to the limit of our resources to make houses available for persons with big family responsibilities, but I also know that there is a great problem at the present time in connection with the provision of housing facilities for our young married couples, and that the growth of high wages in Great Britain has resulted in our young married couples going abroad as they are not considered here to be in such dire need of housing as are those with large families.</P>
    <P>I think a great deal more should be done for our younger families who are going to dictate the character of our civilisation for the next 40 or 50 years and I should like to ask the Minister whether he should not consider changing the attitude of his Department towards our young married couples in order that they might be facilitated in this respect.  In connection with housing grants I think the Minister will agree with me that although it is true in a number of counties that houses of the cottage type are being built for farmers with a valuation of under £10 with the aid of Government and local authority grants, we still have a problem in relation to the farmer whose valuation is up to £25.</P>
    <P>There are still houses in the countryside which should be replaced.  In spite of all reconstruction work being done, for various reasons we still have <Col N="958" /> too many houses of that kind in very poor condition throughout the countryside and these naturally are anything but an attraction to the young people who want to look forward to a better standard of living.  There may be a number of reasons for this failure of our smaller farmers to take advantage of the grants and loans that are available. Their capital may be tied up in family settlements, they may not have the necessary capital or there may be a natural reluctance to borrowing upon sureties because if they borrow upon sureties they may take several years to repay the loans.</P>
    <P>In relation to the design of farm residences, I think there should be expert advice available to the local engineers.  One of the things that may discourage small farmers from building a new residence is the difficulty of securing a design for a house which is peculiarly suited to the farmer who needs a number of out-offices.  Farmers should have a different design to suit their own individual needs.  In some cases the design of farm buildings has a direct connection with the design of the residence.  The two should be considered together and I am not at all sure that the Minister should not enter into some arrangement whereby the Minister for Agriculture and himself should co-ordinate their activities in relation to farm residence and to farm out-offices.</P>
    <P>There are a number of different ways for speeding up the replacement of the very poor type of farmhouses we see throughout the countryside.  They include, of course, making available higher grants or altering the methods by which loans are guaranteed and questions relating to the payment of the interest on the annuity.  There are also difficulties of administration and of title which may impede the rebuilding of a great many small farmhouses. I think it would be a very good thing if the Minister would have an examination made in a sample area in order that he could ascertain why small farmers have not taken advantage of the loans and grants available.</P>
    <P>I should also like to ask the Minister whether he would not consider reviving the architectural competition <Col N="959" /> which was in process of being promoted in 1947 when I happened to be Parliamentary Secretary.  It has been abandoned since.  The only difficulty that lay at that time was that the architects themselves had not agreed on the fees in connection with the competition, but I think a great deal can still be done to improve the appearance and design of local authority houses. The character of the elevation of a house, the position of windows and roofs&mdash;the slope of the roof&mdash;can make all the difference between the appearance of the house of which we can be proud and of the house which has nothing to recommend it architecturally.</P>
    <P>I think that a competition such as that of which I have spoken would be a stimulating factor and I think such a competition should be inaugurated. The cost would be very little and it would be a stimulus to architects. Attention should also be given to the improvement of the interior amenities of municipal houses and I am quite sure that the last word has not yet been spoken on that matter.</P>
    <P>Coming to the general question of road development, here again I have to enter the political field in discussing this matter.  The Minister, as one would expect, referred to the amounts from the Road Fund in the normal manner, but some of his supporters are going around the country and announcing the increase in the total amount made available for roads as though that were a gift from the Fine Gael Party to the people of the country, as though they had provided money for the improvement, construction and maintenance of the roads which was not available in our time.  I think that is a scandalous type of propaganda.  The Minister knows that if he has increased grants to make available it is because of the increases in the number of vehicles due to the prosperity of the country in 1953 and 1954 and that it has no relation to anything that the present Government could do in a short term of office.</P>
    <P>I may say that the motor tax fund has increased very largely since 1950. It was £2.8 millions in 1950 and it grew <Col N="960" /> to £4.4 millions is 1953 and I understand that it has now passed that figure.  The increase in the Road Fund is not a gift from the Fine Gael Party or the Coalition Government and it is ridiculous to go around the country making that a claim to be elected a member of a local authority.  I understand from the Minister's speech that at the present time to sums are being made available from the National Development Fund for either main or country tourist roads.  I would like to ask the Minister's indulgence as to whether he will confirm that there is no such sum available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers:</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell:</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers:</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that, but the Minister has not committed himself to the extent of saying that there will be allocations.  As soon as the National Development Fund was started we indicated that the roads would be our first consideration and during our last full year of office we gave £500,000 for main roads, over £500,000 for county roads and £400,000 for tourist roads from the National Development Fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has announced that there has been an enormous increase in traffic and the revenue from the Road Fund will not be sufficient to save the roads from disrepair and the enormous effect of the remarkable increase in traffic.  More will have to be done in the way of providing capital for assisting in the reconstruction of the roads and in the long run it will be more <Col N="961" /> economic.  The amount which will be saved on maintenance in later years will make such a project economic.  I press on the Minister the desirability of providing some moneys from the National Development Fund for the reconstruction of the roads.</P>
    <P>In regard to the allocation for the county roads&mdash;and again I must deal with this matter from the political point of view&mdash;I hear the candidates myself running around this country telling the people that the Fine Gael Party and Coalition Government were the first to provide moneys for the improvement of county roads.  That is an absolute untruth.  The first sums made available for county road reconstruction and improvement were granted in the financial year 1946-47 and not in the time of the Coalition Government.  The amount gradually increased from the first figure of just under £500,000 to the amount indicated by the Minister in his Estimate speech. During our time in office we increased the county road allocation from the period 1951-52 to the period 1954-55 by £500,000 and I hope that the other members of the Minister's Party will follow his good example and not parade around the country telling the people that we have got all these grants with the coming into office of the Coalition Government and that the increases were solely the work of that Government.</P>
    <P>In connection with the improvement of the main roads, I would like to ask the Minister whether he has examined ways and means of increasing the output, having regard to the enormous cost a main road improvement scheme means nowadays, due to the main roads not being able to bear the greater traffic.  Some years ago an examination was made by the officers of his Department into the comparative value of the concrete and bituminous surface.  At that time it was found that, in a certain class of terrain, and under certain conditions, if a period of 15 years was taken into account, a concrete road surface, even with the heavy initial cost, would be an economic proposition and that the maintenance after a certain period of time <Col N="962" /> would be so low that the high capital cost would be more than covered by economies.  I would like to ask the Minister whether he has any recent figures as regards the comparative value of concrete and bituminous roads.</P>
    <P>I have been told that one of the big difficulties lies in the enormous cost of concrete machinery and I would like to ask the Minister whether he has considered the possibility of forming a pool of such machinery which could be given out to the different county councils. I am now speaking about the main roads and the enormous difficulty of improving them efficiently.  The result of any improvement in output would be that there would be more money available in the long run for the county roads.  I would also like to ask the Minister whether he is satisfied that the standards set up for the improvement of main roads and county roads are of current use or whether there should not be a revision of the methods by which the density of the roads is calculated.  I would also like to ask him whether he is still using the old standards or whether he has got amended standards.  I move to report progress.</P>

The board subsequently informed me that they have no option but to release the flood waters, owing to the high rainfall and the operation of drainage schemes in Northern Ireland.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that <Col N="968" /> there is a demand for a special soil-testing laboratory in County Dublin, and I am satisfied that there is no need to set up one there.  The Soil Laboratory at Johnstown Castle Agricultural College, Wexford, is capable of dealing adequately with all soil samples coming this season from County Dublin, whether taken in connection with agricultural or horticultural production.  In fact, there is a special unit at Johnstown Castle which is largely concerned with tomato house soils.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister further aware that there is a large acreage of tomatoes under glass in County Dublin?  That being so, would he be prepared to consider favourably the establishment of a soil-testing laboratory or research station in County Dublin because the people there do not want to have to send soil samples all the way down to Johnstown Castle and await their return?  A number of people in the horticultural business in County Dublin who had acres of tomatoes last year found that when disease came on the tomatoes a certain amount of delay was necessarily involved in soil testing.  They want the research work carried out close to them rather than to have to send soil samples down to Johnstown Castle and await their return perhaps two months afterwards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the Press report referred to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have made inquiries into this matter and am informed that on 18th October, 1948, an offer of a grant of 75 per cent. of the cost of providing a 20 foot wide slipway usable at high water of spring tide and reconstructing the steps to the boatyard at Graughill was made to the Mayo County Council, subject to the council agreeing to contribute the balance of the cost and to accept responsibility for the future maintenance of the works when completed. The county council were informed at the same time that it was not proposed to repair or extend the breakwater and that they were not being asked to take any responsibility in connection with it.  On 13th July, 1951, the council signified their agreement to provide the requisite contribution and to accept responsibility for the future maintenance.  On 7th January, 1953, the Office of Public Works forwarded to the county council a plan, specification and estimate together with the usual form of agreement governing the execution of the works and on 6th February, 1953, the county council were requested to lodge their contribution so that the works might begin in the following month.  On 29th April, 1953, the Office of Public Works was informed by the county secretary that the county engineer was satisfied that the work proposed would prove to be inadequate, defective, of bad design and entirely unsuitable and that in the circumstances the necessary documents could not be completed.  In reply to <Col N="970" /> an inquiry as to whether the county council endorsed the views of the county engineer, the council in August, 1953, suggested a meeting on the site at which an engineer from the Office of Public Works should attend. On 8th September, 1953, the council were informed that arrangements would be made for the attendance of an engineer from the Office of Public Works, but that before the meeting took place they should furnish detailed information indicating the respects in which the county engineer considered the proposed scheme of works to be defective.  No reply has since been received, and it is therefore clear that the failure of the council to reply to the reasonable request for information regarding their engineer's grounds of objection to the scheme is solely responsible for the delay in having the facilities provided.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Corish):</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, in his Financial Statement on the 4th of last month, announced that the Government had decided to increase old age and blind pensions, and widows' non-contributory pensions; and he indicated that legislation would be introduced with a view to having the increases made operative from Friday, the 29th July, 1955.  The object of this <Col N="982" /> Bill, then, is to obtain legislative authority for the proposed increases.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is a Bill which requires much explanation.  So far as old age and blind pensions are concerned, the effect is that the present weekly rates&mdash;21/6, 16/6, 11/6 and 6/6&mdash;will each be increased by 2/6. The number of pensioners who will benefit by these increases is about 166,000 of whom some 6,000 are blind pensioners.</P>
    <P>A glance at trends in old age, and blind, pension rates in the past seven or eight years may not be out of place. In 1948 the statutory rates were the same as in 1928, ranging from 10s. down to 1s., but, under Emergency Powers Orders, cash supplements to pension were being paid at 5s. a week in the cities and towns, and at 2/6 a week in the rural areas.  In the rural areas the public assistance authorities had power to grant additional supplemental allowances, up to a maximum of another 2/6 a week, to pensioners in necessitous circumstances.  Seventy-five per cent of this expenditure was recoverable by the local authority from State funds.</P>
    <P>Under the Social Welfare Act of 1948 which was one of the first measures introduced by the inter-Party Government all these supplements were discontinued, and new inclusive rates of old age and blind pensions were provided as from the 7th January, 1949, the maximum being increased to 17/6 a week.</P>
    <P>In his Second Reading speech on the Social Welfare (Insurance) (No. 2) Bill, 1950, Mr. Norton, the then Minister for Social Welfare, informed the House on the 2nd March, 1951, that he intended on the Committee Stage of the Bill to introduce amendments relating to old age pensions, which would include raising the maximum to 20s. a week. Before this could be done there was a change of Government, but under the Social Welfare Act of 1951, promoted by my predecessor, the increase to 20s. a week was authorised with effect from 5th October, 1951.</P>
    <P>Under the Social Welfare Act of 1952 the maximum rate was increased to 21/6 a week as from 4th July, 1952, to <Col N="983" /> compensate pensioners for the increased cost of food due to the reduction of subsidies.</P>
    <P>There is, I think, general agreement that the present rates of old age pensions should be increased to the maximum extent permitted by the financial position of the country.  Many Deputies will, no doubt, ask for larger increases than those provided in this Bill and the Government would be glad to grant larger amounts were it not for the fact that even small increases in the rates of old age pensions mean that a large additional sum has to be found.  The increase of 2/6 per week now being provided will cost £1,085,000 in a full year.  The estimated cost of old age and blind pensions in the current financial year before providing for the increases now proposed is £9,420,000.  The annual cost, therefore, when the increased rates are in force will be £10,505,000.  This sum represents 2.4 per cent. of the total national income for 1953, the latest figure available.  It may be noted that the corresponding figure for Great Britain is 2.5 per cent. so that we are devoting almost the same proportion of our national income to the payment of old age pensions as Great Britain does.</P>
    <P>The other recipients of pensions for whom provision is made in this Bill are widows who are in receipt of non-contributory pensions.  These number approximately 28,000 and they will each receive an additional 2/6 per week as from the 29th July next.  If the widow has one dependent child she will receive a further 1/- per week and where she has two or more dependent children a further 2/- per week in addition to the 2/6 per week mentioned earlier.  A widow with two or more dependent children will as from 29th July next receive 36/6 per week as a non-contributory pension if her means do not exceed £52 10s. per annum.  The increases in the rates of pension will cost the Exchequer £199,000 per annum and will bring the annual cost of non-contributory pensions for widows up to £1,799,000.</P>
    <P>As in the case of old age pensions the first inter-Party Government provided <Col N="984" /> in the Social Welfare Act, 1948, for increases in the rates of widows' non-contributory pensions.  Prior to the passing of that Act widows residing in county boroughs received 11/6 per week and those in urban districts 10/- per week inclusive of the cash supplement to their pensions.  These two rates were each raised to 14/- per week by the Social Welfare Act, 1948 and rates of 7/6 per week and 8/- per week for widows resident in small towns and in rural areas, respectively, were each raised to 10/- per week.</P>
    <P>The rates of non-contributory pensions for widows were further increased by the Social Welfare Act, 1952, under the provisions of which the, maximum pension for a widow with two or more dependent children became 32/- per week.  Under the present Bill this figure is being raised to 36/6 per week as from 29th July next, so that the increase in such cases is 4/6 a week.</P>
    <P>Deputies will note that taking old age and blind pensioners and widows in receipt of non-contributory pensions together the number of beneficiaries under this Bill will be approximately 194,000.  These classes are amongst the most deserving in the community and each pensioner will as from the 29th July next receive an additional sum of 2/6 to 4/6 per week.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne:</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to congratulate the Minister on his provisions for the most needy section of our community. It is true that some of us had hoped that the provision would be higher and that an increase sufficient to bring the pension to 25/- per week would have been possible.  We realise that, under the circumstances, perhaps, that is not within the power of the Minister at the moment, but I would stress that we still feel there is room for improvement in these pensions because of the fact that these particular types of people are subject to a very severe means test.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is on that means test that I would like to say a few words.  I believe that when the Minister again approaches the question of old age pensions, either for the old age and blind pensioners or the non-contributory widows, he <Col N="985" /> should consider the question of removing the means test completely.  I had occasion to put down a parliamentary question to the Minister some time ago and I think his reply was that to do away with the means test would cost approximately £2,000,000 per year extra.  I do not know how close the Minister could go, in reply, to the actual figure, but even assuming it went as high as £2,000,000, I believe there would be contrary savings that would reduce that amount considerably. The time and the money spent in investigating the claims of old age and blind pensioners and of non-contributory widow pensioners would represent a considerable saving.  In the light of the help and the feeling of independence it would give to the people who have to avail of this service, I think the country would be amply repaid.</P>
    <P>The means test as it operates at present is to my mind absolutely unjust.  Take the case of a substantial farmer with up to £50 valuation.  He can, under certain circumstances, divest himself of his farm, hand it over to his son and at the same time draw the full pension while he reserves for himself the right of a living in that farm, the right of shelter and food; and there is nothing to stop his son giving him a share in the profits of that farm.  When I say that, I do not want it to be thought that I have anything against a farmer getting that, but contrast him with the working man, with a county council worker. If he is over 65 and his wife is 70 years, she is refused a pension.  She will not get a single penny because half of his income is related to her. Taking still the county council worker or the ordinary industrial worker who has paid in a considerable sum out of his small wage each week as a contribution towards a retirement pension, we find that the very fact that he has saved and gone without in order to provide a pension for himself will automatically debar not only him but also his wife from an old age pension.</P>
    <P>I think these are grave, glaring defects and that it is the duty of the Minister to investigate and to reform the code in such a way that it will be <Col N="986" /> an enticement and an inducement to our people to provide as much as they can for old age without having to pay the penalty of being deprived of the pension that most people get because of the fact that they were thrifty.</P>

      <P>I rise to compliment the Minister on bringing in this Bill because it is felt throughout the country that the sections of our community who benefit under it are the most needy people under our care.  I would like to add to what Deputy Kyne has said and to bring this matter to the Minister's attention in the hope that perhaps on some future occasion he may deal with it.  Deputy Kyne has referred to a class of farmer who may transfer his holding to his son and obtain the pension having done so.  It is a fact that, when this was introduced some few years ago it was a very good thing to do, that up to that time it was impossible for a farmer to get the old age pension on attaining the age of 70 years unless he transferred his farm on marriage.  This provision was made, I think, during the inter-Party's term of office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy:</NameTxt>
      <P>Now, Deputy, it was not made at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan:</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision was that a farm under £35 valuation could be transferred and that the person who transferred the farm would qualify for an old age pension.  The Act, however, specified that the transfer must be to a son or daughter.  Throughout the country there are childless couples who, instead of leasing their farm, take in a nephew or a niece at a young age. That nephew or niece may spend the best years of their lives working on that farm with that couple&mdash;uncle or aunt as the case may be.  That old couple settle the farm on the nephew or niece who becomes the proprietor. I would bring to the Minister's attention this fact and ask him to extend the scope of the Act to take in such <Col N="987" /> cases so that a farmer with a valuation of under £35 could obtain a pension after he had assigned his farm to a nephew or niece.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley:</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said, the public were convinced that the increases would be very substantial and they are now sorely disappointed.  I have a feeling that the Government, in the local elections, are going to receive a vote of no confidence in no uncertain manner.  There is one point which has evidently been overlooked by the national Press and that is the question of the types or categories of persons who are going to benefit from this proposed Bill.  It has been freely stated that widows without the word in brackets &ldquo;non-contributory&rdquo; are going to benefit.  It should be pointed out that widows on contributory pensions will get nothing at all&mdash;that it is only those in the non-contributory class&mdash;the Minister mentioned 28,000 of them&mdash;who are concerned.</P>
      <P>The Minister must be sorely disappointed that he cannot implement his own wishes.  Speaking evidently at the same meeting as Deputy O'Leary, because it was on the same day, and he is quoted in the same paper, he said that: &ldquo;Fianna Fáil boasted of their social welfare scheme but could any man maintain himself on 21/6 a week or could an old age pensioner do it on 24/- a week or a married man with a wife and three children do it on 50/- a week?&rdquo;  If he could not do it in 1954 on 50/- how can he do it now, with an increase in price in each of 40 commodities?</P>
      <P>There were specific promises by all the Coalition speakers that the unemployment assistance would be increased. There is no mention of those increases made here, but as I say I appreciate the Minister's attitude that he has to cut his cloth according to his measure and that being in such a position he had to deal with those whom he considered to be in most necessitous circumstances.  From that point of view I would expect him possibly at some date in the very near future to give some consideration to those receiving the £1 a week disability allowances.</P>

      <P>I would not rise to speak at all on this measure were it not for the remarks of the young Deputy from Limerick.  Deputy O'Malley is new to this House.  Indeed, I think he is new in politics.</P>
      <P>We in the Labour Party are glad that a Labour Minister has been able to do something which his predecessor in Fianna Fáil did not do.  Indeed, the only thing that Fianna Fáil Deputies seem to be able to do is to read quotations. We all know that this Government is comparatively new.  Taking the Easter and the Christmas recess into consideration and the fact that we did not take office until June of last year, we have not really been 12 months at work.</P>
      <P>We were told by Fianna Fáil speakers &mdash;I heard them myself&mdash;that the Coalition could do nothing; they could give no increases because the money was not available.  If Deputy O'Malley had been here when Deputy Dr. Ryan was Minister for Social Welfare he would know that Deputy Dr. Ryan told me here on one occasion that an increase of 1/6 was enough to meet the cost of living; and at that time butter was 5d. per lb. dearer than it is to-day. The Deputy must remember that this Government had to face a problem in the winter that has gone, a problem which no other Government had to face. I am referring to the flooding in the Shannon valley and in Dublin, as a result of which money had to be provided by way of compensation for those who suffered as a result of the flooding.</P>
      <P>Remembering all that, the old age pensioners will be glad to get this increase of 2/6.  The sooner it is put into operation, of course, the better. I admit it is not much.  I would like to see more being given and I hope that next year there will be a further increase.  I think something should be done in relation to the people who go out to the old age pensioners' houses and probe for information.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gogan:</NameTxt>
      <P>The measure before the House represents the only bright spot introduced into this House since this Government took office.  I would like to congratulate the Minister on having had the opportunity of increasing the old age pensions by 2/6.  At the same time, I would make a very strong appeal to him to go back to the Government and ask them to give an extra 1/-.  I think that request would be supported by every member of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to support the appeal, too, of Deputy Kyne in relation to the investigation or the means test imposed on old age pensioners.  Surely after 50 years of old age pension legislation we ought to have reached the stage in <Col N="992" /> 1995 where the old age pension is automatically given at 70.  The large sum paid to meet the increased bill for pensions would be saved in the cost of investigation and administration.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Leary said, in the course of his remarks, that all we can do on this side of the House is refer to newspaper cuttings, to speeches made here and quote from the Official Report.  I want now to give the Minister this assurance.  No bonfires will be lit because of the extra half-crown that is being given to old age pensioners.  No matter how glad the pensioners are because of the increase they still feel it is a niggardly award.</P>
    <P>I happen to be a home assistance officer and I went to the trouble of seeking the opinions of some of the old age pensioners to find out in what light they regarded this increase.  I shall quote now, not from newspaper reports, but the actual words of the people I asked:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;They broke their hearts.  As far as I can see the pension will not be worth anything with the cost of living as it is.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The second one is:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;God only knows where we will be in July.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was in reference to the fact that the inquiry was made during the month of May.  Another old age pensioner, and this is about the most favourable comment, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Better than nothing.  You cannot make them give any more&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Another one said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is not a whole lot, is it?  I do not know how we manage.  Everything has gone very dear&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>These people feel, and I am sure the Minister himself feels, that the 24/-, or the 25/- which I suggest, is not anything like adequate to meet the extra cost of living imposed on these people.  Recently the Minister made an Order in connection with persons who qualify for the disablement allowance that the first 10/- of that allowance is not to be taken into consideration in connection with people who have to apply for home assistance.  If the Minister did the same thing in relation to the old age pensioners he would be doing something worth while.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy:</NameTxt>
      <P>The advance made is to be welcomed in so far as it goes, but I am sure the House and the Minister realise that there are cases of special hardship, principally among old age pensioners living alone, and having to meet all the demands of rent, maintenance and the usual charges that go with a household.  Some local authorities give them additional benefits when they are approaching 80 years of age and are getting really helpless.  In the local authority in Cork some of these people are getting 4/- and in some cases 5/- a week in addition to what was previously granted.  I am sure the Minister will not interfere with the discretion of local authorities in such cases and that the addition of half-a-crown a week now being granted will not take from the discretion of local authorities in cases of special hardship.</P>
      <P>As far as the suggestion made about the means test is concerned I think it would be welcome, but I do not think that it can be dealt with under the present Bill.  The one appeal that I would make to the Minister is in respect of these old age pensioners who are living alone.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that any of us would agree that even if we were to grant 4/- or 5/- a week to the old age pensioners it would be adequate for them to subsist.  This is the first installment by the Government to redeem the promises made in respect of social service benefits.  I think it is a remarkable step forward and I think that it is brazen impudence on the part of the two Deputies from the Fianna Fáil side of the House who described that increase as niggardly. Those others from the opposite side of the House who said that they welcomed the increase genuinely meant it, but do Deputies O'Malley and Gogan understand what was the attitude of their Party to this matter not less than six months ago?  Would it be wrong for me to quote what the Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party said to the delegates at the Fianna Fáil Árd Fheis when the matter was mentioned?  He said that in view of the fact that taxation had reached such a high limit it would be, in present circumstances, dangerous to increase social services. If that is the attitude of the Fianna Fáil Party why do they describe this proposal for old age pensioners and widows and orphans as niggardly?</P>
      <P>Deputy MacEntee spoke on the Budget debate and it must be agreed that if he was still Minister for Finance there would be no increase given to old age pensioners or widows and orphans. Speaking on the 18th May at column 1723 of the Official Report he said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I was saying that if we were in office to-day there would have been in this year's Budget a reduction in the standard rate of income-tax and there would have been a corresponding reduction of an equivalent amount in other taxes as well and there would have been no cut in the social services.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He went on to say that if he had been Minister for Finance there would have been no cut in social services but he said nothing about an improvement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lemass welcomed the proposal to increase the benefits but described them as niggardly and said that they were merely sufficient to compensate for the increase in the <Col N="995" /> cost of living for which this Government was responsible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish:</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.  In April, 1952, when Deputy MacEntee in his Budget speech announced the withdrawal of certain food subsidies he said that in order to compensate the old age pensioners and widows and orphans for the increase in the cost of living which would be involved he proposed to give them an increase of 1/6 per week.  The effect of the withdrawal of the food subsidies in the 1952 Budget was to increase the cost-of-living index figure from 115 to 122 points.  That was admitted by the present Leader of the Opposition when he was Taoiseach in reply to a parliamentary question.  Fianna Fáil contended that to compensate for an increase of seven points in the index figure an increase of 1/6 a week was sufficient.  Since we assumed office the index figure has increased from 124 to 126 points and we are now giving an increase of 2/6 a week to the old age pensioners.  If the Fianna Fáil increase of 1/6 for an increase in the cost of living of seven points was justified surely we are now attempting to undo some of the damage done to these people by the withdrawal of the food subsidies in 1952.</P>
      <P>I did not intend to make these points and I only make them now in view of some of the remarks made by Deputy O'Malley and Deputy Gogan.  I do not think, and I am sure the majority of Deputies in this House agree with me, that the old age pensioners should be made the subject of political controversy. I am sure that during my term of office and the term of office of the Government this will not be the only assistance we will give to these people. In respect of the other people now in receipt of social welfare benefits we are prepared to implement our promises and I can promise the House and assure the Opposition that, as far as I am concerned, the promises we made will be honoured to the letter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Kyne raised the question of the means test.  I explained to him before that to do away completely with <Col N="996" /> the means test would cost somewhere in the region of £2,750,000.  I would like to dispel from his mind the idea that the doing away of the means test would mean a very big saving as far as administration is concerned.  From the information available to me it appears that if the means test was abolished the saving in administration would amount to about £25,000.  I want to say that I am still a believer in the principle that there should be no means test in respect of old age pensions and I believe that in the present circumstances, if there is any sum of money available to the extent of £2,000,000 or £2,750,000, it should be devoted to improving the weekly allowance.  I do not know whether or not it will be possible for me during my term of office to completely abolish the means test but I do hope and trust that I will be able to effect some improvement.  I can see that there are many hardships and anomalies and we all hope that there could be some improvement in its operation as it stands at the present time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers:</NameTxt>
      <P>When I reported progress I was dealing with the problem of the improvement of main roads and I was saying that if the maximum amount of money was to be made available for county roads and even for the less important main roads&mdash;those other than arterial roads&mdash;every effort should be made to improve the output on the main roads.  I was asking the Minister whether he thought standards devised in 1945 for the calculation of the widths, elevations and curvatures of the main roads were still adequate or whether, in the light of present circumstances and the present <Col N="998" /> character of vehicular traffic, they need to be revised, and whether in fact they have been revised.</P>
      <P>So far as I remember, the position was that a road where there were over 400 vehicles per hour at peak times of traffic, if the traffic were to be considered in the light of 20 years of progress in vehicular density, would have two carriage ways each 24 feet wide, and where there were over 100 and less than 400 vehicles per hour there should be a single carriage way and the width should be 24 feet.  By establishing standards of that kind and anticipating an increase in the density of traffic a great deal of money could be saved both in reserving eventual land for widening roads and in actually constructing the road, and over a period of 20 years the taxpayer and motor user could be saved money.  I know that those standards have been adopted.  They were more or less sanctioned at the time they were devised and introduced into the Department, but what I am asking is whether the increase in the density of traffic has been noticed by the Minister and due allowance made therefore and whether he considers there should not be some further surveys made in that respect.</P>
      <P>I have noticed that there are density indicators along some of the main roads and I would like to ask the Minister for some information as to how he is using them.  I should also like to ask the Minister whether the scheme for providing higher training for assistant engineers on methods of road improvement and construction is being continued.  It had been the practice, as I understand it, for notable lecturers on methods of road construction to come over here from other countries, to have lectures by our own experts and also to send our assistant engineers on courses where there are laboratory facilities and demonstration facilities, which in a small country like this are not always available.  I would like to ask if that work is continuing and if the Minister can give some idea of the progress that is being made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having dealt with main roads, we come to the problem of the county roads and it would seem to me that no matter what five year plans have been <Col N="999" /> adopted by various county councils, the traffic upon those county roads is growing at a pace that will make the maintenance cost of stone roads an appalling burden upon the ratepayers unless the work is done more quickly. It would take, it would seem, some 30 to 60 years to complete the surfacing of county roads in many counties.  I wanted to ask the Minister whether he does not consider the present manner of financing the improvement of county roads is now inadequate and that there should be some change.  I would like to ask him whether he considers that borrowing facilities of local authorities for the improvement of county roads, by means of which they can get additional moneys over and above those provided by the Road Fund and the ratepayers, are sufficient and whether there should be an extension in the amount that may be borrowed or a change in the method of borrowing.</P>
    <P>I should like to point out in connection with county roads the urgent necessity of offering some allocation from the National Development Fund as soon as possible so that work can be planned in advance.  It is my belief that many thousands of pounds are lost every year through road allocations being given too late.  Both Governments are equally responsible for that. It would seem to me that, where roads have to be planned, designed and engineered, the materials purchased, the work laid out, and have that conform to financial practice which may relate to other aspects of Government which are totally unsuited to long-term road planning, some other principle should be adopted.</P>
    <P>It would seem to me to be quite within the capacity of the Department of Local Government to tell local authorities that the allocation, for example, from the National Development Fund, if it is coming&mdash;and we have not been given any assurance that it is coming&mdash;is likely to continue for a period of over 12 months, and other things being equal, that there would be a general continuance of the principle of Road Fund grants for county roads.  In that way it would be possible to do more long-term planning.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1000" /> I understand from the Minister that he is conducting an examination into the standards to be adopted for county roads.  I am glad that that is the case because, from reading reports of various county council meetings not only in my own constituency but in others, it would appear that the cost of improving county roads varies considerably from one county to another, not only because of local conditions but because of the actual systems the county engineers in their own right seem to be adopting.  That some independent examination of standards should be adopted for the improvement of county roads seems to me to be eminently desirable, and I have also ascertained that the use of machinery for the improvement of county roads varies a great deal, and machines, for example, possibly suitable for roads of that particular width have been found suitable in some counties but have not yet been adopted in others.</P>
    <P>I would like now to deal with the problem of non-public roads.  Here again it would seem to me that the conditions which we have seen in the community during the past five years are different from those in any previous period and that if ever there was a case for reassessing the importance and the value of the non-public roads it is now.</P>
    <P>I understand there are 40,000 miles of public roads and that the Department have estimated that the mileage of non-public roads can amount to 15,000 miles.  Various figures have been given in the past 20 years but I do not think the estimate has ever been lower than 15,000 miles.  These non-public roads are used by a very large number of persons and the only methods for repairing them were methods devised by the previous Government, at a much earlier stage&mdash;that is, grants in the winter time in areas where there are a sufficient number of unemployed to warrant the making of a grant and grants under the rural improvements scheme in which the users of the road make some contribution towards its repair.  The total amount of money available under these two heads is, I understand, in the neighbourhood of £500,000 and bears no relation to the enormous mileage of roads and is <Col N="1001" /> utterly inadequate to deal with the repair of roads which are now being used for motor car traffic, for tractors and for lorries on a scale certainly never envisaged before the war as inevitable. The use of these roads by motor traffic has altered the importance of the problem. It has made the problem more urgent for consideration.</P>
    <P>I would say that whatever Minister is in office&mdash;and I speak here without any political bias because no Government have solved this problem yet&mdash; must face reality in regard to these roads.  Everyone who comes from a rural area is aware of the fact that, whereas some of these roads are being kept in proper repair by one means or another, a great number are falling into a shocking condition and, as a result, the value of the property and the value of the farm residences at the ends of cul-de-sac roads has diminished.  There is quite a familiar pattern to be seen in relation to farm properties in the sense that you will find a farm owner buying a farm at the end of a cul-de-sac road which has not been properly repaired and using it as a secondary farm or you will find people living in houses at the ends of such roads with nobody to inherit the property because no one is willing to live down the road.  The fact that there is a large mileage of these roads has, I think, made every Minister for Local Government shy of undertaking any major repairs by reason of the appalling financial responsibility involved.  The method adopted of leaving it to the voluntary act of the users, in connection with the rural improvements scheme, or of using the yard-stick of unemployment in the area has been felt, up to now, to be the only thing that can be done.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that the rural improvements scheme has expanded in the course of the past few years.  More money is being made available and more money is being spent.  I think, equally, that if the cost of materials and of labour is examined the actual volume of work that is performed is not what it should be if this problem is to be solved.  The reason is known to every member of the House&mdash;the difficulty of securing consent to the contribution.  There will always be the <Col N="1002" /> people who live only a short distance down the cul-de-sac road and who do not want to pay their share for its repair.  There are also the people who are content with the road even in its shocking condition.  Then there are the people who are either unwilling or unable to purchase cars or tractors and for whom the road is adequate for the ordinary cart which they use to bring them to Mass and to the nearest town. There are all these variations in the attitude of mind of such people and, as a result, there are thousands of miles of non-public roads in this country which are not likely to be repaired under either of the two schemes now in operation for that purpose.</P>
    <P>Any Minister can adopt one of two attitudes in regard to this matter.  He can continue the present system in which there are these two types of grants for roads.  If he does so, he will be aware that, simply by the process of time, the social pattern of life in rural Ireland will alter.  People will not be content to live down stone-bound roads with an enormous amount of water accumulation in winter.  Gradually the properties will deteriorate in value and the residences will cease to be used.  That is what you might call a <i>laissez-faire</i> attitude. On the other hand, he can make up his mind that communications are important, that he wishes to preserve the tradition of people living throughout the land and not necessarily living along the main roads and he can decide to spend a capital sum over, say, ten years and carry out as much of the job as he can of repairing these roads and make grants on a scale that they have hitherto not been available. The only way to do that would be to survey a sample of non-public roads in different counties, to estimate what the cost would be and what the maintenance would be, to establish some kind of a yard-stick in regard to the number of users per mile of road and then say for every class of road in every county where there are over and above a minimum number of users that a capital grant will be made available for the putting into repair of these roads.  In that connection, the Minister would have to examine the standards adopted by county councils when they <Col N="1003" /> take over these roads&mdash;which they do on rare occasions.</P>
    <P>As the Minister well knows from the figures available to him, the rate of taking over these roads has been very slow and, under a recent Act which I think is in itself defective, county councils have not been able to take over cul-de-sac roads.  I understand that the terms of the Act make it extremely difficult for them to do so and that the county councils are unwilling to undertake that responsibility. The Minister can make a survey and estimate the cost.  He can find out what the maintenance would be.  I believe it would be very difficult, if not impossible, for county councils to strike the rate for the maintainance of these boreens, these non-public roads, when they have been put into order. The Minister might have to consider making a special sum available from the Central Fund for the maintenance of the non-public roads and that he should recoup the county councils for the maintenance of these roads or make some provision or other so that county councils will not feel that their rates will be burdened by the sudden repairing of a huge mileage of roads which I think should have been repaired and put in order from the very foundation of this State.</P>
    <P>Nobody can blame successive Governments for not thinking of everything, but I think successive Governments have failed to face up to this issue.  I am quite willing to recognise that the Minister has a difficult problem in this connection.  He could take the very hard-boiled point of view, with a certain amount of justification, that you cannot have more than a certain maximum mileage of roads in any county in a condition to bear motor car and tractor traffic and that, if that is the case, then, by a process of the survival of the fittest, the social pattern of the countryside will change until eventually everybody will live on a road in good condition and there must be some migration.</P>
    <P>I will not accuse the Minister of being inhuman if he takes that point of view because I realise the nature <Col N="1004" /> of the problem.  So long as he is responsible for his office, which we hope naturally will not be long, I would like the Minister to make up his mind on the problem, make the necessary survey, make the necessary estimates, and come to the House where, I am perfectly certain, he will receive a sympathetic hearing from the people on this side of the House, because although we did initiate this, whatever it is, £500,000 or £750,000 a year grant for minor relief and rural improvement schemes, we have to admit that we ourselves have not been able to solve the problem.  As I have said, the Minister has the alternative of accepting a permanent maximum figure in any county for the provision of up-to-date standards of comfort on these roads or of making a great effort to put as many of these roads into repair as can be done in the next ten years, using special grants for that purpose.</P>
    <P>The Minister might also consider whether local authorities should not be allowed to contribute to minor rural improvement schemes if they so desire; in other words, that if a local authority feels it has a particularly serious boreen problem within its territory, some grant should be allowed, not only for rural improvement schemes in the case of link roads when they are being taken over by the local authority but in the case of cul-de-sac roads that are not likely to be taken over by the county council under its present powers.  That is another alternative and that, again, involves a possible commitment for the local authorities, but I know of several local authorities which would like to have that power and they would like the Minister to consider giving them that power.</P>
    <P>I think I have already dealt with the necessity of planning for reconstruction of roads on a long-term basis.  I would like to ask the Minister whether he could confirm that he has definitely changed the rule whereby grants for the improvement of main roads must be wholly expended by the end of the financial year.  That seemed to me to be an absolutely lunatic procedure, that because a county council received a supplementary grant for main road improvement or grants in general, <Col N="1005" /> all the money had to be spent by the end of the financial year, which makes planning impossible and which makes the doing of good work virtually impossible. I should like to ask the Minister whether he has amended that regulation with a view to getting the maximum amount of work done with reasonable efficiency on the basis of long-term planning and having regard to changing weather conditions.</P>
    <P>The Minister made it quite clear that the housing problem was ending in a number of counties and I want to ask him whether he is making any long-term plan to provide other much-needed amenities in local areas having regard to the fact that the burden upon the capital expenditure should become less as time goes on.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke of the difficulty of establishing regional water schemes because of the scattered character of the dwellings in the countryside.  I would like to ask the Minister whether he has really examined that problem. An inter-departmental committee was established by the Fianna Fáil Government to investigate and act upon the problem of regional water supplies. Although many of the households of rural communities are scattered, I would like to ask him whether he has impressed upon county councils the desirability of instituting regional schemes where it is technically possible or whether he himself has rather a pessimistic view of the general idea and is content to have things proceed without any direct pressure from himself or from the officers of his Department.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that the present grants for the installation of a private sewerage and water supply for a house or a dwelling which is not connected with the public supply seem to be inadequate in view of the number of persons who apply for these grants.  In 1932 there was a tremendous housing problem to be solved and we on this side of the House can, I think, take credit for one in every four dwellings which got these facilities.  There is another tremendous problem to bring about a great increase in the number of private sewerage and water schemes for residences <Col N="1006" /> throughout the country.  Could the Minister tell us if he would consider, for example, some kind of arrangement whereby there would be special contractors for that purpose who would get to know the problem and whether by that means he could reduce the cost?</P>
    <P>In 1947 there was a Traffic Amendment Bill on the stocks and as there have been two Governments in office since then I can speak on the matter again on this occasion without political bias.  I remember as Parliamentary Secretary having preliminary conferences with the traffic section of the Garda Síochána and with representatives of the Department of Industry and Commerce and, naturally, with officers of the Department of Local Government in preparing an amendment to the Traffic Act of 1933 to bring up to date the whole code of traffic law in force.</P>
    <P>Has the Minister had time&mdash;he should have had time&mdash;to examine how far that Bill has progressed and how many more years it will take before it sees the light of day?  Everybody will agree that the maximum fines for traffic offences are utterly inadequate, having regard to the present value of money.  There are many other defects in the legislation so far as I know.  The red tape associated with the procedure of the Garda Síochána in order to bring a person to court is quite excessive and has been long abolished in democracies where the respect for the individual is no less than it is here.</P>
    <P>All those matters were being considered under that Traffic Bill.  There were all sorts of very important questions to be considered, where perhaps a Minister with some moral courage could make changes which in the long run would prove beneficial.</P>
    <P>Out of about 80,000 traffic offences in the year, I think that half of them are due to unlighted bicycles and it is up to the Minister to decide whether he will continue the system whereby Guards apparently spend 50 per cent. of their time in dealing with this kind of offence, when everybody knows that the law can hardly be enforced; it certainly is not being enforced in that regard, not even on main arterial roads.  I am giving that as only one <Col N="1007" /> example of the urgent necessity of revising the whole of the traffic leglislation.</P>
    <P>I understood the Minister to say that under the present Local Government Bill which is now being put into operation he will be able to make uniform the use of road signs.  I would like to know if that also applies to the use of illuminated discs on the road known as cats' eyes, because along the main roads of the country at the present time the system of cats' eyes varies from county to county and from area to area.  Nothing would be more useful to motorists at night than to know that the principles which are used for the establishment of cats' eyes on curves or on straight roads are the same in one county as in another.  It would involve no great expenditure and be of maximum value to motorists.</P>
    <P>I could deal with many other matters in connection with motoring in general but I think the Minister can best deal with the question by letting us know whether he intends to proceed with the Traffic (Amendment) Bill and whether he has considered the various problems that have been raised by the road safety organisations throughout the country and by all sorts of people in that connection.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture is touring the country during the local elections and his plan is to arrive in a certain area and meet another Fine Gael supporter and then to announce with dramatic effect that the Government is giving over £1,000,000 for sanitary services in the coming year.  Of course he does not add that the last Government gave £1,000,000 or somewhere in its neighbourhood for three successive years and that the grant for sanitary services is only a normal renewal of grant made available by Fianna Fáil.  I just wanted to make it clear to the younger people in this country that the sanitary services of the Department are not a novelty, something new, and that this talk about increased grants for roads and sanitary services is simply a method of deceiving the electorate as to who is responsible.</P>
    <P>Lastly, I should like to say a few <Col N="1008" /> words about the library services.  I heard the Minister say that the library surveyors have made a report to him of ways and means of improving the library services and I should like to express the hope that the Minister would implement as many of their proposals as he considers advisable.  We know that there is a desperate need for improvement in many counties while others, at the same time, are highly commendable and as good as can be found anywhere.  I should like to direct particular attention to the fact that there is a need in the library service for the provision of books for children in a great many counties and I should like to think that a great deal more was being done to provide books for children than is the case at the present moment.</P>
    <P>In a number of countries abroad the library service is associated with the showing of films on various aspects of national and historic development and I would like to suggest to the Minister that he should ask some authority within the State to consider the greater use of films for the education of our young people.  In Denmark there is a very small charge or tax for cinema entrance and about £135,000 is collected each year and there are four independent Danish film units producing films of educational value on Danish history, Danish art, Danish agriculture, on the struggle for Danish independence and on everything that could be regarded as highly desirable for the education of young children in this country.</P>
    <P>These films in Denmark are shown as part of the library service by the local librarians in local halls.  They are organised in conjunction with local associations which would correspond with Muintir na Tíre and other such organisations in this country.  All of these associations make an effort to bring along so many children.  It seems to me that it is highly desirable to expand the curricula of the elementary schools.  Such an expansion would involve considerable difficulties and I think an expansion of the library services along the line I have mentioned would help out in that respect.  I think that the facilities <Col N="1009" /> provided in Denmark deserve consideration by the present Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond:</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite recently we discussed another matter affecting local government in this House&mdash;the City and County Management (Amendment) Bill&mdash;and I think that at this stage we would be a little out of tune if we indulged in any very long debate on this measure until we see, through the operation of the City and County Management Act, how we get along with local government.  It is only fair at this stage that we would give credit to the Minister and to the Administration for one aspect of local government. That is the new policy on roads.  We realise how important it is to have our main roads in good condition but for many years back we have been expressing the view that the main roads were being put into excellent condition very often, unfortunately, at the expense of the county roads.  We considered that the policy of providing so much money in State grants for main roads was denying certain rights to the people living in the rural areas.  We realised that that policy was a wrong one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the past few months that policy has been changed and our hope now is that this policy of providing more money from the Central Fund for county roads will continue.  Deputies from all sides of this House will agree that in almost every county in the country the smaller roads are in a deplorable condition.  We know that no matter how the local authorities strive to improve these roads the responsibility placed on them to try and do that job out of their own financial resources is too heavy and that they could not achieve the desired results while the main roads were provided with nearly all the money given in grants.  That is why I say to the Minister that we all hope the policy <Col N="1010" /> of providing more money for the construction and maintenance of county roads would be continued and that it will expand so that eventually our county roads will be kept in a good and suitable condition.</P>
    <P>Many of us are very pleased to note that progress is again being speeded up on schemes under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  When the Act was introduced we in the Labour Party welcomed it because we believed that good work could be done under its provisions.  Our beliefs were justified in that measure which was introduced by the late Deputy T.J. Murphy.  It is wrong to say that, because Deputies have been able to come in and give specific instances of work badly carried out, the Act was not justified.  Several schemes of tremendous importance have been carried out under it in rural areas.  In connection with this important work I, in company with my colleagues in the Labour Party, express the hope that the schemes will be continued and that more moneys will be allocated under it.</P>
    <P>In connection with housing, I am sure the Minister will realise that in some counties we in the local authorities are doing our share in trying to speed up the building of homes for our people.  We realise our responsibility and we know that if we are to improve our efforts in this direction it can be done only through a greater sense of co-operation between the Minister and his Department on the one hand and the local authorities on the other.</P>
    <P>Many important items occur to one under this question of housing.  Many Deputies have mentioned the ceiling as regards grants but I would remind the House that a very retrograde step was taken in this House two or three years ago in this regard and time has justified the fears expressed by members of this side of the House about that step which was in relation to the question of supplementary grants for housing.  Originally that measure was designed to cover applicants with a family income of £6 per week, but under the last Administration <Col N="1011" /> it was pared down to a miserable amount: in order to qualify for a supplementary grant the applicant could not have an income of more than £204 or £208 a year.</P>
    <P>Similarly, in order to get two-thirds of it, the family income must not amount to more than £320 or £325 roughly.  If the family income exceeds £416 or £418 the applicant is out completely. I know these figures were subsequently altered or improved to some extent, but from my experience as a member of a local authority, a number of genuine applicants, genuine in our belief at any rate, have been denied the right to a supplementary grant; the number, as I know from experience, is very high.  When talking of the allocation of grants and the improvement in them, the most important step fundamentally, in our opinion, is that this measure should be re-examined with a view to easing the means test in relation to the supplementary grants.</P>
    <P>It is our duty to provide houses in the various county council areas and we should be prepared to do our utmost to co-operate financially with applicants who are prepared to build their own houses.  Should these people not be desirous of building their own homes the burden of providing houses for them will fall on the local authority provided they qualify.  If, on the other hand, these people are prepared not to depend on the local authority to build houses for them but rather to build their own houses, we should then do our very utmost to ensure that these go ahead people are facilitated in every way.</P>
    <P>There is another point in relation to houses to which I would like to draw the Minister's attention.  Under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts, certain people are entitled to apply for a loan to the local authorities.  Now that is helpful, but I am afraid that in some local authority areas those administering these loans are far too stringent in their views and far too narrow in their outlook when it comes to co-operating with applicants for loans.  There is one aspect that has been completely overlooked all down <Col N="1012" /> the years.  A man may be a tenant of a house for many years.  The time may come when the landlord is anxious to sell; he may be prepared to give first option to the tenant.  I suggest that if no grant was given for the erection of that house originally, provided the house is in a proper state of repair and meets all the requirements and demands of the local authority engineer, the tenant of that house should be facilitated under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act in the purchase of that house; and if that is not enough to enable him to avail of the opportunity of providing himself with a home for himself and his family, a loan should be advanced to him.  The Minister may possibly argue that the main purpose of providing money by way of loan is in relation to the building of new houses, since automatically new houses provide new rates for the local authority That may be so, but I maintain we ought not to be quite so narrow in our outlook.</P>
    <P>For some years back, at the present moment and for some years to come our main criticism or commendation in relation to local government must be directed to housing.  I appeal to the Minister to investigate the position in the light of the suggestions that I have made.  I have no intention of delaying the House, not that I wish to relieve the Minister or his Department of responsibility or because I think everything is going well but because I think it is only fair to hold our fire until we see how the new County Management Act will operate.  I sincerely hope in that connection that we will have the co-operation all of us were so desirous of achieving when that measure was going through the House.</P>
    <P>If that co-operation is given to us and if members of local authorities are prepared to accept their responsibilities we will in time be in a position to assess where and how we stand in relation to this important Department, more important perhaps to the people in the rural areas than any other Department of State since it has a more direct bearing on their daily lives.  I think within the next 12 months we will have a fairly clear indication of the position.  During the <Col N="1013" /> interregnum we will be satisfied with maintaining the rate of progress; but in every aspect of the administration of this Department&mdash;housing, roads, water and sewerage&mdash;it is essential that there should be the utmost co-operation with the local authorities.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the matter I am now about to raise comes within the ambit of the Department of Local Government.  If it does not, I appeal to the Minister to raise it with the responsible Minister.  I refer to the advisability of getting the E.S.B. to co-operate with local authorities in connection with public lighting.  When we are dealing with the annual estimates a prohibitive impost is placed on ratepayers for public lighting.  The impost is in my opinion disgraceful. This problem must be tackled.  We cannot decide not to provide an amenity such as public lighting where rural communities are entitled to it, but, because of the present impost, we are almost debarred from providing such an amenity.  If that is not a function of the Minister for Local Government, I appeal to him to take the matter up with the Department of Industry and Commerce or with whatever Department is responsible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry:</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with only one brief portion of the work of the Minister's Department, namely, the provision and maintenance of library services throughout the country.  I think it can be said that these services are as good as the local committee and the local authority can make them.  In the City of Cork we are fortunate in the services we have been able to provide there.  We have been singularly fortunate in our librarians and we have been fortunate, too, in the fact that the city manager is a man of very enlightened views.  We have been able to provide lectures.  Excellent exhibitions have been held.  I mention these things because Deputy Childers referred to a possible extension of such library work.  Such work is being done and can be done if the local committee and the librarian take it upon themselves, obtain the necessary funds and have sufficient energy to do these things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one problem we will find <Col N="1014" /> ourselves confronted with in the City of Cork in the near future; that is the growth of the actual city area.  We will have to consider the provision of branch libraries outside the central depot.  That will mean a greater demand on the rates.  However, the service is such a worthwhile one I hope the ratepayers will be good enough to help us in that matter.  I have a very deep sense of the importance of a good library service and I hope the Department will continue to favour the enlightened development of such services. The report on the library services returned by the two librarians who made it is an extremely valuable document. It was completed with commendable thoroughness and I think the Minister should now set about implementing some of the suggestions made in that report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is agreed on both sides that this is the most important Estimate after that of the Department of Agriculture.  I am afraid I cannot compliment the Minister on his opening statement.  Quite obviously the Minister is breaking no new ground. He is conservative in his outlook in relation to the whole position of housing in the country to-day.  To give an example of that, we had a Deputy representing Cork, Deputy A. Barry, where conditions are not good with regard to housing, speaking here this afternoon of the library service.  He made no reference to housing.</P>
      <P>Admittedly, the library service is a very interesting service.  It is, I suppose, a service that would come within the category of culture.  To my amazement nevertheless Deputy A. Barry made no reference to the very acute housing problem which exists in Cork City.  There are, however, enough Cork representatives here to deal with the problems of Cork in a far more able manner than I can deal with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a good deal to say on this Estimate.  There is very little I can agree with in connection with the Minister's outlook and his air of complacency. Tremendous work has been done throughout the country in an effort to solve the housing problem, <Col N="1015" /> but a great deal more remains to be done.  We do not hear anything to-day about sending to England for skilled tradesmen&mdash;the carpenters, the masons and all the other categories which go to make up the building industry. We do not hear anything about bringing them back to-day because to-day there is idleness in the building industry.</P>
    <P>Building is one of our major industries here.  Yet, in every part of the country to-day building operatives are idle.  While there may be certain logical reasons for that, in my opinion a lot of the fault lies with the Department of Local Government.  First of all, there is no proper co-ordination between Government Departments. They do not look to the future to find out what employment will be afforded for a number of years ahead in such areas as Limerick, Cork, Waterford or Galway.  They seem to live from year to year&mdash;from hand to mouth&mdash;and they do not appear to realise that while, on paper, a mason, a carpenter or a skilled tradesman may have a good wage, he can be idle for quite a considerable period of the year due either to inept planning or to a complete lack of planning on the part of the Department of Local Government, and, indirectly I suppose due, too, to the incompetence of local authorities.</P>
    <P>I am sick and tired of sitting here listening to Deputies complimenting city and county managers.  With very few exceptions, I think the less said about those gentlemen the better.</P>

      <P>I did intend to go into technicalities in connection with planning, but the day is a bit heavy. Indeed, so far as planning, or, rather, lack of planning is concerned, one has only to look at Dublin.  Not so long ago O'Connell Street was one of the loveliest streets in Europe.  To-day it is suggestive of a honky-tonk in Algiers with its vitreolite shop fronts and nico-lodeons blaring forth.  Responsibility may appear a frivolous subject, but it is not frivolous.  The aesthetic attributes of a city are most important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1016" /> We hear a good deal about An Tóstal and about cleaning up our cities, our towns and our villages.  It is an appalling penance to walk down O'Connell Street to-day and see the bastardised architecture which has grown up over the last few years.  If there is no control by the Dublin Corporation or the competent town planning authority the Minister should step in.  These bodies are riddled with red tape in relation to certain technicalities. Yet, they permit these monstrous abortions to be erected.</P>
    <P>These abortions are an eye-sore.  They have been commented on most adversely by visitors to this country.  The sooner something is done about this situation the better it will be; otherwise it will come under the scope of the Gaming and Lotteries Bill as far as I can see and be more germane to the Estimate on the Department of Justice.  In that connection a friend of mine went in the other day to a licensed premises and while he was having refreshment there the same tune was played over and over again by one of these machines.  In all, it was played 22 times: &ldquo;Softly, Softly&rdquo; was the name of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley:</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of correction, I was not referring to any structure on O'Connell Bridge.  That has already been discussed <i>ad nauseam.</i>  I was referring to the bastardised architecture of the shop fronts on either side of O'Connell Street.  I am not talking about the bridge at all; at least there are flowers on it.</P>
      <P>I hold that the Minister is directly responsible for the defects in our present architecture.  This kind of thing is not confined to Dublin.  It is also happening in Cork, in Limerick and in Waterford.  These monstrosities are appalling.  They are spoiling the whole country.  The Minister should take some action about these town planners, a most mythical race.  No one ever sees them.  As far as Limerick City is concerned, I will admit we have a most eminent man but he is like an absentee landlord; he passes plans which are transmitted to him by Dublin.  As far as their being considered by the Limerick Corporation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>So far, these people have not proved their usefulness to the community as a whole.  The Minister will have to do something.  He should call a conference of all town planners throughout the State.  While I am on the subject of town planning, the general public do not realise their rights in relation to town planning at all.  If a man has land and makes a certain proposal in connection with that land and that proposal is turned down by the town planner, the individual concerned suffers a certain loss; under the Town Planning Act he is entitled to compensation.  People do not seem to realise that and local authorities are rooking the public because the city managers and county managers do not make the public aware of their rights in the case of an adverse decision by the town planners.</P>
      <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
