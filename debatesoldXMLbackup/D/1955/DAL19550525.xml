    <Speaker pid="KathleenOConnor" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether he has received a resolution, which was passed by the Kerry County Council on 2nd May, 1955, in regard to a statement, made by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government, urging the people to abolish the Kerry County Council, and, if so, if he will state the terms of the resolution, and what action he proposes to take in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received a copy of the resolution of the Kerry County Council referred to in the question.  The terms of the resolution have been published in the newspapers, and it is unnecessary to repeat them here.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary did not, as is suggested in the wording both of the Deputy's question and of the resolution, urge the people to abolish the Kerry County Council.</P>
      <P>I am personally aware of the zealous manner in which the Parliamentary Secretary discharges his duties and his enthusiasm for speeding up housing throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2" /> The members of the Kerry County Council, in an interview which I had with them recently, detailed to me the achievements of the council in dealing with their housing problems.  I have no doubt that the members of the council are sincerely anxious to settle those problems and to provide the houses necessary for their people.</P>
    <P>While differences of opinion may exist as to the methods to be employed, I suggest that, as it is apparent that both the county councillors and the Parliamentary Secretary are agreed on the objective to be attained, frank discussions between them would go far to settle the questions of methods and procedure requisite to solve the problems.  There is no reason why such discussions should not take place and so put an end to controversy.</P>

      <P>and <b>J. Lynch</b> asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state, in respect of the period 2nd June, 1954, to date, and the corresponding period in the previous year, (1) the number of trade disputes which occurred in the Republic of <Col N="3" /> Ireland, (2) the number which were for increases of pay, (3) the names of the firms and unions involved, and (4) the number of working days lost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Norton) William Norton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Norton)</NameTxt>
      <P>Information which has been compiled from various sources shows that the number of trade disputes between 2nd June, 1954, and the latest date for which this information is available was 86, as compared with 74 in the period 2nd June, 1953, to 1st June, 1954.  The number which were for increases in pay was 25, as compared with 19 in the period 2nd June, 1953, to 1st June, 1954.  The number of <Col N="4" /> man-days lost was 99,685 as compared with 58,752 in the period 2nd June, 1953, to 1st June, 1954.</P>
      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to circulate with the Official Report a statement giving the information sought in the third part of the question.</P>
      <P>As there is no statutory obligation on employers or workers to make available the information requested in the question, it will be appreciated that no guarantee can be given that the particulars supplied are fully comprehensive, or completely accurate.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement:&mdash;</P>

As a result of that inquiry, and on the recommendation of the Prices Advisory Body, the Bacon (Maximum Prices) Order, 1955, was made by me on 12th February, 1955.  The Schedule to that Order specified in ten different columns a series of maximum retail prices for bacon.  These prices were calculated in relation to different ex-factory bacon prices, and the Order provided that the prices specified in any particular column could be brought into operation by a direction of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
      <P>The latest adjustment in retail bacon prices was made in accordance with these arrangements, on the application of the retail trade, and followed a direction published on 7th May, 1955, and effective from the 9th May.</P>

      <P>I give this reply and replies to two other somewhat similar questions on to-day's Order Paper under the letters subdividing the queries in the questions.</P>
      <P>(a)  The period of office of the Broadcasting Advisory Committee has expired and a new committee has not yet been appointed.</P>
      <P>(b)  The advisory functions of the committee are to assist the Minister in the conduct of the broadcasting stations and in the selection and control of the broadcast matter distributed from such stations.</P>
      <P>(c)  The committee met normally about once a month but sometimes at longer intervals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(d)  Members of the committee were consulted from time to time in subcommittees or individually about certain <Col N="22" /> types of programmes on any subject on which they happened to have special knowledge but it would normally be for the committee itself to initiate action about any aspect of broadcasting on which they wished to advise the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkDeering" hpid="Mr. Deering Mr. Deering">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deering</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (a) on what basis the members of the Advisory Body of Radio Eireann are appointed, (b) if any vacancy on the body has occurred since its formation, and, if so, how such vacancy has been filled, and (c) for what period the members of the present body have been appointed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>(a)  With the exception of two members appointed specifically to represent agriculture and education members of the Broadcasting Advisory Committee were appointed because of their general knowledge of a cultural or other nature, apart from any specialist qualifications they possessed.</P>
      <P>(b)  Vacancies occurred from time to time in the committee and they were generally left unfilled until there was a general reconstruction of the committee after each period of office.</P>
      <P>(c)  The two years' period of office of the advisory committee expired on the 31st October, 1954, and a new committee has not yet been appointed.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="23" /> (b)  The duties laid down for the comhairle are to advise and assist the Minister in the conduct of the broadcasting service and to exercise general control and supervision over the service.  The comhairle acts in an executive as well as in an advisory capacity.  The comhairle met 16 times during 1954 and five times so far in 1955.  Between meetings the chairman is in regular consultation with the director.</P>
    <P>(c)  It is not a normal function of the comhairle to suggest individual programmes and they would not ordinarily express objections to programmes unless something like a serious breach of taste or a matter of policy were involved; no such objections were reported to me.  I understand, however, that general programme matters involving issues of policy are regularly discussed at meetings of the comhairle attended by the director.</P>
    <P>The term of office for which the comhairle was appointed expired on the 31st December, 1954, but I have asked them to continue to act temporarily without a definite date limit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Cosgrave)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose replying to Questions Nos. 27 and 28 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the report referred to which does not, however, correctly summarise the reply of the Irish Government to the United Nations inquiry. In its reply the Government expressed the view that further examination of the proposals for a reform of the calendar by international agreement ought to depend upon the likelihood of gaining for any such reform such a measure of international agreement, including the agreement of the religious authorities concerned, and of the Catholic Church in particular, as would secure international acceptance and avoid the danger of a reform being partially accepted.</P>
      <P>In considering the inquiry from the United Nations such expert advice from within the Government service as appeared necessary at this stage was obtained.  The views of the Director of the Vatican Observatory regarding technical and religious aspects of the problem have already been published and were available as were also the views expressed by the representatives of the Protestant Churches and the Jewish Faith.</P>
      <P>From information available, it would not appear that the present proposal of the United Nations for calendar reform will receive a substantial measure of international support, and the likelihood of calendar reform is remote. Consequently I do not propose to set up a special commission of inquiry to examine the question.</P>

While, owing to the many factors likely to be involved, it is not possible to say with any certainty what the actual figures would be, it is estimated that the cost to the Exchequer of the establishment of a system of P.A.Y.E. for income-tax payable under Schedule E would be £160,000 for the year of introduction and that after a few years the annual cost would diminish to some £100,000.</P>

In some cases the works provided for general improvements such as the removal of a limited number of obstructions, the removal of accumulated deposits and some re-garding of the banks.  Where the proposals were suitable they were approved for execution under grants available to the councils.  In other cases, particularly in the case of some of the rivers mentioned by the Deputy, the work proposed was of a more extensive nature providing for large-scale removal of rock obstructions, re-grading of the river channel throughout its length and such other heavy work.  These latter works, being of arterial dimensions, would be outside the scope of schemes under the Local Authorities (Works) Act and accordingly they could not have been approved.  Even work appropriate to the Act could not be approved in some cases where it would create downstream flooding necessitating drainage of an arterial character towards the outfall.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I had hoped that, after the short discussion which took <Col N="30" /> place recently on this Bill, the Government had decided, and wisely decided, to forget all about this measure.  I was greatly surprised, therefore, to find that this Bill was coming before the House to-day in spite of the opposition expressed to it by many Deputies in the House and by various sections of our community outside.</P>
      <P>In the words of the Minister, the Bill is to re-enact with amendments the laws which already exist to prevent gaming, except that certain small lotteries and gaming will be allowed to continue for charitable purposes. The Minister went on to say that the principle on which he worked was that gaming is not wrong in itself but that public gaming needs restriction to prevent fraud and abuses.  The Minister expressed anxiety that no foolish persons would be allowed to ruin themselves and their families by excessive gambling, but he did not want at the same time to create powerful vested interests in the form of professional gamblers, or racketeers.</P>
      <P>These, to sum up, were the reasons given as to why this measure was brought in.  The extraordinary thing, of course, is that as far as this Bill is concerned it does not even touch on the main causes of evil with regard to gaming and with regard to abuses that exist.  The Bill, and I regret to have to say it, in my opinion reeks of hypocrisy.  Under this measure it will be quite in order to rob the widow and the orphan provided it is done for charitable purposes.  That cannot be denied when the sections of this Bill are discussed later on in Committee. We have here sub-section (2) of Section 4 which exempts what might be described as private gaming.  But the showman who comes to the villages in rural Ireland and provides for the people in the locality an innocent game of pontoon and the other amusements that are provided by these show people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  That individual is now going to be subject to severe restrictions.  He needs must get the <Col N="31" /> permission of the local authority before he can set up in a small village and under this Bill if it becomes law he can stay no longer than a week in that particular village.  We all know that the weather may be against amusements of that kind.  We all know the difficulties of travelling that obtain in rural areas yet here we are deliberately making an attempt under this Bill to squeeze out that small man who, at the present time, is helping to bring a bit of life into the rural areas. While that attempt is being made to squeeze out this type of showman, permission is given, under sub-section (2) of Section 4, for private gaming.  In other words, those people who wish to form a club can play all the little games they like.</P>
      <P>The comparison that I will draw there is with the licensing laws at the present time.  There is a similar line of approach here in this measure as there was to the licensing laws where we have clubs that can cater for certain sections of the community and give them facilities not available to the ordinary individuals.  That is done under a special section of the Licensing Act to cover these clubs.  Here we are proposing to give special facilities to similar organised groups who can have their own gaming, but for the ordinary countryman and woman we are going to provide nothing in the future.</P>
      <P>We know how seldom pictures come to the rural areas.  We know also how much talk there is about social amenities and improved conditions that would keep the people on the land.  It must be admitted, however, that the facilities available at the present moment for amusements are not going to keep very many more on the land, but why should we curtail what is there already in the line of amusement? The attitude of the Government and, I think, also of the ex-Minister for Justice, Deputy Boland, is that gaming, whether in the form of wagering, games of chance or lotteries, is not bad in itself but that excessive gaming brings excessive evil in its train.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If that is the case put forward by the Government, surely there must be <Col N="32" /> very strong evidence at their disposal that widows have been robbed by playing Pongo and that the children who play on these slot-machines have come to the stage where they have lost their parents' money.  Surely there must be evidence available that serious harm has been done to our community.</P>
    <P>I hope that evidence will be forthcoming from the Minister.  It is extraordinary how much sympathy is shown towards certain sections of the community at the present time in connection with this gaming while a greater temptation is left for the widow and for the father of a family in the form of the public or licensed bookie's office.  I wonder which is the greater evil.  You have the bookie's office where the breadwinner can put his entire wages on some horse and leave his wife and family without the means of existence for the next week or ten days.  Surely control of that type of gambling is much more necessary than the control which is now sought to be exercised over games like Pongo and other similar forms of amusement.</P>
    <P>Before this Bill came into the House we had a good deal of publicity in the various papers about foreigners&mdash;undesirable aliens&mdash;who had come in here and were setting themselves up in business groups and exploiting the public through this Pongo business and through slot-machines, and it was felt that these people should be crushed out.  If we have such undesirables, steps should be taken to curb their activity, but there is no use in taking steps to curb their activity if those steps are of a nature that will harm our own people or prevent them having lawful amusement.</P>
    <P>It is gratifying to find that people in power are aware of the serious inroads that have been made into various aspects of our life by foreigners.  It is gratifying to know that there is a feeling of uneasiness amongst those who are in control of the affairs of State and that steps are being taken to curb the activities of these gentlemen in certain aspects, but it is tragic that all we are offered by way of curbing these people is a little Gaming Bill like this, that we will prevent them <Col N="33" /> operating slot-machines and Pongo, while we allow them to buy up the best land in this country.  If we go about curbing aliens, as the Government desire, let us start with fundamentals. If we do not allow these people to purchase the business and the land of the country, we will not have much trouble with them in connection with the running of Pongo or slot-machines.</P>
    <P>It is suggested that gaming and lotteries are more open to abuse and to the danger of fraud than betting on horses and dogs.  It is suggested that the greyhound industry and the horse-breeding industry are of great benefit to the country and that, consequently, betting should be allowed.  If we are to have restrictions and control on certain aspects, I do not see why other forms of gambling should be excluded.</P>
    <P>I shall refer now to Section 49 of the Bill and I would like the Minister to clarify the position for me.  Section 49 states:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This Act does not apply to a sweepstake under the Public Hospitals Acts, 1933 to 1940.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There will be a limit of £300 prize money with regard to lotteries and, in addition to that limitation, under Section 32, it will be illegal to send out of the State any ticket or counterfoil or coupon for use in a lottery, so that the running of lotteries and pools must be confined to the State.  The Hospitals' Trust are entitled to send money, orders, and so forth, to the four corners of the earth.</P>
    <P>I would not mind so much if this was a State lottery.  It is not.  If the Minister assured me that he would take steps to have the sweep a State lottery, I would not have the objection I have at the present time.  I see no reason in the world why there should be sections in this Bill to exclude particular groups, particular vested interests that have grown up in the last 20 to 30 years.</P>
    <P>There will be a limitation on running expenses for lotteries under this Bill. Yet, in Section 49, we are specifically excluding one lottery from the terms of the Bill.  To make it still more glaring, the Hospitals' Sweep are in a position at the present time that they <Col N="34" /> need not disclose the amount of free tickets issued to sellers of tickets; they need not disclose the figure given for commissions and they need not disclose the figure for other remunerations in their return after each sweep.  That power is conferred on the people who run the sweep under Section 2 of the Public Hospitals Act 1933.</P>
    <P>Why cannot we have this particular lottery brought into line with the lotteries which will be subject to control under this Bill or, <i>vice versa,</i> why cannot we give the same facilities to the small lotteries that are run in the country as to this one which has special protection under the 1933 Act?</P>
    <P>Remember, there are many lotteries being run for very excellent purposes, some for charitable purposes.  There is one lottery run to get funds to help patients who have suffered from T.B. to rehabilitate.  There is also a lottery run to help the revival of the Irish language.  I shall not refer specifically to any of them now, but there is quit a number and, under this Bill, the promoters of these lotteries will have to pack in.  That would be a very undesirable and a very unfair thing to happen. I do not believe that the Minister personally would like that to happen.</P>
    <P>I mentioned certain aspects of gambling and so forth which are excluded from the terms of this Bill.  I would like to tell the Minister that in, I think, 1926, a joint committee was set up to examine the whole problem of gambling as far as racing, bookmakers, and so forth were concerned.  If it was considered desirable in 1926 to set up such a committee to examine all the aspects of a problem such as this, such a committee is more necessary now.  There may be and probably there is need for certain precautions and regulations, but I am firmly convinced that this Bill is not the correct or proper way to go about this matter.</P>
    <P>I would urge the Minister to let the Bill drop.  I know he is a man of principle and courage and I feel sure that when he realises that it was a mistake ever to introduce this Bill he will withdraw it and, instead, set up a committee of the type I have suggested.  If he does that he will be conferring a <Col N="35" /> benefit on the public because the evidence of all the interested people can be taken, an examination can be made of the desirability of bringing in certain restrictions, and plenty of time could be given to thrashing out all these problems.  If this measure becomes law as it stands I can assure the Minister that it will be a law that will not be respected.</P>
    <P>It is a terrible thing to put on the Statute Book laws that do not have the respect and the approval of the general public.  If the Bill passes and becomes law and if people are prosecuted under certain sections of this Bill, I have no doubt in my mind that the general public will have more sympathy with the people prosecuted than they will with the State.  It is a bad thing if legislation is looked upon as unfair.</P>
    <P>To give a final comparison, we have nothing but dissatisfaction all over this country at the present time in connection with the administration of the licensing laws for the sale of liquor on Sundays and with regard to the facilities that are available to hotels and clubs and the lack of facilities for the ordinary man and woman.  If this measure is enacted you will have the same form of dissatisfaction and you will initiate the same sort of distinction, a form of class distinction among our people.  I would urge finally on the Minister to drop this Bill altogether and set up a committee to examine all the aspects which are involved.</P>

      <P>All Deputies of the House are agreed that a Bill in some form should appear on the Statute Book dealing with this matter, but I certainly do not think that this Bill in its present form will meet the requirements.  To be successful, many amendments in every section of the Bill will, in my opinion, have to be made.</P>
      <P>I will draw the Minister's attention to Part I, which under the heading &ldquo;Preliminary and General&rdquo; says (Section 1 (2)):&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;This Act shall come into <Col N="36" /> operation on such day as the Minister shall by Order appoint.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>No one knows whether this Bill will pass through the Dáil before the summer recess or before Christmas or in 1956 with all the amendments which are envisaged.  If the Minister could give some interim concession to the amusement caterers and others concerned in the country he would be doing a good day's work.  The holiday season is approaching when we will have the usual seaside carnivals.  Not only the caterers themselves but various charitable organisations are in a quandary as to what exactly they may do.  I would appeal to the Minister to give some interim concession pending the passing of the proposed legislation.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill, in its present form, the only people who will benefit are the lawyers, both solicitors and barristers. It is a very vague and ambiguous measure and each section can be interpreted in many ways.  It would appear that if it is passed as it stands we are in for another era of pontification from that extraordinary tribe known as district justices.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to the Bill.  I would like to refer the Minister to Part II, Section 4, sub-section (2) (c) (i) (ii).  It seems there is no restriction whatever with regard to the prize money which may be offered, that any sum could be offered as a prize, say, for a whist drive.  As the Bill stands at present, if the game is run for charity or for a club, sub-section (2) (c) (i) does not apply, which means that £5 could be charged for playing a game and £1,000 could be given as a prize, which is fantastic.</P>
      <P>In sub-section (2) (a) of Section 4 it says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Only one charge is made in respect of the day on which the game is played or the charge is related directly to the time spent in playing the game.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Five pounds or any figure can be charged in respect of the day on which the game is played, or if the charge is related directly to the time spent playing the game.  Sub-section (2) (b) says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;the charge does not vary in accordance with the stakes, and</P>
      <P>(c)  either&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  the amount of the charge is no more than is reasonably required to meet the actual cost of the facilities provided for the playing of the game, or</P>
      <P>(ii)  the promoter derives no personal profit from the promotion of the game.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that is most obscure and I suggest to the Minister that a <Col N="38" /> maximum charge of 5/- be made and put into this Bill for a person wishing to take part in such a game.  By specifying a charge such as 5/- as the maximum, the amount of the prize itself will be limited.  In its present form the matter can get out of hand.</P>
    <P>While I am dealing with Part II, I would draw the Minister's attention to the fact that whist drives and &ldquo;45&rdquo; drives throughout the country are becoming a racket.  Certain individuals who attend these drives work in collusion with the organising committees to win the first prize, and the first prize can be very substantial around the Christmas period for instance.  I have had personal experience of that both from running these drives myself and from taking part in them as a player.  There is fraud, cheating and deceit and the ordinary individual who pays his 6d. or 1/- to take part in such drives has not a chance because these others are making a business out of it.</P>
    <P>When introducing the Bill on the Second Reading the Minister said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Owing to the difficulties that have been experienced in proving, in the case of particular games, that the chances of all the players, including the banker, are not equal, the definition of unlawful games in the Gaming Act, 1845, has been widened so as to include gaming &lsquo;in which a toll is levied on the stakes or for the right to take part in which any charge is made&rsquo;.  The new definition will, it is felt, bring within its ambit all gambling games (such as Pongo) irrespective of whether they are games of skill or chance, and will render the promoters liable to prosecution.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Following on that, certain newspapers came out with a heading to the effect that Pongo was outlawed or would be outlawed.  Unless I am misinterpreting the Bill, it would appear that under certain conditions unlawful gaming will become lawful gaming.  I think that statement of the Minister's needs clarification. One newspaper carried the heading: &ldquo;Pongo Outlawed&rdquo;, and two amusement caterers foolishly got rid of <Col N="39" /> their paraphernalia when they read the papers.  In my opinion, if they complied with certain sections of this Bill there would be no necessity for them to do that.</P>
    <P>In Section 6, sub-section (a) of Part II it is stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Gaming carried on at any place ...shall not be unlawful gaming if (a) gaming is not the main activity at the show.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Who will draw the very fine line of distinction there?  Who will tell the promoter what is the main activity? Will the main activity be decided from the point of view of revenue or greater turnover?  That, too, requires some clarification.  Sub-section (b) states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The show at or within three miles of that place does not extend over a period exceeding one week and has not been carried on within that area during the preceeding three months.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister has advanced no sound argument for the inclusion of that particular provision.  Deputies who have spoken on this measure have shown that the provision is fantastic.</P>
    <P>Deputy Boland played a large part in the preparation of this Bill when he was Minister for Justice, and very few changes have been made in it since he left office; but irrespective of who prepared it, the present Bill leaves very much to be desired.  The present Minister seems to be obsessed with the idea that fortunes are lost by people who play Pongo and other games of that kind.  Though individuals can go to a racecourse and gamble indiscriminately, the ninth annual report of the Racing Board states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That racegoers in general are not concerned with gambling is evidenced by the fact that almost 80 per cent. of totalisator tickets are purchased in 2/- and 4/- units.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Surely the Minister will not suggest that people have no sense of responsibility. Surely he must take into consideration all the people who cannot attend a race meeting or go out to Harold's Cross, Shelbourne Park or the other dog tracks around the country. Surely his approach to this <Col N="40" /> measure must be a common-sense approach.</P>
    <P>Deputy McQuillan suggested the Minister should drop the Bill.  I do not agree with that point of view.  I think the Bill is on the whole a welcome measure, but it does need amendment. To some extent it is not an honest Bill because it is not facing up to the facts.  It is full of ambiguities.</P>
    <P>This stipulation of a period of one week will have to be changed because common sense dictates that it must be changed.  The period should be three months.  Many of these travelling shows pay quite large sums to local authorities.  The rentals for the concessions they receive are pretty stiff. As has already been pointed out, they contribute very generously to local charities.  In connection with Galway, it was pointed out that that particular amusement caterer hands over the proceeds of the first two weeks to local charities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1943" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be, but nevertheless local charities benefit considerably. A period of two weeks is nonsensical.  I say the period should be three months.  The sub-section stipulates&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;and has not been carried on within that area during the preceding three months.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I cannot understand that provision at all.  On the other hand, we have individuals advocating the furtherance of An Tóstal activities.  We read reports in the newspapers every day from highly-placed individuals concerning the lack of amusement and complaining that rural life in Ireland is suffering because of this lack, which is also said to be one of the reasons for the flight from the land.</P>
      <P>If carnivals take place around the Tóstal period, does it mean in actual fact that a large firm&mdash;there are only a certain number of these very large firms that are in a position to give good employment&mdash;which, say for the sake of argument, remains in Galway for the Tóstal period, could not appear back again in Galway, as sub-section (b) states:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="41" />&ldquo;the show at or within three miles of that place does not extend over a period exceeding one week and has not been carried on within that area during the preceding three months, and ...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I wonder if I am wrong?  I see the Minister shakes his head, but I cannot get any other interpretation.</P>

      <P>That would not be much use to him because as everybody knows amusement caterers or football or hurling clubs make their arrangements well in advance, maybe in January or February.  Would they risk going along for the Tóstal and staying a certain period in a certain place and then depending on a district justice to see if the decision will be in their favour?  The Minister should abolish that section completely.  It is serving no useful purpose; it is merely a waste of print.  It will lead to utter confusion and, as I said before the Minister came in, it will yield a rich harvest not alone to junior counsel and solicitors, but to our very eminent senior ones also.  The poor man in the street and the promoters particularly of our national games will suffer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Section 16 the Minister, without doing any harm, could easily change the age from 16 to 14 years.  I understand that according to the law of this country young people may get married at the age of 12, yet they cannot go in and play Pongo.  The analogy might appear a little strained, but I am told that is the position.  I suggest that the Minister should bring the age down to 14.  As he knows, the young people <Col N="42" /> could be doing something much worse than attending an amusement arcade. I have seen many of them in these places actually under parental control and at many of these events when they are run for charity you have present the local schoolteacher and people of that type who can keep an eye on the youngsters.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall deal with that shortly.  I think I am right in saying that under certain conditions Pongo and such-like games are legal.</P>
      <P>Section 7 does not make its meaning perfectly clear:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Gaming carried on as part of a carnival, bazaar, sports meeting, local festival, exhibition or other like event shall not be unlawful gaming if&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the persons arranging for the holding of the event derive no personal profit from the event or from the game, and</P>
      <P>(b)  gaming is not the main activity of the event...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>May the people arranging for the holding of the event enter into an arrangement with an amusement caterer?  That is not very clear and under (b) which ensures that gaming is not the main activity they must be able to do so because they would not have the equipment required.  Any ordinary charitable body or a committee of a football club would not have equipment for side shows, rifle ranges, hobby horses, etc., as this would involve considerable financial outlay.</P>
      <P>Every section I have dealt with so far shows to the ordinary layman like myself the ambiguities that exist, and God knows what ambiguities will be found by the lawyers.  I shudder to think of them.</P>
      <P>I would refer the Minister to his opening statement in Volume 150, No. 1, at column 85:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Section 8, which prohibits gaming on licensed premises, and <Col N="43" /> Section 10 which provides penalties for cheating, are simply stating existing law.  It is intended, however, that where there is only one charge in respect of the day on which the game is played the charge will not constitute part of the stakes hazarded by the player and in consequence playing of games such as whist or rings or darts, in which there are no side-stakes, but in which the player hazards his entry fee in a competition to win a prize will not come within the definition of gaming and will not be prohibited on licensed premises.  This is simply a case of removing the technical offence which is at present committed by operation of some of these harmless games in public-houses, licensed hotels and clubs.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am very interested in that, out of curiosity, and not from any personal motives.</P>
    <P>Whist can be played in a licensed premises and I fail to see under the section how the Minister deduces that such is the case.  If whist can be played, I presume solo, &ldquo;45&rdquo; and poker can also be played.  Can anybody envisage a publican asked by some of his clientele: &ldquo;Boss, can we play poker?&rdquo; replying: &ldquo;Hold on a minute, Jack, until I look up the appropriate section of the Act.&rdquo;  It says here that you can play whist, but I am not too sure about poker or &ldquo;45&rdquo;. No doubt it would cost the licensee two or three guineas to find out and then his advice might not be altogether correct. Therefore, I would refer the matter to the Minister again and respectfully point out that his interpretation is not in accordance with what the section itself states.</P>
    <P>Section 9 deals with slot-machines Before going into the section itself, may I ask if the Minister will be prepared to give facilities for the export of illegal slot-machines which amusement caterers hold?  That would at least lighten the blow which they are about to suffer or have suffered.  In my view, that concession should be considered.  As this Section 9 stands, cigarette machines, chewing-gum machines, chocolate machines, and <Col N="44" /> so forth, are all barred.  &ldquo;No person shall operate or cause or permit to be operated or provide facilities for the operation of any slot-machine, that is to say, any machine designed to deliver, when successfully operated,....&rdquo; A chocolate machine is designed to deliver and, when successfully operated, delivers a bar of chocolate.  &ldquo;.... a money prize or a token or other article....&rdquo;  A bit of chewing-gum would be an &ldquo;other article.&rdquo;&ldquo;.... which the promoters or any person acting on his behalf undertakes or is willing to exchange for money or money's worth or which may be used to enable the machine to be operated again.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I submit that clarification is needed there.  I can visualise a very efficient young Garda of the type which they are turning out nowadays coming along and studying this section and telling an individual to take down his slot-machine if he is selling chewing-gum. As a matter of fact, it is debatable whether one can weigh oneself now because it delivers an article in exchange for money put into these slot-machines. Quite a lot of people weigh themselves regularly.  As the section stands, all these things I speak of are illegal until the Minister changes it.</P>
    <P>The whole difficulty in regard to the Bill is that five or six interpretations can be taken out of most of the sections. In his own mind, the Minister may possibly see that such and such is the logical interpretation, but, in effect, that is not necessarily what will happen.  When an application is made to the District Court or such court it will be the considered opinion of the learned district justice, or whoever will be dealing with these matters&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I should now like to refer the Minister to Part IV of the Bill.  Section 22 deals with private lotteries and it states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A lottery shall not be unlawful if</P>
      <P>(a)  the sale of chances is confined to</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="45" /> (i)  the members of one society established and conducted for purposes not connected with gaming, wagering or lotteries, ...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That could mean that a very large trade union, with thousands of members, could engage in a very large lottery.  Obviously, the Minister's purpose in introducing this section was to confine a lottery to a small group such as a football group or a local dramatic society, but, as the section stands, an organisation with thousands of members could run such a lottery.</P>
    <P>Sub-paragraph (b) of Section 22 provides:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A lottery shall not be unlawful if the tickets and counterfoils are individually identifiable only by a number or like distinguishing mark and bear no indication that they relate to a lottery,...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What is this great fear of lotteries? To-day, many Deputies left this House to hear the result of the Derby: they left to hear Phil Drake win&mdash;much to their chagrin.  A lot of money was wagered on the result of the Derby to-day&mdash;a lot more money, I submit, than would be wagered on many a night at Pongo, and the Minister knows that in his heart.</P>
    <P>While I am on the subject of lottery tickets, there is one point I should like to refer to the Minister.  There is a group of individuals going around this country hawking tickets.  We all meet them.  They knock on the door at night.  They will stop you on the street and you will buy a ticket for 3d., 6d., or 1/-, as the case may be. There is a definite abuse because, in quite a considerable number of cases, the money collected goes into the pocket of the person selling the ticket and does not reach the promoters of the raffle.</P>
    <P>The Minister may ask me what suggestions I have to make in that respect.  I suggest that the promoters of a football club, or other such body, be allowed to run a raffle or a lottery on condition that, like the Hospitals' Trust, receipts are given to the purchasers, or some such safeguard to the <Col N="46" /> general public.  I know it would be a costly thing to have to issue a receipt for a 3d. or 6d. ticket but if these raffles are localised, as most of them are, and if they have an energetic local committee, then it will not kill them to get some youngsters in that local football club to deliver the receipts by hand.  At local elections we have to deliver our election literature to 37,000 or 40,000 persons by hand.</P>
    <P>I would impress on the Minister that there is a racket in this country and that the public will have to be protected.  Every Deputy in the House is aware of the truth of what I say.  If a man buys a raffle ticket for 6d. or 1/- and puts it into his pocket it is the last he hears about it and it is the last the promoters of the ticket see of it, in many cases.</P>
    <P>If we are to be realistic about this Bill and if we are to have Deputies on all sides of the House saying that it was time it was brought in let us get down to brass tacks and introduce something that will be effective and fair to all sections.  As the Bill stands we are not doing that and that is my reason for being so critical of the measure.  While speaking of gambling generally I should like to point out that last year on the racecourses of this country there was £5,750,000 wagered.  That, of course, was on the courses alone.  In the bookmakers' offices £6,000,000 was wagered, making a total of £11,750,000 wagered last year in this country on courses and in bookmakers' offices.  That does not include the money laid in dog tracks, because there is no levy in that connection.</P>
    <P>I am not advocating that there should be a tax on greyhound betting, but I am pointing out in a comparative way that the Minister is taking too seriously this matter of controlling the maximum amount of prize money involved in lotteries.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw the attention of the House also to the statement of the Racing Board issued last year, because I think it is one of the most important statements that could be introduced into this debate.  It shows that the people who bet or invest are <Col N="47" /> not careless or frivolous spendthrifts. The ninth annual report of the Racing Board says that racegoers in general are not concerned with gambling and that is evidenced by the fact that 80 per cent of the totalisator tickets purchased were in 2/- and 4/- units.  That, in my opinion, should be borne in mind by the Minister.  The amount of money placed on the totalisator last year in this country was £1,936,000 and now the Minister is turning around and mentioning a figure of £300 as the limit for first prize in one of these lotteries.</P>
    <P>I expect every Deputy in this House has got the memorandum issued by Gael-Linn and other organisations and it is quite obvious that the prize money of £300, which is the maximum limit allowed, should be increased.  I cannot see why the Minister will not allow a maximum prize or prizes in weekly raffles to a limit of £1,000.  I cannot see any reason in the world why.</P>
    <P>The Bill makes provision for the percentage allowed for expenses.  Does that mean that subscribers are limited? Section 25 says that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A superintendent of the Garda Síochána, on the application of any person residing in his district, may issue a permit for the promotion of a lottery in accordance with this section.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Sub-section (2) of the same section says that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The lottery shall comply with the following conditions:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the permit-holder shall derive no personal profit from the lottery;</P>
    <P>(b)  the total value of the prizes shall be not more than £300;</P>
    <P>(c)  the value of each prize shall be stated on every ticket or coupon.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Sub-section (3) of the same section provides:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A permit shall not be granted more than once in six months for the benefit of any one beneficiary.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There are quite a number of lotteries which will cease automatically if the prize fund is restricted to £300.  As I have told the Minister already the <Col N="48" /> figure I have advocated is a total prize fund of £1,000 and the Minister could review the position later on in the light of experience gained in 12 months after this measure has become law.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to do away with the provision dealing with the superintendents of the Garda Síochána.  I cannot see why they are brought into this at all.  I think that in any district the necessary application for a licence should be made directly to the District Court.  I think it would be a very small matter.  Where the superintendents of the Garda Síochána are concerned there are far too many personalities involved. Besides, the superintendents have enough work on their hands already without this new job of issuing permits to carnivals, bazaars and lotteries.</P>
    <P>I should also make reference to a provision in Section 26 which says that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Not more than one-quarter of the gross proceeds shall be utilised for the expenses of promotion, including commission, and any free entry for the lottery shall be deemed to be a payment of commission to the extent of its value.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Gael-Linn memorandum which every Deputy, including no doubt the Minister himself, has seen, shows the position as it will be experienced by other similar organisations promoting such lotteries.  I do not propose to deal with that in detail.  I should, however, like to say something on Part V of the Bill with regard to enforcement, evidence and penalties. Section 34 (1) says that every contract by way of gaming or wagering is void and sub-section (2) continues:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;No action shall lie for the recovery of any money or thing which is alleged to be won or to have been paid upon a wager or which has been deposited to abide the event on which a wager is made.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As far as that provision is concerned, I do not agree that the Minister is facing up to facts.  That means that a punter might plead the Gaming Act. It means that in fact an individual may have a substantial investment <Col N="49" /> with the bookmaker or a firm of bookmakers and default and that such bookmaker shall have no redress in the law courts notwithstanding the fact that the Exchequer is very anxious to recognise the bookmaking fraternity, as evidence its takings from them last year.</P>
    <P>But supposing for a moment that a bookmaker defaults on an individual. What happens then?  That individual can report the bookmaker to the Racing Board and recover his debt from the Racing Board and until such time as the bookmaker purges the debt he is warned off every race meeting in Ireland.</P>
    <P>In England, when they set up the Royal Commission on Gambling, there was a test case.  I would refer the Minister to Parliamentary Papers, H.C., 1950-51, No. 8.  There is a special section dealing with the enforceability of wagering transactions and I am suggesting that the Minister will bear it in mind.  The commission reported to Parliament:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Section 18 of the Gaming Act, 1845, provides that all contracts or agreements, whether by parole or in writing, by way of gaming or wagering, shall be null and void and unenforceable in courts of law.  The Act relates only to the original contract made between the wagering parties.  It does not affect subsequent agreements between the same parties relating to the original transaction but supported by fresh consideration on both sides.</P>
    <P>Until the recent decision of the House of Lords, in Tom Hill v. William Hill, Limited&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&mdash;they are the big English bookmakers&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;the courts proceeded on the basis of the decision in Hyams v. Stuart King, which decided that a renewed promise to pay the outstanding debt was legally enforceable if given in return for an undertaking by the other party that he would forbear to do some legitimate act, such as reporting the defaulter to a sporting association, which might prevent him from enjoying future betting facilities or amenities at racecourses.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="50" /> The decision in Hill v. Hill has reversed the decision in Hyams v. Stuart King.  The issue to be decided by the House of Lords was whether a promise by the loser of a racing bet to pay an amount equal to his debt in return for the winner's promise not to report his default to the stewards of the Jockey Club was enforceable at law.  On a careful analysis of the transactions which led to an apparently new agreement between the winner and the loser, the House of Lords held that there was, in the case before them, no fresh consideration given by the loser, whose promise was really no more than a promise to pay his existing racing debt.  By a majority of four opinions to three the House of Lords held that such a promise falls within the Gaming Act, 1845, and that no action could be brought upon it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>By a majority of four votes to three.</P>

      <P>I am urging the Minister to study Section 34 and to ensure that no one shall be entitled in this country to give the defence, in relation to a betting transaction, that he is pleading the Gaming Act.</P>
      <P>I could have spoken in greater detail but I did not wish to take up the time of the House.  I would respectfully point out to the Minister that, if this is to continue, God knows when this Bill will become law.  Would the Minister not try to get a committee to hammer out the various ambiguities which exist?  If he did so, a more expeditious and more satisfactory Bill would then be presented to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of us find difficulty in speaking to this Bill.  If we praise the Bill, we are, apparently, accusing amusement caterers of being all types of individuals whereas, if we oppose the Bill, apparently, we are to <Col N="51" /> do it because of the large number of victims that will be discovered in the persons of these people.</P>
      <P>The difficulty of Deputies from rural constituencies is very different from that of Deputies representing Dublin and, perhaps, to a lesser extent, Cork City.  We cannot understand why there should be so many restrictions imposed in rural areas or small seaside places on amusement that we think is not in itself in any way harmful. We realise that, having regard to the amount of money involved, the problem in Dublin or in Bray is much greater than it is down the country. That consideration will not help us to any large extent.  In my opinion, it would be a pity if the genuine showmen&mdash;there are a few, undoubtedly, in every part of the country&mdash;were to be handicapped.  If they are handicapped, the areas in which they operate will also be handicapped and the people in those areas will be deprived of the little amusement that has been theirs for many years past.</P>
      <P>There are other points, as mentioned by Deputy O'Malley, with which I could not agree.  Deputy McQuillan, perhaps, struck a strong note when he pointed out that when we are discussing this Bill we should be more farseeing in our praise or criticism. Deputy O'Malley mentioned the position of the defaulter in a betting transaction and wanted to know what will be done about him.  One of the glaring cases in connection with the Gaming Acts here, about which nothing is being done, is just the reverse of the point that has been mentioned by Deputy O'Malley, that is, where an unfortunate worker puts 5/- or 10/- on Phil Drake, the bookmaker in paying out will keep his 1/6d., not alone on the winnings, but also on the 10/-.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In discussing a Gaming Bill, it is no use to take the side either of the Minister and his Bill or of the so-called victims that are cropping up, many of whom have called on Deputies of all Parties in this House.  I am speaking of people who have been here to try to get the Bill amended to suit themselves.  I do not blame them for <Col N="52" /> that but they have approached members of every Party.</P>
    <P>Is it not a pity that, at this stage, when so much requires to be done and when there is so much that can be done, we have to devote such time to a Gaming Bill?  Are we to continue discussing this Bill when there are other things that we need far more urgently, even though this may be important to certain people?</P>
    <P>Deputy McQuillan mentioned one point and quoted one section.  I would hardly speak on this Bill at all if it were not for the interest that I have in that matter, that is, the omission from the Bill of the Hospitals' Sweep. I think, and many people down the country believe, that it is rather lopsided that a showman coming to Cross-haven or anywhere in Cork must toe the line and everyone concerned must toe the line while people know quite well that conditions which many people are speaking about prevail as regards the Hospitals' Sweep.  Why is it that the Hospitals' Sweep is being omitted from any restrictive practice that may be imposed in connection with the activities of showmen?  We are not satisfied with that.</P>
    <P>Not alone is the present Minister connected with this Bill but his predecessor is also connected with it and we are discussing it in a completely detached, non-political way.  It would be far better for everyone concerned, if, instead of the Bill that is before us, there was a Bill to nationalise the sweep.  When that is not the case none of us can be whipped up to be for or against this Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley has mentioned other associations in this country that are running pools, or something else of that kind.  It is quite true to say that many of these organisations or societies have again approached us in person and also by letter.  I am not picking out any particular one, although I know some of them, but while they are being run for a specific purpose, notably charity as we are told, the amount of the expenses has been fairly liberal.  However, what they are clamouring for in connection with this Bill is to be allowed more expenses.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="53" /> Quite recently I have seen letters sent by these organisations not alone to the Deputies of this House, but also to their own collectors.  These collectors are making a little bit of money, and good luck to them, but they are being told by these organisations to get in touch with the Deputy in the constituency, to get in touch with the messenger boy, so to speak, in the constituency, to ensure that he will get more expenses allowed for these organisations.  It ill becomes us to be depending on pools or other such methods of getting a share of the money collected for social or charitable organisations in this country.</P>
    <P>If we follow that line we will soon be faced with a similar position to that with which they are faced in Britain at the present time and with all the difficulties they have to contend with in connection with pools.  It may be that the time is not ripe for this Bill to be discussed at all, but if this present position continued for a few years more and if organisations cropped up all over the country clamouring to make money for charity and believing, as many of them do, in the old maxim that charity begins at home, we would reach the stage where we would have to deal with as big a problem as exists in Britain.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to deal with the activities of certain groups or individuals in, say, Dublin, Bray and probably Cork City where the situation is causing grave concern.  However, we must not overlook the difficulty of the showman who visits the rural areas or a seaside resort for a couple of weeks in the year.  The people in the country districts and at seaside resorts depend on the visit of these showmen to brighten up the place for the few months in the summer time and at other times in the year.  It is a pity if we cannot devise some means whereby the pressure, which of necessity will be put upon certain groups and individuals, will not be so severely put on the showmen to whom I have referred.</P>
    <P>It is essential that the Minister should realise the necessity of dividing the people concerned into two different <Col N="54" /> categories: the sharper who is operating in a large way and the other fellow who is struggling to make a living. Even though the latter may be a little bit cute as to the way he makes his money, he is giving enjoyment to the rural areas.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy O'Malley in what he says on the sale of tickets.  We all know the terrible abuse that can arise as a result of youngsters selling tickets.  It is about time that was stopped.  It is a danger for school-children&mdash;and very often it is inside the school they are given the tickets to sell&mdash;and the temptation is, if they get a few shillings for selling tickets and pass a shop in which they see a few bars of chocolate, to spend 6d. or so out of the pool rather than return all the money they collect.  I cannot agree, however, with Deputy O'Malley in regard to slot-machines because if we had less machines in these places we might have more workers employed. In relation to weighing machines, I think they are the greatest robbers of all.  If you try six or seven of them, each will give you a different weight and perhaps the next one you try will not operate at all.</P>
    <P>Finally, we must have a dividing line between the person operating in a big way, who should be dealt with as severely as is necessary, and the smaller showman who should be given a fair chance of earning a livelihood.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say I sympathise very fully with the Minister's position in introducing this Bill. As some Deputies have pointed out, successive Ministers for Justice have been pressed by all sections of the people for many years past to introduce a Gaming Bill and, when one is introduced, the unfortunate Minister who introduces it is under fire from all quarters.  I think it is bound to fall out in that way, because I do not believe it is possible to introduce an entirely satisfactory Gaming Bill.  I do not believe that this is an entirely satisfactory Gaming Bill and I do not believe that the Minister has endeavoured to make the case for the Bill on that basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Minister approached the introduction of the Bill and the amendments <Col N="55" /> proposed in the Bill in a wide way in the principles which he laid down in his introductory speech.  My quarrel with the Minister is that I do not believe, in relation to the lottery end of this Bill in any event, that he has adverted to the principles which were enunciated in his introductory speech.  When he was introducing the Bill the Minister, at column 84, Volume 150, of the Official Debates of 20th April last, said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The principle upon which we have proceeded is that gaming is not wrong in itself, but that public gaming needs to be severely restricted to prevent fraud and excess.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He went on then, in relation to gaming, to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We feel, however, that the prohibition should stop short of a prohibition of minor forms of gaming and the holding of small lotteries for charitable purposes which have long been sanctioned by public opinion.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The phrase I want to emphasise there is the phrase:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;which have long been sanctioned by public opinion&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Later on at column 86 in the same speech the Minister said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;As I mentioned earlier, the Government's attitude is that gaming, whether in the form of wagering, games of chance or lotteries, is not bad in itself, but that excessive gaming brings definite evils in its train.  So long as gaming is carried on in moderation under conditions which preclude fraud, we see nothing wrong with it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What I would like to emphasise there for the Minister's benefit in relation to that phrase is the word &ldquo;gaming&rdquo;:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;So long as gaming is carried on in moderation under conditions which preclude fraud, we see nothing wrong in it&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The gaming I take the Minister to be referring to there, and the gaming which he desires to control, is the <Col N="56" /> propensity of the individual gambler. It does not seem to me to make one whit of difference so far as catering for the gambling instinct of human beings is concerned whether the catering is done by professional artists, showmen or voluntary organisers of pools, lotteries or any other type of gambling for charitable purposes.</P>
    <P>So far as the individual is concerned, his desire to gamble is being catered for and I take it that what the Minister set out to do in this Bill is to control the gambling instinct.  But what he has done in the Bill, so far as I can see, in relation to a number of things, is not to control the gambling instinct but to control the operators of the different forms of lotteries.  The Minister made it quite clear in his introductory speech that he was having regard to public opinion. I think he is quite right in that.  In the first few words he uttered he referred to gaming and lotteries in one form or another having been sanctioned for a long time by public opinion.  Again, at column 88 of Volume 150 he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We recognise, however, that there is a public demand that will not be denied for lotteries on a somewhat larger scale for charitable purposes.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then he goes on to deal with the provisions made in the Bill to meet that demand.  Now in those remarks the Minister was being realistic but I am sorry he did not accept the position as it is to-day, namely, that because of public demand, there are at present operating here quite a number of pools with admittedly laudable objects, which derive their support from weekly contributions of a small sum of 6d. or 1/- from very many people.</P>
    <P>I am sorry the Minister did not bluntly recognise that that state of affairs exists and that it exists by reason of the public support given by charitably-minded people to these ventures.  I am sorry that he did not say he would accept that as a fact and legislate so that these pools and lotteries will not be interfered with under this Bill.  Instead of doing that <Col N="57" /> the Minister has adopted another course.</P>
    <P>I recognise, as Deputies on both sides recognise, that this is not a hurried measure; it has been the subject of examination not only for months but for years.  It is possible that when the original framework of the Bill was laid, after the groundwork had been done, a number of the ventures to which I am referring were not in existence.  If that is so, my only quarrel is that the groundwork which was done and the framework within which the Bill was erected some years ago was not brought up to date to meet the existing demands and existing requirements, which are not only sanctioned&mdash;to use the Minister's own expression&mdash;but are demanded by the public to-day.</P>
    <P>If the Minister had approached the position in that frame of mind he would find a very much warmer welcome here for the Bill and not only from Deputies, but from people throughout the country.  The Minister, in dealing with these lotteries pointed out the danger that exists of such lotteries being taken over by professionals rather than by voluntary workers who sacrifice their leisure time for charitable purposes.  I recognise that that danger exists.  I recognise what is in the Minister's mind, but, so far as the Bill is designed to control gambling and to guard against the gambling instinct, that particular argument does not weigh with me because I do not think it is relevant.</P>
    <P>I do not think it matters whether the gambling instinct is catered for by a professional or by voluntary workers. In referring to this danger, I think the Minister brings himself up against another position with which he will find himself confronted.  The Minister stated that nowadays in the various pools operating throughout the country a number of people derive some form of livelihood out of such operations. There are people employed as organisers.  There are people employed as collectors and so on.  Now, I do not see any harm in that.  If an individual is able to earn a livelihood by promoting a venture of this sort, which <Col N="58" /> as I say, has admittedly laudable and charitable objects, provided that does not lead to excessive gambling I see no reason why the Minister should seek to discourage it.  It would be a different matter if it could be shown that the individual's gambling instinct was being excited in such a way that he was being induced to gamble excessively. I do not believe that is the position and I do not think any effort has been made to show that that is the position; consequently, I do not see any harm in the world in ventures of this sort employing collectors, organisers or anyone else to assist the promoters in their work.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made here to-day of specific lotteries.  I do not want to go into these in detail but every Deputy must recognise that there are certain reasonably well-known lotteries in the City of Dublin and elsewhere throughout the country performing work of a type which has public support. Most people feel these should be encouraged in any event in so far as their objects are concerned.  I understand the position to be quite genuinely that some of these organisations will not be able to sustain the necessary impetus to do their work properly if the ceiling laid down in this Bill is adhered to, namely, a total prize fund of £300 and 25 per cent. expense account.  It has been represented to me&mdash;I know the case has been made to the Minister and to other Deputies &mdash;that there is room for increasing this ceiling substantially.  It has been suggested by Deputy O'Malley, and I think by others, that the prize unit should be raised to £1,000.  There certainly seems to be uniformity in the case presented by the promoters that 25 per cent. is not enough for the expense account and that at least 40 per cent. should be allowed.</P>
    <P>If the Minister will agree that there is nothing intrinsically wrong in the promoters of any venture employing organisers or collectors to help them out&mdash;perhaps these people get their entire livelihood out of the commissions which they may receive as collectors or whatever wages or salaries they may receive as organisers, and I do not personally see anything wrong <Col N="59" /> in that&mdash;I cannot see why he should not concede to the demands to increase the expense account in these cases to 40 per cent.  I strongly urge the Minister to give very careful consideration to this question of lotteries which has been mentioned.</P>
    <P>If the Minister feels it would be wrong to approach it in the way I have suggested, namely, to freeze, so to speak, the position as it exists to-day, I think he should, in any event, go this far to meet the public demand that is there, that he should not preclude the possibility of either himself or another Minister in another Government having second thoughts on the subject and that he should incorporate in this Bill some machinery which will enable a case to be made either to the Minister himself, to the Government, or to somebody&mdash;whatever body he likes to nominate&mdash;as to why in particular instances or for particular ventures the ceilings should be raised.  I would like to see the Minister putting in a section in the Bill dealing specifically with the lotteries which exist at the present time, which are known to exist at the present time, and which are known to have a widespread public support at the present time and to allow them to operate as they have been operating.</P>
    <P>Alternatively, I would suggest to him that he could incorporate into the Bill some machinery which would enable the Minister for Justice or, as I say, any person or body that he might think fit, to issue licences excepting particular lotteries from the ceiling provisions of the Act.  The only other way to meet the position, as I see it, would be to increase the ceilings in the Act now, to bring them up to the levels which exist at present and which are known to exist.</P>
    <P>The only other matter on which I want to comment&mdash;and I do it as a lawyer despite the strictures of Deputy O'Malley&mdash;is in relation to Section 20, sub-section (3).  My remarks will also apply to some later sections in Part V of the Bill.  I would like to enter some kind of protest against the idea incorporated in sub-section (3) of Section 20 <Col N="60" /> of the Bill, and that is: why should this House legislate deliberately in a manner which runs counter to the principles of evidence and the principles of justice which have been established in this country and the neighbouring countries for very many years, namely, that in the event of a prosecution being brought, the defendant in the prosecution is presumed to be innocent until the contrary is proved.</P>
    <P>Section 20 of the Bill reverses that in relation to certain things.  I am quite well aware of the fact that there is a precedent for this, that there is other legislation of comparatively recent date where the same thing has been done.  I think it was done very frequently in the emergency powers legislation, but Section 20, sub-section (3) of the Bill lays down in relation to lotteries:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If any ticket, counterfoil or coupon for use in a lottery is found at any place or premises searched in pursuance of a search warrant under this Act, it shall be evidence until the contrary is proved, in a prosecution for a contravention of this section, that the person having control over the place or premises had it in his possession for sale or distribution.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Let us remember that this Bill is laying down extremely heavy penalties for offences committed against this Bill. Speaking from recollection, I think it is provided elsewhere in the Bill that where no specific penalty is laid down the penalty then shall be a fine not exceeding £100 or three months' imprisonment or both fine and imprisonment.</P>
    <P>We are providing here in Section 20 that if a person is found in possession of a lottery ticket or counterfoil unless he is able to prove to the contrary&mdash;and the onus of proof is put on him&mdash;it can be assumed that that was in his possession for the purpose of sale or distribution; in other words, that he was committing an offence under this Bill.  And that will be assumed conclusively against him unless he is in a position to prove to the contrary.</P>
    <P>I do not like to see, and I certainly do not like to encourage, that form of <Col N="61" /> legislation because it runs counter to the principles of evidence and justice which have obtained in this country for many years.  Notwithstanding the fact that I recognise there is a precedent for it, that in recent times similar devices have been injected into our legislation which make things easy for the prosecutor in prosecuting people for offences under particular Acts, I would like if the Minister could have have another look at that section and some of the later sections which are roughly to the same effect and see if he might not resist the temptation to legislate in this fashion for the ease and convenience of the State prosecutor.</P>

      <P>I suppose some sort of amending Bill to deal with gaming is necessary, but certainly not, to my mind, a Bill of the type we have here. I would say from my knowledge and experience that the chief need of a Bill at the moment is to introduce some sort of consistency into the actions of the police in the various parts of Ireland in dealing with these games.</P>
      <P>A year or two ago, when the people in Bray were being prosecuted and fined hundreds of pounds, I saw the same game being played quite openly in other parts of Dublin and nobody interfering with it.  That is the chief reason I see for introducing a Bill of this sort&mdash;to provide something on which there would at least be agreement amongst the people in charge of the areas as to how to proceed.  I think the Minister stated that the game of Pongo is banned.  Unfortunately, I was sick at the time and I did not hear or read it.  Am I right?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1943" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  However, carry on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HarryColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be the height of hypocrisy for us to condemn Pongo while, at the same time, we have operating in all our streets licensed betting offices into which people can go and pay not 3d. or 6d. at the very outside, as they pay for a game of Pongo, but much more than that and they can go in and out of these offices several times a day and waste their day and lose their money.  We are permitting the <Col N="62" /> operation of these betting offices by legislation and, at the same time, we are banning the game of Pongo.</P>
      <P>I tried to play Pongo once and I just could not stick it so I am not an advocate of it.  However, I think it would be desperate hypocrisy on our part to deprive people of the right to play that game when they get amusement out of it.  At any rate, I cannot see the situation in any other light.  Certainly, we are setting out to be very puritanical and to circumscribe the rights of our people in regard to amusements&mdash;lawful amusements, to my mind&mdash;they like to take part in.</P>
      <P>In recent years, we have been hearing a good deal about the liberty of the individual.  I feel it would be a gross interference with the liberty of the individual if one prevented him from playing Pongo.  I cannot see that nearly as much money could be lost in playing that game as is lost through betting on horses&mdash;and yet we legalise that.  In my view, it would be a gross interference with the liberty of people who wish to play Pongo to attempt to say that Pongo should be banned, while we have bookies' shops in operation.</P>
      <P>Slot-machines are also to go.  Again, I think that if man wants to put money into a slot-machine he has as much right to risk losing his money in that way as he has to bet in a bookie's shop.  Certainly I would ban slot-machines for children, but I cannot see that we have a right to ban them for adults.  Nobody is forcing the adult to put his money into a slot-machine and if he has a right to go into a bookie's shop and lose his money there then to my mind he has a right to put his money into a slot-machine. As far as I can see in the Bill, even where permission is given to some professional showmen to carry on other games&mdash;apparently they are not being allowed to carry on these at all &mdash;we are limiting them to the summer months, from Easter to September.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know some places which have been operating all the year round in Dublin. They give good and steady permanent employment to a number of people and <Col N="63" /> they pay big rates.  I know that, for years back, some of these places would not permit a child into their premises even when accompanied by a parent. When this racket about these games started a few years ago, one of these men said to me: &ldquo;They could walk out from me when I refuse them and go down the street into an ordinary shop &mdash;for instance, a provision shop&mdash;and maybe they would be on their way for a bottle of milk for their mother who gave them a shilling and they could buy their bottle of milk and lose the change in a slot-machine in the shop and it would be all right.&rdquo;  They were coming down on the gaming man even though that man, on his own, was taking precautions such as I have mentioned.  There is something to be said for those men who have been carrying on their business in a proper way.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy M.J. O'Higgins, I do not think it matters much to the people who want to play those games whether they play them in a club of which they are a member or whether they play them in a professional showman's place.  Certainly, in the summer months in seaside places the bulk of the people who do indulge in these games do so because of lack of something else to do on their holidays or on wet nights.  In my view, we are going altogether too far in this matter. We are setting up too many restrictions and, as far as I can see, it is just something grand to hand to the lawyers.  I think every line of the Bill could be contested by some lawyer.  I am not competent to go through it but even I could see a couple of readings in a few parts of the Bill, and if I can see two readings I am sure a lawyer could see 12.  The Bill is altogether too drastic as far as the question of gaming is concerned.</P>
    <P>I want to deal now with lotteries. We have in Dublin at the moment a few lotteries for good purposes and they are doing good work.  I have in mind the &ldquo;Bobwin&rdquo; for the hospital at Glasnevin, &ldquo;Gael-Linn&rdquo; for the Irish language, and so forth.  As far as I can see, this Bill will seriously interfere with them.  The amount allowed for <Col N="64" /> expenses is altogether too small and they could not carry on with it.  I think an ordinary insurance collector on industrial policies will get 25 per cent. for going around and collecting and it would be much easier for him to do that than to collect for a lottery such as this&mdash;and, in addition, there are headquarters expenses.  As I say, I think 25 per cent. would be altogether too low and some people who have approached me tell me that they will just have to close down.  That would be a pity, particularly when they are only just getting their feet under them.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, if they were allowed a higher prize fund, as has been advocated here, they would do just as good work as our official sweep is doing, which we all support.  Some of these draws are being run for the very same objects except that an individual hospital is concerned.  To my mind, the objects for which the draws are run are just as good and admirable as those of the sweep, which we have legalised. In that respect, I think the Minister should seriously consider the points that have been put up here by other Deputies about the ceiling of the prize fund and the amount of expenses allowed.</P>
    <P>As far as I can see, these people may get a licence for only one year.  That means their licences must be renewed every year.  Perhaps that would not mean so much if they were properly run; it might mean that they would get a renewal without any great bother.  But it still means a certain amount of expense on them.  These people also give a certain amount of employment: they give a certain amount of whole-time and of part-time employment.  All these things should be more seriously considered before we do what we propose doing under this Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 32 was referred to already and as I see that section it prohibits the sending of money or documents out of the State.  That seems to mean that we are prohibiting our people from doing what we, in our legalised sweepstake, are asking everybody in the world to do.  We are asked not to send or attempt to send out of the State <Col N="65" /> any ticket, counterfoil or coupon for use in a lottery or any money for the purchase of or any money representing the purchase price of a ticket or chance in a lottery.</P>
    <P>Am I misreading it?  Does it mean I cannot buy a ticket in a sweep outside the country and that if I do I am guilty of an offence in sending the money away?  I cannot see anything else in it.  Or does it mean that if there is some sweep organised at home&mdash;one of those lotteries which would be allowed under the Bill&mdash;that I would be guilty of an offence in sending some ticket in that lottery outside the country?  I am not very clear on it but it seems to me that what we are doing under this section is prohibiting what we ourselves are doing in our legalised sweep. That is not consistent.</P>
    <P>I would urge on the Minister that he should reconsider this both as regards the gaming&mdash;very much as regards the gaming&mdash;and also the lotteries.  Those people who go in for gaming are not people who are doing anything that is very wrong.  A number of them provide a night's amusement for the people at cheaper rates than do cinemas and picture houses.  Nothing is being said about the money that is wasted on pictures and I do not see why we should put restrictions in the way of our people from carrying on innocent forms of amusement.  Perhaps there are abuses of which I am not aware but as I know these things there is not very much wrong with them and accordingly I cannot see any great argument for restrictions as we propose to impose them here.  I would ask the Minister to withdraw the Bill and set up a committee which would get some sort of agreed measure introduced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I have very little to add to what my colleagues in these benches have said.  I rise to speak for a few moments only to ask the Minister to reconsider the drafting of the Bill in relation to Part IV.  We are all aware of the representations that have been made to most Deputies on both sides of the House in relation to lotteries run for charitable purposes and I want to say that I agree in principle <Col N="66" /> with the general limitation put on lotteries in this measure.  I think it is an undesirable thing in the public interest to have the country overrun, as undoubtedly it would be overrun if lotteries were allowed to exist, by football pools and other lotteries of one sort or another.  Such a state of affairs would be undesirable in the public interest.</P>
      <P>I am in favour of the principle of allowing lotteries for certain charitable purposes.  It is well known by every member of this House that a number of lotteries have been in existence for the purposes of forwarding the interests of a number of very charitable organisations and that these people would be unable to carry on their activities were it not for the funds which they obtained from these lotteries.</P>
      <P>If lotteries are limited, if they do not become a social evil, as they could be if not limited, I cannot see any harm in allowing lotteries to exist in the future provided, as I said, the country is not overrun by people selling tickets, and above all by people making profits by running such lotteries on a commercial basis as they would be if we had not got the existing legislation or the legislation proposed in this Bill.  Once we establish the principle&mdash;and I believe it is a good one&mdash;that lotteries in general should not be permitted but that we will permit special ones under licence, I think we should listen to the representations which have been made by the people who are running these lotteries for charitable organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all have been informed by certain people who have been running these lotteries for very deserving charities that in their experience and in their opinions it is not possible to run the lotteries on the basis allowed by Section 26 of this Bill.  I am in favour of amending Section 26 in order to fulfil the wishes of these people who have had experience of running these lotteries.  Once you have a recognised principle laid down that the lotteries which are to be permitted must be licensed under Section 26 and that lotteries run for charitable and philan-trophic purposes are to be allowed <Col N="67" /> and that the promoters of these lotteries are not going to derive any personal benefit, then it seems to me that we are not going to do anything harmful to the general public by increasing the expenses allowances which may be permitted under sub-section (2) (e) of the section I have just mentioned. We shall be dealing with people who have had practical experience of running these organisations; we shall be dealing with people who have said that from their experience they are not able to keep their expenses down to the 25 per cent. limit.</P>
    <P>I suggest that we should listen to the voices of these people when we know they have nothing to gain for themselves.  If these were commercial undertakings from which people were going to benefit in their own pockets, then perhaps we might look with greater care and deeper scrutiny at the representations which have been made by these people who have circularised Deputies.  But the people who have circularised us are not acting on their own behalf but on behalf of very deserving charities.  They tell us that the Bill as it stands will not be capable of being operated as far as they are concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Not the Bill&mdash;that they will not be able to operate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, as far as they are concerned, that they will not be able to operate the Bill.  The Bill will be there, but it will be a dead letter so far as these charitable organisations are concerned.  I know there is a certain objection to the idea that people will become professional lottery ticket sellers and that that is one of the reasons why this 25 per cent. ceiling is put on expenses.  I have two things to say about that argument. The first is, that the experience has been that, even at the present time, when there is no ceiling on expenses, in fact we have not got professional lottery ticket sellers and the experience has been, and these people have made it quite clear, that the number of people who make their livelihood out <Col N="68" /> of selling lottery tickets is negligible and that the mortality rate of the sellers of lottery tickets is very high, that their experience has been that they do not last very long in trying to make a living out of selling lottery tickets.</P>
      <P>The second thing I have to say about it is that I do not see any great harm, if people can make a small living out of selling lottery tickets, in their being allowed to do so.  We permit people to make their living out of gaming of various types.  Most of the people who try to make their living out of the commission they get on selling lottery tickets are usually deserving people who have got no means of their own, who cannot make a living out of other pursuits.  In relation to one of these organisations, it is people who have suffered from tuberculosis, who are not capable of making a living in any other way, who try to earn a few pounds by means of selling lottery tickets.  I do not see any objection, therefore, to trying to avoid by legislation people&mdash; it would be a very small number of people&mdash;making their living from selling lottery tickets.  I do not see any objection to it because, first of all, it probably will not happen and, secondly, even if it does happen, it will be very limited in its scope.</P>
      <P>To my mind, therefore, with the safeguards and restrictions which we are putting in this Bill, above all, with the restriction that the lotteries which we are allowing will be for charitable, philanthropic purposes, for purposes which the local district justice will vet with great care, and when these lotteries will not bring any private gain to the persons who will run them, I can see no reason why we should not allow a ceiling of, say, 50 per cent. for the expenses involved&mdash;50 per cent. of the gross proceeds&mdash;in Section 26, sub-section (2) (e).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be always open for us to amend this legislation if it does not work.  It will be always open for the local district justices, who will have the information from the Garda authorities when these organisations come up for renewal of their licence, to decide that they are wrong in the manner in which they are balancing <Col N="69" /> their accounts and to refuse the licence on the grounds that they are putting too much to expenses.  But I would like to urge the Minister to give the Bill a chance on the basis of raising the ceiling to £600 for these lotteries under Section 26 and raising the expenses percentage to 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>The safeguards in the Bill are warranted. We will now avoid what I think would be an undesirable state of affairs, namely, the country being overrun, as England is, with lotteries for large-scale commercial transactions. We will have limited lotteries which will not do any harm to our people, which will certainly have no depraving effect, which will certainly not affect the breadwinner's ability to look after his family and which will do an immense amount of good for the charitable organisations who will have control over these lotteries.</P>
    <P>We have these safeguards and I would suggest that we listen to the word of experience and give the Bill a trial as amended according to my suggestion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>At this stage I do not propose to say much on the Bill. Most of our objections would be in relation to sections which can be more appropriately dealt with on the Committee Stage.  By and large, the Bill is commendable in so far as it takes control of gaming and lotteries.  It was desirable that some legislation should be introduced which would control these things.  We may differ as regards the degree to which unlawful things were done or unnecessary things happened but the fact remains that it was necessary to have some control and every Minister for Justice was, time and again, appealed to by sections of the people to introduce legislation.  There are people who would say it was unnecessary.  I too might think that the Minister, perhaps, has gone too far in the present Bill to control those things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is a pity that the children of to-morrow will be deprived of the thrill we all enjoyed in putting a few pennies into a slot-machine at a seaside resort, the thrill of entering some little gambling hut to spend a few <Col N="70" /> pennies on the day we would visit a seaside resort.  It is a pity that that thrill will be denied the children of the future.  There was not much harm in it.  They are days we all remember. It is a pity too that if we visit a seaside resort with our children and if the day becomes wet, as, unfortunately, happens too often, we will not be allowed to bring the children into the shelter, which is very often the only shelter, where there is gaming equipment or carnival equipment, to pass the evening.  It is ironical that the children can be allowed to go to the cinema while the parents may go to these gambling schools.  I think the children should be allowed to go in company with their parents or guardians, at seaside resorts.  The restriction will inflict a good deal of unnecessary hardship and very often it will prevent people visiting these places at all unless the weather is particularly fine which, unfortunately, is seldom the case.</P>
    <P>I must confess that I remember being a few days in Portstewart a few years ago and every night we enjoyed a game of Pongo and saw no harm in it. Everybody did it.  Everybody sat around and had a few hours' fun playing Pongo.  As somebody from the other side of the House said, the amount of money you could win or lose would be negligible.  There was far more money won on Phil Drake in the Derby or lost on some of the others.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1943" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Derby is not the only race, you know.  In that respect I think the Minister may have gone a bit too far.  However, with regard to this section and the section to which Deputy O'Malley and Deputy Declan Costello have now referred, we will have an opportunity of dealing with them on the Committee Stage, and I hope the Minister will be prepared to meet us.  We would like particularly that the representations made by Gael-Linn would not be overlooked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are some other matters with which I would like also to deal on the Committee Stage, particularly with reference to premises.  I can easily see where a prospective proprietor of premises <Col N="71" /> might go to considerable expense and find then he was not allowed the necessary licence to carry on.  We all know the regulations under the Tourist Act whereby you can submit your plan for a hotel or licensed premises to the court and have a licence granted provisionally subject to the plans being executed to the satisfaction of the superintendent of the district.  There is no reason why a person preparing plans for premises for submission to the court in connection with a licence for gaming should not be allowed the same facility.  They could proceed with plans only and know before they went to any expense whether or not the premises would be suitable.  These are only details but they are important details, and the Minister might look into them with a view to bringing in the necessary amendment.</P>
    <P>There is also some doubt in the minds of the proprietors of these gaming premises with regard to the sale of the goodwill of these premises. They do not seem to be clear whether they are allowed under the Bill to transfer premises by sale to another proprietor and sell the goodwill of the business as well.  There is a great deal of apprehension on this point which the Minister might clear up in his closing statement and, if necessary, meet on the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>There are other points entirely related to particular sections but I think the Bill, by and large, is a commendable enough proposal.  Most people will agree it was necessary to bring in some control but like most Bills of its type, it will be more of a hindrance to the smaller man than it will be to the larger and well-organised concern. In that respect, the remarks of those Deputies who appealed for special concessions for rural areas or for the smaller villages and towns in rural areas might be taken into consideration. You will find that under most sections the large and well-organised concern will come out of it much better and that in some cases the small concern with only a few gadgets in operation will come out of it very badly or go out of business completely.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="72" /> On that score, I appeal to the Minister to examine more closely the provisions of the Bill with a view to having the necessary adjustments made by way of amendment on the Committee Stage.  However, as I said previously, I want to appeal to him mainly on behalf of Gael-Linn who have circularised us all and whose case I believe is a genuine one.  Their entire income is derived from running a lottery and they will be deprived of any chance of income under the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely want to make one particular point to the Minister on this Bill.  The rest of the discussion has probably covered the other points I would have made. When the Minister decided to put on a stop Order, so to speak, in regard to certain gaming machines, if you like to call them that, and certain games, it seems to me that he acted a little bit precipitately and it has had a certain unjust effect&mdash;I daresay it was not meant&mdash;in regard to individuals. There was not a large number, but there were some people engaged in the amusement business who had certain machines and carried on games without any abuse.</P>
      <P>There was a law against them which was very largely regarded as a technical law.  As long as they conducted their business in an orderly fashion they were not interfered with by the police and, in fact, they were very cooperative with the police according to such information as I have on these matters.  There was a sudden close-down on them and there has been a situation of uncertainty from the time that this matter was first brought up by way of enforcement of the law as it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the meantime, these people are in a difficult position.  I understand that representations have been made to the Minister on that and on a number of similar points.  I would ask the Minister to give these matters careful consideration because continuance of the <i>status quo</i> until such time as this Bill was passed would not have hurt anybody. However, the action has been <Col N="73" /> taken now and these people are in that difficult position and I would like the Minister, out of a sense of justice, even though the law is technically against these people, to permit them to carry on until such time as this Bill is law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister will agree that this Bill is not only highly controversial as between different sides of the House but that it is highly controversial within each Party.  At the outset, therefore, I would like to ask him would he not consider sending this Bill on Committee Stage to a Special Committee of the House rather than attempt to have the Committee Stage dealt with here.  It is quite obvious from what everyone has said that whatever a Committee Stage produces from this House will not be satisfactory. In fact, from the Minister's point of view and from the Department's point of view it is a Bill which will cause a great deal of trouble and possibly require amendment after amendment. If the Minister would indicate at this stage that he would favourably consider that, he would lessen the burden, if you like, of discussion here on this matter.</P>
      <P>Certain Deputies have dealt at length with certain aspects of this Bill and the representations made to them in relation to the impact of this Bill on certain people.  Speaking as a member of a local authority, I think the Minister will have to admit that Sections 12, 13, 14 and 15 are not capable of implementation as far as the City of Dublin is concerned.  It is provided in Section 12 that &ldquo;A local authority may by resolution adopt this Part&rdquo; for the purpose of implementing the Bill when it becomes an Act for the purpose of giving licences to people who apply for them.  First of all, each member of the local authority will have to be circularised before the resolution is proposed.  Can the Minister visualise what the life of a councillor will be if a special meeting has to be called to consider whether or not we will adopt this Part?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 11 stipulates that: &ldquo;This Part shall not have effect in any area unless there is for the time being in <Col N="74" /> force a resolution under Section 12 adopting it for that area.&rdquo;  That is the resolution to which I am referring. The local authority of the City of Dublin will have to adopt by resolution and, in order to pass that resolution, every member of the council will have to have a month's notice.  In that month he will be torn and pulled between interested parties for and against.  His life will be a misery to him.  Some people will say they do not want these places in a particular area; others will say they do.  Goodness knows what will happen.</P>
    <P>I think the decision in that matter should be the responsibility of the State and it should not be left to the various areas to decide.  Now in the City of Dublin we have an establishment called &ldquo;The Fun Palace.&rdquo;  It is open all the year round.  Under this Bill, that particular business, if the local authority decides to implement this section, will only be allowed to carry on for six months in the year. That is a ridiculous situation.  It should either be allowed to carry on for the whole year or it should not be allowed to open at all.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley, speaking on this measure, said he was speaking as a layman.  He could not discuss this from a legal point of view any more than I can.  But all kinds of legal questions will arise under this Bill if it becomes an Act in its present form.  We shall have all kinds of <i>mandamus</i> in the courts as a result of decisions taken by, say, the local authority for the City of Dublin.  That is one of the reasons why I think the Minister would be well advised to withdraw this Bill from the House for the purpose of having it dealt with by a Special Committee. This Bill has no political implications and could therefore be quite conveniently dealt with by such a Committee so that a measure may be framed which will find favour with all sections of the community generally speaking.</P>
    <P>I know that very strong and very persistent representations have been made to the Minister in relation to Section 34.  That section starts off by saying: &ldquo;Every contract by way of gaming or wagering is void.&rdquo;  Of <Col N="75" /> course, we all know that is not true. Money due as a result of wagering is not recoverable in law if the Gaming Act is pleaded.  The person who makes his living out of wagering is, on the other hand, in a sense immune.  I think some consideration should be given by the Minister to the point of view put to him in connection with Section 34. Again, that is something which could more properly be considered by a Special Committee.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister and his officials have had as much contact with the public in relation to this Bill as members of the Dáil have had.  I do not suppose five minutes passed without some organisation or some group of individuals making representations. That shows there is considerable public interest in this Bill, both for and against.  It is very difficult for a Deputy to make up his mind properly in the welter of representation.  Again, for that reason, I think a Special Committee would be ideal because we would there have an opportunity of expressing our views and hearing the views of the other members.  If the Minister does not agree to the setting up of such a Committee he will have a very long and tiresome Committee Stage in the House, with the possibility of another romp over the jumps on the Report Stage.  I do not think we can get agreement here on a number of these sections.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moran spoke on this Bill on the evening on which it was introduced. I was not aware of all the implications behind it from the legal point of view until I heard Deputy Moran speak and subsequently read his speech in the Official Report.  From the legal point of view, it is obvious the Bill requires a good deal of consideration if it is hoped to make the Bill effective eventually so that it will operate in the manner in which we all want it to operate.  I am wondering whether I could extract from the Minister now an indication as to whether or not he is prepared to consider the setting up of a Special Committee of the House to deal with the Committee Stage of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister would be wise <Col N="76" /> to say he is prepared to consider it, because it will alter the whole approach or preparation on the part of Parties or individuals for the Committee Stage.  I feel if he does not that it will become a very burdensome thing because every section of the Bill outside of the interpretation sections, every part of practically every section contains clauses which in themselves can bear interpretations probably not intended, but which if the clauses are left as they stand, will be the cause of great trouble and controversy not only in this House on the Committee Stage but afterwards.</P>
    <P>Consequently, I ask the Minister to consider what I have suggested and to understand that there will be considerable agitation and pressure to deal with Section 34 in the manner in which was suggested to him by deputations as a result of representations, and to many members of the House.  What is being requested is, in my opinion, reasonably fair and where we are dealing with an advance or a new development in the whole outlook of the people I think we have to be reasonably broadminded.  We cannot stand on an outlook that existed at the time when a completely puritanical approach was the order of the day.  We are living in different times, in times where we gamble with life in the frequency of our wars, in the types of equipment which we use in wars; we gamble not only with the lives of our soldiers, sailors and airmen but also with the lives of innocent non-combatants wherever they may be.</P>
    <P>Yet, come in here and talk about the morality of the people in connection with a limited activity that may make their drab lives a little better; we talk as if we were living in the distant past when everybody's behaviour was according to rules very definitely laid down.  Our standards are different, our outlook is different and our behaviour must become different; therefore, we have to be a little more elastic in our judgment of others and in our restrictions on others in the legislation we attempt to pass.</P>
    <P>The Minister must also recognise that if any legislation is passed in such a manner as to restrict unreasonably the behaviour of the people, we shall only <Col N="77" /> be creating a new set of offences and a new collection of offenders because we are making a law which will have the effect that the ordinary simple transactions of to-day will become means of breaking the law to-morrow.</P>
    <P>Returning to lotteries&mdash;if we are going to allow a limited number of lotteries with limited amounts of prizes under very restricted regulations then we should at least be prepared to consider whether there is any reasonable case being made by the promoters of these charitable lotteries in so far as they say that the maximum that is being allowed to them for expenses is, in fact, too little.  I do not know how these lotteries are run; I subscribe myself to quite a few of these little lotteries.</P>
    <P>One has a twofold reason, I suppose, for doing so.  On the one hand, one has a chance of winning a few pounds and on the other hand one feels that if one does not win, one is at least giving a few shillings to a good cause.  That is all I know about them, but they exist and people who run them for charitable purposes say that there must be this margin.  To the ordinary person who subscribes 6d. or 1/- and who is told the prize is £300, it does not mean a thraneen if the promoters had to spend 40 per cent. of the gross takings in bringing about this prize of £300, or whether they were allowed to spend only 25 per cent.</P>
    <P>I do not understand what is behind this.  Deputy Costello suggested that as he saw it it was because the Minister wanted to prevent the coming into being of professional lottery ticket sellers.  Every single business that is started under the law, every single undertaking that has to depend on money for its existence has to employ people.  One might as well say that if a particular lottery is run regularly and properly the promoters should not be allowed to employ a secretary or typist because that person would be professionally employed or would be making a living out of being a typist to a lottery.  So far as the typist is concerned it does not matter whether she is a typist for a group running a lottery or for the Minister <Col N="78" /> for Justice; she just takes dictation and types the letters and addresses envelopes.</P>
    <P>I do not know who is responsible but certainly somebody is prodding the Minister to be a little too prudish.  The Minister might be a little bit more humane.  Again, I appeal to him in view of the very great amount of difference of opinion that exists, to take a broader view.  I find even among my own colleagues that I cannot get&mdash; let alone agreement on certain things&mdash;even a similar point of view or understanding of what is really meant or intended.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I appeal to the Minister&mdash;I am not saying he should withdraw the Bill as has been suggested&mdash;but at least we should deal with this Bill in a businesslike way by having a special Select Committee on it.</P>
    <P>Many years ago when a certain Bill was introduced here&mdash;it happened a few times&mdash;where the many different views expressed were far apart even within Parties, agreement was reached to set up a special Select Committee.  I am referring to the Moneylenders Bill. Persons were seen; persons examined; people who were to be affected were allowed to come and make representations. As a result, a Bill was passed and nobody has heard anything further about that transaction since.  I am convinced if that Bill had gone through its Committee Stage and was passed through the House without a Special Committee we would have been amending it every year since it was introduced in 1928 or 1929.</P>
    <P>In the same way I say to the Minister that this is the type of Bill, the Committee Stage of which should not be carried on in the House, and we should be allowed to discuss it as members of the House irrespective of group or Party, meeting the different points of view that may be expressed by people outside who are individually affected and who are members of groups or charities so that the House can make up its mind that justice is being done and that injustice is not being inflicted on any single individual or on any group.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a few words to say on this.  I am surprised at the attitude of some members of the Opposition because from the information I have this is the former Minister's Bill.  I think something should be brought in because in the cities and other centres people have lost their wages.  Machines which were debarred in other countries were sent into the Republic and used wholesale not alone at seaside resorts but also in shops.</P>
      <P>As far as I know, nobody wants to interfere with certain amusements, but the people must be protected.  What is the position to-day?  All these big show people are foreigners who have come into our country.  Not alone are they coming to seaside resorts, but they are buying land here also.</P>
      <P>We hear a lot of talk about charity. What, in fact, is the position?  The showman gets 60 per cent. and the community get 40 per cent.  As well as that, there is free ground and probably free current.  It is about time the Minister brought in this Bill.  He had the courage to introduce it and did not run away from it like his predecessor.</P>
      <P>Taking it all round, there was a cry from certain people that something be done in a position where we had youngsters losing money in these slot-machines and where we had people sitting into the early hours of the morning losing their husbands' hard-earned wages.  Are these not facts?</P>
      <P>There has been much talk about Pongo.  Pongo is all right when it is limited&mdash;and it was limited when it started.  I have played Pongo probably more than anybody else in this House and, when it started, it was limited to 36 cards.  As time went on, the cards went to an unlimited number and, from 2d. per card in the beginning they went to 3d., 6d. and 1/- in the end.  Furthermore, there was the lure to remain until the show was over at maybe one o'clock in the morning.  These are the things that require to be considered. In my view, it is about time some control was introduced in this connection. There is plenty of amusement for youngsters in the way of hobby-horses, chairplanes, and so forth, besides slot-machines and gambling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="80" /> Some Deputies on the Opposition Benches spoke about the Derby. Probably every Deputy in the House had at least 1/- each way on one of the horses running in that race to-day and maybe there are some people who had even £100 on one of the horses. That happens only once in the year. When you go to a seaside resort and see all the different classes of machinery and gambling there, there is not very much pleasure in it.  It is a nuisance and it becomes a nuisance in the town where it is kept on until late at night. If these people get away scot free we will have numerous shows coming into our country from England, Scotland and Wales which will fleece the public.</P>
    <P>I believe the Minister is doing a good job&mdash;a job that the public cried out to him to do.  When we see youngsters operating these machines and losing their pennies and then going to their parents and asking for more money and then losing that again in the same way surely we must feel that something should be done about the matter because obviously there is something wrong.  The Bill was brought in because the public were talking.</P>
    <P>The employment given is nil.  When there is a carnival you have a committee working free on the show for the week or the fortnight.  It is obvious, therefore, that whatever employment is given is very little.  A Deputy spoke about the Fun Palace.  I have never had much fun in the Fun Palace and I have been in it as often as most people.  I have never had much fun there and, even after losing a few bob there, I had very little sport in it.</P>
    <P>It was reported in the newspapers that a member of a county council not very far from Dublin City said that he would bring down a sledge hammer and break up the machines in his town and throw the pieces into the sea.  The public must be safeguarded.  It is not the big people who are losing in this connection.  It is the working-class people and their families who are losing, and losing heavily.  From that point of view, we want a safeguard.  I speak from experience when I say that the public require to be protected from such machines and such gambling.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to speak at great length on this Bill because a great deal has been said already on it.  Certainly, enough has been said to convince me that the House as a whole do not approve of the Bill in its present form.  I hope the Minister will listen to the accumulated wisdom of the Deputies on both sides of the House who have agreed that many changes will have to be introduced before this Bill finally goes through.</P>
      <P>I want to deal, first of all, with the section of the Bill which refers to lotteries.  The Minister dealt with it in his opening statement.  I want to quote what the Minister said, as reported in Volume 150 of the Official Report, columns 88-89.  He said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The provisions of Section 26 have been drafted with regard to the situation that exists at present whereby a number of charities are promoting £300 weekly lotteries. Prior to 1953 the limit was £100 and some years before that £30.  As you are aware these lotteries in aid of charities are illegal under existing law and their toleration extending back over 40 years has been on the basis that the organisers give their time and labour free.  Unfortunately, at the £300 mark some charity promotions, in an endeavour to outpace rivals and to get in as much money as possible, have been paying clerical staffs, organisers, agents and collectors and it is obvious that, if the prize money were to be raised any higher, the increased sales of tickets necessitated could only be got by an increase in the number of collectors, etc., receiving payment for their services.  Furthermore the number of lotteries which could operate on a countrywide scale would necessarily be few and the purposes for which they might be promoted would not necessarily be the most deserving.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is where the Minister makes the statement which I wish to interpret in a certain way&mdash;and which, perhaps, the Minister might like to expand on, if I am wrong.  He says:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;For instance, some sports organisations with thousands of <Col N="82" /> members might create a virtual monopoly for themselves and in the process bring to an end the innumerable small parish charity promotions which fulfil such good purposes as helping the sick and the aged, relieving poverty and distress, advancing religion and education.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;For instance, some sports organisations with thousands of members....&rdquo; The only conclusion I can come to from that is that the organisation in particular to which the Minister was referring was the G.A.A.  I was not aware that the Minister was antagonistic to the G.A.A. or that he regarded it as a body which could be used for the purpose of killing small parish promotions designed to relieve poverty and distress and I wonder why, if the Minister felt that or feels it, he did not come out in the open about it and say so.</P>
    <P>I am further convinced on that score by further references made in the same speech by the Minister where he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;As it is, even at the £300 point, representations have already been made to me that some of the existing lotteries cannot carry on unless the percentage for expenses is raised to 40 per cent. or more and an examination of figures supplied shows that over £1 in every £2 10s. collected goes in expenses of one kind or another.  I should like Deputies to consider carefully the implication of providing higher prizes and greater percentages of the proceeds for expenses. I am aware that Deputies are being asked for their support in that regard, and I should like them to think twice before raising the matter.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What sort of double talk is that?  If the Minister has something to say about these things why not come out into the open and say it?  The only way one could read that is that these lotteries are at present being run or being promoted for personal gain and that they are an evil in themselves.</P>
    <P>I deny right away that that is so.  I deny that the operation of these small pools giving total prize money of £300 is having the slightest injurious effect <Col N="83" /> on local charities designed to relieve distress of one kind or another.  I simply say that that is not so and I cannot understand what was in the Minister's mind when he became responsible for bringing before the House a Bill to give effect to a proposal of that nature.</P>
    <P>As well as that, one would imagine, from the warning given that Deputies should think twice before raising this matter of asking for higher expenses, that these organisations were not willing to submit certified accounts and to submit their operations to the most rigorous examination.  One would think that they had something to hide. These organisations are not only willing to have their expenses and their methods of operation examined by the authorities, but they would insist on all organisations to be established under this Bill being subject to the most rigorous examination at all times. That would, of course, include the lottery promoters making an annual return which would give the names of all people associated with them and such an annual return would be available to every person who paid one shilling or less as a contributor; accounts would be produced each year which would be certified by a duly qualified accountant, and any other supervision which the Minister might think necessary would be exercised.</P>
    <P>Not only are these organisations willing that these things should happen, but they would ask the Minister to reconsider this attitude of his which is designed to kill them.  They would ask him that if he is to allow them to operate at all he should make the most stringent provisions to ensure that everything is open and above board and properly carried on.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brennan mentioned Gael-Linn. There are few such organisations in the country and perhaps they do get the bulk of their support from the G.A.A. members.  I want the Minister to come out into the open and say exactly what he meant by these ambiguous statements which he made in his opening address.  Also, I want to say to him that if he insists that these particular organisations should <Col N="84" /> be killed, he is not going to stop a penny of the money at present being spent every week from being spent by the people who want to speculate a bob or two.  Instead, he is going to increase the flow of this money to the British soccer pools and to other foreign-based lotteries or, for that matter, to the crossword puzzle people who operate for profit and make no bones about the fact that they operate for profit.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister making the case that because a person supporting an organisation which is national to his country by spending a shilling a week is doing something which is wrong and which is likely to be injurious to the poor?  If so, what then is the Minister to do when the same money will go out for the benefit of the British people who are running soccer pools on soccer games played in England?  The plain case these people submitted was that their expenses allowances should be increased from 25 per cent. to 40 per cent. and I should like to add my voice to that of the other Deputies who had asked for that increase.</P>
    <P>If the Minister uses his majority in the House to push through the provisions of this lotteries section of the Bill, the only effect it will have is that it will injure organisations which are native to this country, injure people who are getting employment in this country and provide the people who support these organisations by their shillings with the alternative of investing their money in a foreign game or, perhaps, of going over to work for the promoters of a foreign pool.</P>
    <P>There are some other matters to which I want to refer but I do not want to keep the House too long.  I do not agree at all with Section 12, which provides:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A local authority may by resolution adopt this Part in respect of the whole or a specified part of its administrative area and may by resolution rescind such adoption.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That provides for local authorities such as the corporation in Dublin or the county councils throughout the country adopting a resolution before bringing Part III of the Act into operation.  I do not know what tempted the Minister <Col N="85" /> to bring in corporations and county councils into the administration of law in this country or into the application of the law.  I think it is a very bad thing indeed and there can hardly be anybody in the House with the exception of the Minister who is convinced that it is a good thing that matters like that should be the subject of canvass and debate by members of the corporation in Dublin or of county councils throughout the country.</P>
    <P>It is a new thing and I do not see any reason why it should have been brought in.  By implication it means that the courts previously handling these things have been regarded as unfit to make decisions in this matter. That again I think is nonsense, and I feel sure the vast majority of the Deputies in this House would want the courts to decide questions of this kind and not the local authority, which might or might not cause an injustice to certain people.</P>
    <P>The worst thing about local authorities&mdash;and I am afraid we must face it&mdash; is that they are politically based.  In theory they are not supposed to be&mdash; they are supposed to be people concerned with local problems not on a political basis&mdash;but in fact as everybody knows members of such bodies, or the vast majority of them, are connected with one of the major political Parties in the country and they carry on their business at their meetings in the light of their political affiliations. It means, in effect, that politics will be be brought into the administration of this particular section of the Bill and that individuals who may not be <i>au fait</i> with the controlling Party in a given corporation or county council might be victimised as a result of that.</P>
    <P>I think the courts established by the Constitution to deal with things like this should be left to deal with them. I think, and I agree with Deputy O'Higgins regarding Section 20, that a person should be deemed innocent until he is proved guilty.  There is no reason at all why that principle should be departed from in this case any more than in any other.  Deputy O'Higgins gave certain examples of departures from it which had occurred before.  I do not see any compelling reason why <Col N="86" /> it should be departed from here.  I feel that such a sound principle should never be departed from in any legislation unless there is a compelling reason to depart from it.  From time to time, there may be such compelling reasons but I submit that there is no such reason at all in this case.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go over the provisions of the Bill in detail.  The proper time to do that is the Committee Stage.  There are many suggestions which I will have to make regarding particular provisions of various sections in the Bill but now is not the appropriate time to deal with them.  It is sufficient to say again that, in my opinion, and, I believe, in the opinion of the vast majority of the people of this country whom we are here to represent, the lotteries which are in existence in this country and operating on a non-profit-making basis, some of which derive their principal revenue from people who are all members of sporting organisations in this country, are doing a good job.</P>
    <P>These should be allowed to continue doing that job.  The only result of preventing them from doing that job will be to increase the flow of money from this country to England, to increase the flow of money to crossword people, bookmakers, and so forth, thereby simply diverting money which has been earmarked for lotteries from one type of lottery to another.</P>
    <P>If, therefore, there was any real principle behind this Bill in regard to lotteries, it would be understandable that that principle would have to operate no matter whom it affected.  It has been shown by many people in this House, indeed, it is self-evident, that there is no such principle involved in this Bill.  Therefore, the Minister should have regard to the wants of the people, to their demands, and perfect the legislation on the basis of their wishes.</P>

      <P>From a layman's point of view it would seem that, if this Bill is enacted, we will have to build another prison and we will have to increase the Garda force.  If we pass this Bill, we will interfere with the promoters of every local club in <Col N="87" /> the country and will make them amenable to the law.  Any exacting Garda can challenge them that they are not doing things as they should do them.</P>
      <P>I am in agreement with Deputy Briscoe.  I believe that there are certain sections of this Bill which are good and the enactment of which is long overdue but I am not in agreement with more and more interference with the people to the extent that they can be challenged in respect of small things, as they can be challenged under this Bill.</P>
      <P>If the Minister wants to deal with certain people, he should state that specifically in the Bill.  If at any time there were certain lotteries that would be responsible for cutting out small parish sweeps and that kind of thing, it would be time to bid the devil good morrow when you meet him.</P>
      <P>I strongly object to interfering with every small club that is doing this kind of thing.  From my reading of the Bill, any promoter of a small club can be challenged if he does not do the things which this Bill requires him to do.  I put it to the House that we have enough interference and that we have enough Guards in the country to do the job that they ordinarily have to do.  I do not believe in interfering with people too much.</P>
      <P>A number of hospitals, schools, clubrooms and social amenities have been provided in this country as a result of lotteries.  There is no compulsion on any man, woman or child to buy a ticket if he does not wish to.  If A, B or C is responsible for doing something wrong, I do not see why the whole community should be punished.  I do not see any of the charitable organisations breaking the law.  Nobody has ever forced me to take a ticket.  I have often been asked to buy one and I thought I might as well spend a shilling in that way as in any other way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Leary referred to gaming. The point he made about certain machines can be made about a lot of other things that there are in the country.  Surely nobody wants us to do as they did in the United States of <Col N="88" /> America years ago.  Because a few puritans agitated in the United States, they closed the saloons there.  We are a grown-up people and should have some discretion.</P>
    <P>I am in agreement with the Minister in regard to slot-machines.  I am in agreement with him in certain other aspects of the Bill but I would respectfully suggest to the Minister that, if this Bill is enacted, there will be more and more prosecutions, more and more interference with the ordinary people who have always lived within the law and who have been doing good work. Before the Minister brings the Bill any further he should have it dealt with by a Select Committee.</P>
    <P>I thoroughly agree with Deputy Briscoe because even though the Bill would not be enacted for some time, the Select Committee appointed would go into the matter very methodically. They would be just and fair and they would raise the points that each of the speakers has raised here.  In that way, the House would bring in a just and fair Bill and we would not be doing the same as the famous American judge did years ago: there were 100 men brought before him and only one of them was guilty.  &ldquo;I will convict them all,&rdquo; he said.  That is not justice. However, I do not think this House should accept the Bill in its present form.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies dealt with gaming saloons and gaming houses. That question could also be dealt with by a Select Committee.  If amusement caterers have machines which are contrary to all good taste and which are taking away the people's money and robbing children, as has been alleged here, the Select Committee can deal with all those points and have at their disposal all the information that is available to the Minister and his Department.  The problem can be reasoned out in a calm way and it can be taken out of the field of Party politics.</P>
    <P>If this Bill is brought in in its present form all I can say is that it will be a good lawyers' Bill.  There will be a number of prosecutions and it will be a harvest day for all those in the legal <Col N="89" /> profession.  May I suggest again to the Minister that he should adopt Deputy Briscoe's proposal and set up a Select Committee?  In doing that the Minister and this House will be doing a good day's work and they will be fair to every section of the community without interfering with the rights of any citizen.</P>

      <P>I fully agree with the suggestion of Deputy Briscoe.  The Minister will agree also that the House has not approached this Bill in a Party spirit. He should, therefore, listen to the plea of Deputy Briscoe and refer this matter to a Committee of the House. There is no great urgency about it.  I am surprised at Deputy O'Leary, in his hasty statement, referring to the former Minister as running away from his responsibility on this question of lotteries and gaming.  Every side of the House knows that Deputy Boland never ran away from anything.</P>

      <P>The Deputy should not have said it and we will leave it at that.  I fully agree with the sentiments expressed by the Minister for Justice when he brought in this Bill, that he was interested in all the useful work done by little parish committees for local charities and that he was concerned with the safeguarding of the work done by them.  I am only a layman but I wonder are there sufficient safeguards, even considering the work done by the draftsman of the Bill, to prevent syndicates or a large syndicate being set up, something like the Hospitals' Trust, which would wipe out all the little committees that the Minister for Justice knows about and <Col N="90" /> probably worked on and that I know about and have worked on, and which would undo the work we all have at heart.</P>
      <P>Some Deputy here deprecated the practice of gambling, gaming and lotteries for charity.  I would refer that Deputy to a recent letter from a Limerick doctor on the question of hospitals.  He said that for years the very term &ldquo;voluntary&rdquo; hospital was a misnomer.  As regards direct contributions to voluntary hospitals, instead of being a stream, as they were long ago, they have become a trickle, and are disappearing altogether and the only source of inducement for contributions to voluntary charities is some form of gambling.</P>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister and to the House that the work done by these little local committees is splendid and that the suggestion made by Deputy Briscoe should be entertained by the Minister, that a Committee of the House should be set up to deal with this whole question. I confess I have not read the Bill thoroughly.  I came in, listened to the debate and read part of the Minister's speech.  I gave a cursory glance through the Bill itself but I looked at Section 31 in the last few minutes and it reads:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Every ticket, coupon, counterfoil and notice relating to a lottery (other than a lottery to which Section 22 or 23 applies)...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Perhaps I am caught out there.  I thought that when we would be running a bazaar in Castlepollard we would have to have &ldquo;Castlepollard Bazaar&rdquo; printed on every roll of tickets we would sell, and that would have been most awkward.  Nevertheless, there may be other things running through the Bill which would bring about a situation where, as Deputy Burke mentioned a minute ago, you would have undue police action.  It would be absurd if I was running a bazaar in Castlepollard and I had to ring up the secretary of the Westmeath County Council for permission to run it.  In Section 7 it is stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Gaming carried on as part of a carnival, bazaar, sports meeting, <Col N="91" /> local festival, exhibition or other like event shall not be unlawful gaming if&mdash;</P>
    <P>(b) gaming is not the main activity of the event,</P>
    <P>(d) the stake in each game is not more than 6d. for each player.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The prize for the expenditure of 1/- might be a bicycle and, therefore, that seems a rather sever restriction.  It is a detail worth consideration.</P>
    <P>If every local council has to be approached, all I can say is that the Minister is creating grave difficulties for us in rural Ireland.  When the Minister is reconsidering this whole matter of gaming and lotteries, he should extend the scope of the Bill and take a clipping from the profits of private companies working in the seaside resorts and direct that clipping to charity.  If there are to be strictures on Gael-Linn, for example, then the same strictures should apply to every private promoter.  If, as Deputy S. Flanagan suggests, as a result of our action here these people will have to submit their accounts and overhead expenses to scrutiny, then that rule should equally apply to the private promoter as well as to the group of people organised for charitable purposes.</P>
    <P>I think Deputy Briscoe's proposal is worthy of consideration.  The trouble I see about all this is that when one attempts to regiment something like gambling the natural growth as a result of that action is the development of the big syndicate which pulverises all the smaller groups and organisations.  Consider the Hospitals' Sweep in that aspect.  Such regimentation can ultimately lead to an appalling state of affairs.  We might find ourselves with another Republic of Monaco with the Hospitals' Sweep running the country and everybody almost deprived of the right to breathe.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The local authority should not be brought into this Bill at all.  That is the most objectionable feature of the Bill.  As far as one can gather, this Bill is to a great extent adopting existing legislation which is 100 or 150 years old.  I think that is wrong.  Most of that legislation has proved inoperative here over the last 20 or 30 years, as the Minister well knows.  The laws enacted in this country should be such as can be enforced subsequently.  They are laws that should be respected by the people. Putting them on the Statute Book and then finding that two-thirds of them are not enforceable redounds to no-body's credit because the Garda, the district justices and everybody else are asked to turn a blind eye to particular aspects of the law.  Nothing is so damaging to a community as legislation of that type.  It would be much better if there were no laws and it was left to the judgment and good sense of the people to make their own laws.</P>
      <P>The Minister knows quite well that as a result of bookmakers being licensed, for every one person who backed a horse in the small towns long ago 600 are backing horses to-day.  I do not object to people having a flutter. I have an open mind on this.  Just as people have the right to drink intoxicating liquor, they should equally have the right to gamble.  There is nothing to prevent gambling in private houses. Sometimes hundreds of pounds change hands in poker games in private houses.  Often serious damage is done. People have gambled away their property and their business and smashed themselves playing cards in private houses where no laws can operate at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The suggestion that this Bill should be sent to a Special Committee is a good one.  Our concern is that it should be capable of operation when <Col N="93" /> it becomes law.  In that connection, the laws should be simple and easily understood. They should not be framed with the object of giving the legal profession more scope for their energies.  The phraseology in our laws is more intricate than it is in a neighbouring country or in America.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to dwell on that.  I merely want to point out that to the ordinary layman the phraseology of the present measure before the House is incapable of interpretation. Every member of the legal profession, every justice and every judge will take a different point of view until the matter finally goes to the Supreme Court.  Legislation of that type is bad.  I appeal to the Minister to accept the suggestion made on this side of the House and set up a Special Committee of the House where judgment and wisdom can be pooled and the Bill can be examined in detail.</P>
      <P>With the help of the Minister's advisers it may be possible&mdash;I do not say it will be&mdash;to get a more tolerable Bill and a Bill that will be likely to have a chance of achieving the object which is in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased, and I congratulate the Deputies for the suggestions they have thrown out and for the non-Party spirit in which this Bill has been debated.  We all admit that a Bill is necessary.  As Deputy Burke pointed out, the Bill is long overdue.  Deputy Kennedy pointed out &mdash;and very rightly&mdash;that he had not read the Bill.  I admire him for that admission because some of the Deputies who stated that they had read it suggested that there were things in the Bill which are not in the Bill.  One Deputy asked if we were going to drive people from playing Pongo?  What we are doing is slashing Acts of Parliament passed 250 years ago prohibiting persons from playing Pongo or indulging in innocent games, and legalising a game which up to the present time, up to to-night, one could be prosecuted for playing. <Col N="94" /> What the House is asked to do is to try to legalise such games by removing all these Acts that were passed hundreds of years ago against the people of this country.</P>
      <P>In putting forward the Bill, we recognise that in certain respects we have to put protection for our people in the Bill.  I am more than surprised that there was not greater opposition, knowing the wealth of certain individuals who might want to retain certain forms of gambling.  To my mind&mdash;and I am only giving a personal opinion&mdash;too much money is spent in Ireland on gambling.  We cannot afford it.</P>
      <P>Since the Bill was introduced I have received deputations from the principal showmen in the country, men whose business is to the extent of 80 per cent. concerned with providing amusement in towns and villages throughout the country during the appropriate period.  They all want a Bill.  Even the various societies that I met in connection with lotteries wanted a Bill because they want to be legalised.  At the present time they have no power to run even a lottery. The showmen want a Bill.</P>
      <P>Some Deputies have pointed out that the period permitted for staying in rural areas is too short.  We are prepared to meet the showman by giving him two week-ends in the small village, and it will not be necessary to go to the county council and have a special meeting of all the members of a county council to give permission to have the fun-fair or the amusement in a particular area.  That provision refers only to seaside places.  I think Deputy Briscoe will agree with me that public bodies have a right to say, where business depends on tourists, that music boxes and loud speakers cannot be allowed to go on until the late hours of the night or the early hours of the morning and thus prevent people from having their rest.  That would quickly ruin the area, and surely a public body should have the right to say: &ldquo;You must close down your loud speaker or music box at 11.30 or 12 o'clock so that the people who come here for a holiday will have their night's sleep.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="95" /> I am sure that Deputy Briscoe will not agree with the speakers who said that public bodies would not give fair play.  I am surprised at representatives of public bodies making such statements against the men on public bodies.  I have been for a very long period on a public body and because a man disagrees with me it does not mean that he is dishonest or that he is influenced by any motive other than what he believes is right.</P>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe has put up an important point and so has Deputy Burke.  I did not bring in a Bill and neither did my predecessor to inflict hardship on any section of the community. We brought it in because we recognised it was necessary.  A Committee of the whole House has been suggested&mdash;let us get our Bill passed and I will give that very favourable and sympathetic consideration, but there are other points to be considered.</P>
    <P>Lotteries have been mentioned.  I am not wedded to £300, but what I am worrying about is this: you have parochial lotteries in various areas for very charitable purposes and if you go and have commercialised lotteries for £1,000 or £2,000, probably those lotteries which are doing very good work at the present time would be put out of existence.</P>
    <P>On the question of the 50 per cent. mentioned by Deputy Costello, I met deputations of various Irishmen engaged in promoting lotteries for very good, worthy and noble causes, but again I thought they were going too far.  I am sure Deputy Briscoe will agree with me that 50 per cent. is too high.  If a person gives a shilling to a lottery for a certain charitable purpose he wants his money to go to that purpose.  We do not want 50 per cent. of it going on expenses.  We had a case put up by a deputation representing a very good and worthy cause. They collected £1,300 or £1,400 a week and there was £200 for the object in aid of which the lottery was organised, but there was over £800 in expenses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>How much for the prizes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not mentioning that organisation which does very <Col N="96" /> good work, but its expenses are too high.  They promised my predecessor: &ldquo;If you increase the limit to £300 we will not exceed 25 per cent. on our expenses.&rdquo;  I very rightly pointed out that the moment you go to 25 per cent. you will go further, and their expenses exceeded 25 per cent. because they were giving 3d. out of every 1/- to the collectors they had all over the country, and they were involved in other expenses.  I believe that if you are organising a lottery for a good, charitable cause&mdash;and I have some experience in running them each year&mdash;you do not have to pay men for working for a worthy object.  But it seems to be coming to the point in Ireland now that even where we have a very charitable object, we must pay men huge salaries to make a success of the lottery.</P>
      <P>At the present time I can understand where a society is running a lottery for a very laudable purpose they are exceeding their 25 per cent. and are going on to 40 per cent. in expenses. They have to compete with others by offering their agents a similar amount.  If we had agreement as to the amount that we should allow for expenses&mdash;let it be 30 per cent.&mdash; then one would not have an advantage over the other because both would be bound by the same regulations.</P>
      <P>I think I have dealt with all the points made.  I have said it is not necessary to refer to the county council. The recognised showmen want a Bill.  We are not interfering with the small men.  The larger showmen are interested in and are trying to protect the smaller ones.  Neither my predecessor nor myself, having the responsibility, had any desire to inflict hardship on any section of the community. We are faced with a problem and if Deputies accept our statement they will know that despite the speeches that have been made here suggesting that we were preventing amusement in rural areas, that is not in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If you want to have gaming and to have your amusements you must get permission from the district justice if you are going to remain three months, say, as Deputy O'Malley mentioned, in Galway.  At the present time you must <Col N="97" /> get permission from the district justice to run a dance.  There is nothing to prevent an amusement caterer from going before a district justice and getting permission to remain two or three months in the one place.</P>
    <P>Various points were raised by Deputies, each Deputy acting according to what he believed to be the best interests of the community.  I do not desire in any way to inflict hardship on the people.  My only desire is to remove some of the grievances that exist. I promise Deputy Briscoe and Deputy Burke that I will give my most sympathetic and earnest consideration to the suggestion of putting this Bill before a committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I would advise the Minister to be careful about that because the lobbying that is going on now will be nothing to what it will be if the Bill is put before a few individuals at a committee.  I advise the Minister carefully to consider the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>When the House reported progress on the consideration of this Estimate I was pointing out that if the Minister for Agriculture wishes to make real progress in increasing production he should cease misusing statistics for political purposes.  I indicated that, by taking a different selection of years in regard to agricultural production, one could always prove a particular case.  I pointed out that it would be much the best thing for all of us if we faced the need for a great increase in production and recognised that no Government and no Party as yet has succeeded in <Col N="98" /> creating the kind of growth in our production which we would all like to see.</P>
      <P>For example, in the course of his statement the Minister chose to compare the number of cattle of under one year, taking the average of 1934 to 1938 as being 978,000.  He pointed out that in 1954 there were 1,036,000 cattle of under one year in the country.  One might just as well take the year 1939, after five years of admittedly difficult conditions with the hardships imposed by the economic dispute with Britain. In 1939, there were 1,029,000 cattle of under one year in the country&mdash;almost exactly the same number as in 1954.  I think the people on this side of the House will not accuse the Minister for being responsible for the fact that there was only that very small increase in young cattle, when we take those particular years.  Equally, it is unfair of the Minister to try and make political use of these figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If one wants to, one can take figures for other years and go back to 1911 when there were just under 4,000,000 cattle in the country.  In 1954&mdash;44 years later&mdash;there were 4,500,000 cattle in the country.  That sort of figure is much more representative of the real position than to select a figure for particular years.  We could say to the Minister, if we wanted to, that production in 1945 was the same as it was in 1950 and we could ask him what he thought he was doing during his three years of office if, at the end, the production was only the same as it was after we had had to face five years of emergency. We shall never be able to persuade the agricultural community that there is sufficient safeguard for them to increase production&mdash;with all the expense involved, with all the capital investment required and with all the anxiety that will inevitably follow&mdash;if we use that kind of propaganda in this House.  Let us simply say that there has been a small but heartening increase in production, compared with the year before the war, of under 10 per cent.  Let us say how glad we are that that is the case and let us proceed from there and do our best to secure a a far greater production than anything dreamt of at the present time.  If we <Col N="99" /> can argue in that way in this House about methods and policies we shall do much more for the farming community than by playing politics with figures.</P>
    <P>All of us recognise the difficulty of inducing an increase in production. The difficulty lies in the ease with which people can leave the land compared with countries competing with us in the British market where there are not the same facilities for emigration and migration.  We have been given the facts in documents that have been approved by the present Government. They cannot deny the facts. The facts are that the people have steadily left the land under every Government so that now there are fewer people on the land than there were many years ago.  They have approximately the same production but the prices have gone up.  As a result, the income from farming per person on the farm has risen.  I think about 150,000 persons left the land between 1946 and 1951.  For those who were left on the land there was, naturally, a proportionately higher income. Let me put it in another way. Production is roughly the same to-day as it was in 1939.  Prices for produce have gone up over three times while the prices of what the farmer buys in the way of goods have gone up by about two and one third times.</P>
    <P>A very large number of people have left the land.  As a consequence, there is greater prosperity for the farming community, occasioned mainly by the higher prices and the larger income per person.  All these things have been admitted by the present Government. They can all be found in official Government publications.  They were equally admitted by us.  We published the figures year after year.  No one can deny them.  A number of commissions which were appointed by different Governments confirmed the same facts. It will be enormously difficult to change the system if greater and greater profits can be made through this means whereby you have what would be called in the ordinary way an extensive system of farming rather <Col N="100" /> than an intensive system.  It will be very difficult to convince the farming community that it is worth while farming intensively&mdash;with all the worry and anxiety that must come with it, in addition to the fear of uncertain markets for some products, the hazards of farming and all the other difficulties faced by the farming community.</P>
    <P>I spoke also about the report of the population commission.  The members of the commission were seriously perturbed by the fact that productivity seemed to have grown more from the larger farms than from the smaller farms.  They pointed out the progress that was being made in scientific and modern methods and said that farm organisation in general was far more advanced in the East, where perhaps capital facilities were more readily obtainable and where farmers had many more opportunities of meeting together and of talking about their problems.  That to me was a serious matter, because we all know the difficulties of the farmers in the West.  We regret that the output per acre on the smaller farms has gone down but that in the case of the large holdings of 20 acres and over it had increased.  We realise that that is something all of us would wish to see put right.</P>
    <P>I think we do not have to go far to seek the reasons for these difficulties. There has been a great deal of consolidation of holdings taking place in the western areas and no Minister for Lands has ever succeeded in getting ahead of the congestion problem.  It is admitted that a certain number of holdings are provided every year for migrants but we do see, as the present Minister for Lands knows, that the people are leaving the land in large numbers and that their holdings are becoming consolidated&mdash;that a farmer who has ten acres in one place will have bought ten or 15 acres in a different area, perhaps at the head of the valley where he lives.  In other words there is a great deal of fluidity in the western areas which is not conducive to high productivity.  There is also the fact that the larger farms are not worked as productively as they might be because there are too few people left to work them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen it myself, going around the country.  The Minister will have to admit that there has been a lot of consolidation of holdings in the western areas.  The small holdings which belonged to people who emigrated or to others who died are being consolidated and to a greater extent than can be coped with by the Land Commission.  I have seen it myself when going through the areas and the facts have been pointed out to me. This problem, in the main created by emigration from the western areas, is common to all Governments; it is a problem to be faced by all of us.</P>
      <P>It is a serious problem.  But there are signs of hope for the future.  A great deal of use has been made of the schemes administered by the Department. There has been a heartening, even though small, increase in production. Farmers have been reconstructing their premises and their out-offices. Land reclamation and drainage have been proceeding and I think that the greatest hope we can see for the future is that in every area and in every county you will find one farmer who will produce more than twice as much as his neighbour.  That farmer is a shining example and, as I say, that situation is not confined to one county or to one area.  What is needed to bring about a vast general improvement is a technological revolution in farming methods.</P>
      <P>No one needs be despondent, because improvement can be seen; there has been very manifest and striking improvement.  We know from our various constituencies that there is locked up in the soil of this country the fertility value which would amount to £100,000,000 per annum.  It is being availed of to a great extent but an enormous lot has to be done if we are to achieve the best than can be achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That brings me to ways and means of improving agricultural production. These do not happen to relate to anything that might be called matters of political dispute but purely to questions of organisation.  First of all, I <Col N="102" /> think we need a change in regard to the methods of propaganda we use.</P>
    <P>The Department of Agriculture has many excellent schemes.  Its propaganda, of a type, is excellent but because it is a Government Department, subject to the personal direction of a Minister, it is not likely to use the most modern methods of propaganda. You will never see advertisements issued by it with value and volume symbols, the difficulty being that it is hard for a Department to guarantee any figures and from the standpoint of modern public relations practices the advertising done by the Department is utterly dull and uninteresting.</P>
    <P>You will very rarely see advertising of the kind which would be recommended by a group of public relation officers who had a first-class expert knowledge of their subject and I think myself it is true to say that without a reorganisation of the public relations side of the Department it would be hard to ask the officers to make any striking changes in their methods of propaganda.</P>
    <P>That brings me to another matter. We are in the year 1955 and we have not yet established any number of pilot farms run by the farmers themselves with the help of the Department where accounts are published and where the progress that can be made can be seen by all the farmers.  We are a conservative people and I think it would be rather difficult to get the farmers to co-operate in that way but it is my belief that if a proper effort were made and that if the farmers' organisations like Macra na Feirme and the new farmers' organisation were asked to co-operate it should be possible to run many pilot farms.  I believe there are one or two already but it has been found in Holland and Denmark that the greatest benefits accrue from demonstrations designed to show the advantages of modern methods.  It should be possible to have pilot farms run for farmers of every size who would be able to visit these farms and see what the results are.</P>
    <P>I refuse to see how such pilot farms <Col N="103" /> would be too expensive to run initially. The money would be well spent and I believe there should not be just a few but 3,000 or 4,000 of these farms run in this way, run by the owners themselves who would accept voluntarily in the beginning the advice given by the Department, and where accounts would be kept.  The demonstration plots, of which there are many in the country, have a certain effect, but I have heard farmers say that they operate <i>in vacuo</i> and that it is not the same thing as if a farmer had to spend additional working capital in face of all the difficulties and the problems and the hazards of the weather.  As a result demonstration plots have not the success we would like them to have.</P>
    <P>The demonstration farm at Johnstown Castle showing the advantages of the application of fertilisers to grassland has been effective to a certain degree and the excursions of such organisations as Macra na Feirme to Johnstown Castle have been very useful but a great deal more needs to be done in that direction.  I learned from the Minister that only 72 lectures were given in a year accompanied by films. I may be wrong but I think there should be a complete film unit operated by the Department of Agriculture. In Denmark the people voluntarily pay a small tax of a penny or twopence on cinema seats and they collect £135,000 a year in that way.  They have four private film companies who provide films on Danish history, civics and agriculture.</P>
    <P>They also provide technical films for agricultural use and it seems extraordinary that the Danes can have four or five film companies doing valuable work and that we have not got a single film unit to make films to assist the Department of Agriculture advisers in giving classes.  My own belief is that the use of films and probably in future of television is an absolutely essential part of an instruction, that it should be a far more frequent feature of the lectures given by our advisers.</P>
    <P>I note in that connection that, although there are something like over 400,000 people who are concerned with <Col N="104" /> agriculture, the total number of persons attending classes for elementary instruction in soil mechanics, botany and so forth and farming is 4,600 in the year and that about the same number attend the rural science classes in the vocational education schools.  That number is the lowest of any country in Western Europe and the very small number needs explanation. I refuse to believe that the younger community, particularly now that they have extra classes under Macra na Feirme auspices, are unwilling to study a subject which has now become so complex that one may say there are almost as many innovations in farming as there have been, for example, in the radio world starting off with Marconi and ending with television. I refuse to believe that, if a great effort was made to popularise education, both theoretical and practical, a very much larger number of farmers' sons would not attend these classes.</P>
    <P>The difficulty seems to be to break the vicious circle of lack of incentive and a lack, perhaps, of imagination in what is offered by the Department.  I believe the vicious circle can be broken and should be broken.</P>
    <P>I suppose the Minister for Agriculture would agree with me that only about 25 per cent. of the knowledge required for modern farming can be inherited these days.  The rest of it is highly technical in character and has been changing rapidly in the last 20 years and the amount a person can inherit in the way of knowledge to run a farm is far less than it was, say, 30 or 40 years ago.</P>
    <P>Of course, speaking of the public relations end of the Department's work, the Department is assisted by advertisements by private firms but, as I said, I still feel that a great deal more can be done to make the advertising interesting.  To give a specific example, in my own constituency, when the urgent necessity of changing from the pork pig to the bacon pig became evident, I would say from the standpoint of modern public relations, the propaganda effort made by the Department to persuade the farmers as to what they should do was totally <Col N="105" /> inadequate.  I am not saying that any particular Minister was responsible for that.  I am simply saying that the conception of modern public relations is not what it should be.  We have very far to go before that whole conception is up to the standards which are desirable.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the fact that propaganda must be concentrated; it must be interesting and not didactic.  It can only be persuasive.  The idea of telling farmers that they should do a thing&mdash; the didactic way&mdash;is hopeless.  It must be interesting and sympathetic.  I understand all those things.  I understand that advertising and public relations between the Department and the farmers provide a difficult problem. It is not easy to do the right thing.  It is not easy to prepare propaganda in the right form.  Nothing would be more useless than a vast increase in propaganda of a purely didactic character.  It would be utterly hopeless and the farmers would be quite right in deriding it and ignoring it.  Nevertheless, the problem remains.</P>
    <P>Passing to the whole question of the agricultural advisory services and the proposed initiation of an agricultural institute for research, I would say the agricultural advisers do excellent work. We all of us recognise that.  Farmers are the first to pay tremendous tribute to the work they do.  Some of them go far beyond their ordinary hours in giving farmers advice and helping them with the many problems they have to face.  But, there again, in relation to their work, the agricultural committees, however well they may perform their functions, are mainly administrative bodies and there is not the element of creating competition between the advisers as to the amount of good they can do in an area in a given year.</P>
    <P>That element does not exist.  There is never any suggestion of a target to be achieved in a particular area.  The advisers have never yet been given any kind of approximate survey of the conditions of their area and the amount that requires to be done to improve the grass land, to alter conditions, to improve production.  There is not an atmosphere of competitive <Col N="106" /> incentive in the advisory world of the Department of Agriculture and that, again, is because the agricultural advisers work to departmental rules under agricultural committees.  While that is perfectly all right in its own way, it does not conform to modern and up-to-date conceptions of public relations.</P>
    <P>It is my view and the view of many of my colleagues that the time has come to indulge in an act of faith in the farming community and to give them far more personal, immediate, direct and day-to-day interest in the advisory work done by the Department, to give them the responsibility of knowing what the problem is from the Department's point of view and of having a personal interest to a far greater degree in the work of every adviser and particularly in the work of the new institute that is now to be formed for research.</P>
    <P>I see no reason why the institute should not be administered by a corporation consisting of farmers and experts and others.  I see no reason why the present Minister should not consider separating in the Department the purely advisory services from the policy services and the services in connection with various schemes, why he should not consider giving the agricultural community a far greater immediate power and interest in the work of research and in the work of providing advice.</P>
    <P>I think that in every county the farmers' organisations should be given an indication of the target to be achieved, that there should be some sort of survey conducted in every county where the local farmers' organisations would know the complete problem facing the adviser, the number of acres of grass requiring complete re-cultivation, the difficulties encountered in connection with diseases of animals.  They should be given an idea of the kind of target that could be achieved, the work that requires to be done, the difficulties to be met, and they should feel that they themselves had an immediate and direct part in administering the work of the adviser.  The adviser should be, so to speak, run by them rather than by the Department in the immediate <Col N="107" /> sense.  The feeling that the Department was in some way apart from the agricultural community, that it was run under the aegis of the Minister and that it was rather apart from their immediate lives seems to me to be something which it is time we should end.</P>
    <P>I believe that if the present farmers' organisations were given the direct responsibility for the research institute, for directing the work of field advisers on special subjects, who would go down from the Department to the local areas, and in, as I have said, the formation of targets to be achieved and the problems to be overcome, it would be the greatest thing that could be done in the last quarter of a century to bring about an increase of production.</P>
    <P>I believe that the farming community would do this work effectively.  In other countries, for example, where industry is pre-eminent, the industrial organisations do their own propaganda for increasing productivity.  In Great Britain there are a dozen organisations all working towards increased productivity. I refuse to believe that there are not enough intelligent farmers in the whole of Ireland to do this work and to take immediate responsibility for the work, to administer the services through a grant aided association of experts with the professors of agricultural colleges and, if necessary, nominees chosen by the Minister in the various fields to help them.</P>
    <P>I believe they should take an immediate part in the work and that if they do, the work of the advisers would be enormously speeded up, and the effective work of the advisers would be greater; in every county and in every area the farming community as a whole would have a far better idea of the kind of target that can be achieved; there would be far more co-operation with the advisers, and the advisers themselves would find their work all the easier.</P>
    <P>I think also that, due perhaps to the incidence of the civil war, followed by the economic dispute, followed by the Great War and for other reasons, there is a hopeless inadequacy of research <Col N="108" /> stations in this country.  I have made a comparison with conditions abroad and it would seem to me we need far more research stations in every area for every type of soil and in particular for the utilisation of grass after tillage. We need far more research in order to give correct information to the farming community on the results of various mixtures of grass, the extent to which the grass will endure in a particular time, the type of grazing that should be effected in connection with any grass land rotation.</P>
    <P>There is a vast amount of research to be done and there again it would seem to me that no matter what the expenditure, this expansion is worth while.  I see no reason why the kind of research that is being done in Aberystwyth and in a dozen other areas in Great Britain of a most concentrated kind is not just as essential for this country.  Even though we have research stations they are not sufficiently extensive.  The grass mixture and strains are not sufficiently varied in number and a vast amount of work needs to be done in that regard. I am willing to admit that there has not been the demand for it for the reasons I have outlined, but my own feeling is that it is very essential indeed.</P>
    <P>One objection that has been offered to me in connection with this suggestion that the farming community should take a more direct part in the advisory work, is that it would be almost impossible for the Government to separate policy from advice.  I refuse to believe that.  If there are differences of opinion on what is the best thing to do under given circumstances in a given area the adviser should be entitled to give his advice for both alternatives in respect of any one thing and there should not be any need to have the policy-making activities of the Department interfering with the general advisory service.</P>
    <P>There are an enormous number of objectives in farming policy on which we are all agreed in this House.  We are even all agreed about the general value of tillage in spite of the distortions on the other side on subjects such as wheat, and so forth.  The present <Col N="109" /> Minister, when he is making a formal speech at a committee of agriculture and on any other occasion, repeats the identical words of the previous Minister in regard to the desirability of tillage in various areas, and it is only when the present Minister differs with us about the value of wheat and when it would appear a great many of his followers are not so keen on tillage, we disagree with him.</P>
    <P>However, as we have told the House, he has learned the Fianna Fáil policy of encouraging tillage and we have faced a long struggle to achieve that end.  As I have said, there is so much that everybody believes in in regard to agricultural policy that it should not be difficult for the advisers to have a general pattern of work which they can follow and on which they could co-operate, as I have said, with the farming community of this country, and the farming community should be, week after week and month after month, interested in the administration which guides the advisers.</P>
    <P>Another reason for the kind of research which would seem to me to be needed here is the fact that you can go down and talk with farmers in any area and on certain matters they cannot give the answer because the facts have not been presented to them.  You have, for example, the question of the profit that can be made on cattle at various ages, the profit that can be made on cattle of different breeds, and so on.  It seems to me we need research of that kind on a greater level than we have at the present time.  I see no reason why, if the British, Dutch and Danes need research of that kind, we do not need it.  The conditions here are different; climatic and grass conditions are different.</P>
    <P>In that connection, I would like to ask the Minister what steps have been taken in connection with the bull conversion factor testing which is now beginning in Great Britain, in connection with which from the point of view of beef, a beef bull's progeny is tested for the conversion factor, the amount of weight put on to a given intake of food.  I would like to ask the Minister <Col N="110" /> whether that kind of experimental research is beginning here.</P>
    <P>There are countries abroad where an agricultural adviser can go to a farmer in a given area and if the farmer is a dairying farmer, a mixed farmer or a farmer of any kind, the agricultural adviser can tell him the maximum profit being made on farms of similar size, of similar type and with similar soil. He can tell him the maximum profit that is being made in the area without mentioning names, the medium profit and what constitutes a low profit. Sooner or later we will have to get down to work of that kind.  In Great Britain, one example where that information can be given, a man can go and look at a farm of 50 acres and find out from the adviser the actual costings, what is the maximum profit of that farm, the medium profit and so forth.  We need far more research in regard to costing for farms of different sizes, different soils and different types and that should be one of the extensions of the work of the advisers, providing costings for farmers in regard to these matters.</P>
    <P>One of the principal reasons why the output per acre of small farms of the West, according to the Population Commission, has not shown the same advances as in the East is that, as everybody knows, a great many of the measures for increasing production in the case of small farmers require co-operation. There are co-operatives in the creamery areas but co-operation is a thing which it has always been said is not natural to our temperament.  I very much doubt if that is fundamentally true.  I believe more can be done to stimulate co-operation and I understand that in the 12-point programme of the Government mentioning the needs of increasing agricultural production the word &ldquo;co-operation&rdquo; was actually used.</P>
    <P>There, again, it is impossible for the Government to act didactically, but I hope that the Minister would consider various methods of stimulating co-operation. He might, for example, consider offering some help at the initiation of a new co-operative outside a creamery area and not related to the <Col N="111" /> creamery business.  He might offer some help at the initiation of a co-operative provided certain conditions were observed.  He might help in the matter of credit.  Every Deputy here says that the small farmer is unable to get credit to increase his production and sooner or later that fact will have to be faced by the Government of the day.  If credit is required, the whole question of farming credit must be investigated.</P>
    <P>We hear various stories from both sides of the House.  We have heard from the Minister himself; he has told us he has no evidence that the farming community as a whole is seeking credit which is not available to them under the present organisation of the State. We hear others say there is a woeful lack of credit among the small farmers and that something should be done about it.  There are various ways in which the Minister might give incentives to co-operative organisations, such as offering them special terms in connection with the machinery loans scheme or in connection with schemes for giving grants for farm improvements. This might induce farmers to form co-operatives, farmers who otherwise would feel that the difficulties and risks in connection with the formation of such co-operatives would not be worth while.</P>
    <P>I also learn that there are a great number of creameries which for one reason or another are not willing to act as credit organisations.  They may have their own good reasons for that. Some creameries advance credit to farmers for machinery or fertilisers and for various improvements, such advances being collectable by subtraction from the milk cheque.  There are other creameries whose credit facilities are extremely limited.  I think the Minister should investigate how it is that so few of the creameries have yet become what they should be in my view&mdash;cooperative banks as well as creameries.</P>
    <P>I know that takes organisation.  It takes faith.  It takes courage.  It seems to me to be inevitable in the future and if, on both sides of the House, it is now agreed that the small farming <Col N="112" /> area will fall constantly behind the big farming area unless co-operative methods are used, both in the marketing and in the purchasing of the more essential requirements and in the use of machinery, it seems to me that is a challenge to any Government.  We all of us know that challenge is there and we none of us can avoid it.</P>
    <P>Both sides have expressed the view that it is impossible to envisage a large-scale increase in production in the western areas without co-operation between the farmers; both sides have expressed the view that that job somehow has to be done or we will continue to see greater progress made in the big farming areas in increasing output and the use of modern scientific methods and less output in the small farming areas.  The 12-point programme of the Government clearly states that and makes it a point at issue.  But I accept the difficulties in bringing it about.</P>
    <P>There are quite a number of branches of Macra na Feirme which have started a system of veterinary insurance.  I am not sure whether there are enough veterinary surgeons in the country to take part in any extended scheme of veterinary insurance and I would like to ask the Minister&mdash;he has already been asked by both sides of the House &mdash;whether he has considered any form of veterinary insurance or any kind of aid that can be given either to co-operative societies or others to initiate veterinary insurance so as to encourage farmers to make use of veterinary surgeons more immediately thereby encouraging the growth of veterinary services on a very large scale.</P>
    <P>I have spoken to veterinary surgeons in various parts of the country and I am aware of the fact that, although great progress is being made in the use to which veterinary services are being put, a great deal more still remains to be done.  I think in the case of the co-operative society which either provides an adviser for their members or provides veterinary insurance or facilities for the co-operative use of machinery or the purchase of machinery co-operatively, the Minister should consider taking further steps <Col N="113" /> over and above those which have already been taken to encourage such societies either by way of some kind of initial grant or some sort of premium upon the facilities that are available from the Department generally in relation to such societies.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that the task of increasing the extent of co-operation now will be less difficult than it was before.  One has only to look at the number of cattle marketing organisations starting up in the country to realise the change that has taken place and realise the fact that the old fashioned fair is gradually being killed in some areas. The farmers are now coming together to run their own auctions.  That is an indication of what can be done and an indication, too, that there is a fermentation of thought on the whole problem. It does not seem impossible to imagine that, if the farmers can come together and run their own auctions, they could equally begin to think about the co-operative use of credit and machinery.</P>
    <P>I think the Government will have to give some stimulus to that.  There is an obligation on their part to give some stimulus if they possibly can.  I have tried to speak as far as I could in a non-political way because it seems to me that a great many of the problems we face are not political but technical.  I would remark again that the Minister would do far better to start from scratch at the point he has now reached and not try and take credit for something for which credit is not due to him.  He should simply regard the present year as a base line for all future increases in production.</P>
    <P>So long as he continues to talk politically in the way he has done, then we shall have to repeat endlessly and continually the tremendous work done by those who are now on this side of the House to stimulate production. We shall have to spend our time contradicting the propaganda of the Government, which would suggest that practically every scheme to assist the farmer was started by them rather than by us.  We shall have to contradict the propaganda of the Government side of the House making use of the worst weather year in our history, <Col N="114" /> 1947, for the purpose of trying to prove some enormous increase in production as compared with that year when, in fact, the main problem in regard to productivity is still there.</P>
    <P>When production increases by a very small amount exports rise and there has been a very heartening increase in exports both in our time in office and in the present Government's.  But, of course, the real problem can be concealed by the fact that the Irish people themselves are very big consumers of their own foodstuffs.  An immediate increase in exports, which is most valuable and helpful, will take place the moment there is a slight increase in production; but that still leaves the main problem untouched and I would, in conclusion, ask the Minister to do the utmost he can to give farming organisations, Macra na Feirme and the National Farmers' Organisation, a more direct interest in the work of the advisers and in the part that is played by the research organisations, particularly in relation to the new institute, the conception of which is now, I understand, under consideration by the Minister.</P>

      <P>While I give credit to the last speaker for the type of speech he has made, at the same time I would say that in order to speak about farming one must be a farmer living on the land.  In my opinion, the debate on the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture is more or less interwoven with the debate on the Budget.  What is said on one is said on the other.  I sat here and listened to the debate for the last three weeks.  I refused to speak on the Budget because I heard such a lot of highfalutin nonsense from the other side of the House.  The principal speakers of the Fianna Fáil Party &mdash;the ex-Taoiseach, Deputy Vivion de Valera and Deputy Briscoe and a few others&mdash;all said this was a good Budget and I was quite satisfied that that should be an end of it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickGiles" hpid="Captain Giles Captain Giles">
      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>All the long-winded, highfalutin nonsense spoiled the <Col N="115" /> whole tone of the debate.  It would sicken any ordinary honest man sitting in this House to listen to what goes on.  Statistics, so far as I can see, can prove anything and we have far too much of them from all sides of the House.  I am sick of hearing figures bandied about and I hope this practice stops.  I am also sick of seeing bundles of papers and cuttings brought in both by front and back-benchers.  If they would put them in a cart and bring them to Clondalkin Paper Mills where we would never see them again, it would be far better.  I prefer a man to come in and speak as a man.  Let us give up the nonsense of going back on what such a man said last year or last month.  It is time that was cut out and that realities were faced.</P>
      <P>Speaking of the prosperity of the farmers, I believe the country is in good shape; things are doing well; money is turning and farming appears to be on the upgrade, but as one who looks ahead with a common-sense view I believe we are in a dangerous situation. Our prosperity now is based on one line of agriculture, the main line that has carried this country for 200 or 300 years, perhaps, that is the cattle trade.  We all know why we have that prosperity and I agree that the Minister by his efforts and his policy over the past few years has greatly contributed to it, but in the main the prosperity of the cattle trade depends on the armaments race in Britain.  So long as a war situation looms ahead our cattle trade will hold a very significant and happy position but if anything happens and if five or ten years of peace can be seen ahead I believe we would be made sit up in this country and we would find ourselves in a very serious position, perhaps overnight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like this House to define a genuine, absolute agricultural policy for the country irrespective of what Government is in power.  I am sure the agricultural policy which suits Fine Gael also suits Fianna Fáil but we are not sincere about it.  I find the Fianna Fáil farmer who lives beside me sows wheat as I sow it, keeps a few cows as I do, and tills his eight or ten acres <Col N="116" /> as I do.  We carry on the same type of agriculture irrespective of who is in power.  Therefore, I ask that this House should give a decent line of agricultural policy so that when there is a change of Government we will not have this bickering and barneying and so that we can agree on the fundamentals of agriculture.</P>
    <P>In the first place, we must agree that the cattle trade is our main industry and that we must make it better if we possibly can.  As one who knows the cattle trade over a long number of years, I am satisfied we have the best type of cattle in the world&mdash;I am not saying we have the best type of milch cow&mdash;but the cattle trade has carried the country for hundreds, if not for 1,000 years.  The clearances in Munster by the British during the conquest were for the purpose of advancing the cattle trade, and right down to this day the cattle trade is carrying the country.</P>
    <P>But I am not happy about the Irish cattle trade because I feel we are in a dangerous position.  What about the people on the land?  Is it more important to have cattle and bullocks or people?  I hold the people come before anything else.  The land in this country is being depopulated, and while we may have the cattle, the people are going.  That is where the leakage is, and I want to see that problem faced.  It may cost millions of pounds to do that, but it has to be done.</P>
    <P>I want to see the cottage industries of the past revived.  We have these cottages all over the country in which live men with their wives and six or eight children.  Thirty years ago, these men did not live solely on their wages: each of them also had a pig or two in his pigsty and a weanling calf in an outhouse and, perhaps, two dozen hens or turkeys that he was able to rear.  To-day there is hardly a hen, let alone a pig or a calf, in the cottier's plot or byre.</P>
    <P>Something must be done about the pig industry immediately.  I have seen too many changes in it.  I saw the country flooded with pigs, then I saw no pigs at all.  I saw it flooded with pigs again and I saw a short while ago <Col N="117" /> pigs going out of the country and a scarcity developing again.  Now, I see there is a boom and up goes the pig again.  That is not agriculture.  I believe there is a ring to be broken somewhere and there is no question about that.  If we produce our own cereals, barley and fodder beet with skim milk and our own potatoes, we do not need to import anything so far as pigs are concerned.  I rear a fair amount of pigs but I never bought a stone of any type of meal except what I was able to produce myself and I can challenge anyone to produce better pigs or produce them more quickly than I have done on fodder beet, skim milk and potatoes.</P>
    <P>I hear too much talk about importations of maize and other stuffs.  Deputy Corry will be on that subject one day and somebody else the next.  There is very little need for that.  We should put the small man in a position to produce pigs.  It is the large producer who is carrying the country at the present time and who is making the big money because the small men are not in as good a position to feed pigs. I want to see something done for them. As a rule the big producers have or can get plenty of capital but the small man with ten or 15 acres, or with a cottage plot, would not get capital even to the extent of £20 to-day.</P>
    <P>We are happy to hear the farmers of Ireland are organising to join together as one body.  I hope they do.  I would like to see the farmers and the agricultural workers blended together in one body because the farmer is nowhere without the worker.  If we start organising farmers on one side and workers on the other we will end as we did in 1920 when the farmers could not cut their wheat and had to open the gates and let the cattle in on it, destroying the fertile crops of that period.  These things happened before and will again.  Let us bring the farmers and the workers together and promote a spirit of peace and Christian charity between the two sections.  I saw, perhaps, 40 different types of organisations in this country and saw them all break up for the same reason &mdash;no charity and no give-and-take.  A few big windbags got to the top and <Col N="118" /> burst the whole thing.  I hope that will not happen again.</P>
    <P>I heard Deputy Childers say the old type of fair was gone and he seemed to be glad of that.  I am very sorry to see the old type of fair going; it was the life of the country.  There was no question about that.  You may have streamlined ways of buying and selling to-day but the old system was much more satisfactory to the ordinary country person.  In the old days, they bought and sold and money changed hands.  The butcher and the baker did well and perhaps the ice-cream man at the corner of the street did well too. That is all being departed from.</P>
    <P>Now we have the middle-man, the jobber in his high-powered car.  He makes big money in a short period.  He buys the cattle on the land&mdash;not one or two at the time but scores.  He exports direct to the port and nobody gets a penny on the way.  We are depriving the country of the happiness we enjoyed when we had our little fairs and markets, our little sense of humour and our little prosperity.  That has been killed and now we have an artificial type of middle-man who should not be allowed to operate in the country.  My view is that these big things always burst a country.  What is wanted is the turn of money in local areas.</P>
    <P>If we do not look after our little villages and towns then, no matter what we may do for agriculture, it will be of no use.  There is big money floating around but very little of it is being ploughed into agriculture and very little of it is being saved for the stormy period that is not far distant.  The money is being spent on luxuries, on good times and on gambling.  It is being spent on everything that goes for grandeur and big things.  If we had a bad set-back and if conditions across the water were so unfavourable that hundreds of thousands of Irish persons who are now employed in Britain had to return to our shores then indeed we should be in a sorry plight.  I believe that what has happened in the past generally happens again, and I warn every person to be on his guard.  When a person thinks he is on the crest of the wave, there is always danger around the corner.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="119" /> I dread to think that this country is being carried along on the back of the bullock.  The bullock's back is strong enough, but if you build your agricultural economy on that one single aspect of farming you will crash.  Such prosperity does not reach down to the agricultural worker, to the little man who is trying to rear a few store cattle and who must sell them at six or eight months, at the wrong time for making profits, to the bigger man who can put them on the broad acres and leave them there for one winter or two winters, and perhaps sell them for £100 or £120 and does not worry if he does not sell them.  That is not the type of prosperity I want to see.</P>
    <P>I want to see this country alive with industry.  I want to see the cottier on his feet and not having to exist with his wife and children on £4 7s. 6d. or £4 10s. a week.  In the past, he was able to have a few pigs in his byre, maybe two dozen hens and maybe two dozen turkeys.  He had a small garden and there was grazing at the side of the road.  We want to get back to that again.  I hope the Minister for Agriculture, who is a realist, will get back to it.  We spent millions on the industrialisation of this country and I feel that that money was spent unwisely in a great many instances.  If half of it were spent in laying a decent foundation for agriculture, how happy we should all be now with a proper balanced economy.</P>
    <P>What is the position to-day?  The agricultural worker is up to his knees in dirt and mud and is earning £4 7s. 6d. or £4 10s. a week.  In the past, he got his money, a few drills of potatoes, perhaps the skimmed milk and perhaps the old clothes from the homestead of the big men who employed him.  There is none of that to-day.  The agricultural worker must live on the few pounds he gets on a Saturday night.  In the bigger towns where there is industrial development you will find boys of 16 or 17 years from the adjoining countryside and from the town itself earning anything from £6 to £10 a week on an easier, cleaner and nicer job.  Is it not only fair to ask why should any man stay on the land under present conditions? <Col N="120" /> This House is responsible for that position.</P>
    <P>There is a mad craze for industrial development.  If, in that industrial development, we made sure we would absorb the unemployed in our big towns and villages there would be something to be said for it but we have done no such thing.  We brought our people from the rural areas and used some of them in the industrial drive.  We should have stabilised agriculture. The task which the Minister has before him is very difficult because we have not that co-operative effort and spirit of Christian charity which is needed.  Big men, whether they be industrialists or farmers, have a one-track mind; they want money and more money.  They have neither a national nor a broad general economic outlook.  Their whole theme is their own personal future and their own personal advancement.  That has been the way since the beginning of the world and they are the type of persons who have this country in the sad plight it is in at the present time.</P>
    <P>There has been a big controversy about wheat in the House for some months back.  The Minister has given us a reasonable hope of a balanced agriculture.  The Opposition talk about the price of wheat but everybody knows that if Fianna Fáil were in office their Minister for Agriculture would have had to do exactly the same thing as the present Minister for Agriculture. The Fianna Fáil Minister for Agriculture would either have had to cut the price or to cut the acreage.  He could not cut the acreage because that would be interfering with the rights of the farmer and therefore he would have had to cut the price.</P>
    <P>The present Minister for Agriculture had to endure all kinds of abuse from Fianna Fáil because he did the one thing which was necessary to give this country a balance in our agricultural economy.  He wanted to get rid of the racketeer&mdash;the big man who was trying to rake off big profits in a year or two and who did not care about selling out after getting the swag.  Now, people are doing as much tillage as they want themselves and a little more to put on the market.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="121" /> We need more and better production from the land if we are to solve any of the problems which face us at present. There is no use in saying that we will carry on under the present system of production because it just will not work. We have prevented the cottier and the small farmer from being able to keep pigs, poultry, and so forth, because the cost of feeding stuffs is so high that they cannot buy them.  If we could produce 20 to 25 barrels of wheat from an acre which at present produces ten; if we could produce 30 or 40 barrels of oats from an acre which is at present producing 15, and similarly as regards barley, then we should be able to sell at lower prices and we should be able to put on the market for the small man the feeding stuffs he requires at a cheap rate so that he could go back to his cottage and live as he lived in the old days.</P>
    <P>I want to see the parish plan pursued in this country because without it we cannot get down to the people.  As a people, we are inclined to be individualistic. Every man wants to go his own way.  I fear we do not co-operate very well.  There is great spirit in the parish plan and the spirit is what we want&mdash;not money, but a change of heart and spirit.  If the farm workers and the people from the villages and towns and the farmers mix together then we can make progress and have a new type of agricultural effort in our countryside.  If we got that going then the next thing we would require would be cheap credit for the small man. Some people will say that the banks are there if you want them but they are not there for the small man.  Any man from 20 acres down who tries to get a loan of a few hundred pounds from the bank has to drag in two or three other farmers with him when he is asking for the money.  I want to see a farmers' bank and I want to see the members of Macra na Feirme and Muintir na Tíre able to go into that bank and get seasonable credits at reasonable rates of interest.</P>
    <P>We all know that the type of agriculture engaged in by the small man is very haphazard.  He never takes his crops in in time because he has got to wait until his bigger neighbour has <Col N="122" /> finished his work first when he can borrow the big man's horse or his machinery.  But he can get the machinery or the horse only when the other man does not want it.  The small man has to scrape in his crops when he can and the results are very poor. Where he could get 15 or 20 barrels of wheat to the acre he gets four or five, and by the time he pays the mill and the man whose reaper and binder he used he has nothing for himself.  He is the most miserable man in this country.  He has got to till his land in order to live and with the exception of the few barrels of oats or wheat he gets out of it to feed his family and the few pigs and cattle he keeps he has nothing, while at the same time the big man of the money can go into the bank and command £1,000 or £10,000.  He can write to England or to Europe and get the most expensive type of machinery which he can use in a big way and make something out of it.</P>
    <P>Surely, that system is all wrong.  We must get down to the small people who are the foundation of the nation&mdash;the people with the big families who stocked our countryside for hundreds of years and who are prepared to stay on the land whether times are good or bad.  These are the people who deserve our attention, but we are deliberately driving them off the land. We are here talking about statistics. I say &ldquo;Damn the statistics&rdquo;.  There is nothing I hate more than to hear the figures coming from both sides of the House here.  The figures are put forward from the angle that suits the Deputy who gives them on either side. Deputy Walsh, if he wants to get a dig in, will delve for a week until he gets something to suit him and then he will trot it out here.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry will come up from Cork and go straight into the Library with his hacks behind him to get something to throw at the Minister for Agriculture.  At one time they quoted the Minister as saying that he would not be found dead in a field of wheat. Would anybody like to be found dead in a field of wheat?  But do you not see how they put their twist on it?</P>
    <P>I would say to the present Minister: &ldquo;Do not mind what you hear from the <Col N="123" /> far side or from this side of the House. You are a balanced man, a man of brains and courage, a man well-versed in so far as agriculture in concerned. Get down to a properly balanced economy.  I believe you will be there for the next five or ten years if you live.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Fianna Fáil would like to see you cock your toes but I hope they will not be able.  Since the civil war and during the economic war we had too many ups and downs and they taught us what the small farmer is made of.  He has been there for hundreds of years.  He has met the lowest ebb and yet he comes up again, not due to the credit given to him by the banks but to his own hard work and perseverance.  Let us on all sides of the House get down to a foundation that will bring back peace and prosperity to the country.  I would ask the Minister not to mind the big industrialists or the big rancher but to get down to the problems facing the smallholders.</P>
      <P>I would ask him to get after the pig industry and get a committee of experts to help him to see what is wrong with it.  We want pigs to become a reasonable proposition at all times.  We should be able to make their rearing pay.  They have been the friend of the poor man and they have carried him over many ups and downs.  We should never be without pigs and we should be always able to buy from the men who produce the pigs.  There has always been something wrong with that branch of our economy and I hope the farmers, with the Minister, will find the solution.  I think that the middleman who goes around the country in his car should be got rid of.  All these fellows are after big profits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember one time when Deputy Smith came in here and had a smile on his face a yard wide.  Man alive, was not he about to get the poultry industry on its feet?  He had got £1,000,000 from England and he was going to pack the whole countryside with coops and poultry stations and what not of all kinds.  But when the <Col N="124" /> people tried to sell, the English market flopped and the Irish people had to bear the huge loss and England recouped her £1,000,000 in a few weeks. It was a man with the Fianna Fáil mentality who would be proud to scrape together £1,000,000 of England's money.  We do not want England's money.  We are able to get it ourselves. It is a sad day when we would fall into such a trap again.  And they said that the present Minister for Agriculture was to drown England with eggs, and they quoted that from their platforms.  But Deputy Smith tried to do it before that.</P>
    <P>Whatever we do in this country let it be done on Irish lines, with Irish money and Irish effort and let us do it in the interests of Ireland and always look to ourselves first.  If we do that I believe that the pig and bacon industry and the poultry and egg industry will be saved but we must also put the small man in the position of being able to earn a little more money to help him to bring back prosperity and plenty to the nation. We must bring back our little fairs and markets and put out the middle-man&mdash; the man going around with the big car and buying cattle from the big ranchers and exporting them.  They are ruining the whole economy of this country and we must curb them.  In that way we will be bringing back the traditions and the prosperity of the past.</P>
    <P>Why can we not have our fairs, our bargaining, our bartering and our happiness of the past?  We see the position of many of our villages to which these fairs brought a reasonable amount of prosperity.  Everyone to-day wants the big money and when he gets it he wants to float it and he keeps nothing for to-morrow.  It is a sad day when nobody thinks of to-morrow. Everybody nowadays is living for to-day and that is a most dangerous thing.</P>
    <P>We are proud of our cattle trade and proud of the fact that our cattle carried us on their backs but we must remember that dependence entirely on the cattle trade would be a dangerous thing.  If a flop occurred in the cattle trade and tens of thousands of our people were sent back home to us from <Col N="125" /> emigration where would we be then? It would not be just a matter of the few hundred people who sat down in O'Connell Street in the days of Fianna Fáil.  You would not have a few hundred then but 10,000 marching and you would have the bridgehead of communism.  We must face all these facts and I would say to the Minister not to devote too much attention to the big industrialist and the big rancher who are able to fend for themselves but to consider the small man who has carried the nation for years.  They were in every war and in every fight; they have built up the old Irish tradition but that is fast going and if it goes entirely the whole of Ireland will say: &ldquo;My curse on Leinster House.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to detain the House but if possible I should like to say a few words from a different angle to that to which we have been listening during this protracted debate.  Farmers and farming have been discussed as such at great length but many people, when they talk of farmers, forget that there are various types of farmers.</P>
      <P>There is not a county in Ireland which typifies every class, with the exception of the rancher, as does County Donegal.  There, there is the smallholder with the few acres, the small plot; the man with the mediocre farm, in South-West Donegal; the hill or mountain grazer; in East Donegal, the man who goes in for intensive cultivation, who is easily the best tillage farmer in Ireland.  In fact, we have every type of farmer with the exception of the rancher or the big grazer. Unfortunately, we have more of the smallholders and that is the type about whom we have heard rather little in this debate apart from what Deputy Giles has said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am all with Deputy Giles when he says that the present measure of prosperity, if we could refer to it as such, which the farming community in general are looking forward to or are enjoying over a period, does not apply equally to the smallholder, if at all.  I could not quite follow Deputy Giles' reasoning when he praises the present Minister for being the most perfect <Col N="126" /> man&mdash;his description of him would lead one to believe that he is the most perfect man alive&mdash;and at the same time did not point to anything he had done of which Deputy Giles approved as being even useful, apart from being perfect.</P>
    <P>Deputy Giles condemned quotations made by Deputies on this side of the House with reference to what other Ministers or Deputies had said in the past.  He said that these things should be forgotten but he was quick to refer to Fianna Fáil's reference to the British market being gone and to other things in respect of which we were equally misrepresented in this House.</P>
    <P>I do not want to say anything about that misquoted statement by Fianna Fáil except that I was not a member of this House at the time but I am sure that when we were fighting a war with England, let it be an economic war or otherwise, it would not be very patriotic for any member of this House to say that we were beaten, that we would have to yield, that we could not go on.  When the war of London was on in 1942 I do not think Churchill cried that they were beaten, that they could not go on.  I am sure the Fianna Fáil Party were not going to squeal at any time during the economic war which they were fighting. If anybody from the Opposition did so at that time, to their shame be it said. If we did say that we could live without the British market&mdash;I was not in the House at the time&mdash;it was the right thing to say because we had our backs to the wall on many occasions and we never squealed.</P>
    <P>I am not personally interested in the controversy with regard to wheat for the simple reason that every Deputy speaks from his own point of view and there is nobody in West Donegal, or there are very few at any rate, interested in the production of wheat on their own farms.  I am interested to this extent that we believe, and every patriotic Irishman should believe, that the production of the food which is most necessary for the life of the people is a first charge on those who are capable of producing it.</P>
    <P>I am proud, and every Deputy on <Col N="127" /> this side of the House has a right to be proud, when we cast our memories back to the days when there was a fight to get the people to believe that wheat could be grown in this country at all or should be grown and when we remember that the people who told us then that it could not be grown successfully and that it should not be grown, are now telling us that we are growing too much of it.  That is one of the many outstanding achievements which we have a right to be proud of and which we have lived to see in our time.</P>
    <P>I do not want to say any more with regard to this controversy with regard to the growing of wheat than that I am glad to see the time when those who said that we could not or should not grow it are telling us that we have been growing too much, that we were likely to grow too much of it.  That is a very satisfactory situation.</P>
    <P>I am interested in the type of smallholder to whom Deputy Giles has just referred, the man who may go fishing for a day or two in the week in his small boat as an inshore fisherman, or the man who may work with the county council on the roads for a day or two, who will till an acre of land, keep a couple of cows, a pig or two, a few dozen poultry&mdash;the smallholder.  I doubt if the smallholder will agree that he is getting at the present time the co-operation or assistance or encouragement which the Labour Party or others seem to think are unnecessarily extended to the farmer.</P>
    <P>A spokesman from the Labour Benches yesterday said that if we are going to carry on with the incentives and grants which are being given as inducements to the farmers, if we were going to carry on at that rate, the farming industry would soon be, instead of a national industry, a national charity.  The farmers of this country never wanted charity from anybody and do not want charity.  All they want is a chance to live and produce in order that the people of this country may live because on the farmer they live.  If the farming industry was organised to the same extent as other <Col N="128" /> branches of industry are organised and strikes became as frequent amongst farmers as they are in other branches of industry, many of the people who are crying out about the farmer getting too much for his produce would then realise how indispensable he is to the life of the nation.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the farmer is not in a position to use the strike weapon to the same extent or with the same facility or efficiency as it is used by other organised sections of our community and for that reason he is merely the person about whom everybody talks nicely but at the same time expects that he should work for nothing to provide cheap food for the cities and the industrial workers and he should go around in drudgery and export his surplus labour to England and America.</P>
    <P>Deputy Giles said that the industrial drive in this country was putting the cart before the horse, that it was precipitated, that it was done before the farming industry was properly developed. One of the problems which the smallholder has to face, because he has not capital to spare or even sufficient to enable him to run his business free of debt, one of his great problems, for which no solution is yet in sight, is what he must do with the three or four sons whom he brings up on the farm, or the three or four daughters as well, when they grow up. He is not in a position to give them a secondary education and he may not have the convenience of a technical school within reach of them.  They must go to England when they are 14 or 15 years of age and one may remain at home or may return at some later stage with a few pounds which he has earned abroad to carry on the drudgery on the small farm.</P>
    <P>It is very easy to remind the House of these things but it is not so easy to suggest means by which that position can be remedied.  We acknowledge that fact but somebody will have to tackle it and I think the ex-Minister for Agriculture recognised, as did his predecessor in the Fianna Fáil Government, the difficulty of the smallholder and brought about many schemes which were very much to his benefit <Col N="129" /> and schemes which I would like to see enhanced and extended in relation to the smallholder's difficulty.</P>
    <P>The farm improvements scheme was one scheme which is a credit to whatever Minister brought it in here, but it is inadequate in funds and in the scope of its regulations to give the fullest benefit to the thousands who have been and are yet prepared to avail themselves of that scheme.  We had at one time a similar scheme which applied to the making of fences and I do not think it is in force now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was suspended for a time anyhow and I would very much like to see that scheme developed fully because one of the greatest problems of the smallholder is the making of fences between himself and his neighbour.  Not merely is it the cause of friction frequently but it uses up much of his time yearly and it is the cause of much bad husbandry on his land as the result of improvised or inadequate fencing being carried out.  I take it the Minister is correct when he says that there is a scheme in operation and I hope it will enable a farmer to have fencing of a suitable type, wire or otherwise, on his holding and to receive a grant out of Central Funds or a loan to cover the cost of fencing of that sort.</P>

      <P>I have had occasion to ask the Department of Lands and the Department of Agriculture on many occasions to pay attention to the fencing of various holdings in a town-land. I received a reply stating that there were no funds at their disposal out of which they could make grants available for such a scheme.  Therefore, I take it that the scheme is not as generous or at least is not known to be the type of scheme which I have in mind and which I would like to see put into force in the farm improvements scheme in relation to the making of wire fences or any other type of fencing on the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of the difficulties of the smallholder result from the instability of <Col N="130" /> markets as referred to by the previous speaker, fluctuation due to supply and demand.  That is the position which will have to be remedied if such industries as poultry, pigs, and so on, which are the mainstay of the smallholder, are to be made profitable.  The propagation of the pig population over a short period can set the industry at a stage where it is not profitable to keep pigs at all.  The farmers go out of pig production; there is a shortage and the price goes up again; then they all go into it again and, due to the quick propagation of the pig population the price fluctuates again and it goes on in a see-saw fashion year in year out.</P>
    <P>The same applies to poultry.  The fact that there is no stability in the market regarding these two particular things is one of the reasons why many people have ceased to keep pigs or poultry at all, and others only take a chance on going into them haphazardly and make a guess as to what the outcome is likely to be.</P>
    <P>I fully agree that a shortage of credit is one of the greatest difficulties that the smallholder has to face.  Anyone can get extended credit, an overdraft or a loan from a bank except the small farmer; yet he is held to be the backbone of the nation and we are told by everybody that he is the most important man on the land.  However, when he goes into the local bank he finds himself a very unimportant person indeed.  When he asks for accommodation and offers a first charge on his little holding he is told: &ldquo;That is not good enough.  We want two personal sureties as well.&rdquo;  He then has to humiliate himself and go to his neighbours in order to obtain the personal sureties.  When they are sent off to the bank he gets a further reply to the effect that for undisclosed reasons they cannot see their way to grant him the £50 loan to buy a cow and a few head of sheep, and there is no further explanation.  Nevertheless, we are still told he is the most important person in the country.</P>
    <P>Now that cattle have become so expensive those people are unable to re-stock their holdings and I often thought that it would be of immense benefit if any Minister for Agriculture <Col N="131" /> would initiate a scheme whereby each smallholder whose valuation was under £5 or whose valuation did not exceed £6 could get a loan, free of interest, to buy one cow.  Not merely would that be a good scheme for the farmers but for the nation and it would help to build up our cattle population because the smallholder is the man who does really contribute to the increase in the cattle population.  As Deputy Giles said, he sells off his cattle when they are six months or a year old and he is continually providing stores for the man who has the grass.  The only reason why we have not a greater increase in our cattle population is that we are not able to get sufficient cows due to heavy cost and if one dies I doubt if he is able to replace her.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies who are familiar with the conditions on the western seaboard know of hundreds of cases where, if the farmer loses a cow or any other beast for that matter, as the result of disease or in any other way he is unable to replace it due to the fact that it is going to cost at least £40 and he carries on with a depleted stock.  That is the type of person who would need and who should get some credit facilities.  That is the type of person who finds it most difficult, if not completely impossible, to get the credit facilities that would be necessary to enable him to carry on.</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister a question recently regarding the establishment of an A.I station in Donegal.  I do not believe he was being quite honest or frank when he said the indecision of the Sligo conference was a bogey in having an A.I station started in that part.  Donegal were completely agreed on the matter and should get full encouragement to have an A.I station of their own.  It is a serious position as it stands and I hope the Minister will take steps in so far as it lies within his power to give the necessary incentive to any co-operative society prepared to establish a station.  It is a want that is much felt and the reasons are well known to the Minister.  The farmers of Donegal have suffered grave losses recently.</P>

      <P>In the Mountcharles area of my own constituency. At least one veterinary surgeon found it necessary to report it to the county committee of agriculture, of which I happen to be chairman. We, in turn, passed the information on immediately to the Department and we asked them to expedite the establishment of an A.I station.  I hope the Minister will take note of that now.  The veterinary advice is that A.I alone will eradicate that disease.</P>
      <P>This debate has become very protracted and perhaps the problem of derelict farms in the congested areas would be more germane to the debate on the Estimate for the Department of Lands.  It is in order, however, to refer to it on this Estimate.  It is a matter which is causing much concern in the congested areas.  Apparently these derelict farms are not the responsibility of anybody.  In some cases they have been offered to the Land Commission in exchange or for purchase so that they might be consolidated with adjoining holdings but no action has been taken.  I hope to raise this matter on the Vote for the Department of Lands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="133" /> I appeal to the Minister to give more consideration to the smallholder.  We heard a good deal of talk about the possibility of a Minister for the Gaeltacht being appointed.  Even if we had an active Parliamentary Secretary to the Government on whose shoulders such work would rest, something might be done.  We believe it constitutes a separate problem and the Minister will have to delegate authority to some committee or individual to deal specifically with the Gaeltacht and the congested areas, particularly in relation to smallholdings, and ensure that the many pursuits which go to make up the livelihood of these people are properly co-ordinated and assisted. They will not become wealthy merely because cattle prices increase.  The cattle they sell are negligible, but they help.  They will not become wealthy by an improvement in the poultry industry, but that again will help considerably. If the bacon industry improves, that also will be a help.</P>
    <P>The cultivation of vegetables and root crops requires intensive personal attention.  If more co-operation could be established between the small-holders that would go a long way towards solving many of their difficulties. Co-operation in the purchase of machinery is the most important of all. Farming machinery on a smallholding is more or less redundant but if neighbours combine together to purchase and use that machinery that would be one of the best types of co-operation they could have; and co-operation on that basis is essential.</P>
    <P>Some speaker here said that co-operation was something which the Irish people did not readily fall in with; they were not easily adaptable to a co-operative system.  That is nonsense. In the congested areas there has always been a co-operative system of necessity from the days when they were first pushed into these unreclaimed holdings by the plantations.  To this day every important job is done by co-operation between neighbours.  The hay is stacked on that system.  The turf is still cut on that system.</P>
    <P>If that system could be fostered and introduced into the purchase and use <Col N="134" /> of agricultural machinery that would tend ultimately to eradicate many of the evils which beset the smallholder whose life is one of drudgery and frugal living, a job which begins at sunrise and in many cases does not end until after the sun has set.  Yet, we are told by some people here that his life is a life of luxury and that he should produce more things more cheaply in order that other people may have a lower cost of living.  That farmer is an important individual in any community and I think his plight is not generally known very often by those who should be fully aware of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesJBurke" hpid="Mr. J.J. Burke Mr. J.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>This Agriculture Estimate has occupied the attention of a good many Deputies.  Nearly every aspect of agriculture has been debated at some length.  I gather from the remarks of Deputies on both sides that we are at last in agreement on one thing; that is that agriculture is the main industry in the country and that every person depends for his or her standard of living on the farmers' ability to export profitably.  If we are to raise the standard of living of all our people it is generally agreed that the only way we can do that is by increasing in volume and in value the goods we can export at a profit.</P>
      <P>I think it is generally agreed now that practically the only thing we can export from this country at a profit is live stock and live-stock products.  It is, therefore, the duty of any Government or any Minister for Agriculture to increase the number of live stock and also to try to put the land of the country into such a state of fertility that it will not alone be able to feed the extra live stock but feed them better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should give credit where credit is due and I can safely say that the present Minister for Agriculture has done more to increase the numbers of live stock and improve the fertility of the soil than any other man.  By the introduction of the land rehabilitation scheme, the ground limestone scheme and the making available to the farmers generally of modern soil testing facilities, he has put thousands of acres into production which would otherwise be lying derelict and of no <Col N="135" /> use whatever to the people who own them or to the State.</P>
    <P>The Minister's latest addition to the land rehabilitation scheme&mdash;the raising of the ceiling to £60 per acre&mdash;is one that will be much appreciated by the small farmers in the West whose applications to have their little farms reclaimed had been turned down on the grounds that the cost per acre was too great.  These men will be glad to know that they can now go ahead with the reclamation of their little holdings.</P>
    <P>In relation to increasing the number of live stock, the Minister's action in saving the lives&mdash;if I may put it that way&mdash;of the 80,000 calves that would have perished either by slaughter or disease has gone a long way towards bringing the live-stock population up to its present satisfactory level.  The Minister not alone saved the lives of those calves, but ensured they would fetch very good prices when they reached maturity as they are doing at the present day, by the foresight he showed in negotiating the 1948 agreement.</P>
    <P>I am in entire agreement with the Minister in his belief that the whole future of the cattle trade depends on the dual purpose Shorthorn cow.  To my mind, it is only through this type of animal that we can hope to maintain the foundation stock.  I am greatly afraid that in the not very distant future we will experience a very serious shortage of suitable store cattle and what is infinitely worse, a very serious shortage of suitable cows and heifers to breed that type of cattle.  I would ask the Minister to take serious notice of what is happening throughout the country regarding the breeding of cattle at present.</P>
    <P>The farmers, particularly the smaller farmers, are refusing point blank to bring their cows to Shorthorn bulls and it is very hard to blame them in view of the fact that a Shorthorn calf is worth at birth at least £5 less than an Aberdeen Angus or a Hereford crossed calf.  At two or two and a half years there is at least £10 or £15 difference in their values.  It is very hard to blame small farmers for breeding <Col N="136" /> the type of cattle that pays them best; at the same time I think it is definitely the duty of the Minister and the State to see that the foundation stock is preserved.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that every farmer under a certain valuation who breeds a Shorthorn calf should be paid a suitable subsidy to compensate him for any loss he may sustain by breeding that type of beast.  I would also suggest to the Minister that a number of farms should be acquired throughout the country by the Department and used for the sole purpose of breeding Shorthorn cattle, so that an adequate supply, if I may put it that way, of Shorthorn heifers would be available at all times.</P>
    <P>I do not think any Deputy who is a member of a county committee of agriculture and who has seen the advantages to be gained by having an expert technical adviser on agriculture, can sit down without saying a word or two about the parish plan.  I think this idea of putting within reach of every farmer a highly-qualified technical adviser is one that will be much appreciated and availed of by young farmers of the present time.  These young farmers are fully alive to the necessity of being educated in modern methods of agriculture.  They know it is only by having their soil tested, applying suitable manures, devising proper rotation of crops and by proper reseeding that they can hope to increase the output of their farms and in that way raise their standard of living and the standard of living of the country as a whole.  I think if those parish agents work in close co-operation with the county committees of agriculture and with our experienced officials they will play a very important part in greatly increasing agricultural output.</P>
    <P>In regard to the scheme for the eradication of bovine T.B. I would like to compliment the Minister on his efforts in that direction.  I would also like him to know that the farmers are fully alive to the necessity for such a scheme and that the faster he pushes on with it the better they will be pleased.  I think the Minister was very <Col N="137" /> well advised when he doubled the grants for farm-buildings to participants in this T.B. scheme because everybody, I think, will admit that proper housing is an important factor if we are to have healthy live-stock population.  I am also glad to know that participants in the T.B. scheme may now get grants for piped water supplies to their farms because every farmer will agree that a proper water supply is almost as important as proper housing if you are to keep live stock in condition.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to waste the time of the House discussing the merits or demerits of wheat-growing.  To my mind too much has already been said on that subject.  All I wish to say is this: nearly everybody agrees that we should not aim to produce a surplus of any commodity if we cannot export that surplus at a profit.  We now know we cannot export our surplus wheat at a profit and we have reached the stage when we had a surplus.  There was only one thing that any sane Minister or Government could do and that was to curtail the acreage under wheat.  There were two ways to do it and one was the sensible, obvious way of cutting the price.  The other&mdash;I do not know whether it would have been the Fianna Fáil way or not though they certainly objected to cutting the price&mdash;would be to put wheat on a quota basis and if the farmer grew an inch over his quota send in the inspectors.</P>

      <P>In County Dublin during last year tomato growers found that a disease came into their glass-houses and they are now anxious to have in the north and south of the county a research or soil-testing laboratory, if that is possible.  Their complaint is that when a disease comes either into the land or into the glass-houses, they have to send the soil away to be tested and while there are trained inspectors available there is nevertheless a long delay.  In County Dublin, as the Minister knows, they go in for a good deal of this work and I have been considering the problem for some time and I have discussed it with the people affected.</P>
      <P>I have been considering the matter for some time and I have discussed it with the people affected.  I wonder if the Minister would consider giving permission and a grant to county committees of agriculture to erect small soil-testing laboratories.  I understand that in Cork a number of enterprising farmers have already started and carried out such a scheme successfully. The big delay involved in soil-testing is in having to wait for the soil to come back and to find out whether it is the soil or the plant that is at fault.  That is especially so where glass-houses are concerned.  One man had four glass-houses which would cover, perhaps, half an acre of ground under glass.  The problem is serious and it can mean a big loss for people who are affected.</P>

      <P>I will, gladly.  I am just making the suggestion, through the Chair, that the Minister should consider the feasibility of a research laboratory or soil-testing station of that kind.  I understand that we are short of trained personnel to deal with this type of work.  On the subject of research to deal with all these classes of disease, I believe we could get over that difficulty possibly by giving more <Col N="139" /> power and more money to the county committees of agriculture.  Furthermore, it would be an opportunity of decentralising the work.  If you have trained personnel in different counties the farmers would become more interested in the scheme.  They would become more interested because they would have a research laboratory or a soil-testing station in their own county.</P>

      <P>Everybody else who spoke here to-night referred to the shortage of bacon in this country&mdash;and the Minister knows that very well. Another problem which has been mentioned is the number of people leaving the land.  That is a national problem but the Minister for Agriculture will have to give all possible encouragement to our tillage farmers and horticulturists and ensure that they get a market for their products or else the drain of people from the land will continue.  It is most essential to establish confidence in the minds of those people.  With these few remarks I will keep my word about being brief and sit down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkDeering" hpid="Mr. Deering Mr. Deering">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deering</NameTxt>
      <P>Excluding agriculture, the greatest heritage this country possesses is its green fields and its soil. <Col N="140" /> On its proper utilisation depends our whole national life.  The maintenance of financial stability should aid the programme of agricultural development. It has been established that good grass produces the greatest number of food units per acre and it is the only crop that raises soil fertility.  The farmyard plays an important part in live-stock production.  If we are to get rid of the little stagnation in Irish agriculture the State must invest a large sum in essential capital equipment.</P>
      <P>The Opposition are in a good mood about our export market.  Some of them referred to &ldquo;conversions&rdquo;.  I think the boot is rather more on the other foot and that they should think of their own conversion.  I remember &mdash;long before I came into this House, which is only two years ago&mdash;attending meetings at which people were told, when they asked what they would do with their cattle, to run them at point-to-point meetings.  I do not want to be uncharitable.  Some of the recent speeches reflected great Christian charity and I do not want to upset that.  The cattle-raising industry should be encouraged and it is being encouraged because of its round-the-year employment content by comparison with some of the other industries.</P>
      <P>With regard to wheat, I want to say that if it only put a stop to the gallop of the gentlemen who took considerable acres in Meath and Dublin and, when they had the crop sold, went to the Continent, then the action of the Minister was worth while.  They may be isolated cases but I know that they happened.  These gentlemen then went to Paris and Madrid and the only interest they had in cattle was in the bulls in the arenas there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are some small matters in connection with the land reclamation scheme that might be overlooked.  For instance, the big advantage in ground limestone is that it removes some of the hazards of a late harvest.  Possibly, that is not too well known.  The right quantity of lime encourages the ripening of crops anything from ten to 14 days earlier, other things being equal. Again, with regard to the land reclamation scheme&mdash;and this is where <Col N="141" /> the parish agent might work&mdash;I think that a plan of the scheme should be kept in the archives of the respective farmers' houses.  The drains have to be gone over after ten or 15 years and it would be very wise if succeeding generations knew the set-up and the plan.  A fairly decent plan is given but I do not think sufficient care is taken of it.</P>
    <P>I am a bit late in talking about pigs. There has been such a stir in the price of pigs that what I have to say now may be a bit late.  One of the leakages in the gap between the price of pigs to the producer and the price to the consumer is the fairly heavy transport costs involved.  I know cases where lorries have gone to small fairs, manned by two or three people and getting as few as a dozen pigs.  In addition you will get a private car, complete with chauffeur, with a head or boss coming down to see that everything is in order.  All told, there is nearly a man for every pig that is bought.  I want to refer to these things with regard to Wicklow because Wicklow bacon is just as famous as Wicklow rabbits and is in very great demand.  Coming after the two Deputies Burke, who promised to be short and sweet, I shall finish now by saying that this country and its farming are safe in the colourful and able hands of James Dillon.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. MacCarthy Mr. MacCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it would be a peculiar mentality that would approach a debate on agriculture with the idea that either the Minister for Agriculture or his Department will manage everything for everyone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Hear, hear!</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. MacCarthy Mr. MacCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>In the first place I would say that the people who make that approach do not understand the hard headed person they are dealing with in the Irish farmer who has, through the years, built up a tradition of husbandry which has become the basis of our national economy.  Changes of Government are inevitable in a democracy and the one disturbing thing is that even though a Minister cannot influence the whole scheme of <Col N="142" /> things throughout the whole country, he must at the same time remember that there are such things as differences in policy and plans and ideas and expressions and that the basic tenor of the agricultural community in some regions is so upset that you have shortages and surpluses, scarcities and high prices and all the rest following certain principles of policy.</P>
      <P>With such a variety of seasons as we have here, the productivity of crops alters from year to year as do their quality and we must be prepared for these things.  I presume it is part of the work of a Minister to try and provide in emergencies for the saving of crops as it is part of his duty to advise farmers on fertilising and growing and getting the best from their soil.</P>
      <P>When travelling throughout the country one cannot fail to notice that the amount of waste land is simply immense.  I do not think it would remain for long in any other country but until our drainage has got further ahead there is the difficulty sometimes of bringing about the reclamation which is so necessary and which one realises could so easily be done under normal conditions.  One thing that has emerged from this debate is, to my mind, that the industry must be dealt with on a regional basis&mdash;that what suits the west or the north west or the south west will not suit the Midlands, at least as far as the production of crops and the rearing of cattle are concerned.  So many different plans are advocated, and these have so many different purposes, that it is hard to come to a general national decision of the best type of beast to produce in the country, but if one considers it in regions one must consider the type of soil, marginal land and the type of beast best suited perhaps to the roughness of the region, to its climate and all the rest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On that basis one would be able to form some decision on the matter.  For instance beside the big cities like Dublin, Cork, Waterford, Limerick and Galway and in the Midlands where they finish off the stock that are produced in other parts of the country, <Col N="143" /> you must have the supporting dairying industry because otherwise you will not have the young stock and as the third last speaker said the number of cows in this country will go down.  If they go down the whole mixed dairy industry is in jeopardy.</P>
    <P>The same does not apply to the bacon or sheep industries nor does it to the poultry industry because on these matters there can be some kind of national system of production and marketing.  Very often we see fluctuations of prices occurring in these three industries.  That should not be so because if there is a proper scheme of production and marketing it would tend to bring about a certain stability in the industry which would provide against these fluctuations.  Also, you have people going around trying to turn the people of the cities against the country people on the question of prices, forgetting that they are interdependent&mdash;that what is produced on the land must have distributors and consumers in the cities and the towns, or, as an alternative, that in the cities must be produced some of the things needed in the country areas.</P>
    <P>But agriculture must be treated always as the basic industry and we should try and get more initiative, more co-operation and more capital into it so that there may be better production from the soil, more workers to produce it and, in consequence, more consumers and a better home market as well as a more profitable export market.  I would recommend to the Minister when he is setting about the establishment of the agricultural institute that he would not consider having just one central campus but that he would deal with the dairying area in one way, the small farmer out on the coast lines in another way and on a completely different basis so that we would not have in the institute just something that would suit the Midlands or Dublin but that the whole scheme would be one of encouraging our farmers to remain on their land and develop it in a way that will get the best out of the soil.  If we tackle the problem on these lines our economy will be founded on a firm basis.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="144" /> With regard to production from the soil I have often thought myself that we have two good men in this country, Lieutenant-General Costelloe and Mr. Todd Andrews.  General Costelloe has made a great job not only of the sugar beet industry but also of encouraging land reclamation.  Mr. Andrews has made a great success of turf production.  Both of these industries have been giving employment in the rural areas at a reasonable wage, even if that wage has not yet come up to what it is in other industries.  As time goes on, there will be more productivity in that way from the soil. Other countries have mineral deposits more readily available than they are in this country, but in this country peat and the fertility of the land can be the backbone of the national economy.</P>
    <P>Criticism is essential and the expression of opinions is useful, but criticism for the purpose of criticism is useless. It is wrong to adopt the attitude towards agriculture that one should disagree with a policy because it is being operated by one person, whereas one would agree with it if it were operated by another person.  We must try to get some stability in agriculture so that there will not be variations, which are so harmful.  The production of essential food for man and beast in this country should be our main objective. We should try to secure balanced employment so that people will not fly from the land.  Old muddy laneways into farmers' places should be improved. Everything should be done to brighten life for the small farmer and farm workers and they should be given a decent living on the soil of their own country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>I was glad to hear Deputy Giles on the Fine Gael side and Deputy J. Brennan on the Fianna Fáil side trying to advance the cause of the small uneconomic holder.  It is nice to think that in this House there are a few Deputies from the various sides of the House who appreciate the difficulty of the uneconomic holder and who are prepared to stand up here in his defence.  Far be it from me to doubt the sincerity of either of these gentlemen.  Knowing them as I do, I am satisfied that they are both very <Col N="145" /> sincere men and very honest in their approach, regardless of which side of the House they come from.</P>
      <P>I am also concerned with that problem as representing a constituency where there is a very considerable number of small landholders and where there is so much emigration. Emigration is one of the reasons why agricultural production in this country is so low.  We must appreciate that it is not the old people who are leaving. It is the youth who are leaving this country and that has its serious effect on agricultural production in general, on our total output of agricultural produce.</P>
      <P>The Minister in his opening remarks laid great emphasis on the importance of agriculture in the life of the nation. Many Deputies, perhaps with less emphasis, referred to the same matter. Agriculture, as the Minister and others have said, is the backbone of the country.</P>
      <P>The Minister invited criticism.  While I am prepared to compliment the Minister on the things he has achieved and on the many other things he has tried to achieve but perhaps has not achieved to the extent to which he would like, I feel that honest and constructive criticism is always useful. Therefore, I was glad to hear the Minister appealing for constructive criticism from either side of the House.</P>
      <P>Taking the debate by and large, the Minister has got that criticism.  Some of the criticism, as is inevitable, I suppose, was founded on the usual political basis but, in the main, there was quite an honest and sincere approach to the Estimate from both sides of the House and I am sure the Minister has listened carefully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This evening I listened to Deputy Childers.  I listened to practically the whole of his speech.  He made an exceptionally good argument and gave good honest criticism.  His speech was excellent.  I am not trying to defend Deputy Childers: he is well able to defend himself, but somebody suggested that he is not an agriculturist. From my knowledge of agriculture, I can say that Deputy Childers' speech on this Estimate was as good as, if not better than, most of the speeches and <Col N="146" /> that it was constructive.  The unfortunate thing is that you cannot always get that type of honest suggestion and criticism.  That tribute is due to Deputy Childers for his speech on agriculture this evening.</P>
    <P>The Minister has pointed to the fact that we have priced ourselves out of the British market and other markets in the matters of beef, mutton and other farm produce. Again going back to the problem of the small uneconomic holder, having regard to the fact that many holdings in the West of Ireland and in other parts of Ireland are small and uneconomic, rocky or, in other cases, waterlogged or overgrown with shrubbery, one can appreciate the difficulties of these holders.  Naturally, their costs of production are substantially higher than those of farmers on better lands, such as the counties from which Deputy Giles and other Deputies come.  Therefore, in the West of Ireland there is a very difficult problem.</P>
    <P>Although agricultural prices in the main have increased substantially for some years past, the people in these areas have not gained as a result of these increases.  When the people of Meath and Westmeath, Cork or elsewhere had thousands of pounds to collect on the sale of farm produce, in the form of beef or any other commodity, the people in the western districts did not share their prosperity.  There is one thing they did experience the same as every other citizen of the State&mdash; they had to bear the increased cost of living.</P>
    <P>One of the most serious things that have happened to the people of the West of Ireland was the fall in egg prices.  On this occasion that matter has not been made the political plaything that it has been made heretofore. It is a serious loss to our people in the West of Ireland that the price of eggs for the greater part of the year fell to £1 a 100, which is the present level and which is approximately what has been paid in the country areas.  Anyone who is conversant with conditions in the West of Ireland knows very well that eggs cannot be produced to-day at that figure, particularly when you consider that a large number of these <Col N="147" /> people depend on the local shop for the feeding stuffs for poultry.  Apart from egg production, the same argument can be advanced in respect of the price of table fowl.  The price is not sufficiently high to compensate these people for their labour and the money involved.</P>
    <P>In connection with the increased cost of production with which people in the congested areas are faced as compared with the people on the better land of this country, we should all appreciate that a man who has to go into the field with a spade or a loy&mdash;there are not many nowadays who are anxious to use these implements&mdash;has a substantially higher cost on his stuff than the man who can take out his tractor, his plough, and so on.  I feel we are faced with a serious problem in the congested areas and I was glad to hear Deputy Giles, Deputy Brennan and others acknowledge that fact.</P>
    <P>On the subject of egg production, I am speaking with some experience because I exported eggs for a long number of years from this country not alone to Great Britain but to continental countries.  I do not now engage in that line of business although I engage in business as an egg dealer.  However, I want to say this for the information of the House and for the Minister, that while I found that quite a number of people engaged on egg inspection, and that some people in Merrion Street, the head office of the Department of Agriculture, were conversant with this line of business, I did find sometimes a particular man who claimed to be an egg inspector and who was paid as an egg inspector was a person who was taken from the butter department and transferred to the egg department and perhaps <i>vice versa.</i></P>
    <P>People engaged in dairying have had the same experience.  Perhaps there is a seasonal falling off in egg production and inspectors are transferred from one department to another.  They would all be working under the Department of Agriculture but the majority of those engaged in the butter marketing business would not be conversant with the egg marketing side of it and you often found&mdash;I will <Col N="148" /> not say it was deliberate&mdash;a person engaged in the work of inspecting eggs, say, at Sligo or Westport, who knew precious little about it.  There is no doubt that the people exporting these commodities suffered as a result of this and the industry suffered also.</P>
    <P>It will be hard, unless something extraordinary happens, to get the egg industry back on it feet again having regard to the high cost of food production at home and the low prices prevailing outside the country.  I am saying that having had some practical experience of having exported to such countries as Spain and Germany in my time.  The world price of eggs seems to have fallen considerably and that is something in connection with which the city people might say: &ldquo;Thanks be to God, that is great.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As Deputy MacCarthy said a few minutes ago, it would be a good thing if the city people would appreciate that agriculture was the main industry of this country, that if any particular line of agricultural produce fell below the economic level that it was bad news for the country as a whole and that the pinch would be felt sooner or later by those people in the cities.  In his opening remarks the Minister pointed out, and laid stress on the fact, that industrialists should appreciate, as should professional people and other classes in the community, that the whole fabric of this State could only remain intact if the basic industry was to be successful and was to thrive.</P>
    <P>I do not think I have heard any Deputy referring to our potato industry and particularly to the question of the exportation of seed potatoes.  In my constituency a big percentage of our farmers engaged in that profitable business for a number of years.  In recent times the alcohol factory at Curroy, near Ballina, which was used for the manufacture of alcohol over a period, is now being changed to the production of glucose and steps are being taken at the present time in my constituency to change the variety of potatoes that are being grown by the farmers so as to encourage them to sell to the Curroy factory at a later date for the manufacture of glucose.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="149" /> Over a long period our farmers felt they had a serious complaint in regard to representation on the Potato Marketing Board and repeatedly brought it to the notice of successive Ministers for Agriculture, the former Minister, Deputy Walsh and, I think, on one occasion to the present Minister, Deputy Dillon.  It is very easy to make sweeping statements and to condemn people or condemn boards but what I did feel was wrong about the whole set-up of the Potato Marketing Board was that farmers had not sufficient representation on that board.</P>
    <P>The representation on that board was mainly given to the merchants and when the farmers sought representation and when they were told that they had one farmer on the board while there were four or five merchants, they felt there was something strange about the whole set-up and they were naturally suspicious of it.  In recent times I think the Department of Agriculture have yielded to a certain extent on that point and have given one other member to represent the farmers, but conduct such as that is not conducive to increased production of potatoes or anything else.  The people who are really competent, in my opinion, to be on that board and to have a majority of members are the producers.  I do not suggest that the merchants or the exporters should be denied representation on the board but they should not dominate it.  They may be all very nice men.  I am sure they were quite decent men selected for some very good reason. Nevertheless, it has had the effect of making the farmers believe that something strange is happening behind the scenes because they will not get proper representation.</P>
    <P>For a considerable time there was an organisation in existence here called Eggsports (Eire) Ltd.  They had their headquarters at 65 Lower Gardiner Street.  From my own personal experience I can say that they gave very good service to the nation.  That body was not established because the Irish people wanted it.  It was because there was a demand from across the water; His Majesty's Government was at war and naturally could not afford time to deal with individual exporters. <Col N="150" /> That body gave satisfaction to exporters and producers alike.  It was dissolved when the need for it no longer existed.  Eggs went on a free market and there was no longer any use for the organisation.  While that body was in existence egg prices remained high and the farmers were quite satisfied.</P>
    <P>This Potato Marketing Board is not giving the same satisfaction.  I suggest to the Minister there is one way in which he can help the people in the poorer areas, and I am thinking now not only of my own county but of Donegal and other counties as well.  I have heard those who represent the potato interests in Donegal making the same point.  I suggest to the Minister that he should go into the representation on the Potato Marketing Board with a view to giving the farmers the representation to which they are entitled on that board.  Naturally when the farmer sells his potatoes at £12 per ton and then reads in the papers that they are £24 a ton in England he is inclined to forget the overheads; he subtracts the £12 from the £24 and he decides that the other fellow has made at least £10 profit per ton.  Some information should be given to the farmers by way of tabulated statements setting out the different expenses.  Those tabular statements should be circulated through organisations like Macra na Feirme and Muintir na Tíre.  I think that would encourage the farmers to increase production because they would then realise they were not being done.</P>
    <P>With regard to the land project, I took what might be described as a political risk on one occasion.  Deputy Walsh, when he was Minister for Agriculture, increased the amount under the A. scheme by £10 per acre and I went into the Division Lobby with Fianna Fáil and voted for that.  I did that because I checked the figures of applications from my own county and I found that most of the people there were interested in the A. scheme as against the B. scheme.  Looking back now I am satisfied that while I did a lot of good to a number of people in my constituency, I may have done a little harm to others; but, of course, <Col N="151" /> the thing would have gone through no matter how I voted.</P>
    <P>However, one must take responsibility, and I am not introducing any apologetic note this evening; I take full responsibility for that stand. While I admit the Minister then gave increased benefits to the farmer who was prepared to do his own drainage, in reducing the ceiling figure of the B scheme, he certainly did more harm than good.  I have no doubt that he had the usual battle with the Department of Finance on that occasion.  The Department of Finance was concerned in the main with saving on a particular item in a particular Estimate, and I am sure they advanced every argument they could against increasing the figure.  To-day I can see the present Minister for Agriculture battling it out, too, and I know he has his own difficulties. That sort of thing will happen irrespective of what particular Government is in office.</P>
    <P>Looking back now, I think Deputy Walsh, as Minister for Agriculture, made a serious mistake when he reduced the maximum figure under the land project to £42 per acre in relation to the B scheme.  The present Minister has increased that sum but he has also done something upon which I cannot compliment him.  He has invited criticism and I am going to offer a little criticism here.  Like everybody else, I know he is not infallible and he cannot have it all his own way with the Department of Finance.  Deputy Beegan referred to the matter I am now going to raise and, perhaps when I add my weight to Deputy Beegan's appeal, if there is anything the Minister can do I am sure he will be both willing and anxious to do it.</P>
    <P>I understand that if the estimate exceeds a certain figure the farmer must then bear a percentage of the cost. Probably that is the reason why Deputy Beegan was so much concerned about this because he is a westener, and it is there that we will be faced with the particular problem.  We have very poor land in the West.  I ask the Minister who will be the loser under this?  The Minister has improved the scheme substantially but I am disappointed <Col N="152" /> to a degree because our people will now have to bear a certain proportion of the extra cost if the estimate exceeds a certain figure.  In the main the estimates in our area will be higher than those in counties like Westmeath and so forth, where the land is better.  Land in Meath, for instance, can be done at £20 per acre. Land in Mayo will cost £60 per acre, and if Farmer Brown wants to get his few acres done under the B scheme, he will be faced with the problem of meeting a certain proportion of the cost.  That will place him at a disadvantage.</P>
    <P>I bring this matter to the Minister's notice because I appreciate that he has the courage and the foresight to initiate a scheme such as this.  He has admitted that mistakes were made under the land project scheme even in his own time.  With the passage of time he hopes those mistakes will be corrected.  I consider that the present position is placing our people at a serious disadvantage in the West of Ireland in so far as land reclamation work is concerned.  It must be appreciated that this land reclamation is most important because it will have the effect ultimately of increasing the national income.  It provides what our people badly need in the West of Ireland.  It provides a week's wages for the sons of small farmers.  On Saturday night the housewife has a wage packet holding £5 or £6 and she can go down to the local shop and provide the ready cash to meet the necessaries of life.  Sales of cattle are so small on these small holdings that it is impossible for these people to exist during the period when they have nothing else to fall back upon, and that period sometimes lasts for three or six months.  That is why I consider these schemes of such vital importance to our people.</P>
    <P>The Minister has asked for criticism of the operations of the scheme and I offer that little bit in relation to the land project scheme.  I realise there will be certain obstacles in the way but the Minister is a strong man and I am sure he will be able to crush those obstacles and get over the difficulties.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="153" /> There is another matter that I come up against in my travels around the country.  I have heard reports from land project contractors in different parts of Ireland, men who have engaged in land project work in one part of the country or another, in Mayo, Meath or Kildare, all around about as some of these moved from one place to another.  I have made it my business to discuss with these people their problems. I had some personal experience of land reclamation going back long before the present Minister or any other Minister offered 1/- for doing that work because my family were evicted into a mountain holding and my late father and myself often carried out reclamation work without 1/- payment, so that I have some experience about particular land work.  For that reason, I am always happy to discuss such undertakings with land project contractors now.  Of course there are many aids available to people nowadays such as bulldozers, explosives like gelignite and many other things that were unknown in the olden days.</P>
    <P>These land project contractors have expressed the opinion that the district officer in such a county was much easier to get on with than the district officer in certain other counties.  One might be prepared to let them get away with a certain bore of pipes and overlook a lot of things, while another would be very strict as to the class of work he would want.  I have a suspicion, and my suspicion is strongly founded, that there is a racket in this work both in the time of the present Minister and in the time of the previous Minister.  It is hard to track these things down.  Take the case of a man who undertakes 30 or 40 or 50 acres of land under scheme B&mdash;that is the Department of Agriculture offers that land to the contractor&mdash;and who decides he is going to get all that work and get hold of his cheque as quickly as possible.  It may be down a long byroad quite a distance from the head office of the Department and he knows very well that between them the land project contractor and the district officer can bring off a deal and get over the work pretty easily.</P>
    <P>I do not like to suggest that anybody <Col N="154" /> is dishonest, but I have been told in certain parts of this country a good deal of work being done under the land project is not being done as it should be done and there are strong suspicions that some of our officers are not entirely blameless on this score.  I would suggest that the matter be given serious consideration.  It is a serious thing because, quite apart from the money involved, which is not the point, if an attempt is made on the part of some land project contractor to do 30 acres of land in a slipshod way, it is not a matter of just the amount of money but also of the loss in production to individual farmers and to the country as a whole if that class of work is to be allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>I am deliberately saying this in the House so that it will be published and so that these people concerned will know that we have discussed it here and it will serve as a warning to them. So far as I am concerned, if I got concrete proof of it I would have no hesitation in telephoning to the Minister or a senior officer of his Department, because no matter who is Minister for Agriculture if we fail in our duty in these matters we are failing in a very serious way.  I refer to them&mdash;I have not invented these things&mdash;because I have very strong suspicions, but one knows how slow people are to come forward and give information on such subjects.</P>
    <P>Another matter in connection with the land project is this: I raised this matter in the Dáil recently and I can assure you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, that I shall not dwell on it at any great length.  We have a big deposit, as the Minister for Industry and Commerce admitted, of clay suitable for the manufacture of drainage pipes.  I am not making this speech on Industry and Commerce but I do want to say that our people are faced with increased charges for clay pipes, and for concrete pipes, but particularly for clay pipes, in connection with land project drainage work.  I think the figure is something like £4 10s. per 1,000 over the figure in adjoining counties.  That is a serious handicap to our people.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="155" /> It will be appreciated that concrete pipes, while they are made in Ballina &mdash;which is adjacent to us&mdash;in certain cases in such work these pipes are not always suitable, as, if you have too much acid in the land the concrete is known to decay in the ground after a long period.  But I have this on the most reliable authority that the clay to which I am referring was tested across the water and subjected to pressure and other tests and proved absolutely suitable for the manufacture of clay pipes.  If there is anything the Minister could do through his Department to make it possible for this deposit to be used I think it would be a very desirable step to take and would have the effect of reducing the cost per acre of land reclaimed under his Department.</P>
    <P>I shall say a word on soil testing. Deputy Childers spoke at length on that subject to-night and I was really delighted to hear his speech on that although he was described as a non-agriculturist. He certainly spoke with as much knowledge of agriculture as anybody else.  He referred to soil testing and my experience is that quite a lot of our farmers here, particularly the small farmers, who have rightly been described by Deputies in this House as the backbone of this country, are in the position that although they know their soil is deficient in something, they do not know what that something is.  What they do in most cases is put down a crop in the spring adding phosphate where lime is needed, or <i>vice versa.</i>  They take a shot in the dark and put perhaps barley where oats should be.</P>
    <P>It is a serious thing from the national point of view that farmers should be carrying out their work in a haphazard fashion like that.  I am not reflecting on the farmers.  We have had over 30 years of native Government now and we seem to be advancing and progressing but it is a rather bad business if you have such a state of affairs here that while it is vitally important that farmers should know what their soil is suitable for, they have no means of testing the soil within a reasonable time.  Admittedly, <Col N="156" /> samples of soil have been taken due to the efforts of the county committees of agriculture or the Department of Agriculture, but if one sends away a sample of soil to Johnstown Castle it is ten or 11 months afterwards before one hears about it or what should be applied to it&mdash;it is just a waste of time.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Burke who mentioned that there should be regional soil-testing stations.  Even if they are not the last word in accuracy if we got a reasonably good test it would be a help to our farmers and would indicate to them whether field A was suitable for barley and field B for potatoes and so on.  I think it would tend to increase production, which should be the aim of everybody.  To judge by the speeches made here, one would get the impression that everybody is all out to obtain increased production.  In my view, if we adopt these methods they will tend to increase it.</P>
    <P>Another matter which, perhaps, might be more relevant on the Estimate for the Department of Education concerns the desirability of laying an emphasis in our rural schools on the importance of agriculture.  In my view it would be a good thing, even in the text-books, to bring out the importance of agriculture.  I know that teachers have to work to a programme but I think that if more emphasis were laid on agricultural life it might do our young boys and girls in the country a lot more good than some of the things which they are now learning at school and which do not come in useful to them afterwards.  In particular, I think it would be a wise step to lay an emphasis in the higher classes on the importance of agriculture.</P>
    <P>I come now to the subject of pig prices.  To-day, bacon pigs are worth roughly £10 a cwt., live weight.  That is what the suitable type of pig will fetch.  Only a short while ago, the same type of pig was worth only £8&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>A couple of months ago, small pigs in my home town of Foxford fetched only £3 or £4 each.  On the other hand, a couple of days ago they fetched as much as £7 each.  I admit that the same uncertainty in regard to prices obtained under previous Governments and that it seems to be a thing which it is difficult to get rid of.</P>
      <P>I do not know how to solve the problem but it would be well if the Minister would take steps to try and cope with it.  I believe it would benefit the whole pig industry, which is a vital factor to the agricultural economy in the West of Ireland.  The small landowner depends on the money he receives for his pigs to pay his rates and his taxes, to buy shoes and clothing for his children, and so forth.  When they are forced out of the production of things which are part of their economy, it is no wonder that they leave the country and seek a livelihood elsewhere.</P>
      <P>It is no wonder that our young boys and girls go to Britain and America and Canada to seek a livelihood, perhaps never to return again, when they have nothing but an uncertain way of living at home.  I do not suggest that, by coping with the prices problem, the Minister would cure for all time the flight from the land but certainly it would remedy that problem, too, to some extent.  The Minister is an active, able and energetic man and I hope he will deal with this matter of fluctuating prices now&mdash;a matter which should have been taken in hands many years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been much talk of the parish plan.  Rumour has it that a new parish agent will operate from Merrion Street in Dublin.  I appreciate that the Minister is trying to do his best to make available to our agricultural <Col N="158" /> community, through the parish plan, the best advice they require.  However, the Minister should realise that if the parish plan is to be operated from Dublin or from an address in Merrion Street our farmers will look on it with suspicion from the very outset.  As well as being Minister for Agriculture, the Minister is a rural Deputy and I am sure he must be aware of the truth of what I am saying.  For instance, if a parish agent comes along to a farmer in my county and tells the farmer that he is from Merrion Street, Dublin, or that he is operating under the Department of Agriculture in Dublin, he will be looked on with suspicion.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the scheme be operated through the county committees of agriculture.  I am chairman of the Mayo County Committee of Agriculture.  While I realise that things are not, perhaps, always as good as we should like them to be in our county committees of agriculture, I believe they have done a very good and useful job down through the years. Frequently they succeed where the Department of Agriculture have failed &mdash;principally, as I have already said, because our people have the traditional outlook that anything that comes from the Government must be regarded with a certain amount of suspicion.  The county committees of agriculture have succeeded to a great extent in breaking down that type of attitude and, in the main, our farmers are now willing and eager to learn&mdash;and they have learned a lot through our county committees of agriculture.</P>
    <P>It can truthfully be said that county committees of agriculture, which represent the voice of people elected to county councils, are very important and it would be wrong to operate the parish plan from Merrion Street. Furthermore, if the plan is operated from Merrion Street we shall have two sets of agricultural advisers in each county.  One group would be working under the county committee of agriculture&mdash;that is, unless they are abolished and I should not like to see that happen&mdash;and the second group would work under the Department of Agriculture. I submit that there would be a conflict between the two groups and <Col N="159" /> I fear that things would be much worse than they are at the moment.  While the man coming from Merrion Street would know as much, perhaps, as the man working under our own county committee of agriculture, it is obvious that friction would be bound to occur and that difficulties would arise.  I am afraid, also, that men might come to each county and be unaware of the habits and customs of the people in the difficult localities and that they might not appreciate the different types of difficulties in each locality.</P>
    <P>In the course of this debate, some Deputies suggested the zoning of agriculture. I think it was Deputy MacCarthy who suggested the zoning of certain areas as milk areas, other <Col N="160" /> areas as grain-growing areas, and so forth.  If a representative of the Department of Agriculture who was conversant with milk and dairying came into a part of the country such as mine he would find himself up against a certain mentality and our farmers, once they found that the man had a certain leaning towards milk production, would object to him and would not co-operate with him.  I do not think that much progress could be made in such circumstances.  I move to report progress.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 26th May, 1955.</P>
