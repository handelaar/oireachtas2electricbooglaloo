    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether it is the policy of the Government to transfer certain powers and functions at present administered by civil servants to existing local authorities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the Deputy's question arises out of a public statement by the Attorney-General containing an expression of opinion in favour of increasing the powers of the elected members of local authorities. This was envisaged in the statement of policy issued shortly before the Government took office in June last, one of the points of which was: &ldquo;To restore democratic rights in respect of local government by amending the County Management Acts and giving to local authorities greater autonomy and effective power in local affairs.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Taoiseach's reply, the specific point in the question had to deal with decentralisation, and is the Taoiseach aware that the Attorney-General made the statement at a Fine Gael regional conference in Sligo in September last that decentralisation did not mean the transfer of civil servants to provincial towns, but that it did mean the transfer of functions from Government <Col N="164" /> Departments to be exercised locally? The question, which incidentally suffered very badly by the application of Standing Orders Nos. 31 and 32, did not enable me to put the matter in the form in which it was intended.  Would the Taoiseach say that the statement on decentralisation as made by the Attorney-General represents Government policy on this subject?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The reply, I think, has answered that question, and as regards the suffering of the Deputy's question by the application of Standing Orders, my reply refers to the Attorney-General's statement&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will state (1) the quantity in tons and the average c.i.f. price per ton of maize corn and feeding barley respectively, imported in 1954, and (2) the average price per ton charged by millers for maize and barley meal in 1954.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>During the year 1954 there were imported 170,477 tons of maize of which the average c.i.f. price was £25 1s. per ton.

    <Title>Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Irish Tanners, Limited.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOrmonde" hpid="Mr. Ormonde Mr. Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware of the very serious position of Irish Tanners, Limited, Portlaw, where some 250 employees, who have been employed on only three days per week since June, 1954, are now faced with a complete cessation of production necessitating their total disemployment; and that this position has been very largely created by the importation of synthetic substitute soling materials which has seriously affected the output of heavy sole leather in which Irish Tanners, Limited, Portlaw, specialises; and, if so, if he will take such steps as will enable this company to continue in production and thus secure to the inhabitants of Portlaw and surrounding districts their only means of livelihood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the position referred to by the Deputy and its effects on the employment position in the tannery mentioned in the question is a matter of grave concern to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent years there has been a serious decline in the demand for heavy sole leather on both the home and export markets.  The increased <Col N="167" /> use of synthetic soling materials has contributed to this decline but there have also been other causes, notably the use of natural rubber as a soling material and the considerable increase in the use of rubber footwear.  This trend is world wide and I understand that tanneries in other countries have had to face similar difficulties.</P>
    <P>I am at present considering whether there are any steps which I can take to help in this very difficult situation but I fear that any action which it may be open to me to take would, at best, do no more than offer partial and perhaps temporary relief.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOrmonde" hpid="Mr. Ormonde Mr. Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister state why, in view of the fact that the biggest factory of its kind in the country is about to close down due to lack of orders and over-production, he is now establishing a somewhat similar factory in another southern town?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that this factory has been in difficulties since April of last year when, as the Deputy knows, its workers were put on half-time.  There are a lot of factors impacting on this particular tannery and I do not think we will help the object I want to serve, and which I hope the Deputy also wants to serve, by discussing its affairs here.  This factory previously had a substantial export trade; it now has virtually no export trade.  The use of rubber and synthetic soling materials has increased from about 14 per cent. in 1942 to 37 per cent. in 1954.  The same trend has manifested itself in many other countries.  In addition to that, this company at one stage had a considerable market for its goods.  At that time, however, two other important tanneries were not in production to the same extent as they are to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are only some of the difficulties which one encounters in dealing with this problem and, in attempting a solution of it, one must try to balance employment in the tannery with employment in the boot factories which engage in the production of boots and shoes with synthetic soling materials. I can assure the Deputy that this <Col N="168" /> matter is having my most earnest attention and anything I can do to provide a solution for this difficult problem I shall be only too glad to do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOrmonde" hpid="Mr. Ormonde Mr. Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister realise this is a matter of immediate urgency to the employees of this tannery?  These have been on unemployment benefit now for three days every week for practically the last 12 months.  When they come to be totally disemployed in the course of a couple of weeks they will be excluded from unemployment benefit and will be entirely dependent on home assistance or unemployment assistance.  They, and some thousand dependents, are awaiting an immediate solution of this problem.  In view of that, would the Minister not undertake some immediate action, even if only of a temporary nature, to get them out of their difficulties?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish I could find the remedy with the simple ease that the Deputy would suggest.  It is an extremely difficult problem.  From the over-all point of view there is little use in retaining workers in employment in one factory if, by doing so, one is going to put employees out of employment in another factory.  It has to be recognised in all this business that public taste in the matter of footwear has changed considerably.  Tanners ought to have recognised that long before now, and they certainly ought to recognise it now.  As the Deputy may be aware, the heavy boot trade is not the same to-day as it was ten, 15 or 20 years ago.  The increasing use of rubber-soled footwear and Wellington boots has dealt a pretty heavy blow to the production of the type of leather produced at Portlaw, and may well have a similar effect on other tanneries in the future.  That is due to public taste.  In the United States it is estimated that nearly 60 per cent. of the footwear produced is soled with rubber or substitute rubber soling.  A similar situation exists in Britain and in continental countries, in which we have made inquiries, and these are difficulties which cannot be solved by tanners burying their heads in the sand.</P>

The following particulars may, however, be sufficient for the Deputy's purpose: expenditure incurred in connection with An Tóstal 1953 by An Bord Fáilte was £30,000; by Fógra Fáilte was £47,000 and by the Office of Public Works £2,650.  Corresponding expenditure in connection with An Tóstal, 1954, was £57,000 by An Bord Fáilte; £24,000 by Fógra Fáilte and £3,700 by the Office of Public Works.</P>
      <P>For 1955, the expenditure is estimated at £30,000 in the case of An Bord Fáilte, £2,700 in the case of Fógra Fáilte and £500 in the case of the Office of Public Works.  In addition, the Fógra Fáilte advertising campaigns in Britain and the United States of America this spring, at an estimated cost of £36,000, will specially feature An Tóstal.</P>

      <P>I fully appreciate that there are many land-holders who are at or slightly above what is regarded as economic standard and who are anxious to increase the size of their holdings.  I also realise that the Land Commission's standard holding is necessarily of modest size as the supply of land available for allotment is strictly limited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There can be divergent views about the size of an economic holding but the amount of congestion still to be dealt with and the limited quantity of land available inevitably forces the Land Commission to confine themselves to the building up of small-holdings to <Col N="180" /> the minimum standard which will enable a family to derive a decent livelihood from the land.</P>
    <P>In the prevailing circumstances the primary function of the Land Commission is and must remain the relief of congestion and it is clear that those who are on the land in an uneconomic way must be regarded as having first claim on the resources of the Land Commission.  The Deputy will appreciate the formidable task confronting the Land Commission in their endeavour to secure that small-holdings are brought up to the level of compact economic units.  In giving these small-holdings priority the Land Commission are doing no more than concentrating their resources and staff on putting first things first.  To do otherwise would only dissipate effort and retard progress all round.</P>
    <P>For these reasons I cannot adopt the proposal in the question while the problem of congestion remains so acute.</P>
    <P>No doubt the Deputy is aware that the Agricultural Credit Corporation make advances in certain types of cases.</P>

    <P>On assuming office last year I arranged for a review by the Ministers concerned of all proposals for grants out of the National Development Fund made before 2nd June, 1954.  As a result of that review, the following adjustments fall to be made in the above statement of schemes approved prior to that date: No. 1 &mdash; has been reduced by £400,000; No. 5 &mdash; for the time being, the cost of the survey only, estimated at £1,500, is accepted as a charge against the fund; No. 6 &mdash; has been abandoned; No. 9 &mdash; abandoned so far as concerns sheep (to cost £8,000): for a pig progeny testing station £33,000 (net) has been allocated; No. 10 &mdash; is being reconsidered; No. 12 &mdash; has been deferred; No. 14 &mdash; is being reconsidered; No. 15 &mdash; only £423,000 has so far been allocated to the revised areas selected for the scheme.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="192" /> Furthermore, the allocation for No. 3 has been reduced to £400,000 consequential on the harbour commissioners modifying their original scheme.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he will introduce proposals for legislation to facilitate local authorities in preparing schemes for the building of a more expensive type of house with a view to meeting the requirements of persons living in the country who are willing to pay the economic rent for such houses and to improving the appearance of small towns and villages.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The legislative proposals suggested are not necessary.</P>
      <P>Housing authorities are already empowered by Sections 31 and 35 of the Housing (Amendment) Act, 1952, to provide better class houses for sale or lease to persons irrespective of whether or not they are members of the working classes or agricultural labourers.  Capital grants for this purpose are available to housing authorities under Section 24 of the same Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that it was to villages I was referring and not to the bigger towns?  And is it a fact that the local councils can build better-class houses in those villages? Is the Minister aware that a number of our villages are eyesores <Col N="195" /> and that there is always a group of 12 or 15 men who would avail of better houses in these places?  Is he not aware that the ordinary person has no hope of acquiring a site in these villages and that only the local authorities can do so?  In view of that, would he take steps to have the local authorities take over those derelict sites and eyesores and build better-class houses and so improve the appearance of these villages?</P>

      <P>I have seen newspaper reports of statements made yesterday in the Six-County Parliament by Mr. Hanna, Minister of Home Affairs.  Having admitted that it is with his approval and on the authority of his Government that the lives of innocent wayfarers are placed at the mercy of armed, undisciplined youths, who are let loose by night on the roads of the Six Counties, his attempt to rid himself and his Government of responsibility, and to cast it on the Government of Ireland, for the conditions that caused the recent tragedy can only be described as undignified and absurd. The intention, which he has indicated, of persisting in a course that has already caused the loss of one innocent <Col N="198" /> life, and personal injury to others, cannot fail to shock impartial public opinion.</P>
      <P>The actions of the Six-County Government have created danger enough.  It is the duty of all of us here, Government, public representatives and people, to refrain from any words or acts that would make a bad situation worse.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Corish) Brendan Corish">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Corish)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer to some remarks that were made yesterday and that need correction.  It was alleged that there was a substantial increase in the number of claimants for unemployment benefit.  I want to correct that allegation by giving the figures for the 26th February this year and for the 26th February last year.  The numbers who were claimants for unemployment benefit on the 26th February this year were 40,127; on the 26th February last year the numbers were 39,679.  I do not think anybody will say there is any substantial difference in those two figures.  On the 28th February, 1953, there were 55,421 claimants for unemployment benefit, but in view of the fact that the Social Welfare Act in respect of unemployment benefit did not come into operation until the 1st January, 1953, the figure of 55,421 claimants for unemployment benefit is not really comparable with the figures for similar periods in 1954 and 1955.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In any event I fail to appreciate what case is being made when one has reference to the numbers who are claimants for unemployment benefit. The complaint by the Opposition is that this figure has substantially increased. As I have shown, it has not but if a certain regulation that was made by the then Minister for Social Welfare in the last Government had been put into operation the numbers who claimed for unemployment benefit would be substantially lower.  This particular regulation was designed either to make a reduction or throw approximately 12,000 people off unemployment benefit to unemployment assistance.  That regulation was changed a few days after the formation of the present Government. <Col N="200" /> As I said before, it meant a reduction or a toal disallowance in respect of 12,000 claimants for unemployment benefit.  But I do not think these figures are as important as the over-all figures for unemployment.</P>
    <P>Many statements were made here yesterday with regard to promises and guarantees in respect of employment. It was alleged by the Leader of the Opposition that statements to the effect that unemployment could be cured in 24 hours were made either by members of this Government or members supporting it.  As I said last night, I do not think there is much use in going back to throw into the face of our opponents certain of these allegations.  We all may be guilty of giving certain guarantees and making certain promises, but it ill becomes the Leader of the Opposition to throw such statements across this House when we remember that on one very famous occasion he said, as a Government, the Fianna Fáil Party would stand or fall on their ability to solve the unemployment problem.  I do not think they did that during their 16 years.  I do not think even in their whole 16 or 19 years there was any substantial reduction in the figures for unemployed in the country.</P>
    <P>I am not alleging that at the present day the figures for unemployment are satisfactory.  They are far from satisfactory, but it is heartening to know that the latest figures available show that at the present time the unemployment figures are the lowest that have been recorded for the past four years. That, in itself, is a heartening sign and the reduction compared to last year shows a downward trend as far as unemployment is concerned.  We have, it is true, 72,000 odd unemployed.  Last year at the same time we had 77,000 unemployed.  At a similar period in 1953 we nearly reached a record inasmuch as we had practically 90,000 people unemployed and even the year before that there were 73,000 unemployed. Therefore, I say it is a heartening sign that the latest figures available show that unemployment is at the lowest it has been in the last four years.  This Government's 12-point <Col N="201" /> programme is designed to increase further that figure.</P>
    <P>I explained last night in respect of the different Estimates that whilst economies have been effected, not for the sake of economy, these economies, or cuts as they have been described, did nothing to reduce employment or to cut any of the services.  I do not think it can be challenged, as far as health services are concerned, that more will be spent this year than was spent in the past year.  The other services that are legislated for under the Health Act of 1953 will be implemented this year.  As I said last year, what we are interested in is not so much health services on paper, but health services in operation.  That we are determined to have.</P>
    <P>As far as the other Votes are concerned there are no cuts, and I do not think anybody can point out any cuts or decreases which will have an effect on employment.  As a matter of fact, the general Government policy has been designed in order to ensure that many of the tens of thousands who are now unfortunately unemployed will be provided with work as soon as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is well that it should be pointed out that not alone the completely unemployed, but the partially or the under-unemployed were, for the first time, given official notice that there was a register prepared for them after Fianna Fáil came into office in 1932.  Before or about the time Fianna Fáil assumed office those industrially unemployed were the only class entitled to register at the time. The number was in or around 50,000. It is not true to say that large strides have not been made in dealing with that problem.  We know that under the development of industry before the war the round figure of 100,000 people formed the new insurable jobs, and if that had not taken place that 100,000 could be added to the 50,000 whom we found on the register when we came into office in 1932, making a figure of 150,000 who, of those industrially classified, would be unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="202" /> There is one significant fact about the reduction of the under-employment, and it is this: that the direct cause of the reduction of this figure has been the bringing in of a National Development Fund.  It is the unemployed, then, who benefited directly from the expenditure out of that fund.  In fact, it was for that type of unemployment that the fund was brought in.  We have figures to-day which show that that result was achieved.  The Minister took me to task because I was not prepared to accept that a similar improvement in the industrially unemployed took place since the change of Government last June.  The Minister gave me a figure, in particular, which I gather he chose because it was suitable to his point of view.</P>
    <P>From recollection, I made reference to a number of leaflets which were issued &mdash; we get them once a week or once a fortnight &mdash; and which did not show any such trend.  I think it is no harm to remind the Minister that, when the Coalition Government came into office in 1948, a similar trend showed itself in industry; that industry for some reason or other showed a nervousness which was reflected in reduced employment.  When the materials for industry became available after the war, about 1945, the statistics show that there was a progressive increase of 3,000 in insurable employment each half-year.  For the first year the Coalition were in office that figure was wiped out.  I contend that that phenomenon reproduced itself again on the coming into office of the Coalition Government, but Irish industry has been given such a fine momentum under the direction and aegis of the former Tánaiste that it is not easy to check it for very long.</P>
    <P>What I want to ask the Minister is this: Can he not get in simple language a statement as to what is the position of the national finances, seeing he is so interested in comparing his achievement with that of his predecessor? I would refer him to a newspaper which is not favourable to this side of the House.  In its issue of the 5th March the <i>Irish Independent</i> gives a treble column head indicating that <Col N="203" /> there had been a drop of £2,700,000 in the Estimates.  Then it gives us another figure that the decrease was £7,000,000.  On that particular page, the paper more or less walks in joy with the Minister in doing a little bit of bragging.  On another page the heading of the leading article is &ldquo;A Grave Disappointment&rdquo;.  Surely the Minister cannot be too touchy about criticisms from this side of the House when an organ like the <i>Independent</i> castigates him on the handling of the national finances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary must have taken notice of the very strong contrast which was obvious to the most uninformed on public finances in two consecutive pages of this paper.  I should like the Minister to indicate &mdash; he has <Col N="205" /> been making comparisons between this £7,000,000 of a supposed decrease between the total Estimates for the current year now coming to an end and the coming year &mdash; that this Book of Estimates takes in a number of Supplementary Estimates which were introduced after the Fianna Fáil Government left office.  In other words they were introduced by the Ministers of the present Government.  They are adding these now, which seems to me an extraordinary piece of arithmetics for the purpose of making political capital.  They are adding these Supplementary Estimates, which they themselves introduced, to the figures which Fianna Fáil produced in the Book of Estimates last year, and deducting from that the figure which has now been presented to us for the coming year, and saying to the public &mdash; at least this paper says &mdash; that there is a decrease of £7,000,000 produced by the present Minister for Finance between the Fianna Fáil bill for 1954-55 and the Coalition bill for 1955-56.  That, on the face of it, is completely dishonest.</P>
      <P>The Minister himself has taken these Supplementary Estimates and has deducted from them the sum of £3,000,000 for the National Development Fund and he gives us a figure then of £2,774,000, which is the difference between the two books as introduced &mdash;last year's and this year's &mdash; and adds to that difference the total of these supplementaries of over £2,000,000, and gives us a still further £5,483,000 as being the difference between the figures for the two years.  There is one thing at any event which I think ought to be referred to here.  We agree that any figure of a capital nature, such as the National Development Fund, can properly be extracted and not taken into this comparison, but we have had an announcement from the secretary of the Congress of Irish Unions, made on the authority of the Minister for Social Welfare, that there is to be an increase in old age and blind pensions, and I think the Minister himself has referred to that statement as being correct and that there is to be an increase in these allowances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>The most publicised information about that point was the reference made to it by the secretary of the Congress of Irish Unions.  The usual figure of social welfare benefits since the 1952 Social Welfare Act was brought in is 24/- a week.  We know that cases happen where people in receipt of that figure of weekly benefits, when they reach the age of 70, find themselves reduced to a non-contributory old age pension of 21/6 a week and I take it that the Minister for Social Welfare will correct that anomaly in the new scale of benefits which he intends to bring in.  It seems to me, taking a rough calculation on the figures which already apply to this service, that the Minister cannot make a lesser amount available than £1,000,000 annually to meet this increase. That figure of £1,000,000 has not been included by the Minister in his supply services for 1955-56, and the Minister had also given us a figure of £2,200,000 as being the figure necessary to keep the price of tea at its present level.  Nobody will claim that the increase in old age and blind pensions, and the amount required to stabilise the price of tea, is a capital item; and surely nobody making up a Budget for any purpose &mdash; for the whole nation or the private business &mdash; would take account of items of this sort in current expenditure.</P>
      <P>The ordinary man who reads the news or who takes any interest at all in public finances will add these two sums to the figure the Minister has given &mdash; the two sums being £1,000,000 for the increase in old age pensions and £2,200,000 which the Minister has mentioned as the sum necessary to stabilise the price of tea for 12 months &mdash;and is entitled to add these sums to the figure which the Minister has given us for the year of £105,500,000.  Is it not quite clear that these two items, which should properly be brought into the year's accounts, will mean, in fact, an increase of £2,000,000 over the sum for last year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole discussion on this Vote <Col N="207" /> on Account has been rendered somewhat unreal by reason of the Minister's introductory statement.  He said nobody can jump to a conclusion &mdash; to any final or firm conclusion &mdash; on the Book of Estimates at the moment, that other information will have to be made available at the end of the financial year before anybody can form a firm opinion of what the financial position will be in the new financial year.  At the close of his remarks I think he made a similar statement and in between these two statements, which he erected as a signpost with red lights on them, he developed an argument which must be of very doubtful value in view of the warnings which he later issued that it was impossible to form an opinion of the financial position until the final figures were available.</P>
    <P>We think that the method by which the Minister has sought to prove that his financing is wiser and his schemes better designed to serve the public good does not bear a close examination. The 1952 Budget which was denounced as a savage Budget, is still very largely effective to-day; it is that Budget that is still providing the taxation from which the Minister is procuring the funds necessary for his purposes.</P>
    <P>We were asked what we would do in relation to rising tea prices, in relation to food subsidies, etc.  I think the reply to that question has already been given by this Government.  The Minister made the extraordinary statement that by the reduction of food subsidies we, in fact, actually put up the cost of government.  Now we may not be well schooled in public finance but it requires a good deal of credulity to swallow the statement that the reduction in subsidies actually put up the cost of government.  Certainly I cannot follow the line of reasoning the Minister adduces to bring that point home.</P>
    <P>We feel it is neither a fair nor an equitable distribution of the burden to reduce the incomes of people earning something below £500 or £600 per annum who are engaged in agriculture. We do not think it is fair that their subsidy on wheat should be reduced <Col N="208" /> and that large incomes should be increased at their expense.  I know that the increase in these incomes was brought into force by Fianna Fáil and that the difference in our treatment and the subsequent treatment by the Coalition amounts to a specific lump sum; not alone is that lump sum being obtained by a reduction in the subsidies and one payment made to honour the Coalition's obligation but the reduction will be a permanent one; this reduction of the farmer's income will continue from year to year.</P>
    <P>Is it fair that the price of tea should be stabilised irrespective of income? Is it fair that those with an income of £1,000 a year, and upwards, should have the benefit of stabilised tea prices and reduced butter prices at the expense of the primary producer who kept us going during the war years? If a case can be made for these groups of public servants above a certain salary level how is it there is such delay in meeting the case of the milk suppliers, who say they are producing milk below cost?  It has to be remembered, too, that the report of the commission set up to inquire into that matter has not been published.  How is it there is always a bias against the agricultural section of the community, delay, hesitation and prevarication when it comes to dealing with their claims and such alacrity in dealing with urban claims?</P>
    <P>We on this side of the House have never attempted to drop a curtain between any sections of our people. We have never discriminated between the town and the country.  I think we proved that after the war, and even in the 1952 Budget which was denounced so roundly.  We stated our policy.  We said that in the main subsidies were a war-time measure, a device for meeting changes over which the Government had no control.  When, however, Government gets back some degree of control in economic affairs one tries to apply those controls in a way which will be fair all round.  I think a good case can be made for allowing wages and salaries to increase and increasing social welfare benefits while, at the same time, allowing prices as far as safety permits to find their proper <Col N="209" /> economic level.  That was the policy of the Fianna Fáil Government, but unfortunately our Government was not able to pursue it to its fullest extent because in the 1952 Budget £7,000,000 roughly was provided to stabilise the price of bread.  If we had our way we would continue to reduce the price of bread still further this year.  Last year when there was a little benefit to be got out of the Budget, that benefit was duly passed on.  It was applied to bread.  It seems to me a pity that that benefit is not being passed on by the Coalition Government to the public this year.</P>
    <P>The present Government must know that butter is not a food item through the medium of which the benefit can be most evenly distributed amongst the most deserving sections of the community.  They must know that catering establishments have gained more by the butter subsidy than have the poor.  The effect of that subsidy is that one has a deputation to the Taoiseach, the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Industry and Commerce from the milk suppliers asking that some steps be taken to curtail the consumption of margarine; that in itself is proof that the position is as I have stated.</P>
    <P>Different Governments will have different policies.  We took bread as being the item which deserved the most assistance, and we acted accordingly. I would like the Minister to tell us what his attitude is in relation to supplying the public with figures for these two new services which have not been taken into account in the calculations he has given us.  Will he indicate what figure is to be provided for the Minister for Social Welfare in relation to old age pensions?  Will he tell us how the moneys for the stabilisation of tea prices will be accounted for?</P>
    <P>We cannot have it said about us that we are to continue indefinitely borrowing money for the tea we drink. I do not think the specious arguments put forward by the Government speakers of the possibility of a drop in the price of tea can possibly justify that attitude.  The Taoiseach, speaking <Col N="210" /> at the Fine Gael Ard Fheis, indicated what he thought the position would be next September when he said that the increased price of tea will have to be borne by the taxpayer and by the consumer.  If one may hazard a guess as to how that burden is to be disposed of, I would say that the 1/4 by which the Prices Advisory Body suggested that tea should go up, will be borne by the consumer and that the other 2/- will be borne by the Exchequer. Will the Minister for Finance tell us what that bill will amount to in respect of one year's stabilisation of the price of this particular commodity?</P>
    <P>We believe that these makeshift methods are producing no real improvement in the lot of the people. The people did not expect that they would be treated to small debating points as to the difference between the 1954-55 figures and the 1955-56 figures. They believed there were to be sweeping changes.  The Leader of the Opposition indicated some of them&mdash; the £20,000,000 reduction which was to take place in 20 minutes; the absorption of the unemployed into employment; the reduction of the cost of living by 30 per cent.  All these statements were made and it was on the expansiveness of the claim that was made by the Coalition that they got the results in the urban areas which produced the change of Government.</P>
    <P>The statement by the Minister for Finance, circumscribed as it is by his warning that we are not to take what we have got so far too seriously, certainly falls very far short of the claims that were made before last June.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly can fully agree with one statement that was made by Deputy Bartley, that the 1952 Budget is still very largely in effect. Unfortunately, that is the position. Unfortunately, it is true that very many of the difficulties with which we found ourselves confronted when we came into office and with which we still try to grapple are the conditions which had been brought about, and which still remain with us, by the Budget of 1952.  I will have occasion in the course of my remarks to make some observations on the effects which <Col N="211" /> those conditions in our economic and financial fabric, brought about by the Budget of 1952, have had on us in the formulation and the shaping and putting into effect of our policy.</P>
      <P>I have listened to most of the principal speakers in this debate and I think I can say that anything that has been said has not in any way minimised the remarkable fact that the Estimates for the public service have been reduced by the sum of £2.77 million and that that reduction has not in any way being achieved at the expense of the reduction in the price of butter.  Had we not, in the interests of the consumers of butter and in our desire to keep down the cost of living and to reduce the cost structure that is such a feature of our economy, reduced the price of butter, we would have been able to show on the face of this Book of Estimates for this year a reduction very nearly in the region of £5,000,000.  That, I say, is a remarkable achievement.  It would be remarkable for any Government, in the conditions which we faced and which we still face, to come into this House with a Book of Estimates with any substantial reduction but having regard to the very substantial reduction of £2.77 million at the very time when we have reduced the price of butter by the use of the subsidy, involving expenditure of over £2,000,000, I think we are entitled to say, and the public believe us, that we have achieved something of which we are entitled to be proud.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not merely have we achieved that reduction in face of tremendous difficulties, to some of which I will advert hereafter, but we are entitled to say that, with the significant exception of the year 1949-50, the year when the first inter-Party Government prepared and stood over its first Book of Estimates, this is the first Book of Estimates since the outbreak of the Second World War, to show a reduction.  For 14 years, with the single exception of the first year of the inter-Party Government, there has not been a reduction in the amount of money for the public service appearing on the face of the Book of Estimates but during every one of those 13 years the Estimates have regularly and monotonously <Col N="212" /> shown an increase.  In our first year as an inter-Party Government we showed a decrease of over £5,000,000.  This year, if it were not for the butter subsidy, we would have shown a decrease of nearly £5,000,000 but, in fact, having reduced butter, we show a decrease of £2.77 million.</P>
    <P>Faced with that situation, the Opposition have resorted to the tactics or the technique of accusing us of breaking promises which we never made and of failing to carry out undertakings which in fact we never gave. Deputy de Valera yesterday afternoon, when, trying to make the best of a bad job, he tried to say something against the situation in which he found himself, where for the first time in 13 years there was a reduction on the face of the Book of Estimates, resorted to the technique of saying that we took over office and we became the Government through falsely representing to the people, as I think Deputy Bartley said a few moments ago, that we would reduce public expenditure by £20,000,000 in 20 minutes.  Deputy de Valera referred in that statement, untrue as it was, to the statement that was alleged to have been made by the present Attorney-General, Deputy McGilligan.  He is supposed to have said that he would reduce public expenditure by £20,000,000 in 20 minutes.</P>
    <P>The Attorney-General will, I hope, before this debate concludes, tell the House and the people what exactly he did say.  He did not say what the Leader of the Opposition alleged he said.  He spoke, I think, shortly after the Budget of 1952 and said that if we then got office we would reduce the amount of taxation that was being imposed upon the people by £10,000,000 in ten minutes.  That had reference to the state of affairs in 1952 and to the fact that if we took over office then&mdash; before the effects of the Budget of 1952 or its impact on the people had become apparent&mdash;we would reduce the amount of taxation by £10,000,000. Deputy de Valera alleged that those statements were made to the public during the course of the general election and that we got into office on the basis of false representations and promises we made at that time.  No <Col N="213" /> such promises were, in fact, made.  I have already stated in this House &mdash; and I am not going to fight the battles all over again beyond reiterating this statement which I have made at every meeting from Ringsend to O'Connell Street from the beginning of the campaign to the end &mdash; that anybody who voted for me or who voted for anybody who was associated with me, or who would be associated with me, was voting on the understanding that neither I nor any of my colleagues was making any promises.  The Leader of the Opposition and his colleagues in the Fianna Fáil Party are trying to use the old propaganda trick of repeating lies in the hope that some people may eventually believe them to be true.</P>
    <P>In the course of his speech on the Supplies and Services Bill on the 10th February last, Deputy Lemass said, as reported at column 189 of Volume 148, No. 2 of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We never contended that the Government could prevent prices going up when wages and material costs and the prices of imported goods were going up.  But Deputy Costello then said that all these factors could be neutralised or reversed by some action of the Government. He committed himself in the most definite way to the people of this country, that if he became head of the Government here that Government would bring back prices to the level at which they were in 1951.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Yesterday, the Leader of the Opposition was good enough to suggest that I was endowed by Providence with certain oratorical or rhetorical powers. Had I all those powers, conferred upon me by the Leader of the Opposition, it would tax my powers, within the limits of parliamentary propriety, to say what I feel about that statement of Deputy Lemass or adequately to describe its untruth.  I never made such a statement.  The Leader of the Opposition, Deputy de Valera, went on to quote yesterday afternoon some words I had used characterising certain falsehoods that were being utilised by the Fianna Fáil Party during <Col N="214" /> the general election.  The words which he made use of yesterday afternoon were words which I used in the broadcast I made during the general election campaign.  In reference to certain of these falsehoods I said that they dishonoured those who made them, insulted those to whom they are made, besmirched the dignity which had attached to public life and offended the obligations of Christian charity.  I named the falsehoods in that broadcast &mdash; and they were not contradicted. I said that Fianna Fáil propagandists and speakers from Fianna Fáil platforms alleged, amongst other things, that the victims of the Fine Gael policy would be the employers and investors in the glass bottle factory at Ringsend, the motor assembly trade and the fertiliser factories.  I said those were lies &mdash; and I was not contradicted. I said it over the air to hundreds of thousands of people who were listening.</P>
    <P>The Leader of the Opposition said that if I were in his position and he were in mine and his Minister for Finance had the cheek or audacity to bring in this Book of Estimates, and make the claim we make for it, it would tax my rhetorical and oratorical powers to deal with the situation.  I agree that it would.  I should be struck dumb at the spectacle of a Fianna Fáil Minister for Finance bringing in a Book of Estimates which showed a farthing decrease.  Almost every year during the period of their office the Estimates went up &mdash; certainly over the 13 years I have mentioned from the Second World War until last year.  It would be a remarkable thing to see a Fianna Fáil Minister for Finance bringing in a Book of Estimates which showed even a farthing decrease.  Certainly, I should not be able to use my rhetorical or oratorical powers: I should be struck dumb at the unexpected spectacle.</P>
    <P>When Deputy MacEntee was Minister for Finance in 1953 he rather seemed to indicate that he proposed to effect a reduction in the Estimates in the following year.  For the financial year ending 31st March, 1954, the Estimate was £100,548,106.  I characterised that figure, in a speech which <Col N="215" /> I made during the debate on that Vote on Account, as a record figure &mdash; as, indeed, it was.  At column 167 of the Official Report of the 11th March, 1953, Deputy MacEntee is reported as making this statement.  Having criticised members on all sides of the House for what he called their clamant demands for ever-increasing public expenditure, and their failure to realise the responsibility they had to keep down public expenditure, he went on to say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I have no doubt that there would be clamant resistance from them to any measures designed to reduce existing services or to estop proposals to increase them.  It is inevitable, however, I think, that serious measures will have to be taken to bring State expenditure into line with the capacity and, what is equally important, the willingness of the public to bear the cost and in the coming year this will be the main purpose of the Government.  The Supply Estimates have now passed the £100,000,000 mark and it is imperative that the rise should be halted.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There was a public profession of the then Minister for Finance of what he was going to do in the coming year. He was going to see that various measures would be taken to bring State expenditure into line with the capacity and the willingness of the public to bear the cost.  He asserted that that would be the main purpose of the Government and that it was imperative that the rise should be halted.</P>
    <P>That was said during the year ending the 31st March, 1953, and they had another year in which to carry out that promise; in the result, so far from there being any decrease in State expenditure, so far from the rise being halted, the figure on the Book of Estimates went up by nearly £8,000,000. The figure on the face of the Book of Estimates for the year ending the 31st March, 1954, was the figure that I have stated&mdash;£100,548,106.  For the last year of Fianna Fáil administration the figure on the face of the Book of Estimates was £108,262,473, an increase of very nearly £8,000,000.  That is the <Col N="216" /> record of Fianna Fáil in the matter of public expenditure.  That is the result of the determination of the Minister for Finance to bring State expenditure down and to see that the rise should definitely be halted &mdash; nearly £8,000,000 of an increase.</P>
    <P>We are suffering from that to-day and we had the task of seeing that the rise in public expenditure was halted &mdash;that some effort, at least, was made to bring public expenditure into line with public capacity and willingness to pay.  That was the difficult job we had to do this year and how well we have done it is seen by the reduction we achieved.  It may not be &mdash; and it is not &mdash;as much as we would wish it to be, but if we had only held the line or even brought the total down by a very much smaller amount, at least we would have put our policy into effect and established the principle that the Government was setting itself to the task of trying to bring down public expenditure to a point where it would be not merely within the capacity of the public to pay but where it would be possible for us to do the things that we want to do in the interests of the country and in the interests of all sections of the people.</P>
    <P>It is in this context perhaps relevant to inquire what figure would have been on the face of the Book of Estimates if Deputy MacEntee or one of the Fianna Fáil Front Benchers occupied the position of Minister for Finance. What would be the pattern of expenditure having regard to the fact that in the year following the statements to which I have referred and following Deputy MacEntee's statement that it was imperative to bring down public expenditure, it was increased by nearly £8,000,000?  What would have been the figure of increase this year?  That is not a matter of mere speculation.  We have the material on which to base a definite judgment to hand.  The Minister for Finance yesterday, in opening this Vote on Account, read a statement that was made by Deputy Lemass in this House some few weeks ago.  I take leave to occupy the attention of the House for a few moments in repeating that statement, because it bears repetition not merely because of what <Col N="217" /> is said in it but because of another statement that was made a few days afterwards.</P>
    <P>At column 197 of Volume 148, No. 2, in the Debates of Thursday, February 10th, 1955, Deputy Lemass said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Not in a single Department of the Government &mdash; from the Department of the Taoiseach down to the Department of Lands &mdash; has a single real economy been made.  I say on the contrary, that the costs of administration in almost every Department, have gone up.  I say that, in a few weeks' time, each one of these Departments will come with a bill for administration for 1955 higher than that which they presented in 1954.  The Book of Estimates is almost due to appear.  That prophecy of mine will soon be tested as to its accuracy.  We shall have that book in our hands, presumably before the end of this month.  Unless something has happened, of which no indication has been given to the Dáil or the public, every Department will be showing higher administrative charges.  In many places that may be due solely to the increased remuneration paid to Civil Service staffs; it may be due to larger staffs in some cases.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is a prophecy by Deputy Lemass.  I have sympathy with Deputy Lemass in making such a prophecy, because each time when he was in Government, up went the Book of Estimates every year and accordingly he saw no means of making any reduction this year and he wanted to be in first with his prophecy.  What he said at that time was that he prophesied that there would be increases in the Book of Estimates in every Department unless something happened&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Government happened, and as he himself knew, we <Col N="218" /> set up the sub-committee that was referred to in the <i>Irish Press</i>, which was charged by its colleagues with seeing that something happened, and that that something was going to be a reduction in public administration. That prophecy was made in this House on the 10th February, and somebody coyly and shyly hiding themselves, their names or their identities, under the title of &ldquo;Our Political Correspondent&rdquo; in the <i>Irish Press</i>&mdash; I wonder who is &ldquo;Our Political Correspondent&rdquo;? It is not hard to guess. &mdash;but, at all events, on the 22nd February, that is 12 days after Deputy Lemass made his statement, the prophecy to which I have referred in this House, there appeared a long article from &ldquo;Our Political Correspondent&rdquo; headed &ldquo;Making Out the Taxpayers' Bill&rdquo;.  It referred to the fact that a small Cabinet Committee had been working in the past few weeks on the Estimates for the coming year, and said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is reliably reported that it is having a difficult task in its efforts to prune down unnecessary expenditure and reduce the already alarming increase in the bill which Mr. Sweetman will present to the taxpayers next May.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>And then he goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is now known that the expenditure required for 1954-55 will be up by between £10,000,000 and £15,000,000 at least over that of the preceding year.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Now there were no references to &ldquo;administrative expenses&rdquo; by &ldquo;Our Political Correspondent&rdquo;.  I am sure Deputy Lemass would not try to make out that when he said &ldquo;administrative expenses&rdquo; he was saying something different from &ldquo;Our Political Correspondent&rdquo; when he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is now known that the expenditure required for 1954-55 will be up by between £10,000,000 and £15,000,000 at least on that of the preceding year.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taking these two statements together &mdash;Deputy Lemass's in this House and &ldquo;Our Political Correspondent's&rdquo; in the <i>Irish Press</i>, one giving precision to the <Col N="219" /> other, Deputy Lemass prophesying an increase in every Department in administrative expenses and &ldquo;Our Political Correspondent&rdquo; in the <i>Irish Press</i> saying there would be an increase in expenditure this year of £10,000,000 to £15,000,000 &mdash; the public can realise what the extent of expenditure would have been this year had they not been saved from Fianna Fáil by the general election of last year.  Ten million pounds to £15,000,000 was the increase which they expected and they were right in expecting that because that is what would have happened had they been in office.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding what the then Minister for Finance said in 1952 that steps were going to be taken during the year to bring it down, notwithstanding that apparently firm determination of their then Minister for Finance, their Estimates for the following year went up by £8,000,000.  It is not surprising, therefore, to find Deputy Lemass anticipating that we would not be able to prevent expenditure or administrative expenses, whatever you like to call it, from going up by £10,000,000 to £15,000,000.  Not merely did we prevent it from going up by £10,000,000 to £15,000,000 but we reduced it by over £2,750,000 and we reduced the price of butter to our people at a cost of over £2,000,000.</P>
    <P>We are entitled, if not to present that achievement &mdash; because it is an achievement &mdash; with any smug complacency to the public, at least to say to the public that we have given a solid, concrete indication of that part of our policy and that while we have achieved some measure of success this year, our efforts in that respect are not at an end.</P>
    <P>I said at the outset that this was a difficult task.  It was difficult because of various factors in the situation and it was difficult because of the legacy we inherited from Fianna Fáil and the Budget of 1952 which, as Deputy Bartley said, is still with us.  This difficulty arises from the automatic tendency of certain items of expenditure to increase and from the extent to which the pattern of expenditure is <Col N="220" /> becoming more and more rigid each year.  It was difficult to achieve a reduction because we set ourselves a headline, which was referred to in a speech by the Minister for Social Welfare, that whatever reductions were going to be made &mdash; and reductions were going to be made &mdash; they would be achieved by taking account of the effect which those cuts would have on the administration of Government and on the general economy and by ensuring that whatever cuts in expenditure were made there would be no cuts in essential services and no cuts that would bring about unemployment.</P>
    <P>These were the headlines we set ourselves. That was the difficulty we had. As I said, we had the difficulty to contend with that Government expenditure has shown over the years almost an automatic tendency to increase and to become inflexible. Amongst the items which tend automatically to increase is the service of the public debt.  With capital expenditure regularly exceeding some £30,000,000 annually, this charge is rising by over £2,000,000 or, if account is taken of certain off-setting receipts, by over £1,000,000 net.  Other examples of this automatic tendency to increase are superannuation payments to civil servants, Gardaí, national teachers, Defence Forces, etc., housing loan subsidy charges and, when local rates are increasing, the agricultural grants in relief of rates.</P>
    <P>There are many examples of those types of expenditure which are becoming so inflexible as to be almost rigid. There are payments in respect of social welfare and in respect of health, housing, education and so on.  These payments, which can be grouped under the heading of &ldquo;social services&rdquo; account for about one-half of Exchequer expenditure.  There is little in the line of economy to be got in that direction having regard to the Government's social policy.  There is little in the line of economy to be got from the remuneration of civil servants, Gardaí, teachers, members of the Defence Forces, and so on, which is now running at close on £30,000,000 a year. Of that £30,000,000 nearly £15,000,000 is referable to the remuneration of <Col N="221" /> the Civil Service.  The scope for reduction in that direction is practically non-existent.  Since we have over the years, and in this year particularly, given proof of our care for our public servants, we do not intend them to be singled out for execution by the economic axe; we gave concrete proof of that when we honoured the arbitration award this year.  Notwithstanding that difficulty, notwithstanding the very narrow scope that exists, we are still determined that the cost of public administration shall be brought down.</P>

They are small compared to the difficulties we had to face because of the policy that had been in operation from 1951 to 1954 when the country got rid of the Fianna Fáil Government.  The 1952 Budget, as Deputy Bartley rightly said, is still with us.  I have said how difficult it is to get economy in the public service.  We had the slashing of the food subsidies in 1952, the deliberate policy adopted by the Government at that time because of their philosophy that the country was too well off and was living beyond its means, because incomes generally, as the then Minister for Finance said in his Budget speech, had gone beyond the cost of living.  Therefore, incomes had to be cut down and the cost of living had to be deliberately allowed to rise as it did rise by 15 points over that period of three years during which they were in office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That philosophy brought about the conditions from which this country suffered in the last three years and from the effects of which the country is still suffering and which we have not yet got completely rid of &mdash; unemployment, depression in trade, a steep rise in the cost of living bringing about <Col N="222" /> demands for increased wages which could not be pressed home &mdash; as they could have been and would have been in different circumstances &mdash; because of the fear of unemployment that was ever present in the mind of those people who were asking for more wages to enable them to keep up with the cost of living.</P>
    <P>Deliberate Government policy brought about unemployment, a depression in trade, a depression in money, a fall in the purchasing value of the £.  Panic measures were taken in 1953 by the Government to try and alleviate the unemployment which was brought about by the adoption of their financial policy, panic measures resulting in public money being poured out without any regard to whether or not any productive results were obtained from it.  Public bodies were told: &ldquo;Get on with schemes which will do something for unemployment.  Do not wait for sanction.  Do something, for heaven's sake&rdquo;.  That was brought about by the policy deliberately adopted by the Government, and when I referred to that we were warned off. Civil servants' salaries were increased, and other salaries, and the cost of Government services were increased, because of the fall in the purchasing power of the £ brought about by that policy and because of the other conditions brought about by that policy.  I referred to this matter on previous occasions.</P>
    <P>While I do not think that I have the gift of prophecy that Deputy Lemass assumed to himself during the recent Supplies and Services debate, and at frequent intervals in this House, speaking on the Vote on Account for the financial year 1953-54 on the 12th March, 1953, in column 254, Volume 137, having referred to the evil effects which were then abundantly apparent from the policy of the Government in the measures put into operation so unjustly and so unnecessarily by the Budget of 1952, I put this rhetorical question:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;What has been the cost of this to the commuunity?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I answered that by saying:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="223" />&ldquo;It is incalculable, perhaps it is irreparable.  If it is not irreparable, it certainly will remain as an injury to the economic fabric of the State for very many years after the present Government have ceased to be the Government.  The position has almost become frozen.  Any Government that succeeds the present Government will have a task of appalling difficulty to contend with.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Every word of it was true.  Now that we are the Government we have found how true it was.  We have realised, even more than we had at that time when I was speaking, what an appalling task a Government succeeding that Government would have to deal with.  Now, in spite of those difficulties we have, by subsidy, reduced the price of butter at a cost of over £2,000,000, and have reduced the face of the Book of Estimates by over £2,750,000.  That is no small achievement.</P>
    <P>In the course of the debate on Supplies and Services &mdash; I think in the course of the remarks made by Deputy de Valera &mdash; reference was made to those promises which we never made and the non-fulfilment of undertakings which we never gave.  It was stated that I had, in some way, retracted my position by the speech I had made on behalf of the Government when I was speaking on prices, particularly those prices which rise because of economic forces outside this country, over which we have no control.  I am told that that was something new which we never stated until we took over Government. I said it a long time ago in extenuation of Fianna Fáil policy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not whisper it to myself.  I am going to read it out for the purpose of again ramming it home though I have no hope of convincing those people who are responsible for the lie.  On the 3rd of January, 1952, two and a half years ago, in column 561 of Volume 135, I had been speaking on the Supplies and Services Bill.  Deputies will remember the famous or infamous White Paper that was produced at about that time. <Col N="224" /> That White Paper contained a statement subsequently repeated by the Minister for Finance, that there was no prospect of any expansion in agricultural production and exports.  That was one of the foundations of Fianna Fáil policy.  They could not look forward to any expansion of agricultural production or exports and they reached record heights the next year, and reached further record heights, I am glad to say, this past year.  I was speaking about prices.  I made the statement:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I have called attention to the facts in connection with the price rise.  We do not accept that the rise in price and the rise in the cost of living need necessarily have been too sharp, that the recession of business ought to have been so grave or that the increase in unemployment ought to have been so considerable.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I would ask Deputy Aiken to listen to this whisper:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I realise at once that some of the rise in prices is due to factors beyond the control of the present Government, and beyond the control of any Government.  I appreciate that the rise in import prices was bound to bring about an increase in the cost of living, but we think that it should not have risen to the extent which we have experienced.  The rise &mdash; which we say was unjustifiable &mdash;was due entirely to the policy of the Government in the sudden withdrawal of the food subsidies, and to the unjustifiable increase in taxation.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was somewhat amazed by Deputy de Valera's effort yesterday to try to make a case against this Vote on Account.  When he tried to make out that we had some way represented to the people that we were going to reduce taxation by £20,000,000, I say that no such statement was ever made by us.  Then he found himself in this dilemma: that being disappointed with the fact that there was a reduction, he had to say it was negligible and that it did not, in fact, exist.  And then he had to try and attack the reduction&mdash; trying to have it both ways.  He said there was no reduction but he wanted <Col N="225" /> to criticise the reduction.  And everyone of the speakers from the Opposition have carried on in that way&mdash; there are no reductions but we will criticise the reductions.  Deputy de Valera spoke about a £60,000 reduction in forestry, having said the reductions were negligible.</P>
    <P>I shall leave it to the Minister for Lands to deal with that point later.  I shall only say now that that reduction is a genuine reduction and is due to the fact that there was more money in the kitty than was necessary, and that it is possible for us, in spite of that reduction, to buy more land for forestry this year than ever the Fianna Fáil Government bought in the years of their office.</P>
    <P>That is the reason for that reduction. That is a genuine reduction, but it is not at the expense of forestry or of employment in forestry because more land will be bought with the money we have after the reduction than was ever bought by Fianna Fáil in their time.  Then Deputy de Valera spoke and criticised the reduction in the Army &mdash; though of course he had said that there was no reduction.  Rather implying that he disagreed with the reduction, he criticised the saving made on fire insurance, as he called it. We like, when we do insure ourselves, to see that we are not paying for a bad cover and that is the difference between us and Fianna Fáil.  It would be bad cover for us to spend this £1,000,000 on the Army this year.  But we still have a grand insurance and a grand Army.</P>
    <P>That was Deputy de Valera's contribution. Then he went on about wheat and said that we were enabled to make this reduction, such as it is &mdash; there being no reduction according to him&mdash; by a windfall, the windfall being the moneys from America and the reduction in the price of wheat to the producer. What about the windfall that we left behind us in 1951 &mdash; over £20,000,000 in Marshall Aid?  It was dissipated in six months when we had intended to keep it as a cushion, spreading it over three or four years as capital expenditure.  The public did not get any benefit from that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="226" /> That was a windfall.  If we had got such a windfall last year we would have given the benefit of it in this year's Book of Estimates.  Deputy de Valera talked about wheat.  We cut the amount the taxpayers had to give to the growers of wheat by £1,000,000. Deputy de Valera was always fond of saying that no Government but a Government formed from a single Party would be competent or would have the courage to make unpopular and difficult decisions.  We are what is called a Coalition, what we call an inter-Party Government.  We had to take that courageous decision &mdash; to reduce the price of wheat.  We had the courage to face up to that and it was not a very easy one.  We had to tell the farmers who supported us that, though we knew their difficulties and their problems and that we sympathised with them and appreciated what they were doing, they were getting some money to which, having regard to the interests of the taxpayer and to the general interests of the community, they were not entitled and therefore we had to take it from them this year.</P>
    <P>We faced that unpopular situation in spite of all the efforts made by Deputy Corry and the other Deputies on the back benches of Fianna Fáil to try and work up political agitation against us.  We did that in order to save the taxpayer.  That was no windfall but something that required courage and competence.  It was something which Deputy Corry and all the Fianna Fáil propagandists will be making use of in the years to come.  I am glad to say, however, that what we have done is gratefully appreciated by the public in general.</P>
    <P>I was again amused &mdash; I suppose if I were younger I would get indignant but now I am getting, as my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture says, longer in the tooth, I get rather more amused &mdash; when Deputy de Valera spoke about the audacity of my colleague, the Minister for Finance, in coming in with these so-called reductions.  Deputy de Valera weeps when he remembers all the promises we made, all the undertakings we gave, all the promises that were broken, all the undertakings which were not carried out.  He is <Col N="227" /> grieved to think of the deceptions we practised on the voters.  I really cannot help recalling again the point in the programme through which Fianna Fáil got into office in 1951.  Not a few people on Deputy de Valera's benches got into office on this particular point of policy, which reads as follows: &ldquo;It is the policy of Fianna Fáil to maintain subsidies, to control the prices of essential foodstuffs and operate an efficient system of price regulation for all necessary services.&rdquo;  The leader of the Party, who became Taoiseach on that false representation, is illadvised to speak of audacity or of cheek or of false representation or broken promises.</P>
    <P>This Book of Estimates, as all Books of Estimates produced by democratic Governments in democratic States, gives some indication of Government policy.  This Book of Estimates gives such an indication of our policy to the public.  We have a different approach to the problems confronting this country from that which Fianna Fáil had and which they followed in the years in which they were in office &mdash; during the past three or four years.  We approach our problems on the basis that it is essential for the economy of this country that money must be borrowed for capital expenditure of a productive character and that the money must be borrowed cheaply.  They approached it on the basis of being afraid to spoil the ship for the ha'porth of tar, giving the investors 5 per cent. when some of the municipal enterprises across the water could get money at 3½ per cent. or 3¼ per cent. or less.</P>
    <P>An essential part of our policy is that the price of money borrowed for capital expenditure must be low.  Ours is the policy of cheap money as against borrowing it at dearer rates &mdash; the policy of money at a reasonable rate of interest for productive expenditure as against dear money.  We do not want to spend in the way Fianna Fáil spent the money that our people saved and lent to the Government.  We want to spend that money in schemes of constructive expenditure.  We do not want to send that money down the roads or the drains and get nothing for it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="228" /> We want to spend productively.  We do not want, as has been said by the Minister for Finance, to cut expenditure merely for the sake of cutting expenditure.  We want to cut in order that we may save.  That is very different from what the policy of Fianna Fáil was when that Party poured out money last year planning schemes to relieve the unemployment they had themselves created by their deliberate policy.  Every year their Book of Estimates went up and up and up.  Every year public expenditure went up and up and up.  We want our Book of Estimates, so far as we can achieve it, to come down and down and down so that we may have sufficient money to implement the social services we want to implement, to increase our existing social services, and to bring into existence productive schemes which will create real wealth in our country.</P>
    <P>We have been frequently twitted by Deputy Lemass and other Opposition speakers who try to draw us by saying: &ldquo;How can you increase social services and at the same time decrease taxation?&rdquo; We did that when we were in office before.  We hope to do it again. We hope by our policy to create wealth in the country.  We hope by our policy to make the money in the hands of our people real money, with a better purchasing power.  We hope by increasing the real wealth of the country to put more money into our people's pockets, to increase business and thereby increase the national revenue, so that by buoyancy of revenue, an increased national income and lower taxation we may get a better yield of revenue for the purposes for which money is required by our Government.</P>
    <P>The lineaments of our policy have been emerging in our actions and decisions from day to day, from week to week, and from month to month, over the last nine months.  When we floated the National Loan with, I am glad to say, the loyal co-operation of the Opposition, last autumn, we insisted that the rate of interest should be downwards.  There was much eyebrow raising.  There was much foreboding. But the Minister for Finance insisted on that downward trend.  The <Col N="229" /> result is that we got the money at a cheaper rate and the stocks now are standing higher, higher not merely than when they were floated but higher in comparison with those stocks issued by Fianna Fáil, when they were in office.</P>
    <P>That was the first indication of our policy.  The next indication came a few weeks ago when we were able to secure the agreement of the banks to the proposition that it was the economic interests of the country and of our people which were to decide whether or not there should be an increase in the rate of interest on advances. That was the first time in the history of this State that was done.  I have little doubt that it would not have been done had Fianna Fáil been in office.</P>
    <P>That is another indication of our policy, showing that we are not going to allow the banks to put up the price at which moneys will be lent to our people for business, for the development of agriculture and for the development of industry.  The figure in our Book of Estimates is another indication of our policy.  Again, it is a downward trend; public expenditure down; the cost of loans down; the cost of advances kept from going up, and we hope in time we will get them down.</P>
    <P>We kept the prices of some essential commodities down.  We have at least held the line in relation to others, though it has not been easy.  We were criticised for our policy in relation to tea.  Audacity was the expression used by the Leader of the Opposition to describe our actions in that respect. At least one wants courage, if one does not want audacity, to deal with some of the problems that Fianna Fáil left behind.  We were proved right in our policy in relation to tea.  I can imagine the disappointment of Fianna Fáil when we adopted the device we did to keep down the price of tea.  Can you imagine the howl that would have come from those benches if we had not taken the action we did?  &ldquo;You said you would keep down prices.  Why did you let tea go up?&rdquo;  There would have been a chorus of denunciation here and throughout the country had we not <Col N="230" /> adopted the device we did.  But that was not the reason why we did adopt it.  We adopted it because we felt it was essential in the interests of our policy, our economy and our people. We have no money inflation but we have cost inflation.  We had to keep costs down in some way.  To do it even to the small extent we did has been worth it.</P>
    <P>We have kept down the price of butter for similar reasons and for human reasons, because we knew that the one thing that all sections of our people wanted was a decrease in the price of butter.  Apart from that, that decrease kept down the cost of living and illustrated the trend of our policy. Indications of our policy are now emerging as demonstrated by our actions over the last nine months.  The Minister for Finance in his opening statement yesterday referred to the confidence that had been born as a result of the change of Government and to the necessity for keeping that confidence and keeping stability.</P>
    <P>The people have confidence in this Government.  They have confidence in the stability of this Government and its institutions.  We set out to achieve public confidence in a situation wherein the country was sick of political histrionics and political agitation.  We have given the people quiet over the last nine months and we want to maintain that situation.  We want to continue to give our people quiet so that they can go quietly about their business, secure in the knowledge that they have a Government which is trying to look after their interests and not just the Government's interests. In that framework of necessity for maintaining confidence and preserving stability we have not sought to present our people from day to day, or week to week, with spectacular changes of policy, with anything that could be said to capture the imagination of the people.</P>
    <P>We stated our policy when we formed our Government.  People know what that policy is and what we are endeavouring to do.  We are going about our task quietly, I hope effectively, and unspectacularly.  If we fail it will not be our fault for want of trying.  Our <Col N="231" /> policy is known to the people.  We have given indications of the way in which we are carrying it out.  We have never said that we will do everything at once.  We have never said that we would decrease prices, increase employment or old age pensions within a few weeks or within a few months of our attaining office.  We have a long-term policy.  Ours is a difficult job and we have no illusions about the task we have to fulfil but at least we have loyal colleagues, a firm purpose and a determination to achieve what we set out to achieve and hope, in time, to achieve.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened with a certain amount of amazement to the Taoiseach's speech, but I must forbear to criticise it at any great length because, if I did, I should have to use the word &ldquo;audacity&rdquo; and the Taoiseach does not like it.  But is there anything more audacious than his statement that the cost of tea has been kept down?  The Taoiseach when he made that assertion was quite obviously ringing the changes on two words &mdash; the word &ldquo;cost&rdquo; and the word &ldquo;price&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The price of tea to the domestic consumer, as a consumer and as a purchaser, has been kept down but the cost of tea to the community as a whole and to the consumer as a taxpayer has not been kept down.  It remains at the equivalent of what he would have to pay if this dubious device of financing the purchase of tea out of borrowed money had not been resorted to by the Government.</P>
      <P>Therefore, it is quite misleading to say that the price of tea has been kept down when everybody knows that the consumer has got to pay, in the first instance, one instalment of the cost of that tea over the grocer's counter when he is purchasing it and another instalment to the tax collector when he comes round.  One way or other, the cost of tea remains at the world price and the Government has not done anything and cannot do anything to reduce it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The speech of the Taoiseach which we have just listened to was remarkable in another way.  It was remarkable for the fact that the Leader of this forward-looking Government spent <Col N="232" /> all his time looking backwards.  He was not discussing the volume of Estimates for 1955-56; he was discussing what I said or some other person said in 1952-53.  We were told, so that the Taoiseach might find some extenuation or some excuse for the flagrant breach of public faith which he and his colleagues had been guilty of since the last election, that it was impossible for the Government to cut expenditure, that they had inherited public services which were costing £108,000,000.  Very well, then, let us see what was responsible for that figure.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach himself in concluding his speech admitted that the cost of the social services, of the Social Welfare Act, of the Health Act, had a great deal to do with the fact that the total expenditure on services was of the order of £108,000,000.  He says we are responsible for that.  We have been responsible, he says, for the legislation which has made that necessary. Very well.  The Minister for Health came into this House a few months ago and brought in a Bill to suspend almost <i>in toto</i> the operation of the 1953 Health Act.  If the Government really want to secure the economies to which they pledged themselves when they were in opposition, what is to prevent them following the example of the Minister for Health and securing these economies and cutting these services which the people enjoy, for which Fianna Fáil was responsible, for which the present Government is claiming credit but is not prepared to accept the concomitant obligations?</P>
    <P>That is a simple matter.  The Taoiseach has the remedy in his own hands.  He can reduce public expenditure by amending the Social Welfare Acts for which the Fianna Fáil Government was responsible and, if he refuses to amend those Acts and to cut expenditure upon these services in that way, then he must carry the responsibility for the cost of these services.  The Taoiseach's speech exemplifies the fact that he is an old hand at the Bar and that he has not forgotten the old forensic motto, when you have a bad case, blackguard your opponent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="233" /> I do not think we should accept the Taoiseach's apologia as though it were something out of Holy Writ.  I think we are entitled to pin the Taoiseach down, if not to some of his own pronouncements, then to some of the pronouncements of his leading colleagues. In that connection I should like to compliment the Minister for Finance.  I should like to compliment him on the skill with which he has shaken himself free, not only of the Attorney-General but also of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Government.</P>
    <P>All of us will recall the astonishment with which we listened to the Taoiseach when he was submitting his Government to Dáil Éireann.  When the Taoiseach asked the Dáil to approve of his proposal to appoint Deputy Sweetman, as he then was, as Minister for Finance, he was careful to explain that Mr. McGilligan as Attorney-General would hold a watching brief with Deputy O'Donovan, whom he proposed to make Parliamentary Secretary to the Government &mdash; I think that is his title, but there has been such a proliferation of minor patronages since the Government took office that one cannot be sure &mdash; however, as I have said, the Attorney-General and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Government were to be appointed as sort of tutelary deities to make sure that this wild young neophyte would do nothing foolish.</P>
    <P>I think that was an unwarranted and gratuitous reflection on the Minister for Finance who, in my opinion, is abler than both his whilom mentors put together.  He is, I think, one of the ablest men in the Government and I think, and I hope I am not wrong, one of the most tenacious and courageous.  Unkind people, indeed, have said that the present Minister was the only man who would step into the breach, that he was appointed because my predecessor, the present Attorney-General, funked &mdash; to use a word which may not be very elegant but is very expressive &mdash; taking the post.</P>

      <P>Precisely &mdash; he was stillborn.  I could not find a better expression for Deputy McGilligan's baby than to say it was stillborn.  Here is how the doting parent described it in his final broadcast winding up the Fine Gael campaign at the last election &mdash;he said it was a beautiful child which would provide many economies to hand for a Minister who is serious. Apparently, the Minister for Finance does not measure up to the Attorney-General's criterion of seriousness.  He said in regard to this baby that there is little doubt that savings amounting to several millions a year could be secured without much effort and, as the broadcast continued and as his frenzy rose until he was like a whirling dervish, Mr. McGilligan proclaimed that nothing less than £20,000,000 or upwards would satisfy himself and his Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, £20,000,000 and upwards is a lot of money and it is what the taxpayers of this country were promised in May of last year.  What a lot private individuals could do for themselves if £20,000,000 and upwards were to be given to them this year.  That was the bait, as I have said, which the Attorney-General held out to his listeners to persuade them to vote for him and his colleagues in May of last year.  That was the reward &mdash; let us not forget it &mdash; they were promised they would get in this year's Budget.  That is what they were looking forward to. I have no doubt that there are many innocent people in this country who, when they read Deputy Costello's speech, will still think that that £20,000,000 is going to fall into their laps like a windfall.  Yesterday, however, <Col N="235" /> the Minister for Finance told them at some length that the £20,000,000 was only Mr. McGilligan's pipe dream and that they had better forget it.  Not only is expenditure not being reduced by £20,000,000, not only are savings of many millions not being secured but, so far as the Volume of Estimates unfolds the story, there is no reduction whatever in overall public expenditure.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has quite properly warned us that the Estimates which we are considering represent only one side of the account &mdash; only, in fact, a portion of one side of the account.  For a full picture, as he has told us, we must await his Budget statement.  But we need not await that statement to investigate some of the items in which he suggests reductions have been made.</P>
    <P>Take, for instance, the sub-head in the Defence Vote for defensive equipment. In the 1954-55 Volume that item as published appeared as £1,800,000. In the Budget, however, it was cut to £1,000,000.  Therefore, even the notional reduction is not from £1.8 million to £1,000,000 but £1,000,000 to £.8 million, that is from £1,000,000 to £800,000. But, of that £1,000,000, it was announced in the Budget that the then Government felt justified in borrowing £600,000 of the £1,000,000, leaving £400,000 to be met by the taxpayer. What does the Minister for Finance propose to do?  Perhaps he might, even in advance of his Budget statement, tell us that now, so that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to wait if it is more convenient for the Minister&mdash;if it will afford him a little longer to keep that particular illusion still before the public that he has reduced expenditure on defensive equipment from £1.8 million to £1,000,000. He has done nothing of the sort.  He knows that and his colleagues know that; but the general public do not know it.  What I am coming to is this: is the Minister going to do as we did last year?  Is he going to find £400,000 of this £800,000 out of revenue and is he going to borrow the remaining <Col N="236" /> £400,000?  If he is going to tax in order to get the £400,000, there is no saving whatever to the taxpayer and there is no such economy as has been claimed in relation to this particular item for defensive equipment.</P>
      <P>I want to diverge a little, perhaps, from the financial aspect of that question to come to another aspect which I think is of some importance.  In dealing with this item for defensive equipment, the Minister for Finance mentioned, in justification for its reduction, that it would be imprudent to spend money on obsolete weapons.  Certainly it would be imprudent to spend money on obsolete weapons, but are conventional weapons obsolete?  There are many authorities to whom a layman might bow who deny that they are.  Nuclear and thermo-nuclear weapons are terribly destructive.  We all know that.  But they are also terribly expensive in terms of time, materials and labour.  There are warlike situations of defence and attack where it would be, from a military point of view, wholly uneconomic to use them.</P>
      <P>In such conditions, conventional weapons, as they are called, must be relied on.  In an attack on this Island, it is probable that only conventional weapons would be called for &mdash; though, in the frenzy of war, others might be used.  In any event, whatever weapons might be used to attack us, the only weapons we can make available for our defence are conventional weapons.  I suggest that in a situation in which certain organisations for their own ends and their sympathisers in other organisations appear to wish to provoke reprisal and counter-reprisal&mdash; which, indeed, may lead to a condition in this country tantamount to civil war&mdash;it would be folly on the part of this Government or any other Government to leave this community powerless to defend themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another aspect of this Defence Vote to which I would like to refer also.  Equally important from the point of view of public safety, is the utter neglect on the part of the Government of the problem of civil defence.  Even if there were no danger of involvement in any general European <Col N="237" /> conflict there is still the probability&mdash; indeed, almost a certainty &mdash; that if such a conflict broke out and we were left to maintain our own peace within our own borders we should not escape the dire consequences which flow from the use of nuclear weapons.  These consequences are very grave and real, as the effects of recent explosions have shown.  If the H-bomb were exploded over Liverpool or Bristol or, indeed, over virtually any city in Great Britain not to speak of over Belfast, our people would not escape unscathed.</P>
    <P>Elsewhere, they are alive to this problem.  They are alive to it in the Six Counties.  So far as the present Volume of Estimates shows, the Government appears to be concerned only to ignore it.  I trust, however, that this is not the general attitude of the more responsible among them.  They cannot continue to ignore it.  Civil defence has become a grave problem for every country.  It has become a grave problem for those countries which hitherto have been able to maintain a traditionally neutral position. I read an article last week in an English periodical written by a Deputy of this House, a member of the Fine Gael Party.  In that article he referred to the fact that Switzerland and Sweden had both been able to establish a traditional attitude of conventional neutrality, and that, therefore, they had been saved from and had been relieved of the heavy burden which defensive armaments have imposed on the people of other countries. The Deputy quite forgot the fact that Sweden is taking extraordinary precautions, extraordinary measures to provide for the civil defence of its people.  Even though Sweden may hope, as we may hope, to maintain a strictly neutral attitude in any world conflict, Sweden is not putting its head in the sand.  Sweden is spending huge sums in trying to provide, as I have said, for the civil defence of its people. I move to report progress.</P>

    <P>52.&mdash;(1)  The corporation may provide a building for use by an approved local council for public and <Col N="239" /> other meetings and for lectures, exhibitions, general recreation or other similar social objects and may entrust the care and management of the building to the council either permanently or temporarily.</P>

    <P>(6)  The corporation may, for the purposes of this section, borrow in the same manner as they may borrow for the purpose of defraying expenses under the Local Government (Sanittary Services) Acts, 1878 to 1953.</P>
    <P>(7)  Money borrowed pursuant to this section may be lent to the corporation by means of an issue from the Local Loans Fund as if such loan <Col N="240" /> constituted a local loan within the meaning of the Local Loans Fund Acts, 1935 to 1953, and was authorised by an Act of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 14a in the name of Deputy Denis Larkin:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 21 to insert the following sub-section before sub-section (3) of Section 51:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 78 of the Act of 1946 is hereby amended&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  by the deletion in sub-section (1) of &ldquo;with the consent of not less than four-sevenths of the ratepayers in a street&rdquo; and the substitution therefor of &ldquo;by simple <Col N="241" /> majority decision of members present and voting and with the consent of the Minister&rdquo;,</P>
    <P>(b)  by the deletion of sub-sections (2) and (3) and</P>
    <P>(c)  by the addition of the following new sub-section:</P>
    <P>(6)  Where four-sevenths of the ratepayers in a street object to changing the name of the street they may appeal to the Minister.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is more or less an inquiry to the Minister.  Originally, we had an amendment to this effect, and having had a full discussion on it in this House we were given to understand by the Minister, as recorded in the Debates, that he was having it considered between that time and the Report Stage and as far as we can see in connection with the main amendments brought in by the Minister, there is nothing done about it.  That is more or less why we had to bring it in again. There is no need at this stage to go into the reasons why we brought in this amendment.  These are well known to every member of the House and the Minister, and we are, to tell the truth, very much surprised at finding that, as far as we can see, the Minister has made no attempt to help in any way, and we were completely in the dark in that we did not know what the Minister was doing about it.  We are most anxious to know now what is going to happen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The position with regard to this amendment is that I did consider it as I promised, and as a result of some research we found that no local authority ever failed to change the name of a street where it wished to do so under the provisions of the 1946 Act, which Act provided for the consent of four-sevenths of the ratepayers. I find that no local authority wherever it received that request failed to change the name.  After all, the ratepayers have a vital interest &mdash; I do not wish to use the arguments used on the Committee Stage &mdash; but I did look into the matter carefully and I am <Col N="242" /> satisfied as a result of past experience there is no necessity to amend the law. I would like very much indeed to meet the Deputy, but I must consider the people residing in the locality.  Deputy MacBride did speak to this amendment when it was introduced before.  I gave the House my reasons for not accepting it on Committee Stage and, as a result of the arguments which I have read very carefully since and as a result of the research I have made into past experience, I am satisfied that the law as it stands at the moment meets the requirements and meets the wishes of the people of this particular locality.</P>

      <P>The last Act?  We are not satisfied it ever worked.  We believe our local councils are composed of men of common sense and there is no question of any particular instance in which there was anxiety to change the name to suit our own convenience or requirements, but we are aware that even under the Act mentioned by the Minister there are many instances where people had very good reasons to change these names and bring them into line with true patriotic motives and name them after men to whom we owe a lot, but the request was refused. This happened even under the 1946 Act because the ratepayers did not&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I was impressed by the argument put forward in respect of Dublin but I do not see why I should single out Dublin.

      <P>I move amendment No. 14c:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 22, Section 52, to insert a new sub-section (5) as follows (as a sub-section to be inserted in Section 73 of the Act of 1941):&mdash;</P>
      <P>(5)  Such building shall be exempted for a period of seven years from two-thirds of the rates levied thereon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My reason for putting down this amendment is that when a hall is built there are different demands on it; it is besieged from all sides; the performing rights society and several other people are putting charges on them. I am asking that the Minister should give the same exemption from rates as he does to new houses and enable <Col N="244" /> them to get on their feet.  The Minister is being so good as to give us the other concessions and I am asking him to give us this one, which would be a great help to halls.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt at all that it would be a great help to halls to exempt them from rates; in fact, it would be a great help to everyone if we could wipe out the rates on all buildings, but what about the unfortunate resident who is depending on the spending of the receipts from rates for the upkeep of various amenities in the area?  If we were to wipe out rates altogether where would we get the finance to carry on local affairs?  Here you are asking for two-thirds remission for seven years.  The Deputy is well aware that any parish hall erected in the period of three years commencing on the 27th July, 1953, would be entitled, in common with other buildings, to two-thirds remission of rates for seven years under the Local Government (Temporary Reduction of Valuation) Act, 1954.  This remission would apply to any increase in valuation following on the reconstruction or improvement of a parish hall carried out in the same period.  I think that goes a long way to meet the Deputy's point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to accept this amendment for this reason.  We have asked him by the two amendments to enable a local authority either to make a grant or give a loan with or without interest or at a low rate of interest to the local parish council to erect a suitable hall to meet the requirements of the area. If in the case of Dublin or the country a responsible group of people accept a loan say, of X thousand pounds to build a hall, and so on, obviously having an undertaking that it would be repaid, that within a limited period of years, say, seven or ten years, it <Col N="245" /> would be reasonable to say: &ldquo;Pay us back our money.&rdquo;  Afterwards the ratepayers will have the benefit from the money spent on the rates that will accrue after the lapse of that time, but if we put on their backs the repayment of the money, possibly a small interest charge and rates then, we are putting an impossible burden on people who are acting in the public interest, public-spirited people.  If we were giving a grant and not getting money back I could understand the Minister's argument because the ratepayers would be giving that money, but both these amendments are concerned with what one might call large-scale halls in Dublin City and they would be meeting the requirements of a population such as that of Ballyfermot, as I mentioned yesterday.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to accept that the position that would follow&mdash;not as the Minister says&mdash;is not that the remission of rates as envisaged in Deputy Kennedy's amendment is going to be an imposition on the backs of the ratepayers. In fact it is going to ensure that the ratepayers will get the benefit after a lapse of a limited period of years.  It is going to enable those who are taking on the burden of the running of those parish halls to get on their feet.  After a period of years the hall will be well established, the debt will be paid off, and so on, and then they will be of benefit to the ratepayers. I ask the Minister to see it in that light and to accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>We have no objection whatever to a local authority helping a parish council to erect a hall. They may assist them by way of grant or by way of this loan which we have provided for but I think there is no reason why we should resort to a hidden method of subsidy.  After all, the hall will be subsidised by way of grant or loan and I cannot see why it should be placed in a more advantageous position than a factory or a school.  I cannot see the difference. These parish halls will get a remission under the 1954 Act which will come up for review in July, 1956, and I think the amendment is premature until that time.  We have gone a long way to <Col N="246" /> assist the parish hall both in rural and urban Ireland.</P>
      <P>We have, again, these people prepared now to give loans or grants at the discretion of the local authority. It is milking the cow too much to ask them to give a remission of two-thirds of the rate for seven years, in view of the advantages they got under the 1954 Act, and in view of the fact that schools and factories are in exactly a similar position.  The whole matter will come up for review in July, 1956, and I ask the Deputy to withdraw his amendment.</P>

      <P>I have experience of a local hall on which the valuation was £40.  They are paying back the loan they got, in a ten-year period, to the Carnegie Fund.  The Performing Rights Society followed that committee for a big sum of money which has been settled.  All these burdens make their task well-nigh impossible in the rural areas.</P>
      <P>I would suggest to the Minister that he should compromise.  Where a hall only applies for a loan&mdash;not a big amount&mdash;he should apply this principle of remission of rates.  After all, in the vicinity of the hall you would have 60 houses built, and these will be subsidised by a State grant and subsidised by the local authority.  Some of them will have about £550 in grants, and in addition to that they will have two-thirds remission of rates for a period of seven years.  These halls have been more and more sought after by the health authority for film shows, mass radiography, and a lot of other things. I would suggest to the Minister that he should accept the reamendment of the amendment, that where they only apply for a loan, and therefore repay the loan to the Government, the principle for remission of two-thirds of the rates for seven years should apply.</P>

      <P>(5)  An agreement under paragraph (b) of sub-section (4) of this section may provide for the repayment by the approved local council of the whole or part of the grant (inclusive of such (if any) charges as may be made by the county council in respect of the grant) at such times and in such manner as the county council consider proper.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to delete sub-section (4) of Section 54. This sub-section was inserted in the Bill by way of amendment on the Committee Stage.  It was moved by Deputy Briscoe and was accepted by me under pressure.  Sub-section (4) deletes the requirement in Section 70 of the Local Government (Dublin) Act, 1930, which provided that the consent of two-thirds of the members of the city council must be obtained before expenditure on the decoration of the city may be authorised.  Exactly similar provisions are to be found in the Cork, Limerick and Waterford City Management Acts. The amendment as accepted applies only to Dublin and leaves Cork, Limerick and Waterford as they were.  I have decided for the sake of consistency to amend the corresponding sections of the Cork, Limerick and Waterford Acts.</P>

      <P>(a)  a body, being a body established by statute and not being a local authority, are of opinion that any power, function or duty which may be exercised or performed by them should be exercised or performed, whether generally or in a particular case, by a local authority and</P>

      <P>This amendment is being moved in lieu of amendment No. 17.  This amendment is designed to meet the grammatical criticism made by Deputy Sheldon and, as amended, the section will read, provided the amendment is accepted: &ldquo;Where a body being a body established by statute and not being a local authority are of opinion.&rdquo; I think that will meet Deputy Sheldon's criticism.

    </Speaker>
    <P>I move this amendment because of an amendment which was tabled on the Committee Stage in the names of Deputies Byrne, Belton, Briscoe and Larkin.  The purpose of that amendment, and the purpose of this amendment, is to ensure that Dublin City Council and Dublin County Council will be consulted on any proposal to change the boundaries of the Dublin public assistance districts.  The object of this amendment, and of amendment No. 19, is to achieve the purpose the Deputies had in mind when putting down their amendment originally.  This will require the Minister to furnish a statement of his proposals to the corporation and the county council.  The making of observations on the Minister's statement will be reserved functions by virtue of the next amendment. In other words, the corporation and the county council will be consulted before any changes are made in the boundaries of the Dublin public assistance <Col N="253" /> districts and a statement will be furnished to both these authorities by the Minister and their observations obtained before he makes his decision.</P>

      <P>The shortness of the debate on local government has given this debate some of the characteristics of an ill-rehearsed French farce: we are rushing in and out of our places before our time.  When this debate was adjourned I was referring to the problem of civil defence.  I was saying it had become a problem for every country, and one which concerns every citizen in every country.  It is particularly a problem, however, which is the special responsibility of the Government.  It is a very heavy responsibility.  It is a difficult one to discharge in time of peace because it is always difficult to get people to face up to the fact that peaceful conditions may not continue and it is a particularly difficult task to get them to agree to tax themselves in order to protect themselves.  Nevertheless, <Col N="256" /> I think that, despite the reluctance of people in general to face up to a situation of the kind, the Government should not estop themselves from fulfilling their obligations merely because the Attorney-General during the general election pledged himself to reduce expenditure by £20,000,000 and upwards.  They should forget about the Attorney-General in that connection and face up to the dangers which are inherent in the world situation around us, dangers which may materialise for us all, for those who are at peace as well as for those who are at war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one aspect of the Volume of Estimates which to my mind is of doubtful propriety, and that is the manner in which appropriations from the Grant Counterpart Fund have been dealt with.  These have been brought in as Appropriations-in-Aid of several Votes, notably the Vote for the Department of Agriculture.  Without wishing to reflect on the Minister personally, I should say that, apart from everything else, this manner of dealing with the Grant Counterpart Fund is a little grudging.  I was going to say &ldquo;churlish&rdquo; but I do not want to use the word in that particular context.  Apart altogether from the financial implications of it, the reason why I have doubts that this was the correct way to deal with the help which we shall get from the Grant Counterpart Fund in this coming year is that our Government is indebted to the generosity and benevolence of the United States for the fact that this year the costs of the ground limestone subsidy, the scheme for the eradication of bovine tuberculosis, the scheme for the pasteurisation of separated milk and for the technical assistance projects which relate to agriculture and industry are not to fall on the taxpayer.  All of these various projects will cost the United States almost £1,000,000 in this year and I think that it ill-becomes us&mdash; and I am speaking now collectively&mdash; I wish to make that clear&mdash;and I am using the word in its collective sense as applying to us all&mdash;I think it ill-becomes us to appear to be so ungrate as to try to conceal the fact to which I have referred by bringing the <Col N="257" /> moneys in the Grant Counterpart Fund in as Appropriations-in-Aid.</P>
    <P>Last year and in the preceding years all the expenditure on such services had to be provided for in the Budget.  In years to come, after the grant has been expended, they will have to be provided for in the same way again.  I ask, therefore, why treat the American gift as though it were a normal Appropriation-in-Aid which is something which we collect from those who benefit by the services?  When we see Appropriations-in-Aid used&mdash;quite legitimately used&mdash;to reduce the total amount which the Dáil is asked to provide for public services, we almost invariably find that these Appropriations-in-Aid consist almost mainly of fees which are charged for services rendered from the Votes to which these moneys are appropriated.  That is not the case with the Grant Counterpart Fund.  As I have said, the Marshall Aid Grant is a free gift from the American Government; I think it would be much better, much more appropriate therefore to bring it in the Budget statement as non-tax revenue and have the grace to acknowledge this non-tax revenue as a free gift to us from the American people.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that the only reason why it has not been done in that way is that the Minister for Finance feels himself tied by his colleagues' wild statements.  He has to appropriate the United States gift to reduce in appearance, but not in reality, the cost of the public services.  I have said &ldquo;to reduce in appearance the cost of the public services&rdquo;.  I have said that deliberately because the reduction will be only an apparent reduction.  The real expenditure on all the services to which the Appropriations-in-Aid are made will continue at its former level but the American money, as I have said, is being applied to reduce the figure on the front of the Volume of Estimates by almost £1,000,000.  If taxation for the public services will be less this year by that amount than otherwise it might be, our gratitude under that head goes out, not to our own home Government but to the American Government and to the <Col N="258" /> American people who have provided that £1,000,000.</P>
    <P>But there is one reduction in the Estimates which, coming from the Government which the Labour Party claims to control, is noteworthy indeed. Among the few real economies which have been made in the requirements for the Supply Services is one to which the Taoiseach did not refer.  In fact, when he was trying to excuse the fact that the Government had not fulfilled the pledges which, if he himself did not make them, were certainly made by the Attorney-General&mdash;among the excuses for not giving effect to these pledges was that the Government is not prepared to reduce expenditure upon the social services.  The reluctance to secure reductions at the cost of the social services does not appear to be general and all-embracing because the provision for old age pensions has been reduced.</P>
    <P>Those of us who recall that the Taoiseach some years ago derided old age pensions, widows' and orphans' pensions, children's allowances and the like as a row of medicine bottles will wonder if the bottles are now being emptied.  The Minister for Social Welfare denied last night that this was so.  On the contrary, he told us we would have bigger and bigger medicine bottles and more and more of them until every private purse in the country is purged of its earnings and savings.  Bang again, I may say in that connection, goes the Attorney-General's pledge to reduce public expenditure by £20,000,000 and upwards. That, I may tell the Minister for Finance, is going to be our slogan at the next election: &ldquo;£20,000,000 and upwards is what they promised you. What did they give you?&rdquo;  The Minister for Social Welfare has said that the Government is not cutting the old age pensions.  He says, on the contrary, that they are merely cutting off the old age pensioners&mdash;there are fewer of them.  That, remember, is the justification which the Minister for Social Welfare gave last night for this reduction.  He told us that there were fewer old age pensioners this year than there were when he took office last year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="259" /> The question, naturally, will occur to us, how has the Minister made this saving?  Why are there fewer old age pensioners and what has he done with them?  Has he throttled or strangled or stifled them?  Has he been practising euthanasia&mdash;mercy killing as it is called, murder as it is&mdash;or has he merely been tightening up the means test, making it more difficult for the aged poor to get the pension?  This is a very interesting question and I think it ought to be probed further.  Why are there fewer old age pensioners, as the Minister for Social Welfare tells us, to be provided for this year than there were last year?</P>
    <P>Now I do not think that any person whose means do not warrant it should get the pension.  I believe in a means test and in the fair enforcement of that test.  But the Labour Party, when they were in opposition, pretended to be against a means test of any description in respect of any social service.  Their grumble, for instance, about the Health Act of 1953, which they have tried to nullify, was that it included a means test albeit a very tenuous one.  Yet now that they are in office and in control of the Department of Social Welfare we find them enforcing a means test with a severity and a rigorousness such as was never known before.  In this way the number of old age pensioners who can surmount the barrier and secure a pension has been reduced.  Because of this, the Government are able, by reason of a rigid enforcement of the means test, to boast of a paltry economy of £10,000 on a service which costs over £17,000,000.  In this way, one can truthfully say that the Labour Party grinds the faces of the poor in order to save the face of the Attorney-General who promised to save £20,000,000 and upwards.  A saving of £10,000 from the old age pensioners will not bring us any nearer to that objective&mdash;at least not significantly nearer to that objective.</P>
    <P>Towards the end of his speech yesterday we had a very significant statement from the Minister for Finance&mdash;a statement to which the Taoiseach referred in his speech this <Col N="260" /> afternoon.  Yesterday, in introducing the Vote, the Minister said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Also in pursuance of this aim of stability I made representations on behalf of the Government last week to the banks so that if at all possible interest charges here would not increase&mdash;though, as I said last week, any question as to our economic position is one that must be watched.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Any person reading this statement must notice at once that the Minister begins to hedge towards the tail end of his statement when he says that &ldquo;any question of our economic position is one that must be watched.&rdquo;  From this reservation I gather that the arguments which the banks may have used in their discussions with him must have impressed themselves upon the Minister for Finance even though the pressure of his colleagues in the Cabinet may have compelled him to disregard these arguments.</P>
    <P>The real point I want to get to is the significance of that statement&mdash;the significance of what has been done during the past week or so.  I think the statement requires some further elucidation not merely on the part of the Minister but on the part of the directors of the banks whom he has found so amenable to his representations that he has, in fact, thanked them publicly.  I, in my two terms of office as Minister for Finance, have had many interviews with the representatives of the Irish banks in regard to money matters, and I must say that I have never found them very pliant or pusillanimous.  Nor do I think that they found me a very easy man to deal with on the other side.  I have always found them concerned to safeguard their depositors, to maintain the widest possible basis of credit in this country and to deal fairly and reasonably with the Government when it required their co-operation.  I have always found them concerned also to preserve the stability and security of the financial institutions with which they were associated and to further the development of our economy in every reasonable way.  I have talked very frankly to the banks and they <Col N="261" /> have talked with equal frankness to me.  We have met around a table. We have not withheld anything from each other which we felt it was in the public interest to say to each other. In regard to the bank rate, however, they maintained a position which this year they have suddenly departed from.  As I have said, I think that the fact that they have done so&mdash;after the representations which have been made to them by Ministers for Finance since the foundation of this State&mdash;requires not merely some statement from the Minister but also some statement from the Irish Banks Standing Committee.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned he had made representations to the Banks. &ldquo;Representations&rdquo; is a word which has many shades of meaning.  It may cover a multitude of sins.  Did the representations take the form of telling the banks: &ldquo;You had better do what the Government want, or else...&rdquo;? That would be one form of representation which, in present circumstances, might be coereive.  Or was it for the sake of the Minister's charming blue eyes that this unprecedented departure from the traditional practice was made?  I for one do not think it was a tribute to the Minister's personality that the banks departed from the previous practice.</P>
    <P>I think the potentially coercive approach of the Minister had a great deal to do with the new attitude.  Were the banks, under irresistible pressure, to conform to the Government's &ldquo;Diktat&rdquo;?  If the banks were coerced in this way will the same pressure be brought on insurance companies or on our large industrial enterprises to conform to the political exigencies of the Government of the day?  One may well ask if the Government's interference in this matter is a step towards the nationalisation of the banks or perhaps the Sovietisation of the banks might be a better word.  If so, how far off is the expropriation of all significant private enterprise?</P>
    <P>The banks have to manage their business and administer their trust because it is in the position of a trustee that a bank stands in relation <Col N="262" /> to its depositors.  If the banks have to administer their trust under pressure from the Government, what is going to be the position of any other private enterprise in this country?  Is the same pressure going to be brought to bear upon Guinness, upon Jacobs, on the Press to do and say what the Government want?  Is it towards this general extension of Government interference with private enterprise and with the personal responsibility of individuals who control or direct these enterprises that the Fine Gael Party is now tending in order that it may keep in line with its allies and associates of the Irish Labour Party?</P>
    <P>I do not think that the Irish people want to move in that direction.  I think they want to be free in their business. They want the custodians of their savings to be free to fulfil their obligations to them.</P>
    <P>In my view, it was very ill-advised on the part of the Minister to compel and coerce the banks to do something which he and his colleagues thought was to their political advantage, irrespective of whether it was or was not to the general advantage of the economy of this country.  There has been drawn since last week a very sharp line between two classes of those who have entrusted their moneys to the Irish banks.  Below that line are those whose deposits do not amount to £25,000 and upwards, and to whom a low deposit rate will be paid.  Where the deposits are £25,000 and upwards, where the deposits are the property of wealthy people or of wealthy corporations, they are going to get quite a different treatment from the treatment that will be meted to the small businessman, the average farmer and, indeed, one might say the thrifty labourer or thrifty workman.  I wonder what the farmers of West Cork, for whom Deputy M.P. Murphy speaks so often in this House, will think when they realise that Messrs.  Guinness, Messrs. Jacob, C.I.E. or some of those others will get a higher rate on the money which they may have on deposit in the Irish banks than will be given to any farmer in this country who is putting his savings into the same institution to build up perhaps a dowry for his daughter or to accumulate <Col N="263" /> something with which to educate his son.</P>
    <P>It is all very well to talk about giving people loans at cheap rates of interest, lending at low rates to people who are in business, but the number of depositors in the Irish banks far exceeds the number of borrowers and in this case the many have been sacrificed for the few.  Everybody who knows anything about business knows this&mdash; that so long as the rates of interest do not exceed the 5, 6 or 7 per cent. level what is paid in interest in any sound and well-managed business does not involve any substantial burden upon it.  In fact, the high standard rate of income-tax has made such a mockery of rates of interest, as it has made a mockery of salaries and earnings, that when the rate of interest goes up, the Government has to contribute 7/6 towards every £ of interest paid.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Then the whole bank rate policy in England&mdash;up or down&mdash; does not mean anything?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not talking about the bank rate policy in England; I am talking about one simple fact&mdash; that without any legal title or right to do so the Minister brought in the big stick to the Irish banks and I am wondering where that is going to end, particularly in view of a fairly significant thing which happened two or three weeks ago.  A certain firm in this city &mdash;I am holding no brief for them, making no apology for them, and I do not defend their action in any way, for I am not called on either to defend or condemn it&mdash;asserted its legal right to act in a way which displeased the Minister for Industry and Commerce. What did he do?  He exercised the powers vested in him in this House to do certain things in the general interest, powers which he was supposed to exercise impartially in respect of every citizen and every businessman, he used those powers in such a way as to discriminate against this firm which had committed no crime, broken no law, but had merely aserted the right, as many people do to-day, to decide whether to sell their goods or not to sell their goods to certain individuals. <Col N="264" /> The Minister for Industry and Commerce did that.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance, apparently, has gone to the banks in a similar mood to compel them to manage their business in his way.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce wants this particular firm he dislikes&mdash; not a banking firm, merely a private firm &mdash; to manage its business in the way in which the Minister for Industry and Commerce wants it to be managed. One may ask how long is this to go on? How far is it going to go?  Must the business affairs of private enterprises and of private individuals be conducted henceforward in whatever way may conform to the whim of any Minister of any Government?  That is why I am raising this issue, because I think it was a deplorable thing for the Government to do, to compel the banks to act against their better judgment. It is a deplorable thing for the Government to do, and having done it they must accept full responsibility for everything that happens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have spoken about the depositors, but the shareholders may have to be considered, too.  And a much more serious thing may happen, if these large depositors who have substantial liquid funds decide, in view of what has happened on this particular occasion, that the Government may want to go further and try to prevent the free flow of funds in and out of this country.  It may then come to a position in which these large depositors will decide to take their moneys out of this country and withdraw them from the custody of our Irish banks and out of reach of the Irish Government, and invest them elsewhere. What will be the effect of that on our economy?  As the Minister knows well it will have the affect of narrowing the basis of our credit.  It will compel the banks, whether they like it or not, in the interests of stability and security and the welfare of their depositors, to curtail credit, to impose restrictions, and to reduce the normal amount of their advances.  They must do this if withdrawals leave less lendable funds available than there are at the present time.  That is what will inevitably happen here if the action of the <Col N="265" /> Minister in interfering with the discretion and responsibilities of the banks to manage their affairs in the way which seems to them wisest and best should lead large holders of liquid balances to remove them altogether.  If the banks lose considerable sums which have been deposited with them the loss will compel them in the interests of stability and security to reduce their advances to business enterprise here.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that the Minister, in the course of his statement, said that he proposed to have a review, an examination, of our capital programme.  I for one&mdash;and I am speaking now as an individual&mdash;welcome it.  I think it is time for us in this country&mdash;and I want to speak now without any political polemics in regard to it&mdash;to consider the extent to which our economy can sustain the expanding capital programme which we have embarked upon.  We have, perhaps, been spoiled by the fact that we had, first of all, a backlog of capital development to overtake; secondly, we had resources which piled up and which we were unable to find an outlet for during the war, and thirdly, we got the Marshall Aid loan.  All these factors combined have led us, I believe, to lose sight of the fact that ours is a predominantly agricultural economy in which there has been, over centuries, marked under-investment in agriculture.  Yet, we have endeavoured, on top of that underdeveloped agricultural economy, to impose an intensive programme of capital development.</P>
    <P>That may be right or it may be wrong, but I, myself, would certainly welcome any investigation which the Minister would make in that regard. I think that the investigation is overdue. We might have undertaken it had we remained in office.  But if we did we should have been told that we were curtailing capital development and we should have been told, as we have been told by the Taoiseach speaking with a different voice and in a different tone to that which he used to-day, and, particularly, by Deputy McGilligan and Deputy Dillon, that we are driving people out of employment and out of this country.  The fact of the matter is that&mdash;having regard <Col N="266" /> to the heavy charges which are accumulating on our Central Fund in respect of the numerous loans which have been floated over the past number of years&mdash;we shall have to consider seriously whether there cannot be some more remunerative allocation as between public capital development and private enterprise of the savings of our people from year to year.</P>
    <P>That brings me to another aspect of our financial position on which, speaking personally, I would like to comment. All the great controversial issues that have divided this country have been virtually settled to our satisfaction, settled by us, settled by Fianna Fáil.  We have removed the oath of allegiance; we have retained the annuities; we have given the people the Constitution of 1937 which is now universally accepted.  Every objectionable feature of the Treaty has disappeared except one, and that is Partition.  Unfortunately, that is being made, in my view, more difficult of solution by some of the measures that have been advocated in this House recently, and have been adopted outside it.  I do not want to open a debate on that.</P>

      <P>The majority of elected representatives in Dáil Éireann in 1922, under the threat of immediate and terrible war and of the coercion that leading lay and clerical public men outside brought upon them, accepted the Treaty by a narrow majority.  That was the first time that the elected representatives of the Irish people accepted Partition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We regret and deplore the fact; but I do not want to reopen that issue. What I am saying now is that the big issues which used to divide this House, the issue of the land annuities, the issue of the oath, the issue of the appeal to the House of Lords, the issue of the governor-generalship, the old Constitution of 1922, have all disappeared. <Col N="267" /> We have universally accepted the Constitution of 1937.  I think the time is coming when there will have to be a pact among honest men who enter politics that they are going to stop bidding for the popular vote, that they will stop trying to buy themselves into office by the bribery and corruption of the electorate by misleading the people with promises which are made only to be broken.  It is time, for instance, to get away from the disgraceful conduct of the former Minister for Finance, now the Attorney-General, who wrote a letter to the paper, promising a section of the population almost £1,000,000 if they would only vote for him and his Party.</P>
    <P>A Guard in the street whom I met expressed that to me in a way which brought home to me very forcibly what was being done by that transaction, when he said: &ldquo;Do you know, Mr. MacEntee, Mr. McGilligan last night offered my wife and myself £19, if only we would vote for him to-day?&rdquo;  That is what the bribe amounted to, and I am suggesting that those of us on both sides of this House, who if we were attacked and at war would behave decently and honourably, should behave in the same way now that we are at peace.  I am urging that we should stop making a mockery of democracy, dragging it down to the lowest level&mdash;I was going to say Tammany politics&mdash;of public corruption in any State in the world and that we should refrain henceforward from making promises to the people which we know in our heart and soul we cannot fulfil.</P>

      <P>If I were Minister for Finance I should feel remarkably happy having listened to the speeches delivered from the Opposition Benches. In fact, there has been little or no serious criticism of the financial policy put forward by the Government.  To my mind the most important aspect of the financial policy of the Government as announced by the Minister for Finance is undoubtedly the question of the bank rate and the rates at which money is to be made available.  As far as I know only two of the speakers <Col N="268" /> who have spoken from the Fianna Fáil Benches have made any reference to that development.  Deputy Briscoe referred to it yesterday in very guarded terms, commendably so, terms which I thought might even connote that he in fact approved of the action of the Minister for Finance in having intimated to the banks that it might not be in the national interest to increase rates of interest.  True, Deputy Briscoe did not say in so many words that he approved of this development but he certainly expressed no disapproval of it.  The other speaker who referred to it from the Fianna Fáil Benches was Deputy MacEntee.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>There may have been. I was not here the whole time but I thought it was only one or two speakers who dealt with it.  I do not think the Leader of the Opposition mentioned it at all, nor, if I am not mistaken, did Deputy Aiken mention it.  I was very interested in listening to Deputy MacEntee to try to anticipate what attitude he would adopt in regard to it.  The earlier portions of his speech were what might be generally described as trivial until he came to this portion of his speech.  Deputy MacEntee took the plunge in no uncertain terms.  He committed himself and, unless members of his Party make their attitude clear, he committed his Party, to a policy which would allow the British Treasury to decide the rates of interest payable by our people in Ireland and not our own Government. That is the truth as to the position that has existed here since 1921.  Willy-nilly our banks have automatically based their rates of interest on the credit policy of the British Treasury for the time being.  That was done irrespective of the national interest, irrespective of the financial or credit requirements of our own people and our own nation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The pursuit of this policy has been, in no small measure, responsible for a large proportion of the chronic unemployment which we have suffered, and for the wholesale emigration which depletes our nation.  It is recognised, <Col N="269" /> I think, by economists the world over that, to a large extent, the productive and employment position of any nation can be guided, very nearly determined, by the credit and financial policy which the State pursues.  We have had, in fact, no credit or financial policy of our own since the State was set up. We have allowed the credit and financial policy of the State to be determined, not by our own requirements, but by the requirements of the British Treasury.  It might be said that there is no harm in that.  There would be no harm in it if the interests of British economy coincided with the interests of our own economy.  The basic fault in the pursuit of that policy lay in the fact that practically every single factor of the British economy is different from the equivalent factors in our economy.</P>
    <P>Britain is a highly industrialised country, a large nation with colonies throughout the world.  We are a small, agricultural and undeveloped country. Britain has achieved full employment, and might be said to suffer through over-full employment.  We, on the other hand, suffer from chronic emigration and unemployment.  It is quite obvious that the financial policy that suits Britain in regard to the employment position, for instance, is diametrically opposed to the financial policy which we should pursue here.</P>
    <P>The deflationary policy put into operation in Britain from time to time is largely brought into operation in order to remedy over-full employment, because when full employment reaches a certain level it is found that it is difficult to obtain labour, or direct labour into a particular channel.  One of the reasons for the pursuit of a deflationary policy in Britain, both in 1952 and now again, was to remedy that position.  Would it not be fantastic that we who suffer from a high rate of unemployment should automatically adopt the policy which is destined and intended to create unemployment? Yet, that is what we have been doing steadily over the past 30 years.</P>
    <P>Now, for the first time in our history, <Col N="270" /> as the result of views expressed by the Minister for Finance, our financial and credit policy has not been determined merely to meet the requirements of the British Treasury, but in order to meet the requirements of our own economy. In my view, this is the most important economic step in the history of this State since 1921.  It is the first and practically the only step that this State has taken towards achieving economic independence.  We have had practically no economic independence up till now.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the members of the Fianna Fáil party to examine this question objectively.  I do not believe that Deputy MacEntee represents the views of 20 per cent. of the Fianna Fáil Party either in this House or outside this House.  If he does not represent their viewpoint, then they should make their own viewpoint known.  It would appear that in both national and economic matters the Fianna Fáil Party, which was a progressive Party nationally and economically, has now succeeded in changing its position and in going to the extreme right, politically and economically.  I can only judge by the speech made by Deputy MacEntee.</P>
    <P>Let me say this straight away: there is room in this country for a small right-wing ultra-conservative Party holding views such as those put forward by Deputy MacEntee, who is perfectly entitled to hold those views, and put them forward.  It would be useful to have a policy of that kind in the House.  But I do not think it is the intention of the Fianna Fáil Party to play that rôle.  The sooner the air is cleared on this question the better.  I am not trying to be bitter or critical of the Deputy; I am merely trying to put forward the position objectively. I do not think that Deputy MacEntee's views coincide, for instance, with the views of Deputy Briscoe, or many other Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party.  I think they have a completely different approach in these economic matters. Deputies who may not agree with Deputy MacEntee's views should get together and put forward their viewpoint.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly Deputy Allen has not even read some of the articles in his own paper on the question of the bank rate.  Articles have been published in the <i>Irish Press</i> and the <i>Evening Press</i> by Mr. Colbert&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in which he pointed out that one of the principal evils of the economy of this country was that the credit rates were, in fact, dictated in Threadneedle Street without regard to the national interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>That was not our policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>Apparently that was the policy Fianna Fáil pursued during <Col N="273" /> the 20 years in which they had control of the economic destinies of the country and, if one is to take seriously the speech made by Deputy MacEntee to-night, it is still the policy of Fianna Fáil to revert to that policy if they were in power to-morrow.  I do not know whether Deputy MacEntee was serious in the speech he made to-night, whether he intended it be to a serious expression of the policy of his Party. He certainly gave one the impression of having thought it out well.  Whether he was serious or not, I shall have to make this harsh criticism of his speech: it was an irresponsible and mischievous speech for an ex-Minister for Finance to make.  It was a speech which was calculated, firstly, to try and create a certain degree of panic and, secondly, to try and encourage the banks to an attitude of opposition to the views of the Government on credit policy, and to that extent it was definitely an irresponsible and mischievous speech for a Deputy who held the position of Minister for Finance to make at this stage.</P>
      <P>I should like to assure the Government that they would have the wholehearted support of the people of this country were they to consider it necessary to take any steps to ensure that the credit policy of the State would be under the control of the people and not under the control of either a group of banks or the British Treasury&mdash;a group of banks most of which have their headquarters not in this country but outside this country.  I feel quite certain that if the Government felt it necessary to take measures to ensure that at least in so far as the credit policy of the State is concerned it should be under the control of the Irish people, they would get the full support of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Likewise, I think that if the Government considered it necessary to take steps to restrict the flow of capital, the country would willingly give the Government those powers.  I should like to hear from many Deputies particulars of any country in the world other than this country which allows its economic and financial policy to be determined, not by the requirements of that <Col N="274" /> country, but by a set of bankers in another country.  As far as I know this is the only country in the world where the Government has no say or control over financial or credit policy.</P>
    <P>I am sure many Deputies will recall that in England, when the Labour Government felt it necessary to obtain powers to control the Bank of England, they took those powers.  True, there was a certain amount of criticism at the time from the Opposition Party, from the Tories, but when the Tories returned to power they continued to utilise the same powers and never altered the position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>They only took control of the Bank of England, not the other banks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>But that, as Deputy Briscoe knows, is quite sufficient.  Why control ten banks?  Banking is a commerce in which there is no competition and in which there can be no competition against the State bank, so it was quite sufficient for the Labour Government in England to acquire control of the Bank of England in order to dominate the credit position there.  The Labour Government found it necessary to do that and the significant fact is that the Conservative Government has never altered the position and has utilised these powers in order to dominate credit and impose the credit policy of the Conservative Government in England.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>It that why they put the bank rate up?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Now I would appeal to members of the Fianna Fáil Party not to approach this question merely on the basis of advocating something other than what is being done, or of opposing the action of the Government merely for the sake of opposition.  They must know in their heart of hearts that this was a sound step and, I think, if I can interpret the minds of many of them, their only reaction is: &ldquo;Why did we not do that ourselves ten or 20 years ago?&rdquo;  Now my only interest&mdash;possibly that is an <Col N="275" /> understatement&mdash;my principal interest in relation to Government expenditure and to the economic policy of the Government is its likely bearing on the employment situation.  It is well recognised that the financial policy of the Government determines to a large extent the degree and extent of employment in the years ahead.</P>
      <P>The Estimates which have been put forward will not in any way reduce employment.  The credit policy which the Government is pursuing is one which is likely to promote employment. Certainly it is a very different policy from the policy which the last Government unfortunately succeeded in imposing on the country from 1951 to 1954.  I do not want to quote unemployment figures merely to score points against the last Government, but I feel those figures should be remembered because they show the extent to which the financial policy of a Government does affect employment. As a result of an expansion of credit and of capital development by February, 1951, we had reached the position where we had 63,000 people unemployed&mdash;the lowest figure on record for that period.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>By 1953, two years afterwards, at the end of February, as a result of the deflationary policy pursued and the restriction of credit, we reached the position where Fianna Fáil had 89,000 unemployed.  That was no accident.  It was no act of God. It was not due to a change in weather conditions.  It was due to the pursuit of a deflationary policy which had been decided on in London without any regard to the economic requirements of this nation.  Now, after a few months in office, under this Government there has been an expansion of credit and a consequential fall in unemployment; unemployment is down to 72,000 odd.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Deputy in what way does he maintain deflation was brought about by the previous Government?  What is the specific instance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the <Col N="276" /> Deputy has raised that point.  A deflationary policy was brought about because of the financial policy of the Department of Finance, a policy over which the Minister for Finance stood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Deputy give us a specific instance of how it was applied?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>By means of directives to the banks to restrict credit. The Deputy will recall that I read in the House at the time a Department of Finance memorandum which had been released to O.E.E.C. in which great credit was taken for having achieved a reduction in credit, having stopped credit expansion and brought about a reduction in the amount of credit available.  If the Deputy looks up the records of the House he will find the quotation I gave from the Department of Finance circular.  All that was part and parcel of the policy of the last Minister for Finance. Indeed, it was the policy which the ex-Minister for Finance adumbrated once again here this evening.</P>

      <P>I was interested to hear Deputy MacEntee to-night suggesting in effect that capital development should be reduced.  He did not say that, but he did not go very far from saying it; he said the time had been reached when we should examine whether or not we could afford to <Col N="277" /> carry on the present rate of capital development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance said that yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did not say that in so many words.  The Minister, as I interpreted him, was giving some form of lip-service to the ever-pressing pressure of the Department of Finance to reduce capital expenditure.  He was doing so as nicely as he could but I do not think it was a serious suggestion that capital development should be in any way curtailed.  I am not going to deal with that.  It speaks for itself.  Any curtailment of capital development would be bound to lead to increased unemployment and increased emigration.  What I would like to say a few words on is the question of afforestation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether Deputy Allen feels safe about it.  He might not have a very easy conscience about it&mdash;if he had taken an active part in the workings of afforestation under his Government over a long period of time.  Now that Deputy Allen is provoking me on it, would Deputy Allen like to know how much money his Government provided for afforestation in 1948, when I first came into this House?  &mdash;£393,000. When we came into office in 1951, we increased it to £1,143,000.  Does Deputy Allen and does the House know that the first step of his Minister for Finance, in 1952, was to slash £250,000 off the Forestry Vote?</P>

      <P>There was a lot of talk about the money&mdash;I think £75,000 was the amount&mdash;made available for the purchase of land for afforestation this year.  I am assured by the Minister for Lands that, in addition to that £75,000, there is a carry-over of £75,000 from last year.  That would make a total of £150,000 available for the purchase of land this year.  Now, when we are on that subject, does Deputy Allen or do the Deputies on the Fianna Fáil Benches know how much was provided for the purchase of land for afforestation in 1948?&mdash;£8,000.</P>

Eight thousand pounds were provided for the <Col N="279" /> purchase of land for afforestation in 1948.  The total Estimate for afforestation in 1948 was £393,000.  We increased it to £1,100,000.  The Minister for Finance in the Fianna Fáil Government, who spoke just before me, slashed it by £250,000 as his first act in framing his Estimates in 1952.</P>

      <P>I do.  The acreage is far below what it should be.  I understand that the aim this year is to plant 15,000 acres and that that target will be reached.

What concerns me&mdash;and I think it is the thing that we often overlook&mdash;is the effect of the budgetary and financial policy of the Government on employment.  To my mind that is the determining factor.  I do not mind how much money we have to spend in order to provide work for our people. I do not mind how much money we have to spend in order to save our young people from having to emigrate to the slums of England.  It is money well spent.</P>

I felt that, while that political criticism might be understood here, it was highly irresponsible on the part of the last Government to practically encourage an anti-American campaign.  I was glad, therefore, to-night to see Deputy MacEntee do a somersault and to hear him express his gratitude and the gratitude of his Party for the generosity of the American people and Government in having made this money available to us.</P>

      <P>I am not aware that since Queen Victoria sent £5 over as a gift to the famine fund here, at a time when the Sultan of Turkey sent a couple of ship loads of food, this country ever received a free gift of anything from any other country until America gave us a free gift of £5,000,000.  I am glad that Deputy MacEntee did express his gratitude.  I feel it was a pity that that question should ever have become involved in political issues here, or that Deputy MacEntee should have made statements suggesting that America was trying to put this country in pawn or was trying to impose political or military conditions upon our country as a result of the Marshall Aid grant.</P>

      <Col N="282" /> I congratulate the Government and the Minister on their Book of Estimates. I congratulate them, above all, on having taken the first step towards the achievement of economic independence in this country.  I hope that, when we come to Budget time, the Government will consider the taking of steps to give effect to the proposals which the Taoiseach mentioned in this House for the setting up of a national investment board.  Undoubtedly, one of our principal problems arises from the lack of investment possibilities here and one of the first essentials is the creation of a national investment board.  In my view, that would be the first step towards ensuring that we would utilise and invest at home a higher percentage of our earnings than we have done in the past.</P>

      <P>Various aspects of these Estimates have been discussed by Deputies on both sides of the House.  I am sure each Deputy is concerned with that part of this Book of Estimates which relates to the people with whom he is most in touch.  Deputy MacBride has just said that he is not concerned about the reduction of Estimates and that he does not worry about what amount of money has to be provided if it goes towards the employment of our people and the prevention of emigration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I perfectly agree with him in that statement.  On that basis, I want to look into the things which go to make up the reductions in the Book of Estimates which is before us to-night.  My first inclination is to ask myself in what way will these reductions confer benefit on the poor people of this country, on the 72,000 unemployed and on the thousands who have left the country in the past eight months to bring the figure of unemployed down to 72,000.  I understand that, this year, a sub-committee of the Cabinet was appointed to go into the Estimates and that that sub-committee went to each Department and said: &ldquo;Cut down your Estimates, no matter how you do it; we just will not accept what you are submitting to us.&rdquo;  In <Col N="283" /> other words, for political reasons, we must show a reduction on the face of the Book of Estimates, no matter what the amount is, so that we can point out that the trend is downwards.</P>
      <P>I agree that the people throughout the country are anxiously waiting to see where the reductions will be and of what they are composed.  It is well known that this country is practically overrun with civil servants.  The poor people who are fleeing from the congested areas are well aware that we shall soon have a public servant for every five of the population.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>They increased in your time to a significant figure and they are still increasing.  You cannot shirk responsibility for it one iota.  If the Minister had come in here yesterday and pointed out that he had reduced the numbers by some thousands and, as a result, created economies whose benefits would be passed on by way of providing employment for the poor people of this country then we could say that we are really moving in the right direction and that the trend is in the proper direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What have we in these reductions for the congested areas in the West of Ireland?  What consolation is it to the people there to know that rural electrification will not be pursued with the same vigour as in the past?  What consolation will it be to the people in those areas to know that the grant has been withdrawn when the work is only yet half done?  Some months ago, when the amended Health Bill was being discussed in this House, the Minister for Health apologised for not being able to implement some of the most important sections of that measure.  The excuse he gave was that Fianna Fáil had not been pursuing the building of hospitals fast enough and that there were not hospital beds to be found for all the patients who would be seeking them if all the provisions of the Act were implemented. A few months after that the Minister for Finance comes into this House and points out that the reason for the drastic reductions in the money for the building of hospitals is that we are <Col N="284" /> unable to carry on with the hospitals programme as fast as we would like to. Yesterday, Deputy S. Collins said we had almost reached the end of our hospitalisation programme.</P>
    <P>The statements by the Minister for Finance and Deputy S. Collins contradict the paramount excuse made by the Minister for Health a few months ago for not implementing the more important sections of the Health Act. Furthermore, there is a serious reduction in the employment that would be derived from this building programme which was set in motion by Dr. Browne when he was Minister for Health.  Not merely will that programme be slowed down now but the consequent unemployment which must result from the slowing-down will react on people who might otherwise look forward to an accelerated building programme in their different counties.  We can see that the implementation of the remaining provisions of the Health Act must be delayed longer than we anticipated and, perhaps, as Deputy Dr. Esmonde forecast, they may never come into effect.  That is another of the disadvantages which the poor people find in these reductions which have been extolled by the Minister as one of the greatest things that ever happened in the Government of this country.</P>
    <P>A reduction in the Book of Estimates sounds well but how it is brought about is the more important factor so far as the poor people of the country are concerned.  I agree with Deputy MacBride when he says that we should not be concerned with reductions if money has to be provided for employment and for the prevention of emigration.</P>
    <P>Among other things in which we find economies effected in order to bring about this reduction is Bord na Móna. The research department of Bord na Móna has performed some of the most useful work any body has ever performed in this country and if it was only the perfection of the Móna Jet Burner alone which has given new hope for the production of peat in this country&mdash;and that was only one of the things achieved in their time&mdash;if it was only the perfection of that system of heating which has put peat on a new <Col N="285" /> high level in this country, the research department has justified its existence. I would like to see more money placed at its disposal so that its work could be accelerated and increased, but we find here that the money provided for them is drastically reduced because, again, the poor people of the bog areas were likely to benefit, and the people least likely to give any trouble are usually the victims when there is a reduction being made by Departments.</P>
    <P>Housing grants are reduced at a time when most Ministers&mdash;and all of us, in fact&mdash;are anxious that private building should be increased in quantity and tempo.  Is there any consolation there for the 72,000 unemployed in this country or for the 12,000 who emigrated in the last eight months?  Is there any consolation there for the people who still have to live in rural slums?</P>
    <P>I cannot see in this matter of afforestation, about which Deputy MacBride spoke at such great length, how a progressive afforestation policy can be sustained by reducing the amount provided for acquisition of land by £60,000.  If anybody can point out to me how that represents &amp; sustained, progressive policy of increased afforestation, he will be explaining something which I am now unable to comprehend.  I can easily understand the programme being maintained for this year on the land that has been placed at their disposal and on the maintenance of plantations which are already put down, and there is a very large increase for maintenance of forests&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I fail to see how anybody can prove to this House that the Government is seriously considering a progressive increase in afforestation by reducing the amount for <Col N="286" /> acquisition of land.  Everyone knows that an increase in afforestation can only be maintained by having acquired well in advance the extra land that is necessary to maintain that increase. There, again, is one of the things that has been singled out in order to create a better face on the Book of Estimates.</P>
      <P>Defence has again been the target for a saving.  It always seems to be considered fair game and now the stores are being cleared out, and the actual socks are being taken off our Army in order to make the Book of Estimates look better in the eyes of the public.  We have a recruiting campaign at the moment and it would appear that we will have our men defending the different barracks throughout the country with water-pistols.</P>

      <P>When the Minister is talking about the question of obsolete weapons or weapons which do not conform with modern requirements, I wonder does he take into consideration the fact that we might have a few antiquated and obsolete officers?  We will have an opportunity of discussing that on another Estimate.  I can see the Leas-Cheann Comhairle becoming apprehensive but I will have more to say about that on another day when the Estimate for the Department of Defence comes before this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bord na Móna, rural electrification, housing, tourism, wheat, hospitalisation&mdash;these are the things that are being bandied across the floor as a credit to the present Government because they have cut down the things which go to make for fuller employment for our people and a better standard of living.  I fail to see how the Labour Party in this House can reconcile their past policy, or alleged policy, with the proposals contained in the small reduction which is effected in this Book.  Do you find anything taken off the non-productive shoulders of public servants that have been added to the various Departments of this State over a number of years? Do they suffer anything in the reductions which are being effected here in every single instance on the poorer sections, the sections that are suffering <Col N="287" /> as a result of the few reductions that are brought in here?  The Labour Deputies know that very well.</P>
    <P>I do not see what is to be boasted about in bringing to this House, just for the sake of showing a reduced Estimate, a Book of Estimates which in every instance of reduction takes from the development potentialities of this country or from a standard of living which would give the people a chance of living here instead of seeking employment in other lands.  I think that the Minister for Finance should apologise for the reductions which he has effected and that somebody on the Government side of the House should make an effort to point out to the 72,000 unemployed in this country in what way these reductions hold out brighter prospects for them in the future, in what way the future economy will be enhanced by the reduction in the amount available for hospitalisation; by the reduction in the amount available for housing, for afforestation, for Bord na Móna, by the withdrawal of the grant for rural electrification, by cleaning out the stores of the Army.  I fail to see how in one single instance the downtrodden people in this country can find one glimmer of hope in this reduction for which you are patting yourself on the back for the past two days.  Again I say I agree with Deputy MacBride.  I am not concerned with reductions in any Estimate.  What I am concerned with is what amount is made available towards bringing about increased employment for our people.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance was careful in his opening speech that he had inserted not one single statement with regard to the future effect of these reductions.  Everything he said was a complete contradiction of what he had been saying on this side of the House for the past three years.  Like other speakers who have spoken from that side of the House they entirely confined themselves to ridiculing Fianna Fáil with regard to the past. They boasted they were able to hold the cost of living from going too high but made no attempt to forecast what the future might hold.  When the back <Col N="288" /> benchers of the Party turn to the Minister and wonder what the future will hold as a result of the Estimates before them now and see that he has changed his attitude on that side of the House as compared with that which he adopted when he spoke from the Opposition Benches, they will realise that it is merely a policy of wishful thinking, hoping something may turn up in the future to obviate the effects of this reduction in the Book of Estimates for the coming year.</P>
    <P>If the Minister has changed his attitude from what it used to be when he was in opposition it is merely telling his back benchers that they should perhaps borrow a phrase from the Hospitals Trust wireless programme: &ldquo;It makes no difference where you are, you can wish upon a star.&rdquo;  The attitude is: &ldquo;Let the future look after itself.  We hope something may turn up.  We have reduced the amount on the face of the Book of Estimates.  We have done it at the expense of the congested areas, of the unemployed, houses, rural electrification, Bord na Móna, hospitalisation, but we hope for the best in the future.  We cannot tell you what may happen.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>No, definitely not.  It is evident the Deputy does not want to hear the explanation and to hear the truth.  He is trying to put me off my track, but if I am kept off it for a quarter of an hour I will come back to it and tease the matter out.  The Leader of the Opposition made a rather fraudulent case because he himself must know the truth.  He stated that the Grant-in-Aid for the purchase of land for afforestation was reduced by £60,000.  It is, and why?  I will give the information for the benefit of those Deputies who do not seem to know.  I think Deputy Brennan has it in the back of his mind that a Grant-in-Aid is like every other sub-head in the ordinary Vote of a Department, that it finishes at the end of the financial year.  It does not, and the reason we were able to reduce that by £60,000 was that my predecessor in office made me a free gift of £75,000 that was voted last year for the purchase of land and that he did not spend.</P>

Fianna Fáil Ministers and Governments are very fond of coming into this House, voting huge sums of money but taking jolly good care that not one penny was spent.  Let me go back now a few years to the Estimates of 1944, 1945, and 1946.  You will find there an Estimate for subsidies for fertilisers for the farmers.  In one case a subsidy of £250,000 was voted here but I will ask Deputy Briscoe, who was a member of the House then, how much was spent out of that subsidy.</P>

      <P>The Fianna Fáil party certainly played up to the people of the country, giving them the impression that they were going to benefit, when that Party had no intenion of spending one penny of the money in the Book of Estimates.  I need not mention the subsidy on fertilisers, nor need I remind them of the famous biscuit factory at Ballina.  Under the Health Act brought in here the people of this country were under the impression that, at any moment, if they became sick or any member of a family became sick, they would have a specialist, a hospital-bed and a nurse at their head.  I think that it is not decent for a Government to fool hundreds of thousands of people in that way. Another deception put across the people of this country was the promise that, if Fianna Fáil got into power, they would maintain the food subsidies.</P>
      <P>I smiled listening to Deputy MacEntee to-night, when he said that the time had come when we should stop bidding for votes.  I will ask the House to recall the 29th May 1951, a few days before the general election, when the Deputy, who was to become Minister for Finance three or four days later, told the people in the Town Hall at Rathmines that bad-minded people were going up and down the country saying that, if Fianna Fáil were returned to power, they would impose a tax on tobacco and drink.  Deputy MacEntee said that there was no truth in that rumour.  Yet when he became Minister the tax was put back, and certain food subsidies sliced, that had been maintained during the years.</P>

      <P>What is getting under their skins is that I am exposing the dodging which their leader carried on yesterday, when he said that we were cutting down the purchase of land for afforestation.  I could have done exactly the same as Fianna Fáil did. If I have £150,000 for the purchase of land this year, I will be doing very well even if I spend £135,000 of it.  I would be very happy to get enough land from the farmers for afforestation purposes.  I would like to hear that nymph of forestry, Deputy Eamon de Valera, who spoke to us last night, telling us exactly what he did about afforestation.</P>
      <P>Let us just take a few years and show what Fianna Fáil did for afforestation.  Take 1941-42.  They planted in that year 4,900 acres; in 1942-43 it was 4,482 acres; in 1943-44 it was 4,022 acres; in 1944-45 the acreage was 4,230; 1945-46 brought a big reduction.  In that year the acreage was down to 3,500, and in the following year 3,850 acres were planted.  These are the people who now want to claim that they were the patrons of afforestation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say this&mdash;I want to make this acknowledgment.  When I was Minister for Lands from 1948 to 1951 I got invaluable assistance from Deputy MacBride and I do not take all credit for the progress that was made in <Col N="294" /> those years for afforestation.  I think Deputy MacBride is entitled to that credit.  He gave me every assistance and every guidance.  When he was Minister for External Affairs there was a shortage of forest seeds and in 1948-49 I could not have got sufficient forest seeds were it not for Deputy MacBride.  These were the seeds which were planted out three years later as trees, and Deputy MacBride deserves a lot of credit for his work in that direction.  He gave me every possible assistance and encouragement in that and now that he is not a member of the Government I am in a position to give him credit for it.</P>

No member of any Government likes deliberately to make a slash at any section unless the public interest demands it, but we had the courage to do it.  I wonder how the Fianna Fáil Party would have faced up to a similar situation.  I wonder did the back benchers of Fianna Fáil know about the decision made by the Fianna Fáil Government on the 22nd January, 1954, to limit the acreage of wheat to such an acreage that would produce 300,000 tons of wheat.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;I am to refer to the memoranda dated the 18th inst. submitted by the <Col N="296" /> Minister for Agriculture and by the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry and Commerce relative to the policy of the growing of wheat and to inform you that the Government, at a meeting held to-day, 22nd January, 1954, decided that the general aim of policy in regard to the growing of wheat should be to secure an annual mill intake of 300,000 tons of dried native wheat and that the Departments concerned should forthwith consult together immediately with a view to finding solutions of the problems concerning transport, drying, storage and finances that are likely to arise in ensuring that adequate facilities will be provided on a permanent basis to handle in future years an annual crop of the magnitude represented by a mill intake of 300,000 tons of wheat.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Some Fianna Fáil Deputies might like to give a reply to this one.  Is it true or is it not that a foreigner came in here during the period in which Fianna Fáil was in office and rented a number of acres and grew wheat on it and that he walked off with Government subsidies amounting to £18,000 and that the Fianna Fáil Government allowed him to do that and expected the working man in the town and the small farmer to subsidise that foreigner?</P>

      <P>No matter how long the Deputy is there he will not become one.  The question of the price of tea was raised and Deputy MacEntee went to great rounds to show that the person who buys tea to-day pays one instalment of the price and the taxpayer has to pay the other.  But let Deputy MacEntee know that we were prepared for that and we asked Tea Importers to carry an overdraft.  We knew that this position would arise, and in order to keep the price within the reach and the pocket of the ordinary consumer we asked Tea Importers Limited to carry an overdraft, and by a strange turn of luck the price is dropping now and we do not anticipate having to continue this situation.  I can see plainly the jealousy that exists in the Fianna Fáil Benches because of this.  Fianna Fáil are plainly ill at ease because they are <Col N="298" /> now on the other side of the House and the people have realised that they would be paying 1/8 a lb. more for tea and 4/3 for butter and the Irish farmer has not the slightest doubt that he would be carrying a tax of £10 a head on every beast that crossed the Channel if Fianna Fáil were still in power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to Deputy Brennan, and both Deputy Brennan and myself have listened to Deputy MacEntee.  While Deputy Brennan and Deputy MacEntee both spoke from the same row, their views apparently must be taken as the views of two leaders of two different Parties. Indeed, it must be quite evident to everyone now that, judging by the interruptions we have heard from the Fianna Fáil Benches for the last 15 minutes, not alone have we one leader of one Party in Deputy MacEntee and another leader of another Party in Deputy Brennan but we have apparently four or five further leaders with four or five more Parties behind them on the Opposition Benches.</P>
      <P>Deputy Brennan has been very worried over the possible reaction to the policy of the present Government. Deputy MacEntee expressed his views. Now I have always regarded Deputy Brennan as being both sincere and honest and what strikes me forcibly to-night is why is it that it is only within the last few months that these people have found out they had a tongue in their cheek?  Why did they forget to clamour for all the things for which they are now clamouring in 1951, 1952, 1953 and 1954?  Deputy Brennan spoke here this evening from the Front Bench, as he was perfectly entitled to do.  Why did he not say openly that he either agreed or disagreed with the policy of Deputy MacEntee in relation to finance in the past?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry that the younger Deputies, like Deputy S. Flanagan and others, were not here to listen to the sermon preached by Deputy MacEntee and to hear the horror with which he announced that we are out with the big stick, as it were, to threaten the banks.  What are the views of the younger Deputies in the Fianna Fáil <Col N="299" /> Party in that respect?  Will they say that the banks must continue to control in the same adverse manner as the Bank of England did in the past the credit of this country?  Will they say, rather, that it is our prime responsibility to be interested only in our own country and the economy and prosperity of our people?  What a tragedy it is that these younger Deputies were not here to hear Deputy MacEntee say that this is the first step towards nationalising the banks.  Just prior to that he deplored the horrible situation in which the old age pensioners find themselves.  What an extraordinary situation to find a man, an ex-Minister for Finance and an ex-Minister for Local Government, standing up here and in one breath saying how sorry he is for the old age pensioners and in the next breath holding himself out as the champion of the banks.</P>
    <P>If Deputy Brennan is worried, as he is perfectly right to be worried, over the housing situation in the rural areas does he not realise that if the policy adumbrated by Deputy MacEntee were still in operation, as it was in operation in 1952, local authorities would be hamstrung once more?  We must face these problems in an effort to find a solution to them.  Deputy MacEntee went back a long way; he went back as far as 1921 and 1922.  It is poor satisfaction to the people in Dublin and Cork and the West of Ireland to hear us talking about the past.  When I hear Deputies quoting the past I feel there must undoubtedly be a share of truth in the words: &ldquo;Memory is the only friend that grief can call its own.&rdquo;  We, in the Labour Party, are concerned with the present and the future.  We are interested in the welfare of the old age pensioners to-day just as we were interested in their welfare in the past. We will continue to be so and we have no apologies to offer to anyone here or elsewhere for that policy.</P>
    <P>Opposition members are critical now of our policy.  There was a time when it was to their advantage that we should co-operate with them.  That day has gone and they now fall back on the old gibe that we are prepared to work with other Parties.  We are <Col N="300" /> prepared to work with other Parties provided they are prepared to take their share of responsibility in securing relief for the people who need it.  The people who need relief most at the present time are not the bankers but the unfortunate 70,000 unemployed and the unfortunate people who have been compelled to emigrate year after year in order to find a livelihood.  We are sick and tired of hearing about the glories of the past.  We could equally well speak of the glories of Malachy! A lot of good that would do us!  It is more important that we should realise that it is the present and the future for which we are responsible and Fianna Fáil Deputies will not, try as they may, put us off the track.  We are following the path of progress.</P>
    <P>It is true that we are now in somewhat the same position in relation to this Government as we were in 1952 after eight or nine months of the then Fianna Fáil Government.  At that time little did we realise what was before us and before the people.  At this time it is we who are the watchdogs of the people.  It is we who are carefully scrutinising all that is going on.  We are determined to ensure that never again will there be a recurrence of the policy of 1952.  Deputy Brennan, Deputy Briscoe and others have left the House.  Is there not a touch of irony in a situation in which they sit here and listen to Deputies like Deputy MacEntee defending the banking system when they never opened their lips to protest when Deputy MacEntee, then Minister for Finance, stood up here and told us the people would have to pay more for food because of the removal of the food subsidies? Not a voice was raised by the supporters of the Government against that policy in 1952.  Had even one protested then one could believe now perhaps that they were sincere in criticising our policy.</P>
    <P>They supported then without protest a reactionary policy, a policy dictated by the banking authorities not only here but in Britain as well, because it was after a trip to London that the then Minister for Finance, Deputy MacEntee, introduced his disastrous policy of restricting credit, thereby <Col N="301" /> causing unemployment, and removing the food subsidies.  The unemployment figures were quoted by Deputy MacBride to-night.  We are not simply saying that though there are 70,000 now unemployed there were more when Fianna Fáil was in office.  We are not interested in that.  What we are interested in is the fact that 70,000 human beings want work.  We are equally interested in the old age pensioner, the widow, the orphan and the blind person who finds it hard to eke out an existence even under present conditions.  The policy of the Labour Party, working within the ambit of this Government, is to concentrate on securing economic conditions which will mean that the Constituion of 1937, so ably lauded by Deputy MacEntee an hour ago, which guaranteed equal rights to all our citizens, will not be a mere paper guarantee but that our people will get what they are entitled to, as Christians, under the laws of God, a decent living in their own country.</P>
    <P>It is a joke for Deputy MacEntee to say that we should move away completely from the old policy of making promises and breaking them.  When Deputy MacEntee uses those words it is natural for me to recall the famous occasion when I, as a member of the Cork County Council, heard a circular read that issued from the Department of Local Government, when Deputy MacEntee was Minister in charge of that Department, in which he said that he could not give six shillings a week to the road workers, that all he could give them was twopence a day.  Does he think that we could accept that he is sincere when he pleads for a reorientation of our views and politics?</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEntee pointed out that there may be room for a Conservative or, perhaps, an ultra-Conservative Party in this House.  Perhaps there is. Unlike Fianna Fáil, we would not object if such a Party were formed.  Do not forget that, according to a recent pronouncement by Deputy Lemass, his ambition and anxiety is to see the day when, instead of proportional representation, there will be an X to vote for one candidate.  We accept democracy <Col N="302" /> in its true sense and if there is an ultra-Conservative Party set up, that has nothing to do with us.  The Labour Party do not mind if they are branded as reactionaries or revolutionaries by Deputy Brennan or Deputy MacEntee. We will continue as members of this Government as long as this Government realises that the road to prosperity and progress is a road completely different from that taken in 1952, 1953 and 1954.</P>
    <P>We heard to-night about the possible approach to the problem of capital development.  Deputy MacEntee went so far as to say that a catastrophe had befallen the country because of the approach of the Minister to the banks and his telling them to keep down the rate of interest.  The progress in which the Deputy is so interested is, apparently, around the corner.  He was very cute in trying to divide the House and he was prepared to say, and perhaps he is prepared to foster the belief outside the House, that the policy of this Government towards the banks will spell ruin to the farmers who have their money in the banks.  He stated that here and, in the same breath, he bemoans the problem that exists in regard to capital development.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party have made it perfectly clear that the one hope for this country is capital development.  We have never denied any progress that has been achieved under Fianna Fáil, but, when they staked their claims to new industries, we were not satisfied if these industries gave little employment. We have always maintained, and still maintain, that agriculture is undercapitalised.  Deputy MacEntee's policy, if put into operation, would not be any great help.  It would be a burden.  According to the latest statement issued by the banks, everything is grand, the amount on deposit has increased by a vast amount.  The tragedy is that the prosperity of rural Ireland has not increased.  If private investors are close-fisted with their money and prefer to deposit it in the banks than to invest it in industry, the Government should be prepared to say that a State bank must be set up to provide the money for capital investment <Col N="303" /> where it is not forthcoming from private sources.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil introduced a Bill which they told us would be the saviour of the West of Ireland.  Does Deputy Cunningham remember an amendment by a member of the Labour Party to the Undeveloped Areas Bill on which Deputy Cunningham voted with Fine Gael?  We pointed out that the Bill would be of no use unless there were ample provisions made by way of capital. We pointed out, and time has proved, in many instances, that even with the glowing offers under that Act private enterprise has not come forward, and in many instances private enterprise has refused to take advantage of the Act.  Yet the Government of the day are prepared to sit smugly and to say: &ldquo;We have offered certain concessions but nobody is prepared to take advantage of them.&rdquo;  If the individual, so ably protected and defended by Deputy MacEntee, is provided with the necessary financial stability but refuses to co-operate in the provision of employment that does not give the Government of the day the right to sit back and say: &ldquo;We can do no more.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is a great deal to be done and the Labour Party is prepared to co-operate with the present Government in order to achieve our ideals, ideals which can be so glibly condemned by Deputy MacEntee, Deputy Brennan or others.  We do not mind.  Their catchcries will not affect us.  They have spoken of increased costs, they have ridiculed the &ldquo;tea on tick&rdquo;, they have ignored the reduction in the price of butter.  They spoke of unemployment. They did little in regard to the relief of unemployment in three years.  Unemployment has been reduced from 78,000 to 70,000, but we are still not satisfied.  We can be satisfied, because of our responsibility to the people, only provided the Government of the day is prepared to continue a true programme which will ease the accursed problem of unemployment.</P>
    <P>We want to help those who are in need and those to whom we in rural Ireland owe so much, no matter what Party we may belong to.  Let the Fianna Fáil Deputies spend as much <Col N="304" /> time as they like going through Books of Estimates for various financial years and let them quote from debates which have been held here in the past.  Day by day, we are working very hard to better the condition of our people generally.  We are striving towards the ideals of Connolly and of the late James Larkin and, in the four remaining years of this inter-Party Government, we shall to the best of our ability strive for an economic policy that will benefit the people of Ireland.</P>

      <P>A very eloquent contribution to this debate has just been made by Deputy Desmond.  I notice, however, that he did not say anything about the Vote on Account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I will, on the Budget.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>We shall be looking forward to hearing the Deputy. I thought he might have said something about the reductions in some very important items here.  Of course, we know he does not agree with them. He said that Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party sat with their tongues in their cheeks while different items of legislation were being introduced here and that they did not object.  I did not expect the Deputy to criticise severely some of the proposals in this Vote on Account, but I did expect that he would be honest and say something about some of the reductions.  Again, his figures are not too good.  He spoke a great deal about 70,000 unemployed, whereas the figure is almost 73,000, which is quite a difference, and it is still going up.</P>
      <P>To-day we heard the Taoiseach criticise Fianna Fáil for putting certain schemes into operation last year, but I would point out that those schemes which were put into operation early in 1954 by Fianna Fáil had the effect of reducing last January's unemployment figure from somewhere in the region of 80,000 to, in September last, 48,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>What?  48,000?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>In September, yes. They are the figures which were issued by the Central Statistics Office.  During a particular week in September the unemployment figure in the Twenty-Six <Col N="305" /> Counties was 48,000 persons odd. That was last September, after the present Government had been in office for three or four months.</P>
      <P>Although the present Government took over immediately after the Budget, when the year's finances were available to them to be spent in whatever way they liked and to whatever extent they desired, yet we heard a Minister complain that he has money left over and he proceeded to blame Fianna Fáil for his having that money from the 1954 Budget still unspent.  The unemployment figure during the present Government's time&mdash;it is a short time&mdash;has gone up steadily from the September figure of 48,000 to the present figure of well over 72,500.  There was a slight drop a few weeks ago but the trend has taken another upward curve.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to primary education in connection with the figures in the Estimate.  I notice there is a drop of £113,000 for primary education for the coming year.  In my view, that is a retrograde step.  We may talk about social welfare benefits and we may talk about many other matters, but the provision of heating, cleaning, drinking water and suitable sanitary conditions in decent primary schools is of the utmost importance.  The health and education of our young people are at stake.  Primary education is the only education which the vast majority of our young boys and girls will receive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past few years, an all-out effort was made to erect a larger number of new schools than ever before.  There was an all-out drive in progress for the erection of new schools and for the reconstruction of others. We hope that this reduction of £113,000 in the Vote for primary education will not be reflected in a slowing-up of that drive.  I am sorry Deputy Desmond is not in the House just now because I am sure he would agree that the building of schools in rural areas would provide very welcome employment, for a time, for a number of people there, both skilled and unskilled. In my view, no country at the present time can afford to cut or to <Col N="306" /> economise where primary education is concerned.</P>
    <P>A very fine case has been made for the demand for parity in the payment of teachers.  The I.N.T.O. have built up an unanswerable case for parity with secondary and technical school teachers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order. Might I put this point to you, in regard to this question which the Deputy has raised.  There is an understanding which, in fact, is expressly included in the conciliation and arbitration scheme for teachers that there shall be no agitation so long as any matter is under discussion through machinery.  I would feel myself, therefore, obliged in view of that provision to refrain from making any comment on this matter that is before the machinery.  I think it would be better if, on both sides of the House, we adopted that attitude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>I was unaware of that agreement, but I agree with what the Minister has said.  Let me come back now to the reduction of £113,000 in the Vote for primary education. In my view that reduction will have a very detrimental effect on the primary educational system inasmuch as it will affect the provision of new schools.  A general improvement in the heating, cleaning and supply of water to our schools is, as I have said, of vital importance to the physical and educational well-being of our young, and there is also the matter of playgrounds and recreational facilities to be borne in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A reduction which will have a very serious ill-effect on the people of rural Ireland-and which, again, shows that when the members of the present Government were in Opposition they were not sincere in the tears they shed over the flight from the land&mdash;is the withdrawal of grants for rural electrification.  The rural community understood that the Government were going fifty-fifty in the matter of the cost and they knew that rural electrification was being subsidised. They expected that if and when the E.S.B. showed a profit some of that <Col N="307" /> profit would certainly be reflected in a reduction of the electricity charges.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot see how the Deputy can discuss electricity charges at the moment. These would arise more relevantly on the appropriate Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>This withdrawal is something very serious and will have very detrimental effects on the farming community who had used and are using electricity to increase production.  It has been a great boon to many farmers and the further extension of rural electrification to all the farming community would be a desirable aim and should be the aim of the Government, because it would help to stem the flight from the land and help in the work around the farmhouse and so on.  I think that the reduction of £60,000 which is to be made in the money available for the purchase of land for afforestation is the most retrograde step of all.  The excuse given by the Minister for Lands was that the Minister, over last year, did not spend all the money that was voted.  When we examine that situation we find that the present Government took over in May just over two months after the beginning of the financial year and had therefore almost all the financial year in which to make arrangements for the spending of whatever money was available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another thing which the Minister mentioned was that you could not take over land to-day, pay for it to-morrow and plant trees the day after.  If he applies that to the present situation he will find that in two years hence we will feel the draught from this decrease. It will not be felt next year because, as he says, there is enough land available.  This money has been available and it will be two or three years hence before this gap in land purchase will be seen.  After all, if there was some money left over, it should urge the Minister to go all out on an afforestation drive.  Instead of that, from his attitude towards accusations that we have made, it would appear that he is content to jog along at the rate that has been set up in the <Col N="308" /> past.  That is something which cannot, and should not, be done in regard to afforestation.  The speed at which this most important work should go on should increase from year to year with the result that more money should be made available for it each year.</P>
    <P>There is an increase in the overall Vote for Forestry but that increase is taken care of by increased wages and by the fact that the forests have increased to such an extent that more money is bound to be required to keep them in proper shape.  As our forests extend, the amount of money which will be required for maintenance must also increase, so that actually the situation in regard to afforestation, as pictured in this Vote, certainly does not look bright.</P>
    <P>To refute an argument by the Minister for Lands which has been brought up and repeated here time and again &mdash;he quotes figures, starting with the year 1944 or so and comes up until he finds that in 1948 we had a larger acreage of forest plantation than in any of the previous years.  He always denies that netting-wire was not available and that seeds were not available. The Minister here to-night publicly thanked Deputy MacBride, who, when he was Minister for External Affairs in 1948 and 1949, helped him to procure seeds, which goes to show that the procuring of seeds, even after the war, was a problem in 1948.  How much more of a problem was it in 1944 and 1945?</P>
    <P>Looking through this Book of Estimates we find many things&mdash;small things, if you will&mdash;that create a certain amount of annoyance, reductions here and there.  The Taoiseach in his talk to-night dwelt on what was the key note&mdash;that there must be reductions in expenditure and taxation and so on and it does not matter what the reductions are to be.  At all costs there must be a downward trend. When we look at these figures we find that the reductions are not made in what I might call the controversial items&mdash;like agriculture&mdash; which are very much in the public news and the public mind.  They are made in such things as education, defence, even in fisheries, harbours and so on.  I notice <Col N="309" /> that they go even to the extent of £10 reduction in fishery protection.  The trend must be downwards.  You can sacrifice anything at all but you must have a downward trend.  That £10 reduction in the protection of our fisheries is a small matter, something that is not worth mentioning, possibly, but it shows what is behind these reductions.  It is something that might not be noticed, about which the people in general will not bother, but it is important to see to it that our fisheries are protected; yet we are going to spend less this year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Only £10 less.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  It does not cost an awful lot unfortunately.  I would like to see twice as much spent on fishery protection but £10 is a fairly big percentage of it.  I prefaced my remarks by saying that it is possibly not worth mentioning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>It looks like a token sub-head to me.  It is £10 this year against £20 last year.  It is put in in case any expenditure should be incurred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to say whether that is right or wrong. However, I will not go over it again. There have been, as I say, these reductions in items which will not cause public controversy.  That is the feature of these items, that it is all right to do it when it is done towards something which will not create an outcry with the result that very many, too many, items have suffered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the amount of money available for commercial harbours is also down.  That means that demands for the improvement of our harbours in some of the ports along the western seaboard will not be met at least in the coming year.  Altogether it presents a very sorry picture.  It does not give that vast number of unemployed any hope that extra work will be available.  Even in capital services we heard Deputy Desmond wax eloquent over the intention of the Government to spend more money on capital services and we find, of course, <Col N="310" /> the amount of money is £1,100,000 lower than last year.  We heard the Taoiseach say to-day also that money would be borrowed for use only for projects which would give a return and yet in the same breath he boasted about borrowing money for tea.</P>
    <P>These things are all very contradictory. As Deputy Blowick said we young members are apprehensive as to what is going to be the outcome in the coming year.  If unemployment increases, if emigration goes on at a faster rate, if that is possible, than is the rate at the present time, then we can say, and the Government have given us the excuse to say, this time next year: &ldquo;We told you so.&rdquo;  I hope it will not be true but we are afraid that it will.</P>

      <P>I think Deputy Cunningham will be getting into trouble with the Party.  In the last few remarks he made, he certainly was not toeing the Party line, and I think he overlooked reading the Fianna Fáil gospel for the day, because the case which has been made against the Minister for Finance so far by the Fianna Fáil Party leaders and by the Fianna Fáil Party Press is that there has not, in fact, been any reduction at all, that the whole thing is an illustion, that it is all sham and trickery.  Deputy Cunningham thinks that is not so, that, on the contrary, the Government have gone too far, that each Minister got orders: &ldquo;You must reduce you must cut down; you can secrifice anything at all but the trend must be downwards.&rdquo;  The Fianna Fáil Party organ when they commented on the Book of Estimates on the 6th March, when it was published, decided that the best way to deal with the Book of Estimates would be to instruct their print setter to set up a black headline: &ldquo;Where are the economies? Coalition device is an illusion.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>On the 6th March, however, Deputy Eamon de Valera did read his <i>Sunday Press.</i> Deputy Cunningham will be getting himself into trouble because he did not.  Deputy de Valera had this to say following the article in the <i>Sunday Press</i>.  I am quoting now, for Deputy Blaney's information, the Fianna Fáil bible again, the <i>Irish Press</i> of to-day, Wednesday, 9th March, which reports Deputy Eamon de Valera as saying:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Whatever the members of the Government might lack, they did not lack audacity, perhaps the word `cheek' would be better understood. Here they had a Minister for Finance boasting that he had been able to reduce the current Estimates for the coming year to the extent of £1,140,000, and if they were to consider the Estimates in detail they would see that the whole of it was almost covered by a windfall&mdash;by the Grant-in-Aid that comes from the American Counterpart Fund.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Deputy Cunningham does not believe that.  He says that the knife was put to the back of the Ministers.  They were told: &ldquo;You must cut.  You can sacrifice whatever you like but the trend must be downwards.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I would ask Deputy Cunningham to get together with the Leader of the Opposition and decide on a united front before this debate is over.  I have quoted the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition about audacity and cheek.  I will not deny this, that if any man in this House is qualified to give a lecture on that subject he is the one, but he has a certain amount of nerve to do it, <Col N="312" /> to talk about audacity and cheek and to talk about that in the context in which the words were uttered&mdash;I will quote again from the Fianna Fáil gospel, the <i>Irish Press</i> of to-day's date where Deputy Eamon de Valera has this to say:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I have been in public life for a fair length of time.  I have been through some 15 general elections and some 50 or so by-elections, and in all that time I have never seen anything like the deliberate campaign of deception used by those who are now in the Government, or supporting it, to get the votes of the people in the last election&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We had Deputy MacEntee following on the same lines in his contribution here to-day.  In referring to Deputy MacEntee, I want to say in all sincerity that I am very glad to see him back in the House again, and in his usual form.</P>

      <P>Deputy MacEntee did say in connection with this that the present Government were guilty of a flagrant breach of public faith, and he referred to the dubious device of financing tea out of borrowed money.  He finished up by an appeal to all Parties to be honest men, and to see that bribery and corruption, and promises made to be broken, were henceforth cast out into utter darkness.</P>
      <P>Deputy Eamon de Valera talked about audacity.  Some Fianna Fáil Deputies earlier on became a bit restive when the Minister for Lands exposed what he described as the fraudulent approach of the Leader of the Opposition in his remarks on forestry.  It does not stop there. When Deputy Eamon de Valera gets up and talks about audacity, cheek, and about the greatest deception he has seen for 50 years, let us look at the record of the Party led by the Deputy. Let us look at their record in this regard. Let us compare that with the matters about which Deputy MacEntee was complaining.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Blaney and every other Deputy on the other side of this House <Col N="313" /> will remember the circumstances under which the last Fianna Fáil Government was formed, will remember how on the 5th June, 1951, the Leader of the Party, and every one of their Deputies, subscribed to a solemn pledge.  They will remember that that pledge was splashed on the front pages of every newspaper in this State, and that that pledge was stated to be grounded on the election promises which the members of the Fianna Fáil Party had made during the election campaign of 1951.</P>
    <P>On this occasion I am quoting from the <i>Irish Times</i> of the 5th June, 1951, not a paper, I understand, which is controlled by the Fianna Fáil Party, but which gave them a very generous measure of support during the last election, and advised their readers to vote for that Party.  The <i>Irish Times</i> quotes the solemn pledge given by Fianna Fáil to the country, the solemn pledge made by the Leader of that Party.  That statement started off with the words: &ldquo;Fianna Fáil is the largest Party, and if it receives the necessary support in Dáil Éireann will form a Government, and, in accordance with its election pledges and its national policy, proceed at once to carry out its general, programme, including the following.&rdquo; The following referred to set out 17 points.  One of those 17 points was the maintenance of subsidies, to control the price of essential foodstuffs, and the operation of an efficient price regulation for all necessary and scarce commodities.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera complains about deception.  What is the position here? What of the definite undertaking, the solemn promises given to elected Deputies and purporting to be based on the election pledges given by the Fianna Fáil Party?  Those solemn promises were to maintain food subsidies. Every one of us knows that nine months later the Fianna Fáil Government, with Deputy MacEntee who was talking about the flagrant breaches of public faith, completely reneged on the people, and threw overboard that particular solemn promise given on the 5th June.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonnchadhOBriain" hpid="Donnchadh Ó Briain Donnchadh Ó Briain">
      <NameTxt>Donnchadh Ó Briain</NameTxt>
      <P>There were several millions in the last Budget for <Col N="314" /> food subsidies, brought in by the Fianna Fáil Minister &mdash; between £8,000,000 or £9,000,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what Deputy Ó Briain's defence for these flagrant breaches of public faith may be, but only a short while ago I questioned a member of the Fianna Fáil Party with regard to it.  Deputy Traynor was making, on that occasion, the same type of speech as Deputy MacEntee made here this evening, about promises, demands and undertakings, flagrant breaches of public faith.  On the 17th February of this year I asked Deputy Traynor's permission to put a question to him.  That question which I put appears in column 639 of the Dáil Debates.  I asked Deputy Traynor:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If that is his view, why did the Deputy's Party, in 1951, promise not to interefere with the food subsidies before they were elected as a Government and break that promise nine months afterwards?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Then the Fianna Fáil mentality came out in the reply.  Deputy Traynor's answer was this:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Anything the Fianna Fáil Government did, they did it, whether it was distasteful or not, in the interests of the general public.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>But does Fianna Fáil reserve to themselves the right to criticise, the right to charge us with fraud, deception, cheek and flagrant breach of public faith?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am dealing with some of the speeches made by Deputies, and I propose to let Deputy Traynor off the book and refer to some other speeches.  Deputy MacEntee referred to flagrant breaches of public faith.  I quoted a Fianna Fáil pledge to this House given on 5th June, 1951. That was in respect of food subsidies, and nine months later it was deliberately thrown overboard by the most positive and deliberate act of the Fianna Fáil Government.  Subsidies were slashed <Col N="315" /> and prices of food forced up by the budgetary policy of the Fianna Fáil Government.  Deputy MacEntee, who was talking about flagrant breaches of public faith, is reported in the <i>Irish Times</i> of May 16th, 1951, in a speech which he made in Rathmines Town Hall on the previous night.  He was referring to rumours being spread by a number of persons in the licensed trade who were saying that if Fianna Fáil were returned to Government the taxes imposed on drink in the Supplementary Budget of 1947 would be reimposed, and he threw up his hands in horror to the heavens at that suggestion and said there was no truth whatever in that.</P>
      <P>That was on the 16th May, 1951, and nine months later that particular promise went overboard together with the promise to maintain food subsidies. In the same speech he gave a contradiction of the rumours which he said were being spread and he stated the Fianna Fáil policy with regard to prices.  He also said at that meeting that Fianna Fáil had brought down the price of the loaf to 6d.  He referred to various increases which he complained had taken place under the inter-Party Government, and it is somewhat amusing to find that in the self-same speech Deputy MacEntee gave his undertaking that the taxes imposed in the Supplementary Budget of 1947 on drink would not be reimposed, and that in the self-same speech he had this to say: &ldquo;The people were being asked to decide whether politics in Ireland were to be a dirty game played by confidence tricksters who were prepared to promise anything to dupe the people into voting for them.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This was the gentleman, the white-headed boy with the clean hands, assuring the people that as far as he and Fianna Fáil were concerned there would be no question of putting back the taxes imposed in the 1947 Supplementary Budget.  And that is the gentleman who, as Minister for Finance in the Fianna Fáil Government formed after that election, subscribed to the solemn undertaking to maintain food <Col N="316" /> subsidies and who, nine months later, not only slashed the food subsidies but reimposed in full measure, and with a little bit put into the pot for the cat, the taxes which had been put on in the Supplementary Budget of 1947.</P>

      <P>I do not take seriously this jumping kind of interruption from Deputies opposite.  That has been the measure of the Fianna Fáil criticism not only in this debate but in other debates as well and I find that, talking on the 17th of last month in column 641 of the Official Report, Deputy Traynor's condemnation of the Government in his peroration on that occasion was that by reason of what he called broken promises the people of this country were being given the impression that this Government was just as bad as Fianna Fáil.  Deputy Traynor's actual words were these:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I was listening to some people discussing the condition of affairs in the country at the present time; it was regrettable to hear: `They are all the same.  They are a lot of frauds.'  That is a situation brought about by the non-fulfilment of the promises made.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If Fianna Fáil want to be really dirty they will say: &ldquo;You are no better than we were.&rdquo;  Deputy Traynor was not alone in that.  It was not just an idle thought that came into his head.  It <Col N="317" /> was obviously a serious policy which had been discussed in a serious way at the Fianna Fáil Party meeting the day before, because a few days later Deputy Briscoe got up in this House and his complaint when he wanted to be insulting was exactly the same as that made by Deputy Traynor.  Talking in this House on the 23rd February, Deputy Briscoe had this to say, at column 785 of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is no defence for the Coalition Government to say: `You did something other than we did.'  That is no defence for your own wrong-doing. It reminds me of the story I heard many years ago of two mothers who were bemoaning the fate of their two sons who had been locked up for battering two different individuals. One mother said: `Ah! your son got what he deserved; he did the thing very roughly; he beat the man up this way, but my son was a gentleman; he slugged him from behind and the fellow never knew what happened to him.'  That is the kind of defence that is being put up to me now.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In other words, Deputy Briscoe's outlook was that they were the &ldquo;toughs&rdquo;, that they acted roughly with the people but we were just as bad because we slugged them from behind.  I am not exaggerating now when I say that if Fianna Fáil Deputies want to be really insulting or want to be really hurtful the worst thing they can think of to say about the present Government is that we are just like they were.  There are more important things, however, than Deputies Traynor and Briscoe.  Deputy MacEntee said&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy MacEntee complained about the statement made by the Taoiseach when the Ministers were being nominated.  The gist of his complaint was that the Taoiseach had set up the Attorney-General <Col N="318" /> and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Government as some kind of watch-dogs or guardian angels over the Minister for Finance and Deputy MacEntee did not think that was really fair to the Minister for Finance and thought the Minister for Finance was more capable than any of them.  I refer to the matter really because it crossed my mind when Deputy MacEntee was making that little taunt of his and when a few minutes later he referred to the strength of the Minister for Finance in coercing the banks that Deputy Eamonn de Valera, as Leader of the Opposition, when Deputy MacEntee was Minister for Finance, was a little bit cautious about the whole idea.  I would like to be corrected now on this if I am wrong, but it seems to me that on the occasion when the British Chancellor of the Exchequer summoned Deputy MacEntee to London&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I think we never quite cleared up the mystery but the background was that one day Deputy MacEntee found himself here in the Dáil and the next day he found himself on the doorstep of the Chancellor of the Exchequer's residence in London.  Now I am sure I am right in this, and I am sure Deputy Ó Briain will not hesitate to correct me if I am wrong: I do not think the then Taoiseach in the Fianna Fáil Government felt very comfortable about Deputy MacEntee going on his own and my recollection is that he sent the then Tánaiste, Deputy Seán Lemass, as a sort of watch-dog with him, and <Col N="319" /> there were two vacant seats on the Government Front Benches the following day.  I do not think I am stretching my imagination very far&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We had the holiday allowances kept on a par with the decision taken by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the bank rate kept on a par with the decision taken in England.  Deputies will remember that in that year for the first time, I think, in history the British Chancellor of the Exchequer decided that he would&mdash;a somewhat unique innovation&mdash;bring in his Budget a few months earlier.  Lo and behold, the traditional date for introducing the Budget here was departed from and Deputy Seán MacEntee decided that he would bring in his Budget a few months earlier.  Now, a nod is as good as a wink to some <Col N="320" /> people.  I do not care whether or not Deputy MacEntee was summoned to London, but all of us know the result of his consultations there and is that not all the more reason why we should take pride in the fact that we have now a strong Minister for Finance, a man who puts this country, its conditions and its affairs first?</P>

      <P>I am coming to another one now.  Deputy MacEntee was very concerned about the strength of the Minister for Finance and the strong arm.  He wanted to know if the Government had gone to the banks and said to them: &ldquo;You had better do what the Government wants, or else!&rdquo; He posed that, first of all, in the form of a question and he finished up with it as a statement.  He decided in his own inimitable way that the policy of the inter-Party Government was to sovietise the Irish banks, that the Government would use the big stick and he saw all sorts of dangers in store for the depositors.  I am sure it was all quite unintentional, but if Deputy MacEntee's speech receives any publicity and if there were any people who did not know Deputy MacEntee and who might be inclined to attach any importance or weight to his statements, I am sure it was quite unintentional on his part that his manner of speaking here to-night might cause a certain amount of uneasiness in business circles, amongst the smaller shopkeepers, the small farmers and others who have entrusted their savings to the banks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am giving him credit for thinking that it was <Col N="321" /> quite inadvertent on his part; I have not been corrected by Deputy Ó Briain, so I assume I am right.  Remember, that was Deputy MacEntee talking here on the 9th March, 1955, the circumstances being that, Deputy MacEntee having been an occupant of the Ministerial Benches here some time earlier, found himself now on the opposite side of the House.  That was history repeating itself and I would not advise people to attach too much weight to any remarks made by Deputy MacEntee.  It was only history repeating itself.  There was a previous occasion when Deputy MacEntee was the Finance Minister in the Fianna Fáil Government.  He departed from that position to the far side of the House in 1948.  Suddenly the same idea struck him; apparently he thought it was necessary to issue a warning to the people, to be careful as to how the inter-Party Government would deal with the banks; they will put the screw on; they will use the big stick; be careful of your money; are you sure you can trust them?</P>
      <P>Speaking in his own constituency in Dublin South-East on 2nd May, 1950, as reported in the <i>Irish Press</i> on 3rd May of that year, Deputy MacEntee had this to say:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The screw is to be put on the banks to do what Mr. McGilligan has admitted the public are not prepared to do.  That is the explanation of the cold war which the Coalition spokesmen have been waging on the Irish banks.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Deputy MacEntee's performance here this evening is merely a repetition of his performance in 1950.  Apparently he thought then it was good politics. Apparently he thought that votes could be got, that a certain amount of uneasiness could be created, that the confidence which existed in the first inter-Party Government could be undermined.  He is back once more on the Opposition Benches; the same idea has come into his head and the same words come out of his mouth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is fair to say that the claims made by Government Ministers in the course of this debate are justified. <Col N="322" /> The policy which has been put into force and implemented by this Government is a policy that works.  It is a policy that gives results.  In that it is in sharp contradiction to the state of affairs which existed in the last Fianna Fáil Government.  Deputy Cunningham and others&mdash;I think Deputy Brennan was one of them&mdash; talked about the poorer sections of the people.  Deputy Cunningham said, with a smile on his face, that he was apprehensive about unemployment and that, if his fears were justified, the Government had given him an excuse for saying: &ldquo;I told you so&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I trust that his fears will not be justified.  I do not know whether or not he had the same fears in 1953 under Fianna Fáil when a Deputy who is no longer in this House and who was then sitting as an Independent Deputy, and subsequently joined Deputy Cunningham's Party, had this to say about the Fianna Fáil policy which was then being implemented.  He said, at column 765 of the Dáil Debates of 19th March, 1953, just two years ago, when Fianna Fáil were in control, when they were putting their policy, such as it was, into operation:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There is now one real problem facing this country, and all other problems which have been discussed fade into insignificance beside it; that is, that there are 90,000 people unemployed.  I want to find out what exactly is the policy of the present Government to alleviate that situation. I have looked in these Estimates and quite frankly I do not see anything that promises the slightest hope of alleviation to those 90,000 unemployed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was the judgment passed after the Fianna Fáil policy had been in operation, after they had introduced their Budget, after they had published their Estimates, that there was nothing in the Fianna Fáil Estimates which promised the slightest hope of alleviating the position which had been created by Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>Another Deputy then in the House who, likewise, is no longer in the House, who, likewise, sat as an Independent and who, likewise, joined <Col N="323" /> Fianna Fáil before the last election, spoke in the same debate on the 18th March, 1953.  At columns 614-5, he passed his considered judgment on the Fianna Fáil policy and said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Listening to the Taoiseach, I could not help feeling that the most important matter is not whether the Government policy is the same or very much the same as that of the Opposition.  I do not give a damn whether it is or not.  The only interest I have is whether the policy works, and the policy of the last year, I respectfully submit, has not worked.  I believe that the results of that policy have been too serious for many of our people to allow anybody to feel in any way complacent about it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There was another considered judgment passed by a Deputy supporting the Fianna Fáil Government at that time, supporting them in the capacity of an Independent Deputy.  These two people stated their opinion and passed their judgment that the Fianna Fáil policy was a policy that had failed and that did not work.  The people, at the last general election, passed their judgment and their judgment agreed with that which was expressed by these two Deputies.</P>
    <P>The inter-Party Government has been in office for eight or nine months. They have already set in motion the policy which they published on taking office.  I think it is only fair play that, not only Deputies in this House, but people outside it would give that Government an opportunity of implementing the programme which they have set before the people.  Fianna Fáil Deputies are afraid.  They are afraid because they know the Government is comprised of men of ability, men of sincerity, men of determination and that they have put forward a good policy and a policy which, given a chance, will work.  I know that the people outside this House believe in the sincerity and honesty of the members of this Government; they believe that they are doing their best, in times which are not always easy, to improve the condition of affairs in this country.  I know that the people outside <Col N="324" /> would prefer to see Fianna Fáil Deputies adopting some kind of statesmanlike attitude in their discussions here, to give up their carping criticism, their pin-pricking, their desire to win petty debating points; to give the Government a hand in rectifying the ills and the difficulties from which the people of this country are suffering, largely due to the misguided policies of the past few years.</P>
    <P>The people know that this Government are sincere.  The people know what the policy of this Government is. I have no hesitation in saying that, as far as this Government are concerned, they are approaching their task with determination.  The confidence which they have inspired shows that they are approaching their task and are continuing their task with the earnest goodwill of the majority of people in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>The greatest sign that the Fianna Fáil people have received a terrible shock since this Book of Estimates was published is the fact that the Fianna Fáil people, from their Leader, Deputy de Valera, down, have expressed surprise in their speeches in the House that there is a reduction in taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have listened with interest to the speeches of the various Deputies from both sides of the House.  It is noticeable that the Fianna Fáil Deputies on this occasion seem to be short, and very short, of things to grumble about. We all appreciate the fact that our people are grumbling about the increasing burden of taxation.  They have been grumbling for a long number of years about the increasing burden of taxation.  When I was a young man I listened to the Fianna Fáil speakers going around the country, in the 1932's and 1933's, addressing their audiences, promising that they would effect reductions in taxation if returned to office.  We find, however, that, with the passage of time and despite the pledges and the promises given, year after year, taxation both local and central has increased.  So far as the Fianna Fáil Party were concerned, they certainly, in no period of their régime, did anything whatsoever <Col N="325" /> to put an end to that state of affairs.</P>
    <P>I would like to see further substantial reductions in taxation, if that were possible, but it is at least encouraging to Deputies who have come in the past few years to this House to see that, at long last, an inter-Party Government have not alone cried halt to increased taxes but have succeeded in fact&mdash;the Book of Estimates is there to prove it&mdash;in reducing <Col N="326" /> taxation.  It is an encouraging sign particularly when we consider that the economies which are effected are not being made at the expense of our principal industry, agriculture.  I move to report progress.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 10th March, 1955.</P>
