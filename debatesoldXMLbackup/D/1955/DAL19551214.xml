    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state in respect of each of the past five financial years (1) the net amount of subsidy paid from the Exchequer towards the reduction of flour and bread prices, and (2) the estimated portion of such subsidy which growers of wheat received, without reference to transport, drying and storage costs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to circulate with the Official Report a statement giving the particulars requested in part one of the Deputy's question.</P>
      <P>With regard to part two of the Deputy's question, I would point out that subsidy is paid to millers, on the quantities of flour and wheaten meal produced.  It represents the difference between the cost of production of flour and wheaten meal and the controlled prices at which millers are required to sell these products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The prices payable for native wheat are fixed by the Minister for Agriculture and in so far as these prices are higher than the prices of imported wheat of corresponding quality, the cost of subsidy is correspondingly increased. It would not be practicable, <Col N="1389" /> save at the cost of an unwarranted amount of time and trouble, to ascertain the proportion of subsidy in any year which might be regarded as attributable to the higher cost of native wheat.</P>
    <P>Following is the statement:&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply is he not aware that an estimate of the figure asked for has already been given in previous years? Because of the campaign being carried on by the Government against the growing of native wheat, is this not an opportune time for an authoritative statement to be made by the Minister for Agriculture as to the portion of the subsidy that may be given to the farmers and the portion that is paid otherwise?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter has been examined carefully with a view to seeing if it would be possible to provide the information sought, but having regard to the variations in price, the quality, the freight rates as between Canadian, American and Australian wheat, the variations in output, quality and moisture content and transport of native wheat used for the production of flour, it would be difficult to provide a reliable figure of the subsidy which should be provided for the benefit of native wheat growers.  It was calculated on a rough and ready basis but it has been calculated that, if all our flour were produced from imported wheat, the cost might be reduced by about £2,000,000.  That is the nearest information that is available on the subject and it would require an extensive survey, lasting over a long period, <Col N="1390" /> and a most detailed examination before anything like an approximate guess&mdash;and then it would be only a guess&mdash;could be made in regard to the information the Deputy seeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister or the Taoiseach undertake to have that survey put in hand?  The Minister must be aware that it is of importance for the future of wheat growing in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware that building contractors have recently experienced long delays in the delivery of cement with consequent slowing down of progress on many public buildings, and, if so, if he will make a statement in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed that some delays have occurred in meeting orders for cement, due to the necessity for repairs to a kiln and the unprecedented demand this year because of the long spell of fine weather.  I understand that the cement factories, whose productive capacity was increased last years, are in full production now, and I hope that the delays which the Deputy has complained of will shortly be eliminated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware of the urgent necessity for the establishment of industrial concerns in County Roscommon with particular reference to the towns of Roscommon, Boyle and Castlerea, and, if so, whether he will direct the attention of the Industrial Development Authority towards the problem of remedying this great need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1391" />
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, the establishment of industries is primarily a matter for private enterprise and local initiative.  If he, or the local interests concerned, will let me have particulars of the facilities for the establishment of an industry at any of the towns to which he refers, including information as to factory sites and an estimate of the capital available locally for investment in industrial projects, I will arrange, through my Department and the Industrial Development Authority, to have these towns brought to the notice of parties who submit proposals to me and who have not already selected a location.  The Deputy will realise, of course, that the claims of other towns with facilities to offer are also brought to the notice of industrial promoters.</P>
      <P>I may add that any proposals coming before me for the establishment of industries in County Roscommon will receive the most sympathetic consideration. Any groups interested in setting up industries in that area may, of course, apply to An Foras Tionscal for assistance under the Undeveloped Areas Act, 1952.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be appropriate at this stage to say: &ldquo;We heard it before, Joe,&rdquo; but surely the Minister is aware that the information with regard to site, money available, and so forth has been supplied to the Industrial Development Authority and to An Foras Tionscal on many occasions within the past four years.  Apart from that, is the Minister serious when he suggests that private enterprise is going to solve the problems that exist in towns such as Roscommon&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not consider utilising the Industrial Development Authority&mdash;on the same lines as the Development Council is being utilised in the North under the guidance of Lord Chandos&mdash;in order to ensure that industrial development will take place in the West and that the unfortunate men and women there will not have <Col N="1392" /> to emigrate, depending, as they have to at present, on the whims of private enterprise to set up industries?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy seems to be suffering from amnesia.  He does not seem to have read the question which was put down, which was:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware of the urgent necessity for the establishment of industrial concerns in County Roscommon with particular reference to the towns of Roscommon, Boyle and Castlerea, and, if so, whether he will direct the attention of the Industrial Development Authority towards the problem of remedying this great need.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I have told him I was aware of the necessity for establishing industries in Roscommon and elsewhere and that I am doing my best in that respect.  I have told him that I would bring the needs of Roscommon to the notice of the Industrial Development Authority. These are the two questions I was asked and these are the two questions I have answered, and not the question which the Deputy apparently forgot to put down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has mentioned An Foras Tionscal in his reply and has also mentioned that if people in these areas &ldquo;and the Deputy&rdquo; would make available particulars with regard to the sites and money available he would do all he could, but these items of information are already available in his Department and were made available four years ago.  On many occasions in the last four years efforts have been made by the Development Council in both Castlerea and Roscommon to get assistance from An Foras Tionscal and in view of their failure, I am asking the Minister to forget private enterprise and to get State help for these areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the normal experience of the court.  Throughout the present year and more particularly in recent months the volume of work has been unusually heavy, heavier even than during the previous rounds of wage increases.  The volume has been further increased by the addition of certain local authority and other workers to the classes of workers whose cases may now be dealt with by the court.  The court is aware of these difficulties which have descended upon it in consequence of the abnormal conditions operating during the year in respect of wage increases and it is doing its best to deal with these cases with the utmost expedition.  I am assured that the problem will clear itself substantially within the next couple of weeks.</P>

      <P>I would remind the Deputy that coal prices were released from statutory control in January, 1953.  Nevertheless, when the coal merchants proposed recently to increase the price of coal in Dublin by 7/6 a ton, the Prices Advisory Body, at my request, undertook an investigation of the matter.  A public inquiry was held by the Advisory Body on the 21st October, 1955.  As a result of the inquiry and of their subsequent examination of the evidence, the body were satisfied that the increase was unavoidable, being attributable in the main to increases in the cost of the handling and distribution of coal under the headings of wages and sea freights; part of the increase arose from the necessity of importing a quantity of coal from the U.S.A.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that Bord na Móna have increased the price of turf, and if this <Col N="1398" /> increase has been recommended by the Prices Advisory Body and sanctioned by him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed that, due to increases in wage rates and operating expenses, Bord na Móna have recently increased by 3/- per ton the standard price for machine turf supplied ex-works.</P>
      <P>The price of turf was decontrolled in September, 1951.  I am aware that it is the policy of Bord na Móna at all times to keep the ex-works price of machine turf at the lowest level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did not answer the question he was asked.  Why is it not necessary for Bord na Móna to go before the Prices Advisory Body in the same way as the coal merchants have to go before that body before they increase the price of coal?  Why can Bord na Móna raise the price of turf without getting sanction or without having to ask the permission of anybody to do so?  Turf is a native fuel; there are no outside influences controlling the price of turf as such influences control the price of coal.  Why is it not necessary for the Minister to make inquiry each time Bord na Móna automatically and autocratically decides to increase the price of turf to the poor people of this country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that the Prices Advisory Body can, on its own initiative, inquire into the price of turf charged by Bord na Móna, or the Minister, if he is satisfied that the price is unduly high, can ask the Prices Advisory Body to undertake such inquiry.  The evidence before me is that due to increased wages and other operating expenses, the board's liabilities have increased and they have found it necessary, therefore, to increase the price of turf by 3/- per ton. I am satisfied that the board's policy is to keep their general prices as low as possible and if I thought the board's prices, or the recent increase, were unduly high I would have no hesitation in sending the matter to the Prices Advisory Body for examination. I am not, however, so satisfied.</P>

I am also informed by the board that 330 householders in the area have agreed to take supply and that this figure represents 55.5 per cent. of the total number of householders in the area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The answers to the various parts of the question are as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  The acquisition considerations comprise all the factors which may have a bearing on the requirements of the relevant statutes.  The principal factors are the character and value of the lands, agricultural production and employment thereon, the extent and user of the owner's other lands, if any, and the general circumstances of the owner and his family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1409" /> (b)  Because of wide variations in agricultural and economic conditions in different localities, it is impossible to make a categorical classification in this matter.  In general, a person is regarded as an uneconomic holder, if he is mainly dependent for a livelihood on the produce of a holding which cannot be regarded as adequate to support a family in frugal comfort, even under the best management.</P>
    <P>(c)  Issues about congestion are decided by means of detailed local surveys.</P>
    <P>(d)  The circumstances of potential allottees are checked by an inspector and are recorded in detail.  The inspector then prepares a tentative allotment scheme which is examined departmentally and is finally settled by the Lay Commissioners, who have exclusive jurisdiction in this matter.</P>
    <P>(e)  The selection of allottees is governed by S.31 of Land Act, 1923, which sets out the various classes of allottees to whom advances may be made.  The following order of priority operates:&mdash; displaced employees, evicted tenants, uneconomic holders, migrants, trustees for communal purposes, cottiers, and other landless applicants.</P>

      <P>In the 12 months ending on 30th November, 1955, the Land Commission entered into negotiations for the purchase, under Section 27 of the Land Act, 1950, of 28 holdings.  Of this number, the Land Commission reached agreement in 15 cases involving a total area of 714 acres and a total price of £12,445 as follows:&mdash;ten holdings in County Mayo, two in County Cork, one in County Kerry, one in County Roscommon and one in County Galway.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>As I stated in reply to a question on 27th April last regarding the Shannon flooding, the Land Commission prepared a scheme for the relief of farmers in the flooded area of the Shannon Valley.  It was decided, however, to obtain the advice of an American expert on remedial measures for the control of the river and, naturally, the nature and extent of the <Col N="1413" /> Land Commission scheme will require to be reviewed in the light of the expert's report and the Government's decisions thereon.

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government took very swift action when the abnormal floods occurred on the Shannon last year.  One of the first things I was directed to do was to prepare a survey, which was done, and done in a very excellent manner.  The second was to obtain the services of an expert who could report on whether we could control the flooding on the Shannon or not.  That expert has sent in his report and until that is dealt with it is not proposed to do anything.  It would be obviously foolish for the Land Commission to take steps that might be completely outdated by the expert's report if carried out.</P>

      <P>As the Minister for Agriculture pointed out later, in the Seanad, the speculation referred to was not unlawful and did not of itself provide the Land Commission with a reason for acquiring the land affected. The Land Commission can only deal with such cases where the circumstances generally warrant the institution of acquisition proceedings, and I can assure the Deputy that in all such cases the Land Commission take action.  I would not deem it proper to name the speculators, and I must, therefore, decline to identify with such speculation any cases in which the Land Commission institute acquisition proceedings.</P>

Other adjacent lands were divided some years ago and there are now practically no uneconomic holders in the vicinity, who have not already benefited from substantial allotments.  Land division involves heavy charges on taxation and it is not the policy to give a second round of allotments to people who have already benefited.

      <P>During the week-end Deputies learned with deep regret of the tragic and untimely death of Deputy John O'Connor.  Go ndéanfaidh Dia trócaire ar a anam.  Though he was a comparative newcomer to Dáil Éireann, having been elected for the first time at the last general election, he always took a deep interest in national affairs.  As a youth he joined the Volunteers and during the War of Independence he took part in many engagements in his native county. Since 1948 he was a member of the Kerry County Council and for a time was chairman of that body.  He was also chairman of the Kerry County Committee of Agriculture and of the Kerry Vocational Education Committee. <Col N="1427" /> The interests of all his constituents were his abiding concern.</P>
      <P>The late Deputy O'Connor represented the constituency of North Kerry and during his comparatively short term in the House he endeared himself to everybody with whom he came in contact.  He was a big man, in every sense of the word, and was not afraid to give his views whether in this House or in private.  Sincerity, integrity and a deep love of his native country were his outstanding characteristics. His loss will be keenly felt both by his constituents and by the members of the Dáil.  I ask you, a Cheann Comhairle, to convey to his widow and relatives the sympathy of Dáil Éireann.</P>

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  During the middle and later 1940's greyhound racing in Britain attracted increased support from patrons with a good share of ready money available, and the boom was reflected throughout the greyhound industry in this country from which the dogs were largely obtained; greyhound racing here also attracted increased patronage at that time. Defects in the supervision of the industry were in such circumstances liable to be shown up more clearly, with rather serious resulting abuses appearing, and it became fairly generally accepted that a greater degree of effective control, than that existing under the Irish Coursing Club as already constituted, would be desirable.</P>
      <P>By 1950 the Irish Coursing Club itself was putting forward a case for legislation to establish a control board for the greyhound industry on the lines of the Racing Board, which had been established for horse-racing under the Racing Board and Race Courses Act, 1945, and was proving a success. Aspects of the administration of the Irish Coursing Club itself were also being questioned by interests associated with the industry.  From the general economic viewpoint the greyhound industry had, as compared with pre-war, assumed considerably more importance&mdash;for instance, during the four-year period 1946-49 total exports of greyhounds averaged 8,500 per annum valued at over £800,000, as compared with an average of 2,500 per annum valued at £55,000 during the four-year period 1936-39.</P>
      <P>As a preliminary to deciding what action might appropriately be taken, the first step that suggested itself was to obtain a detailed survey of the whole industry and the Advisory Committee on the Greyhound Industry was therefore appointed with terms of reference:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;To ascertain and report on the position respecting coursing, greyhound racing, greyhound breeding and other related activities and <Col N="1430" /> such measures, if any, as are considered desirable in the national interest for the better control and development thereof.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The advisory committee presented a forthright and very useful report, for which they deserve due gratitude, and the present legislation is largely based on their recommendations. Since the advisory committee's report was published comments on their analysis of the situation and their suggested improvements have not been wanting and as might be expected while the various branches of the industry are naturally anxious for its general welfare each branch has its own special interests and problems particularly in mind, so that divergence of opinion on some matters is understandable.</P>
    <P>The development of commercial greyhound racing in Britain and this country since the later 1920's has of course given rise to the major problems in the industry.  The advisory committee's report (paragraph 51) says in relation to greyhound racing:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;On the introduction of the sport to Ireland, the question of control became an immediate problem. The Irish Coursing Club supervised coursing but there was some difference of opinion amongst members as to whether the club should undertake the supervision of the new sport.  A special meeting of the club was convened to consider the matter, and with few dissentients it was formally decided to undertake supervision of greyhound racing and to formulate appropriate rules in this connection. The wisdom of this decision has been questioned in many quarters. From the national viewpoint, however, it was desirable that greyhound racing, as well as coursing, should be supervised by some central authority and provided the subsequent control exercised by the Irish Coursing Club were entirely effective, the decision might have been justified.  This additional task, however, placed too great a strain on the Irish Coursing Club which as a result found itself <Col N="1431" /> unable to cope effectively with the abuses which gradually became prevalent in the sport.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As regards the constitution of the Irish Coursing Club&mdash;which, at the time the advisory committee reported, comprised a maximum membership of 194 representative members (that is one member representing each coursing club and track) and 100 elected members (that is members elected at general meetings of the club by a two thirds vote from amongst consistent supporters of greyhound coursing who are registered greyhound owners)&mdash;the advisory committee pointed out that the representative members, especially of coursing clubs, did not exert the influence they should in the affairs of the club.  Paragraph 99 of the advisory committee's report says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Conflicting view have been expressed by witnesses as to the reasons for this apathy amongst coursing clubs.  It has been asserted on behalf of the clubs that nonattendance at Irish Coursing Club meetings was because their representatives felt they exerted no influence whatever; and that matters coming before the general body were in fact already decided by the standing committee and with the support of the &lsquo;elected&rsquo; element would be assured of approval, notwithstanding any views to the contrary held by ordinary representatives. Other witnesses maintained that the apathy was due to the fact that the representatives of coursing clubs often had little experience and that in any event they were mainly concerned in promoting the interests of their own particular clubs.  It is true that many clubs are formed mainly for the purpose of organising a coursing meeting and apart from this have little interest.  It is equally true, however, that unless coursing clubs themselves are prepared to participate more actively in Irish Coursing Club affairs, any scheme of reorganisation will fail.  It is, accordingly, our hope that coursing clubs will in future take a more lively <Col N="1432" /> interest in the affairs of the industry as a whole and that a reorganised Irish Coursing Club will give them all possible encouragement in this direction.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The major recommendations of the advisory committee dealt with the foregoing two matters, namely, the provision of adequate supervision of greyhound racing and allied activities, so as to eliminate abuses, and the internal organisation of the Irish Coursing Club.</P>
    <P>As regards greyhound racing, the advisory committee recommended that the control of greyhound racing and of all matters directly connected therewith should be assigned to a statutory control board.  As regards the reorganisation of the Irish Coursing Club &mdash;which it was suggested should in future deal with the routine work associated with the greyhound industry, particularly breeding and coursing, subject to such overriding authority as might be exercised by the control board&mdash;the advisory committee recommended that the club's membership should comprise one representative member from each coursing club and racing track, with ten co-opted members to replace the existing maximum of 100 elected members; and that the standing committee of the club (a proportion of which has been appointed yearly in rotation from amongst both representative members and elected members of the club at the annual general meetings) should be replaced by an executive committee of representative members only, appointed on a proportionate basis by provincial committees&mdash;the provincial committees comprising the representative members in each province.</P>
    <P>One-third of the members so appointed from each province to the executive committee would retire yearly in rotation.  It was also recommended that the members of the executive committee elected from each province should include club representatives in at least the proportion which the number of coursing clubs in the province would bear to the combined number of coursing clubs and racing tracks in the province.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1433" /> The Bill, in Part II, provides for the establishment of the Greyhound Industry Board consisting of seven members (the maximum recommended by the advisory committee) to be appointed by the Minister for Agriculture after consultation with the Minister for Finance.  Four of the six ordinary members, i.e., excluding the chairman, would be appointed by the Minister on the first occasion from amongst the members of the standing committee, and thereafter from amongst the members of the executive committee of the Irish Coursing Club. If the representatives of the standing committee or the executive committee on the board should fail to secure appointment as members of the executive committee under the revised Irish Coursing Club constitution they would thereby cease to be members of the board and would be replaced by eligible members.</P>
    <P>Although the advisory committee did not favour direct representation of particular interests on the board, the case made subsequently by the standing committee of the Irish Coursing Club for representation on the same lines as applies to the Racing Board for horses, where six of the 11 members appointed must be members of the Turf Club or the National Hunt Steeplechase Committee, did not appear unreasonable.  Co-ordination between the board and the Irish Coursing Club will be necessary in a large degree if the board is to function smoothly and efficiently; and, of course, the reorganisation of the Irish Coursing Club itself is designed to ensure that its executive committee will have the full confidence of the industry at all times.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill provides for the licensing of greyhound racetracks by the board and for regulations by the board to cover all matters in relation to tracks and greyhound racing.  Provision is also made for rules by the Irish Coursing Club in relation to the functioning of tracks and greyhound racing; here again the standing committee of the Irish Coursing Club appeared to make a reasonable case, subsequent to the advisory committee's report, for retaining purely disciplinary <Col N="1434" /> functions in regard to racing as well as breeding and coursing because of the close inter-connection of these in many respects, as well as the further important point made by the club that its racing rules apply to the Six County licensed tracks affiliated to it and that the club's position in that respect should not therefore be prejudiced by its ceasing to be recognised as a rule-making authority for racing in the Twenty-Six Counties. Under the Bill, rules made by the club must, in any event, be with the consent of the board.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill concerns the reconstitution and future status of the Irish Coursing Club.  Subject to the general authority of the board, the reconstituted Irish Coursing Club will be statutorily recognised as the controlling body for greyhound breeding and coursing matters, and the club's revised constitution is attached as a Schedule to the Bill.  Under the new constitution each coursing club and racetrack will, as previously, appoint one representative from the club and track to be a member of the Irish Coursing Club, but the previous maximum of 100 elected members, i.e., elected at general meetings of the Irish Coursing Club will be reduced to 50 as soon as the number of existing elected members falls with the passage of time to that level.  These elected members will in future be known as co-opted members.</P>
    <P>The advisory committee recommended a maximum of only ten co-opted members, but, in connection with revision of the club's constitution, the Irish Coursing Club representatives very strongly desired that the number should not be reduced below 50.  These elected or co-opted members are drawn from prominent supporters of coursing whose advice and experience are considered to be of special value to the club.  There have, as the advisory committee mentioned, been criticisms that the elected members exercised undue influence in the past as compared with the representative members appointed by the individual clubs and tracks, but there should be no danger of this under the revised constitution.</P>
    <P>The co-opted members will only have <Col N="1435" /> a vote at general meetings of the club, where they are greatly outnumbered by the representative members and the co-opted members will not be eligible either to become themselves, or to vote at provincial committee meetings for election of, the members of the executive committee of the club.</P>
    <P>The principles of the revised constitution are otherwise generally in accord with the advisory committee's recommendations.  In particular, only representative members of clubs or tracks may be appointed to the executive committee and the number appointed from each province must include coursing club representatives to at least the proportion which the number of coursing clubs in the province bears to the total number of clubs and tracks in the province; the appointments will be made by the provincial committees in proportion to the total number of clubs and tracks in the respective provinces, and only representative members may vote at meetings of the provincial committees.</P>
    <P>Part V of the Bill, dealing with course-betting permits for bookmakers and levies in respect of course bets, follows the lines of Part III of the 1954 Act concerning horse-racing except that its operation is subject to ministerial Order from time to time, as the possibility is allowed for that, instead of a levy on course bets, there may be substituted a special admission charge on bookmakers payable to the board under sub-sections (4) and (7) of Section 48 in Part VI of the Bill. Such special admission charges would of course be in addition to the admission charges payable to the tracks or clubs holding the meetings, and under sub-section (1) of Section 48 the board would have power to control the over-all charges.  Under the 1945 Act concerning horse-racing, the maximum admission charge to bookmakers is fixed at five times the charge to members of the public and it has been represented on behalf of greyhound bookmakers, especially the smaller ones, that the same limitation should apply in their case.  The present charges to greyhound bookmakers are substantially in excess of five times the charges to spectators and the greyhound <Col N="1436" /> tracks appear to think that the same limitation as for horse-racing would involve them in losses.  It has been deemed the best course to leave it to the board to go into the matter fully and decide what is fairest to all concerned from time to time.  It may be said in particular that the board will be expected to protect at all times the legitimate interests of the small bookmakers who be subject to a betting levy or to a special admission charge in lieu thereof.</P>
    <P>There will also be the operation of totalisators by the Greyhound Industry Board, as provided for in Section 20 and Section 40 of the Bill.  The advisory committee suggested the installation of totalisators by the board, first at the Dublin tracks and later at the Cork and Limerick tracks; this appears a very reasonable proposition. The board should derive a fair part of its income in the course of time from the totalisators, but for some period at least a course-betting levy is considered unavoidable.  The advisory committee suggested a levy of 2½ per cent. in the first year and 1¼ per cent. thereafter.  The board's regulations under Section 32 prescribing the amount of the levy will require the consent of the Minister, and it may be said at this stage that, having regard to the interests of the small bookmakers, the intention is that in the first year the levy should also not be more than 1¼ per cent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Regard must be had to that matter.  My concern has been effectively to protect the legitimate interests of the small bookmaker; but, if the problem to which Deputy O'Malley refers of making a levy of 1¼ per cent. workable, should prove insurmountable, it may be that the small bookmakers would themselves prefer to see a levy fixed at 2½ per cent. for the purpose of making its collection more practicable from the racing public. But, as I say, if the general feeling should transpire to be that the interests of the small bookmakers require the lower rate of levy, I would be prepared to say that we certainly ought to try it out at that level if that would help the small bookmaker and his employees to keep going.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I carefully examined that and I am prepared to admit to the Dáil that the apparent delay in producing this Bill is in part due to what was, perhaps, an excessive solicitude on my part to see if I could devise ways and means of making the Bill work without a levy on the small bookmakers; and it was only when it was brought home to me irresistibly that if we were to try and help the industry, which, after all, in the long run is in the interests of the bookmakers as well as everybody else, that we had to have a bookmakers' levy that I persuaded myself of the propriety of bringing the proposals which I now submit to the House.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am always open to suggestion, but I examined this matter in all its aspects.  I have discussed it with the small bookmakers twice and they well know that I have examined every conceivable device I could examine to try to help them but unless we make up our minds that we are not going to operate the Racing Board device for helping the industry at all, as at present advised, I do not see how we can do without that levy on the bookmakers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part VI of the Bill deals with a number of miscellaneous matters arising mostly out of recommendations made by the advisory committee.  These include, especially, power for the board to ensure that public sales and exports of greyhounds, in relation to which abuses have been known to occur, are adequately supervised, and power for the board and the club to investigate cases of suspected wrongdoing and take any suitable disciplinary action called for as a result.  It may be mentioned that only the board is concerned in the case of disqualification orders under Section 45 of the Bill because action in that connection by the club&mdash; which would be concerned with affiliated clubs and tracks in the Six <Col N="1438" /> Counties also&mdash;would be taken in accordance with disciplinary rules made under the club's constitution.</P>
    <P>It is hoped that the Bill will give adequate powers to the greyhound industry itself, suitably reorganised, for its development on sound lines commanding the confidence of the public here and of the export market for Irish greyhounds, without which the industry cannot hope to prosper.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude, I should like to emphasise that the purpose of this Bill is to give the industry itself the means of salvaging itself.  I do not think the Minister for Agriculture, or any other Minister, can undertake responsibility for the greyhound industry, racetracks and coursing any more than a Minister could take responsibility for the administration of horse-racing.  But what I think we have a duty to do in existing circumstances is to give the industry the power effectively to regulate itself so that, if it wants to put itself on a sound basis, it shall have the power and resources wherewith to do so.</P>
    <P>Lastly, I know that it will be the wish of the House that I should say at this stage that it is the duty of any such board, representing an industry, to have regard to the legitimate interests of all parties who depend upon that industry for their living, no matter how small and humble the individuals may be.  I have had that constantly present to my mind since the drafting of this Bill was undertaken and I think the House will share with me the desire to place it on record now that we are not prepared to accept the principle in regard to this business that one cannot have omelettes without breaking eggs.  We want this board to approach their task with due regard to the legitimate interests of the humblest egg which depends for its existence on the future prosperity of the greyhound coursing and racing industry and the greyhound breeding industry in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill. My only regret is that it has taken so long to introduce it.  I have my doubts, however, as to where the Bill was drafted or where the heads of the Bill came from.  Looking at the Bill, it <Col N="1439" /> would appear to me that it was drafted in the headquarters of the Irish Coursing Club.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The general position of the greyhound industry here is a very interesting one.  Away back in 1915 or 1916 we were under the control of the National Coursing Board in England.  At that time one gentleman, in particular, and some of his friends came together and set up a control board here in Ireland.  It was successful in carrying out coursing meetings all over the country.  With the advent of greyhound racing new problems arose.  There was more money in the sport and, because there was more money in it, more people jumped into it.  The result was that we had many undesirables getting into what was one of the finest sports in the country. From 1927 onwards doubts were created in the minds of many people engaged in the greyhound industry whether as breeders, coursers or merely people who went to track-racing. In 1946 and 1947 there was a general outcry.  The report sent in by the advisory committee set up by the present Minister for Agriculture in 1951 and received in 1952, would make one think before giving to the people who were responsible for the running of the greyhound industry in the country from 1916 to 1947 the supreme powers that are being given to them now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no reconstitution. It is the present standing committee which will constitute the new board.  It is before the reconstitution takes place that this board is being appointed.  What does the report reveal?  It reveals defects in the constitution, etc., of the Irish Coursing Club.  The summary of the report states:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The report shows that the chief defect in the present day organisation of the club lies in its unrepresentative character.  The elected <Col N="1440" /> members in the main have ceased to be active participants in the industry. The influence of representatives on racing tracks both in the general body and on the standing committee has become disproportionate.  The standing committee is composed almost exclusively of elected members. Changes in its personnel are rare and its actions have tended to become autocratic.  Neither the administration nor the distribution of the club's funds has been wholly satisfactory.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These are the people that the Minister is now going to appoint to the new greyhound board.  They have a majority on it, four out of seven.  If they proved incompetent in keeping this sport clean from 1947 until 1952, is it not the duty of the Minister to see that they will not be responsible for the administration of the sport in the future?  Unless this measure is amended the Minister, by the introduction of this Bill, is deliberately legalising the undesirable effects that we had in the sport during the years I have mentioned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy advert to the fact that over three years they would all retire and be replaced&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking of the first board that will operate this legislation. Again summarising the report, it goes on to state:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The report establishes that wrongdoing in the different branches of the greyhound industry has in recent years become widespread.  In breeding, substitution of puppies is a common occurrence.  In coursing, dogs have been deliberately switched and doped and standards of stewarding, slipping and judging leave ample scope for improvement. These abuses in breeding and coursing are not, however, on a large scale.  In greyhound racing, on the other hand, malpractices are more prevalent and more grave.  Fraudulent betting coups have been frequently brought off by persons in possession of information which was not available to the public; the grading of competing dogs has been <Col N="1441" /> unsatisfactory in many instances; information given on race cards is often inadequate and unrepresentative of true form; private trials have taken place on licensed tracks about which the public was kept unaware; there has been substitution and doping of dogs; other abuses of a less serious nature are also known to occur.  The report ascribes the prevalence of these malpractices primarily to the fact that the supervision exercised by the Irish Coursing Club has become almost entirely ineffective and asserts that the club, as at present constituted, cannot be regarded as competent to excercise effective control.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That report was signed by the chairman of the standing committee of the Irish Coursing Club with a colleague of his.  Are we to legalise this sport and to give these people the authority to continue doing these things?  In effect that is what it means.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is rubbish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>We are putting four of these men back on this board, giving them a majority.  If they have proved a failure for 25 years, what reason have we to think they will make a success of it now?  They have allowed all these things to creep into the sport. During my term of office, I have had letters from people engaged in this industry all over the country, from every county&mdash;from greyhound-owners complaining about the prices that were offered on the tracks, from people who had offered dogs for sale, stating how they were swindled at many dog sales in the country.  All these things went on under the blind eye of the Irish Coursing Club.  This industry cannot succeed if we continue these things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be suggested that this Bill is based on the Racing Board Act of 1945.  But there is no comparison between the two sports.  You have not the same people engaged in the two sports; you have not the same difficulties obtaining in horse-racing as in greyhound racing.  There are not as many dangers to contend with.  Consequently the job is much easier for <Col N="1442" /> the people engaged in horse-racing than for those engaged in greyhound racing.  You need men of the highest integrity to administer greyhound racing in the country and I doubt, as a result of our experience over the past 25 years, if we can get them from the Irish Coursing Club.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not there?  An independent body of men sitting in judgment on these people who were responsible, gave an honest report to the Minister for Agriculture and I am quoting from that report.  Yet we in this House are asked now to give legal effect to what has been going on.  We had in the past the 100 elected representatives. Who are these people?  If they were so genuinely concerned with the sport and were of such great advantage to it in the past, why were they not elected representatives of their coursing clubs?  They had to be members of the coursing clubs.  Why were these men not elected as representatives to represent their clubs in the Irish Coursing Club?  Why was it necessary to introduce this undemocratic system&mdash;that because he was a friend of somebody else he should be put into the club, brought in by the back door when he was not able to get in by the front door, as happened in many of the cases?  There was a reason for it, of course, the reason being that he would support those in authority and it was another way of maintaining the votes to keep these gentlemen in control.  That is why the elected members were brought in.  It is time to get rid of them.</P>
      <P>If we want to have a democratic organisation or association running this sport, there is a simple way of doing it: let each coursing club elect its representative.  You have the provincial members who represent their province, for instance, and go on to the executive council, or on to the standing committee&mdash;whatever name you like to give it.  Then I am satisfied to give the Irish Coursing Club representation on the board, representation of their own choosing, but not a majority.</P>

      <P>There should be other ways of dealing with that.  There are enough people who are interested in the sport, honestly interested in it, who are not members of the Irish Coursing Club, who could give good service on the board and could be appointed by the Minister.</P>
      <P>I would certainly give representation to the Irish Coursing Club.  There is no doubt that they are entitled to representation, but it should be the elected representatives of the clubs who would get that representation, and not men who have been elected by the back door.</P>
      <P>In his statement introducing the Bill, the Minister said that only elected members or representatives of the clubs can be appointed on it.  I am very glad to hear that, but now some of these people who are now elected members of the Irish Coursing Club will have themselves selected as representatives of their clubs, in order to qualify as members of the board.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope they will not. But remember, that is all right three years hence, but to-day it is not right because in this Bill it is members of <Col N="1444" /> the present Irish Coursing Club you are putting on.  You are not waiting for the election of the provincial councils; you are not waiting for the election of a new executive council; you are not waiting for the appointment of the club or the election of a new club. You will still draw that membership from the 294 people who are there&mdash; roughly 294&mdash;170 representing the clubs, 100 elected&mdash;may be a little less now&mdash; and 20 or 21 from racing tracks.  These are the people from whom you will be drawing and I do not know how, out of these, you will find your four members.</P>
      <P>If the Minister told me that immediately after the passing of this Bill, before he made the appointments, they had to put their house in order by having their elections and appointing a new standing committee or executive committee and appointing from them, then, I would be satisfied.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;if it were not on a rotten foundation, it would be good, but we happen to be on a rotten foundation, as that report indicates and proves.</P>
      <P>There is no difficulty about it.  It could be done before this Bill goes through the House.  If there is a will, there is a way to do it, but there was no will to do it in the past.  This Bill will not pass through this House for a couple of months yet.  This is the height of the coursing season.  There is no difficulty now in having clubs called together and appointing their representatives and executive committee, but there is no inclination on the part of some of the people who are at the top in the Irish Coursing Club to do these things.</P>
      <P>I quote from a circular that was issued by the Irish Coursing Club after a discussion with me:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Although we agreed on scarcely any point raised throughout the conference, we left with a vague understanding <Col N="1445" /> that we would examine our constitution and rules in the light of the advisory committee's report and let the Minister know what changes, if any, we propose to make.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was the attitude adopted when they were asked to put their house in order and that is the attitude the present Minister ran away from, and he gave them their way in allowing them to have a majority on this board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a good job for some of the people now interested in it that I was not bringing it in.  It would not be a Bill of this sort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter that I wanted to refer to, that is, the betting levies.  How are these to be collected? Is the bookmaker to collect the levy? Will he be paid for it?  For instance, in the case of small bets, what will <Col N="1446" /> happen?  There is a very short period between races.  There is not an automatic system of doing it.  I suppose somebody will have to take the levy and write, and so on.  Bookmakers have to pay out money and all that sort of thing.  In the case of small bets, will the levies not be paid in twopences and threepences?  It will be impossible for a bookmaker doing business in any sort of large way to keep track of all these things.  I am speaking now of small bets of 2/-, 3/- or 4/-.  It would be all right if it were in pounds.  In these small bets, will it not seem ridiculous?  In the end, the bookmaker may suffer the loss by paying the amounts.  The Minister should have another go and see if he can devise some means to get rid of that levy, if possible.</P>
    <P>The one point that I want to stress in this matter is that it is necessary, now that this board is being set up, that it should be a board that will command the support of all the people engaged in the industry.  I was referring a few moments ago to the progress that had been made in greyhound breeding and in dog racing.  Up to 1947 or 1948 it was becoming a valuable asset to the country and we were receiving a fair amount of money from it.  As a matter of fact in 1946 we got over £1,000,000 from our greyhounds and in 1947 we got another £1,000,000.  It was at that time that these flagrant things began to happen and that the demand was made to the Minister to hold an inquiry.</P>
    <P>The demand to hold the inquiry was the result of all these things&mdash;the swindling and the doping of dogs.  In 1950 the value of the dog-racing industry in the country had dropped to £500,000.  I have been told that we could have built up a very substantial trade with the Americans at that time, if it was not for the fact that a number of dogs leaving this country had been found to be substituted.  It was discovered that fighters had been sent out and when they arrived in America they were found to be useless.  Naturally, the Americans did not come back here again to buy.  That is the kind of control that was being exercised by the Irish Coursing Club at the time.  We <Col N="1447" /> had dishonesty in the sport.  That is the only way to describe it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what Deputy MacEntee calls it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The sport was not honest.  It was distinctly dishonest and there was doping of dogs and dishonesty in the sale of dogs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy MacEntee says so it must be true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not know it to be true?  If he did not know it to be true, why did he go to the bother of setting up a commission to inquire into these alleged malpractices? He knew it was true and he did a good job by setting up the commission.  After doing that good job and after holding the inquiry he should have gone further and accepted the report of the commission and the recommendations made to him by these men.  These men entered into that work and they were not prejudiced going into it.  They went into it to give a fair, honest opinion and they submitted that fair, honest opinion to the Minister.  If they were an independent body of men it might be suggested that they did not know what they were talking about but you had the chairman of the Irish Coursing Club as a member of the board.</P>
      <P>The report was challenged by some of the officials of the Irish Coursing Club when they stated:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We said that we objected generally to a number of the recommendations made in the report; that it was the feeling of the Irish Coursing Club that some of the findings contained in the report were the views of certain pressure groups who were anxious to see the authority of the Irish Coursing Club whittled away and perhaps eventually replaced by some substitute organisation.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Deputy oblige me by telling me what he is quoting from?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quoting from a <Col N="1448" /> report of one of the higher officials of the Irish Coursing Club of a meeting with the Minister for Agriculture at the time.  That report was circulated to club members.  They also went on to say, when dealing with the question of the chairman of the Irish Coursing Club being a member of the commission, that he might not be as well versed in the administration of the Irish Coursing Club as some of the other officials would be.</P>
      <P>As far as I can see, the report is an honest one and one that could be accepted by the Minister.  It would have been accepted by me as a genuine effort to clean up the sport and to put it on a sound basis.  Before this Bill goes through, I intend to submit a number of amendments which I hope the Minister will accept because they will make the Bill a more secure one. One of the amendments I propose to submit is to change the personnel of this board.  I would not hold the board to be an independent one if the Irish Coursing Club was permitted to nominate four people on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the Deputy and myself are both trying to get the best possible board we can.  Is there not a distinction between saying that the Minister is required to received four representatives from the Irish Coursing Club and saying that the Minister should choose four from the standing committee of the Irish Coursing Club? There is a distinction.  I believe that there is some virtue in continuity.  In three years' time the Irish Coursing Club will be a body which is elected purely from the clubs throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Why not have the elected body first, so that when the Bill goes through you can have the four representatives from the new and freely elected standing committee?  Why not give an opportunity to have the standing committee elected on a democratic basis by having the representatives of the coursing clubs throughout the <Col N="1449" /> country elected?  You would then probably get as good, if not better, members from the standing committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I had the feeling that, when you are trying to reform a situation of this kind, you should not try to do it by process of revolution.  It is far better to do it gradually if you are certain that you are laying down an organisation that will gradually completely change the existing unrepresentative character to a purely representative character.  We could have required them to hold elections immediately after the passage of the Bill but I felt it better to do it by easy stages because, if you did not do so, you might have a completely new committee without experience and that might lead to catastrophe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>You are suffering then for three years and having regard to the amount of damage done in the last six or seven years there will be no work for the board then because there will be no greyhounds.  That is all I have to say about it at the moment but it is my intention to put in an amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the purpose of the Bill is a good one, although I believe it is dealing with a matter which is relatively unimportant.  However, I suppose it is only right that we should attend to the grievances attached to the breeding, coursing and, particularly, to the export of greyhounds. The headline of the horse-racing board has become quite attractive to the greyhound men although I believe myself that there is no comparison between the importance of the two bodies.  Something had to be done because, after all, the greyhound industry has an exportable product which, as the former Minister for Agriculture has said, was worth roughly £1,000,000 eight or nine years ago and is now worth only half of that figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many people are of the opinion that <Col N="1450" /> the decline in that market is due to some of the evils which this legislation sets out to correct.  If that diagnosis is a correct one, this Bill will provoke disagreement on the points raised by Deputy Walsh on the details of this measure.  Many people will take a lot of interest in this debate although, as I say, the matter is not a very important one.  The greyhound has become part of the Irish scene and indeed, from the point of view of rearing and coursing, he is a very desirable part of the scene.  I always like to see a young Irishman, the labourer or the farmer, out with a dog on Sunday.  I think it is a grand thing.  It helps to lighten the tedium of Irish country life. The coming of the racetrack has changed all that; it has made the young puppy worth a potential £100.</P>
    <P>Many unhappy things came before this board.  Those of us who read the evidence are aware of some of the charges and terrible revelations that were made.  Of course, there was a great lot of exaggeration about the whole thing such as there was about the efficiency of the Irish Coursing Club.  It is agreed that there was room for improvement.  The Irish Coursing Club was started to look after a sport that had very little financial background and I think the Irish Coursing Club did that job very well. But the advent of the racetracks and of the export market produced evils and brought undesirables into the sport.  The Irish Coursing Club were not competent to control and protect the breeder and the racegoer when they came to deal with great crowds. They were not able to deal with the new situation in the same way as they had been able to protect the game of coursing which was a comparatively small thing in the various districts.</P>
    <P>That is what this Bill sets out to do &mdash;to try and eliminate the evils that exist.  Frankly, I am not very sure whether it is going to succeed or not, but at any rate I think there is no point in discussing here now the transition period.  I think the Minister is right in saying that there should be interim management by the Irish Coursing Club.  That is the only sensible thing to do.  You will get men <Col N="1451" /> on this board who were intimately associated with the Irish Coursing Club for years past and if Deputy Walsh were sitting here on this side of the House he would have to call on these men to participate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Walsh was quite agreeable to let the Irish Coursing Club do that while he was here as Minister for Agriculture.  The difference between him and the present Minister is that the Minister is bringing in the Bill and Deputy Walsh did not.  I am prepared to support the Minister on that basis. I should like to say that the original Irish Coursing Club did extremely good work, and I should like to record my appreciation of that and to state that the fact they were not competent to deal with the evils which arose was no slur on them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am much more aware than is Deputy MacEntee of the background of that.  I am not very good on most things but I know quite a lot about this.  The <i>Greyhound and Sporting Press</i> was a most curious setup and its control is clearly defined in this Bill.  I want to make sure that the rural breeder of greyhounds is not breeding for fun, that he will make a larger portion of profit out of the export of his animal and that foreign customers will get a reputable article and will come back for more.  That is what I hope this Bill will do.  Any further criticism can wait until the later stages.  I agree with Deputy Walsh that the whole thing will stand or fall on the men who control it.  If the Minister succeeds in getting men of integrity and character this Bill will succeed in its object.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been stated that all the findings of the advisory committee were unanimous and yet at the outset of the report we have this extraordinary statement:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;At least one member of the committee questions whether the food consumed by greyhounds could not be more economically used in other ways and whether many of the persons concerned with the greyhound industry and particularly with greyhound racing could not be more usefully employed in other directions.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy give the reference?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is on page 7, section 3, paragraph 5 of the scope of inquiry of the advisory committee on the greyhound industry.  The report goes on:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;He agrees, however, that the followers of greyhound racing are quite as entitled as other members of the community to the particular sport they prefer and also that greyhound racing, under proper supervision, cannot well be objected to on ethical grounds.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I wonder what about the moral ground?  The report continues:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In any event, the industry, such as it is, definitely absorbs a large number of persons and its sudden collapse would, at least for a time, undoubtedly cause serious unemployment in many directions.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>To have an individual of that mentality as a member of the board would cause one furiously to think as to the findings of the committee as a whole.  If this is any criterion of the attitude adopted by the other members of the committee I, for one, cannot have 100 per cent. confidence in the report.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>There are other interests to be appointed by the Minister <Col N="1453" /> to act on the commission on the 21st February, 1951.  I know some of the gentlemen who are appointed and they are of the highest integrity, entirely beyond reproach, but human nature being what it is, some of these gentlemen had vested interests, some of these gentlemen are important directors of greyhound tracks.  I say that, unfortunately, while the greyhound track-managers and such, and a representative from the Department of Agriculture, were on this commission the ordinary man in the street&mdash;call him the punter or anything else&mdash;or the bookmaker, were not represented.</P>
      <P>Talking about representation generally, the commission has condemned any sectional representation on this board.  Before I come to the Irish Coursing Club representation, I would ask the Minister to cast his mind back to consider the nucleus of the Racing Board.  He has used that as a comparison in many cases in his introductory speech to-day and in the explanatory leaflet he prepared.  Is the Minister aware that an eminent member of the bookmaking fraternity is actually a member of the Racing Board for horse-racing, that a most eminent member who died some years ago had his place before that, and that it is an understood fact that the members of the bookmaking fraternity are entitled to representation?</P>
      <P>I agree, again, as I say, that the commission is against anything in the nature of sectional interest, in the greyhound industry representation. They say it would lead, not to a committee of from five to seven, but to an unwieldy number of from 17 to 30.  With that I agree, but surely one member on the board representing the bookmakers in the four provinces of Ireland would not be out of place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of the Irish Coursing Club representation, I sincerely trust that when the amendment is put before the Minister providing for control to be taken from them he will accept it.  Some minutes ago the Minister was quite surprised when Deputy Walsh mentioned the fact that the Irish Coursing Club had in fact control, and I hope the Minister will appreciate the fact that it is unsatisfactory <Col N="1454" /> to have these people with a majority.  I am not attacking the members of the Irish Coursing Club. Individually, they are gentlemen of the highest integrity, but what happened in the Irish Coursing Club was like what happened with Chiang Kai Shek in Formosa.  We found family dynasties organising the running of the Irish Coursing Club and God only knows how they ran it.  These gentlemen failed in their duty to the public and to the breeders and owners by not turning up at the meetings and by letting certain individuals carry on in whom they had the greatest&mdash;shall I say&mdash;trust.  But in later years their eyes began to open.  We had the extraordinary position that members of the Irish Coursing Club, who were on this commission, had not the guts to go down to Clonmel and say what they had to say.  They stabbed individuals in the back in a report when they would not get up in Clonmel and say their say, when there was a responsibility and an onus on them to do so, if they had anything to say about the running of the <i>Sporting Press</i> and about the fact that fantastic profits made by that company were not ploughed back or utilised to the benefit of the smaller owners or the benefit of the greyhound tracks by increasing the amount of stakes.  Rather were these profits spent on new buildings and buying&mdash;mark you&mdash;new machinery. The total expenditure, I think, came to something in the region of £64,000. The <i>Sporting Press</i> is supposed to be a body run on a non-profit basis but they went in and tendered for the printing of bookmakers' tickets and race-cards all over the country.  These are the gentlemen who should have been questioned in Clonmel at meetings of the Irish Coursing Club.  They come up here and prepare this report which was printed and published in the Press and which made most unhappy reading.</P>
    <P>No one suggests&mdash;and I am not suggesting&mdash;that any individual or individuals derived any financial benefit which was not theirs; I simply observe that some individuals derived fantastic benefits and if what has been going on down the years in the Irish Coursing Club were generally known <Col N="1455" /> throughout the country&mdash;evidently it was cloaked&mdash;there would have been a revolution.</P>
    <P>It has been remarked here to-day that a balance sheet was not produced at any meeting of the Irish Coursing Club&mdash;remarked in that commission report&mdash;but yet, as Deputy Walsh said, these are the people who are now going to obtain four out of seven seats on this board.  Surely individuals of that type who allowed such matters to come to such a sorry pass are not the type of individuals to be entrusted with a matter on which we are all agreed, namely that the industry needs reorganisation.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but what is the alternative?  Before we go into the lion's den, pass a Bill and make it an Act, I would like to say that I disagree entirely with Deputy Walsh that we should give the Irish Coursing Club any representation at all.  The Irish Coursing Club in my opinion is a misnomer.  A man may be most competent and have a great knowledge of coursing and breeding and of greyhound racing in all its branches without being a member of the Irish Coursing Club.  There are Deputies on all sides of the House who know many men in Limerick, Kilkenny, Kerry and other places who would not touch the Irish Coursing Club with a 40-foot pole because it is only a clique of vested interests which stink in the opinion of many fair-minded sportsmen. As I asked a moment ago, what is the alternative?  The alternative is this: leave the board at seven.  I agree with the Minister's proposal to have an impartial chairman.  In regard to the other six members I would go so far as to say that I trust the Minister&mdash;which might be an extraordinary statement&mdash;to appoint people who would be competent without having any tie-up with the Irish Coursing Club.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, I do not want to <Col N="1456" /> suggest that just because an individual is a member of the Irish Coursing Club he should be debarred from being a member of this board and I hope that an amendment will be happily phrased which will express what I am taking so long to say.</P>
    <P>The question of the bookmakers was raised here to-day.  Under this Bill, the money to finance it has to be obtained somewhere and I do not agree with the expected source of revenue at all.  First of all, the Minister is letting off one body of people very lightly.  If the Minister quotes this report when it suits him, he should also quote it on relevant matters such as the source from which he is to obtain revenue. Is the Minister aware that there is in that report reference to the amazingly high and fantastic profits made by the Dublin tracks?  That statement was made&mdash;and it was unanimously adopted&mdash;by a man who is a managing director of a greyhound track.</P>
    <P>The proposition is to introduce the totalisator and 5 per cent. on that will yield £x; then there will be a levy on the bookmakers.  The commission sent for representatives of various public bodies, one of which was the National Greyhound Racing Club in England.  It is a pity they did not send for a representative of the Bookmakers' Association in Britain because what the Minister contemplates doing here was done in England, namely, imposing a tax on the bookmaker. I hold no brief for these gentlemen at all, or for any section of the community, but they are respected members of society as are the members of any other organisation, and they are entitled to the same rights as other organisations.</P>
    <P>We hear a good deal about the Fair Trade Commission.  Now, this Bill is the greatest bit of blackguardism against any set of individuals I have experienced.  In England when punitive legislation was introduced the Chancellor of the Exchequer estimated the hypothetical revenue which would accrue.  What was the result?  Instead of having 60 or 70 bookmakers in the White City, at Wembley and Walthamstow, and other places the position now is that there are only three or four <Col N="1457" /> bookmakers left; and they are not individuals&mdash;they are combines.  All the others were wiped out.</P>
    <P>No doubt Deputies will talk about the smaller bookmaker in the course of this debate.  He will be the first to go, and then the bigger man.  Remember, there are not so many big men here, but they will go.  Let me give an example of what may happen if the bookmakers have not somebody like the Racing Board on the control board to fight their case.  The representatives of the directors of a certain track in the South of Ireland went to the representatives of the bookmakers some time ago and they said their revenue had fallen greatly and they wanted the bookmakers to pay an increased entry fee.  They agreed, subject to a £20 race being introduced once a week. They paid the increased entry fee.  A certain classic took place and after that classic there was no £20 race but the bookmakers were still liable, and are still liable, for the increased entry fee.  It is all very well to say that if the bookmakers do not agree between themselves, in the allocation of pitches for instance, they can appeal to the board.  If they get notice from the board that their licence will be taken away from them, it will not be taken from them for seven days and during that time they can make further representations to the board&mdash;the board which intends to remove them.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister to wipe out of this Bill the payment of any levy whatsoever by the bookmakers. Let him cast his eye on the owners of the greyhound tracks who, the report says, are getting fantastic and abnormally high profits.  Let him get the money for this control board from the owners of Shelbourne Park, Harold's Cross and so forth.  All they will be charged under this is a possible rental for the totalisator, an unspecified sum.  That will be done by regulation; but four of the individuals who will fix that rental will be members of the standing committee of the Irish Coursing Club and nearly every track manager at the present time is a member of the standing committee of the Irish Coursing Club.</P>
    <P>To bear out what I have said, the <Col N="1458" /> following track interests are on the standing committee of the Irish Coursing Club: P.F. O'Donoghue, Manager, Shelbourne Park; A.J. Morris, John Riordan, Harold's Cross; J. Clarke, Shelbourne; J.M. Collins, Shelbourne; P.J. Cox, Newbridge; J.P. Frost, Limerick; J.P. Ryan, Limerick, and W.J. Irwin, Limerick.  Is it not possible that four of those gentlemen could be chosen?  It is unlikely, but it is possible.  If they are not chosen, is it not possible they could be got at? I do not mean &ldquo;got at&rdquo; in the sense of bribery or corruption, but so much is done in this city, from selling Tulyar to fixing other deals, in hotels, that it would not surprise me in the least if the control board were run from the Dolphin or somewhere like that.  The position is much too serious.</P>
    <P>I believe the Minister is genuine and sincere in this Bill.  There is no suggestion of any political discrimination, but he has not yet appointed the board; we will have to wait until he appoints the board before we come to that.  I appeal to him to bring in an amendment to cover the points which have been raised.  I would like the bookmakers to have representation.  I have read the report and the Bill three or four times.  To show where victimisation can occur, let us assume that the board is appointed and the totalisator has been established in Shelbourne Park.  The directors come along to deal with the location of bookmakers' pitches, or something like that; if agreement is not reached, the bookmakers can appeal to the board.  There is something wrong in that.</P>
    <P>The board may tell the bookmakers to shift their pitches from the rails and go back to the stand and they may put the totalisator in front of them.  The bookmakers will have no redress.  In Limerick, the bookmakers may be left where they are up under the long shed against the wall and the totalisator may be put 20 feet in front of them, between them and the track itself.  They will have no redress. That is bad enough, but then the Minister comes along and mentions maximum charges.  Maximum charges can be levied on bookmakers and <Col N="1459" /> there is no mention what those maximum charges will be.  The bookmakers can be charged anything the control board deem just.  Will the Minister believe me when I tell him that bookmakers in England were charged £40 per night and from an attendance of 70 they are now down to three on one of the more prominent tracks?</P>
    <P>There is no mention whatever of what is to be the maximum charge on a bookmaker.  The Minister cites the report when it suits his purpose in regard to the Bill but he pays no heed at all to the suggestion in the note in relation to the Racing Board that the maximum charge payable by bookmakers' there is five times the admission charge, in other words the ordinary entry fee and four times that entry fee.  I think that the bookmakers would be very satisfied if, before this Bill goes through, the relevant section were amended so that there would be no doubt whatever about the charge. Section 48 states:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(1)  The board may by regulations fix the maximum charges to be made for admitting persons to greyhound racetracks and different charges may be fixed in respect of different tracks, in respect of different parts of the same track and in respect of bookmakers carrying on their business and persons who are not such bookmakers.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Therefore they are to be in the dark about representation or about a spokesman to fight their case on this new control board.  To show the victimisation which exists&mdash;and we talk about the Racing Board&mdash;let the Minister go into the bar after races at Leopardstown, Phoenix Park or any other of these race meetings and he will find even substantial bookmakers there living in fear of these officials of the Racing Board&mdash;pimps going around with stubs of pencils&mdash;in case they will report them or have their licence taken from them for some such trivial matter as not having paid their licence on the 1st December instead of 2nd.  If this big stick is being used by officials, at least the people concerned can turn around and go to Mr. Power or somebody <Col N="1460" /> else who is represented on the Racing Board and get some justice. They will get no justice from the representatives of the Irish Coursing Club.</P>
    <P>They may get justice from the chairman, the impartial chairman, but what is he going to say?  The conditions of his appointment are that he shall be impartial, that he will know nothing about greyhound racing except perhaps what he reads in the newspapers, that he will not be beneficially interested in the ownership of a racetrack, he must not course a dog, and so on.  What will his attitude be?  His attitude will be: &ldquo;I am the chairman.  I know nothing about coursing or greyhound racing and I will be guided by these gentlemen who, after all, are members of the standing committee of the Irish Coursing Club.&rdquo;  Therefore not alone will they have four members, but they will have an extra one.  That leaves two, and I do not know who they will be.  They might be defeated candidates in by-elections.</P>
    <P>This Bill is so involved in regard to the position about bookmakers that an eminent colleague of mine who read it 16 times told me the best thing to do would be to consult senior counsel. When an eminent colleague advises me to consult senior counsel it must be very involved, because he has no love for senior counsel or such people.</P>

      <P>Michael Colbert.  With regard to the estimates of the control board, in the first year the salary of the chairman was to be so much of the total expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this first year the control board would have to find £22,000 to cover its administrative expenses alone; yet 2½ per cent. from betting with course bookmakers would yield £100,000, licence fees £1,000, etc.  If we set up a board on which all sections of the House are unanimous, although we may differ about its constitution, where is the money going to come from to make it a success and put it in the position that it would be able to carry out the various sections of this Bill?  If <Col N="1461" /> the totalisator is to be properly run it is pointless to have a race, say, at 8 o'clock and another at 8.10 p.m., giving only ten minutes for the tote to operate.  There must be a different approach.  The programme would have to operate so that the first race would be at 8 o'clock, the second at 8.30, every half hour, or perhaps it would be necessary to start a meeting earlier. We will have to attract a new type of individual.  We will have to cater for people in a different way so that they will be able to go up to a bar and not be poisoned by some of the stuff one gets in such places.  We must also ensure that a person can have a cup of tea.  If a new type of customers is to be attracted there must be facilities for them.  I am afraid a very large percentage of people at these tracks are from the left bank, the Latin quarter.  If we want to get the people who are already educated to the tote, the racing fraternity, then we will have to give them the incentives which are provided at the race meetings.</P>
    <P>In the report of the Racing Board it was pointed out that 80 per cent. of its revenue comes from the investor of 2/- units.  That is an amazing figure.  If this control board is to be successful we will have to attract a new type of individual and ensure that the tracks are a little more honest in certain respects than they are.  The majority of the tracks in this country are &ldquo;hooky&rdquo;.  I have no intention of naming those tracks which are dishonest or those which are honest&mdash;I am too cute for that&mdash;but it is a known fact that if a certain gentleman, or gentlemen, is pally with the management of a certain track he will throw a dog into a race for him.  He may have to wait for about three weeks but then it will be thrown into the race.  Possibly it might get a box at the first bend but, more often than not, the much maligned bookmaker, who opens up cautiously at four or five to one, will pay dearly for the friend of the track manager.  We all know that.  Everyone on every side of the House knows that is going on and I am sure there are a few Deputies in the House who&mdash;well!  It shows the strict supervision that is necessary.  Can that be obtained with the proposed <Col N="1462" /> set-up of the new board?  The man-in-the-street, the general public, the bookmakers, want representation on this board.  By the &ldquo;man-in-the-street&rdquo; I mean an individual, a sportsman, having no ties to the Irish Coursing Club or any other coursing club.  The Minister should appoint such an individual, who would be approachable and who would see the difficulties of various sections of the community, without having seen a greyhound track or coursing meeting. If the Minister were to appoint such a man he would be doing a good day's work.</P>
    <P>I should like to quote for the Minister paragraph 136 of the Report of the Advisory Committee on the Greyhound Industry:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We have been impressed with the demand from practically all quarters for a control board to be established by an Act of the Oireachtas, somewhat on the lines of the Racing Board.  Witness after witness declared that conditions in the greyhound industry are such as to place its future in grave jeopardy, that the Irish Coursing Club has failed to check prevailing abuses, and that in any event, a body, other than the Irish Coursing Club, armed by the Legislature with adequate power, is required to cope with the situation.  Even the minority of opinion, which favoured the continuance of the Irish Coursing Club or of some kindred organisation directly representative of the greyhound industry, was in the main in favour of a control board.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is not necessary to read the whole of the paragraph.</P>
    <P>In paragraph 137 they state:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;After careful consideration, we are in agreement with the general demand for a control board and hereby recommend that such body be established by an Act of the Oireachtas.  Every witness who advocated a control board was requested to give his view as to how the board should be constituted and what interests&mdash;if any&mdash;should have direct representation on it.  It is perhaps only natural that certain <Col N="1463" /> interests, e.g., Racing Track Managements, Course Bookmakers, Bookmakers' Assistants, the Irish Coursing Club itself, etc., would each feel entitled to representation. The bulk of opinion as revealed both in memoranda and during oral evidence was, however, opposed to sectional representation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We should not have it both ways.  If the Irish Coursing Club is to be represented, let the bookmakers come in.  The Irish Coursing Club cover all sections.  The bookmakers are just the one body left out.  If the bookmakers are to be left off the control board and if the one representative they seek is cut out, we should also cut out the Irish Coursing Club or members of the standing committee of the Irish Coursing Club and, instead, appoint a reputable man.  I agree that he could have a connection with the sport.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, through the Revenue Commissioners, derives from the entertainment tax on greyhound racing a sum in the region of £13,000 to £18,000&mdash;subject to correction.  This Bill can only be a success through the assistance and contribution of the general public, in other words, the man who places his bet.  I suggest that the Minister should use his good offices with the Minister for Finance to cut out the entertainment tax on people who go to greyhound tracks.  We would start off then with the position that there would be no tax; there would be further increases in revenue and there would be these allegedly fantastically high profits of the track owners.  Why not make one collection then?  Let them take what they can.  The tote will benefit.  More people will come in if the price is reduced by virtue of the tax being eliminated.  The Minister could take the necessary steps to see that the price would not be the same.  Instead of this impossible levy, the Minister could then ascertain what contribution&mdash;and I submit it would be a very substantial contribution&mdash; could be obtained from the greyhound track owners themselves.</P>
    <P>Section 23 (3) (d) deals with the right of the board to set up, maintain <Col N="1464" /> and work totalisators on greyhound racetracks on such sites as may be required by the board and, where they are set up, as to provision by licensees of suitable arrangements for bookmakers in places convenient for carrying on their business, such arrangements to be determined, in default of agreement between bookmakers and licensees, by the board.  That is another section which will lead inevitably to friction and there is the possibility that the Greyhound Bookmakers' associations may stop betting entirely at greyhound tracks.  Then, let them have their tracks and their totalisator and we will see how successful the owners of these tracks will be without the bookmakers.  That is not an idle threat and that is not a gun held up to the head of the Minister by these people.  Their livelihood is at stake.  If the Bill in its present form is enacted, their days are numbered.</P>
    <P>I am in favour of not having any levy at all and I have already given the Minister another source from which we can get the contribution.  It is expected to get a contribution of £100,000 from a 5 per cent. levy; £43,700 from a 2½ per cent. levy, and that from a levy of 1¼ per cent. the revenue expected would be from £20,000 to £25,000.  I say that the Minister should get that money from the fantastic profits said to be made by the two big Dublin tracks and ultimately from the two provincial tracks, where it is anticipated that the totalisator will be working in three or four years' time.</P>
    <P>If a person goes and puts a bet on a greyhound at six to four and wins, that would gain him 3/- to 2/-.  At a levy of 1¼ per cent. that would amount to something like a halfpenny.  It must be obvious to the Minister that the bookmakers will have to employ extra staff to deal with these halfpence, pence and threepences and to pay out the money.  Besides having to employ extra staff there is also the possibility that the bookmakers will lose business. If a person sees a bookmaker with 20 or 30 people around him waiting to be paid he will go elsewhere to place his bet.  Not alone will he do <Col N="1465" /> that but he might be driven down to the tote.  This goes to show that the bookmakers are going to suffer further. They have taken the matter so seriously that they have actually made representations that, should any of their assistants lose employment, consideration should be given to these assistants in the recruiting of the staff for the working of the totalisator.</P>
    <P>I should like to make my attitude quite clear about the control board. I am not casting any aspersions on any of these gentlemen and if a person such as Mr. J. P. Frost, managing director of the Limerick track, were appointed to the control board, I, for one, would have no objection.  As individuals, they are men of the highest integrity and honour but they will see only one side of the matter&mdash; their own side as track directors.  Any action contemplated by them will not be impartial.  They will want to see what will be the overall outcome of such an action on their own financial matters.  That does not mean that such men of the highest integrity and honour will be biassed in giving information on certain matters.  What they will do is to &ldquo;cod&rdquo; their consciences that what they are doing is being done impartially and in the best interests of the industry.  I can only offer the strongest objection if these people, as a body, are going to control the industry.</P>
    <P>We have already gone against the report of the committee in some respects and I would suggest that we go further and have an impartial chairman; give the Bookmakers' Association a representative; give the breeders or owners a representative and give the track management a representative.  We should cut the thing down to a chairman and four others.  I think the confidence of the public will not be obtained unless these changes are made in the Bill when it comes before the House again.</P>
    <P>Section 17 of the Bill states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The board may borrow such sums as it may require for the purposes of its functions, but the total amount due at any time in respect of such <Col N="1466" /> loans shall not, without the consent of the Minister, given with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance, exceed £25,000.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am suggesting to the Minister that this board might borrow £25,000, to start off with, before it begins to function in a manner which will wipe out a section of the community which gives great employment and is a source of revenue to the Minister in other matters.  The Minister should bear in mind that the greyhound bookmakers are carrying on business, or at least some of them are carrying on business, through S.P. offices.  Therefore, he should bear in mind what the provisions of Section 17 are.  He has suggested that there should be no revolution in regard to the setting up of this control board and that it should be a gradual process.  Then let us start off quietly and gradually in this matter. Let the new board borrow the £25,000 which they are empowered to borrow, then review the position after 12 months and let the Minister come back to the House and bring in amendments to this Act but let us have these safeguards first.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>This section amends the principal Act in relation to the Schedule, and I think it would be no harm if the Minister would be good enough to take this opportunity to make it still more explicit, if that be possible.  As far as the determination of matters arising out of the acquisition of land is concerned, that is of course a matter which will be adjudged by the lay commissioners or the Appeal Tribunal if there should be an appeal. I think there may be some who do not understand that, as far as the acquisition procedure is concerned, the Minister does not enter into it&mdash;that the land is acquired through the Land Commission by agreement as the Minister has said.  Under these amendments to Section 17, the Minister has a definite duty or responsibility&mdash;a statutory responsibility which perhaps might be described as judicial or semi-judicial&mdash;and the question would naturally be asked whether there is any precedent for the Minister being the person or agency which determines the compensation, or whether there would have been any alternative so that it might not appear that the Minister was concerned personally.</P>
      <P>We know that he is acting only in his capacity as Minister but there is always the suggestion that the head of a Department may have certain prejudices or may be guided by certain factors or certain appeals or considerations which might not be proper in the strictly judicial determination of a question.  I think, therefore, it would be well if the Minister could explain what the procedure is likely to be in connection with this question of compensation. If the compensation is the amount that has been agreed upon between the Minister and the vendor, there does not seem to be very much of a problem but if the compensation should be altered, and I am not clear whether it will or can be altered&mdash;I presume it can on appeal to the Appeal Tribunal&mdash;I should like to know, apart from the question of the amount, which may not at all be the amount which was originally fixed, what procedure the Minister is likely to adopt in satisfying himself under paragraph 1 of Part I of the Schedule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1468" /> The Minister must be satisfied that a person has enjoyed such interest for a continuous period of not less than six years immediately before the vesting date; the Minister has to assure himself, in these cases of difficult title, that the person has been in occupation for six years immediately preceding the vesting date; the Minister has to satisfy himself that such a person is unable to give an effective discharge for the compensation and that it would be imposing a disproportionate cost upon the person to ask him to carry out the clearance of his title in the statutory legal way.  The person is then to furnish to the Minister such evidence as to his title to such interest as the Minister considers reasonable.  I wonder whether the Minister could indicate what procedure is likely to be followed in this case.  As he realises, this whole matter of the adaptation and use of compulsory machinery is new.  As the Minister said on the Second Reading, this procedure is largely experimental and we have to wait to see the result.  I am anxious to try and get information as to what the Minister has in mind.</P>
    <P>I also would like to get whatever assurance is possible at this stage that matters will be proceeded with on a proper footing.  I take it that the initial cases will be adopted as a precedent for any cases that occur subsequently and I should like to ask the Minister to give us further information as to the procedure to be followed by the applicant.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The circumstances that led up to the introduction of this section really arise out of the 1946 Act, because in that Act the Minister had power, through the Land Commission, to acquire compulsorily, regardless of whether the person was living on it or could prove title.  The difficulty in that particular section of the 1946 Act, and the reason it has proved unworkable, was that since people would not part with their land to the Forestry Division in a case where there was bad title, it meant that the same procedure would have to be followed as existed in applications before the Land Commission&mdash;the man's land would become State property but the money would <Col N="1469" /> be paid into court or into a public trust and until title was proved the man, so to speak, would be out of both land and money.</P>
      <P>The reason for Section 2 of the Act was to get around that difficulty and for that reason I propose in this Bill to pay a person with defective title. The only conditions on which I am insisting are those set out in Part I of the Schedule which is really the amendment to the 1946 Act, and which up to a short time ago would in the normal course, I understand, be embodied in the section of the Bill itself. The four conditions laid down there are that:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  the Minister is satisfied that that person has enjoyed such interest for a continuous period of not less than six years immediately before the vesting date,</P>
      <P>(ii)  the Minister is satisfied that that person either is unable to give an effective discharge for the compensation, the compensation being regarded for this purpose as the proceeds of a sale of such interest effected immediately before the vesting date, or would be able to do so only at disproportionate cost,</P>
      <P>(iii)  that person furnishes to the Minister such evidence as to his title to such interest as the Minister considers reasonable, and</P>
      <P>(iv)  the Minister is of opinion that, having regard to all the circumstances, payment of the compensation should be made pursuant to this paragraph.</P>
      <P>What Deputy Derrig is anxious to know, I think, is what the procedure will be.  If I may take what I think is an example that will apply to most of the cases coming under this Bill, what will happen is that, with the consent or the knowledge of the person who owns the land or at least is using the land but has not full title, the Minister will apply to the commissioners for an acquisition order.</P>

    <P>The commissioners in another section of the Bill will give due notice, as is done in the acquisition of lands for relief of congestion under the Land Acts.  In most cases, the price will be <Col N="1470" /> agreed with that particular person before the acquisition and for that reason it will be a voluntary purchase effected by compulsory means, the compulsion being introduced at this stage with the consent of the person who is willing to sell to us for no other purpose than to give the Forestry Division and the Minister for Lands full title which could not be got otherwise except at disproportionate cost. In that case, the question of compensation will not arise, or at least a dispute about the amount of compensation will not arise because it will be agreed before proceedings are instituted.</P>
    <P>In the case of persons who do not agree with the Minister as to what would be appropriate compensation, they have the full machinery of the lay commissioners on the question of compensation available to them with an appeal to the Appeal Tribunal if they are dissatisfied with the price of the commissioners.  I do not fix the price; it is the lay commissioners who do so. We are giving a further way out by leaving an appeal open to them but I should point out that an appeal against price is open to the Minister as well as to the recipients should the need arise.  I cannot visualise any case where the Minister would appeal; in most cases it will be the recipients and in view of the fact that the other people will have already agreed on a price I do not think there should be much difficulty on that score.</P>
    <P>As regards title, a very proper point raised by Deputy Derrig is that covered in paragraph (iii) of Part I of the Schedule, &ldquo;that that person furnishes to the Minister such evidence as to his title to sell the interest as the Minister considers reasonable.&rdquo;  In that connection, the Minister will be guided entirely by the Chief State Solicitor and he will examine such title as the man may hold.  There again, it will not be the Minister who will decide or who will take a man's property or his interest in land into his own hands and decide in an arbitrary fashion probably in favour of Forestry as against a particular individual.  It will be the Chief State Solicitor.  I have paid due regard to the landowners' <Col N="1471" /> or land users' interest in that way.  As Deputy Derrig pointed out, I do not think it would be quite correct to leave the matter to the Minister because any Minister who takes an interest in his Department could not help, I am afraid, being biassed in favour of the Forestry Division.  I am, therefore, removing the matter out of the Minister's hands and it will be the Chief State Solicitor who will guide the Minister on all questions of title.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the following amendment:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), page 6, to add the following new paragraph after paragraph (ii):&mdash;</P>
      <P>(iii)  The vesting Order sent pursuant to sub-section (7) of Section 26 of the Act of 1946 to the registering authority under the Act of 1891 shall be accompanied by a copy of the acquisition Order and, on receipt thereof, the said registering authority, in addition to causing the Minister to be registered as specified in the said sub-section (7), shall cause any appropriate alterations to be made in any relevant existing registrations under the Act of 1891.</P>
      <P>When land is vested in the Minister pursuant to a vesting Order under Section 26 of the 1946 Act, the Land Registry is required by sub-section (7) of Section 26 to register the Minister as owner in fee simple.  Where the land acquired was a portion of a commonage and Section 4 of the Bill operates to alter the ownership of an excluded portion of the commonage, the Land Registry will have to note the consequential limitation to the objectors of ownership of the excluded portion. This amendment requires the Land Registry to note such consequential changes.</P>
      <P>Amendment put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the section, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>On the section, I presume that the phraseology is in the usual symmetrical and rhythmical measures comparable with the Alexandrines of John Milton or some of these great epic poets, but it leaves us in the position that even if one wished to amend them, it is almost impossible. It would have been necessary to set up an entirely new framework.  I presume there is nothing in the point that in line 21 where the Minister has &ldquo;has made&rdquo; it means as Deputy Moran possibly had in mind, &ldquo;will make&rdquo; as well as &ldquo;has made&rdquo;, and that in effect there can be no question but that the section will, as intended, apply to future cases.</P>
      <P>I presume that in the opening portion of the section in regard to the acquisition Order that the matter of the rights which the holders of commonage may have, such as rights of way and rights to water, will be deal with, that their rights will be safe guarded and will be duly considered by the appropriate authorities when the making of the acquisition Order is under consideration.  It is certainly rather extraordinary that the first sub-section refers us to the representation which has to be made by the objectors and we have to go on two pages further, to sub-section (2), to find that the representation referred to in sub-section (i) is a representation to the lay commissioners, and so on.  Why in the opening section it could not be stated what the representation was, and proceed from that, I do not understand, but I hope that the Minister will not have any trouble in connection with the introduction of these formidable sections which do not throw very much light on the matter from the point of view of the equities of the cases.  It may be that they fit in, as I have said, symmetrically and that it was necessary that they should fit in with Section 17 and the appropriate sections of the 1946 Act; but, except from that point of view, it is really a pity that it was not possible to state what was in mind in simpler terms which would be more intelligible to the layman, if laymen are presumed to have any intelligence or any interest in these legal matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A point was also raised with regard <Col N="1473" /> to the amount of compensation.  The Minister denied to Deputy Moran that the amount of compensation payable to each of the owners in common, other than the objectors &ldquo;shall be determined as if the whole of the land to which the Minister's application related had been acquired by the vesting Order.&rdquo;  If it does not mean what Deputy Moran contended it meant, it certainly means that language, when it is put into legal phraseology by the draftsman, departs from its ordinary everyday meaning.  If it were to mean that the compensation payable to each of the owners would be on the same proportionate basis as the total compensation it would be understandable; but the section says specifically &ldquo;shall be determined as if the whole of the land....had been acquired.&rdquo;  If that does not mean that the compensation to those whose rights in common are being acquired is not the equivalent of the compensation value of the whole commonage I do not understand what it means.  Perhaps the Minister may be able to throw some light on it.</P>

      <P>Since this Bill passed the Second Reading the minds of commonage owners have been seriously disturbed.  They believe that if one or two of the commonage owners opt to sell their interests to the Minister the others will be seriously affected.  I have been approached by a particular group and I have been told that, if their rights are interfered with, they will take steps to prove the illegality of such interference.  I am sure the Minister has considered that aspect of the matter.  Personally, I am not opposed to the acquisition of land for afforestation but I can see considerable difficulty arising where farmers whose holdings are rendered economic because of their commonage rights have those rights interfered with.  That is the feeling of the farmers themselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>If they are restricted to a particular area, their rights will be interfered with and the commonage will be useless to them.  The whole commonage is valuable because they can graze their stock all over the commonage.  We all know that herbage on a commonage varies and it is only by having the run of the whole commonage that the owners can benefit. I hope that aspect has been considered. These farmers who approached me have sought legal advice.  They are seemingly fortified with information and the Minister may not have quite the easy passage he anticipates.  I do not know what the objective of this section is.  I do not know what the position is in the West of Ireland.  But I do know that in relation to two particular commonages serious difficulty may arise.  One man pointed out to me that instead of being able to graze his sheep over 3,000 or 4,000 acres of mountain herbage he would, under this, be confined to 150 acres; that would ruin his farming activities.  The majority of those with rights on this commonage would be opposed to selling. I know this would be suitable for planting but I would advise the Minister, before he proceeds to implement the law, to satisfy himself as to the constitutionality of the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I have considered this matter and the Deputy is quite right in saying that tenants who want to retain the commonage will be discommoded. While I use the word &ldquo;discommoded&rdquo; I want it to be quite clear that their income, so to speak, off the commonage will not be restricted.  Their right to run the whole commonage will be restricted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>That will restrict their right of value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with that.  I shall explain why.  I have given this point a good deal of consideration because I come from an area where a huge acreage of mountain land is all commonage.  There are several factors which must be taken into consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1475" /> First and foremost, it is not the Minister or the officials of the Forestry Branch who will determine the portion to be retained by the tenants.  It is the lay commissioners guided by a Land Commission inspector, a completely independent authority.  The House can rest assured that the average Land Commission inspector is not engaged in forestry operations and, for that reason, I can see him giving a fair and impartial judgment.  I can see such an inspector erring on the side of generosity to the tenant rather than to the Forestry Branch.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Everything is loaded by the State against the tenant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>It must be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I have gone to extremes to make it quite fair.  In case the forestry officials or the Minister might be biassed I have tried to put in every possible safeguard for the tenant.  I am Minister for Lands to-night.  I may not be Minister for Lands to-morrow.  I may not be in the Dáil this time to-morrow night.  Who knows?  We must make provision for the future.  While I would like to treat the tenants fairly myself, nevertheless any Minister who would be in my place, I am afraid, could not be blamed if he erred on the side of the forestry officials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the interpretation by the judges of the court of law which matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite right.  Nevertheless, if the Deputy peruses the Bill he will find I have put in as many safeguards as it was humanly possible to insert, and taken as much as possible out of the hands of the Minister so that he could never stand accused of erring on the side of penalising the tenants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we examine this whole commonage problem, apart from the question of the objectors, we must also look to the others who are anxious to sell.  It is true that each tenant has the right to roam over the whole common, but that <Col N="1476" /> right is a saleable entity by the man who owned it and he should have as much right to sell it as he would have to sell his house, his cow, his basket of eggs or anything else.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>They are joint owners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I know, but each individual tenant gets a certain proportion out of that commonage.  While I have safeguarded those who do not want to sell, we must not pass any law which would give the right to two or three objectors which would prevent 16, 17 or 20 of their neighbours from selling what was their property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>They would sell to the other commonage owners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>That would not be free sale.  That would be limiting the market very much.  If Deputy Allen, myself or anyone else has something to sell, one of the rights of which we are jealous is that we be allowed to sell it to the highest bidder.  If some Deputy has a basket of eggs to sell and if there is one shop or one person who will give him 1/- more, he has every right to sell it there.  The people who will object in most cases are the two or three fortunate ones who had cash enough, or perhaps had sufficient family help in the house, to stock and look after the stock on the commonage. It was honestly admitted by Deputies from that side of the House &mdash;I think Deputy Bartley and some others&mdash;that in fact those who were using the common were stealing it from their less fortunate neighbours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that himself, not Deputy Bartley.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps &ldquo;stealing&rdquo; in that case is too harsh a word.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Bartley used no such word.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>They were appropriating it.  Most of the people who are willing to sell their shares are those who cannot because they are financially restricted or have not the family help to look after the stock, and keep the commonage.  Those who have stock enough and can look after it are using <Col N="1477" /> the common and are appropriating the grass and the grazing of the others.  If those people who are paying rent and rates for that commonage want to sell we should give them every chance. Even if the commonage were never intended for forestry, we are doing a decent job of work for those who have commonage rights because up to now they could not sell them.  We must remember that it is not the Minister or the forestry people who would decide the portion to be left off.  As soon as the Minister applies for an acquisition Order for the whole of the commonage he must give due notice to the Land Commission.  They must, again, give due notice to all concerned that the Minister for Lands has applied to the Land Commission for an acquisition Order for the whole of the commonage.  Those interested, and those who do not want to sell, have the right to make representation in the prescribed form and can come and state their case before the court.  I have not the slightest doubt that the Land Commission will act fairly by them.  If they err, they will err on the side of generosity to the tenants.  I am not asking them to do that any more than I am asking them to err on the side of generosity to the Department, but I am sure they will do that.</P>
      <P>Deputy Derrig raised a point&mdash;and I agree with him&mdash;in regard to all the legal phraseology that is employed in this section.  I asked myself the same question many a time.  The Deputy need not blame me for it was not I who drafted the Bill.  If I had the drafting of it, it would be much simpler but perhaps it would not hold water in the courts in the same way as it will in its present form.</P>
      <P>Deputy Moran raised a point on the Second Reading on paragraph 3, sub-section (1).  I examined that very carefully while the Bill was in the drafting stage and there is no other way to do it.  How can the value or the compensation for a share in a commonage be determined if it is not related, as Deputy Allen said, to every square inch of the commonage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>That damns the Minister's <Col N="1478" /> own case for dividing the commonage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Not in determining the compensation for those who are willing to sell because there will be no compensation paid to those who are getting their share back.  The question of compensation can only arise with those who are selling to us.  There is no other means of determining the amount of the compensation for their particular share, because it must be over the whole commonage.  I quite agree with the wording there and I am sure Deputies will agree that it is correctly worded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAFinlay1954" hpid="Mr. Finlay Mr. Finlay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finlay</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the section and what Deputy Allen said, there is a point that should be made clear in regard to the present position apart from this Act, the Forestry Division or any other State Department. If ten people own a commonage one of the ten can get, by a proper proceeding in a court of law, either one-tenth part of the commonage divided separately to him and the others left out, or he can get a sale and have the proceeds of the sale divided. As it works out in practice at present, due to the fact that nearly all the commonage is held from the Land Commission, the situation is that if any two or three people living in the country own a commonage and if they fall out for some reason and one of them wants to insist on his rights to the detriment of his fellow tenants in the common, in effect what happens is that by a rather lengthy and expensive legal proceeding he gets the whole commonage sold and the proceeds, after the deduction of the expenses, divided between himself and his tenant in common.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not right to say that this is introducing an element that was never there before.  If you have ten people owning an area of land as tenants in common and if seven want to sell seven-tenths of land to the Forestry Division, they can get it partitioned by the court.  If they want to be difficult about sub-division under the Land Act, they can get seven-tenths kept out and force the other three men into three-tenths.  That could be done whether this Bill was in existence as <Col N="1479" /> an Act or not.  It seems to me that one of the effects of this Bill is that it insists on the right of a tenant in common to keep portion of his holding, if he wants to, rather than its money value, a right he had not got up to this.</P>
    <P>In effect what could have happened before this?  Again taking the example, if you had ten persons holding a commonage and, leaving out the Forestry Division, if I wanted to buy it and seven were willing to sell it and the other three were not, what could be done at present by the seven, without the intervention of any Act or Government Department, is that they could go in on what is called partition proceedings.  They would get an order for the sale of the commonage by the court.  I could go in and buy it in a court sale and the three objectors, the three persons who did not want to sell to me, would be left with no alternative except to take their share of the purchase money and would never get the chance of buying back three-tenths of the land themselves.</P>
    <P>It is no harm for people who are tenants in common and who are concerned with this question of commonage to realise that the Bill, as far as I read it, does not give the Department any right to take away the rights of a man as they exist at present.  In fact it might be in certain circumstances, and is in many circumstances, an alleviation of the situation of the man who does not want to sell and who is only a tenant in common.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>It would appear from what Deputy Finlay now tells us that instead of going to the courts and incurring the expense of going to the courts, this short circuits the procedure and is a less expensive way of dividing commonage.  But who in this country wants to buy a commonage except the Minister for Lands?  I doubt if there is anyone.  In some cases, the use of the commonage makes a particular holding at the foothills an economic holding.  There is no doubt that the ultimate objective of this section is, where there is a commonage <Col N="1480" /> suitable for forestry and where six out of ten opt to sell, to force out the other four.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>There may be particular commonages where cutting off a slice and allocating it to the particular commonage owner as an assistance to his existing farm would be quite all right, but there are other poor commonages where, unless they have the run over the whole commonage, it is no good. The people who own commonages in some parts of the country are very particular about their rights as to the number of sheep they would be allowed to keep on the commonage.  The sheep are counted each year and the persons concerned are not allowed to keep a sheep more than it is their right to keep.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>There are not many&mdash;two or three.  I have a particular one in mind.  I know all the people intimately. They have come to me.  They are disturbed. They have gone to the trouble of getting legal opinion about their rights.  Every one of them has a small farm of arable land at the foot of the mountain and they represented to me that without the use of the commonage the farms would become absolutely uneconomic.  On Second Reading I suggested that a way out would be to provide, where you are taking the commonage, that they would be given other arable land.  That may be a way out for some.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, if the Minister thinks that in enacting this section he will not injure the hope of the Forestry Division of getting more land I am satisfied, but I can tell the Minister that <Col N="1481" /> possibly he has not heard the last of the problem.  The Minister needs to be careful in passing law that that law will not interfere seriously with certain rights.  There is an element of compulsion in this, undoubtedly.  As far as those who do not want to sell their rights to a commonage are concerned there is a very big element of compulsion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is so and if a majority of them do not offer it to us, the question will not arise.  Secondly, suppose the commonage land is held by ten local farmers equally and supposing there are only two not using it and that those two decide to sell, as Deputy Finlay pointed out, they can take their eight neighbours into court and get the commonage put up for sale.  What protection then is there for the other eight and where do they stand in that case?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>That happens with an ordinary farm, business house, workshop or other property.  If the husband and wife or the co-owners fall out, one of them can take the place into court and have it sold over the head of the other.  That is only just and fair. Presumably the court takes the view that if A wants to sell his right, and B does not, A must get his share out of it and the only way to do it is to put the whole place up for sale and give each half of the proceeds.

      <P>I think he has not appreciated the full safeguards in this Bill and the care that I have given to <Col N="1482" /> it and that has been given to it by the draftsman and the forestry officials, who have been most fair and impartial. In my opinion we have gone too far in putting in safeguards.  Some Deputies, on Second Reading, thought the Bill was useless, that there were so many safeguards it would be completely ineffective.  There is a certain amount in their argument.  No matter what Deputy Allen says about the particular commonage he has in mind&mdash;I presume in Wexford&mdash;no injustice will be done to these people.</P>
      <P>Take the case of a man who has a farm of land.  The Land Commission can walk in there and acquire the whole farm and there is no appeal from their decision to acquire, except on a point of law.  In this case, I am not acquiring.  What I do is, I ask the commissioners, an independent body, to decide between myself and the objecting tenants as to who is right and who is wrong.  I cannot go farther than that.  I am bringing in an outside court to decide between us.  If I were giving power to the Minister for Lands to acquire on his own order, under his own name and seal, and to take over a commonage, then I would not blame Deputy Allen, perhaps, for hoisting the danger signal but the Deputy need have no doubt whatever in his mind.  As a matter of fact, this Bill is much fairer than common law is in regard to ordinary property.</P>

      <P>The third aspect of partition arises in connection with this Bill.  The original one has been dealt with by Deputy Finlay and in very few cases is it applied, in my experience at any rate, in the West. Another aspect of it was introduced, empowering the Land Commission to partition these commonages.  The Minister confirmed on the last occasion that the Land Commission has that power.  The difference between that power and the one that is now being given seems to me to be this, that the initiative would be taken, where the Land Commission were concerned in ordinary partition, by the owners of the common.  The Forestry Division will be looking for land and it seems to me that now, under this, it is not <Col N="1483" /> the owners of the land, but the forestry administrators, who will take the initiative.  They will take positive steps to acquire land and, out of these positive steps, the question of partition will arise.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking on the explanations given by the Minister but I may not have interpreted him correctly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The initiative will come, in the first instance, from the tenants who wish to sell their shares in the commonage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>All right.  Then I take it that the forestry officials will not go to any particular commonage and ask the owners if they want to sell.  That will not take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps it might in very rare instances.  I could understand it taking place where the local forester might get local information that the majority of the holders are willing to sell.  In the vast majority of cases the initiative will come from the owners who will want to sell their shares.  I believe that under this Bill we will get more land than ever before through voluntary offers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the Minister is now saying that the forestry administrators will not go around the country casting their eyes on likely land, finding out who the owners are and then asking the owners if they are willing to sell.  Have I an assurance from the Minister that the powers in this Bill will not be operated in that manner?  The reason I raise the matter is that I know that in the West of Ireland there are lands which the forestry officials would like to get, lands which they believe would give good timber, but lands the owners of which are satisfied that they produce good sheep.  It is not every farmer with a good range of kind hill who is anxious to give it up for any public purpose.  In many cases, where they <Col N="1484" /> have been offered good land in the Midlands, they still refuse to exchange.</P>
      <P>Personally, I would like to see these owners voluntarily giving up this land and taking up equivalent value in land elsewhere so as to let the forestry programme operate.  I think the Minister is inclined to take this line himself, but it may be that even his wishes in the matter may be frustrated in the operation of these powers.  As I say, partition initiated by the owners is a long-established right.  The statutory right to partition given to the Land Commission is one of more recent operation and I take it that it is used in the settlment of disputes.  This third partition does seem to me to go a little further.  Take the case of a commonage that is reported to the Forestry Division.  The officials come along and they find that there is not unanimous agreement on the part of the owners to sell the entire place.  At that stage, I understand, the Land Commission will be asked to come and do the necessary partitioning.  As I understand it, the process of acquisition applies to the whole commonage and then the objectors can come in with their objection by way of representation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>At that time the whole of the commonage has not been acquired.  The Minister makes an application for the acquisition of the whole of the commonage but he does not get it then.  It is only then that the tenants must be notified to give them a chance to say to the Minister: &ldquo;You cannot acquire the whole commonage.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>In the operation and practice of these powers it will amount to the same thing.  The official authority comes along and seeks to acquire the whole commonage.  Those who do not wish to sell are told to make representations so that they can preserve their shares.  That action is put in motion by the positive action of the official authority and the objecting owners have to then acquaint themselves with their position under the law.  They will have to take positive action and to that extent <Col N="1485" /> there is a change in these proposals to partition commonage.</P>
      <P>There may be people who are perfectly happy in the ownership of their commonage and the user to which they put it but who are not sufficiently well up to protect their own rights and interests.  I would not advert to the fact at all except that I fear that the Forestry Division will fly, as fast as they can, by the type of land to which I referred a fortnight ago.  They have been asked several times to see what they can do about land that is described as of lesser quality.  I believe that they will set their eyes on the better quality land in some parts of the West which they have failed to get by the common consent of the owners. I feel it is necessary to express in the House, during the passage of this Bill, the viewpoint of those who may well turn out to be a minority of all these common holders.  They have rights and I think these rights are entitled to some appreciation here in Dáil Éireann when we are considering a Bill which very intimately affects their interests.</P>
      <P>I do not want to go back on what I said about the other class of land but I hope that the powers in this section will be utilised to acquire this land of lesser quality such as cut-away bog. There will not be the same difficulty as I have spoken about in respect of that type of land.  I fear that the Forestry Division will not be enthusiastic about it because I know that the cost of development will be relatively high.  If one is to take into consideration the social aspect of this question about which the Minister has spoken, then I think the expenditure of such money under the Forestry Vote could well be justified particularly in view of the fact that it will help to stem emigration and keep at home in these areas, during the planting season, men who would go off to England in the off period of other work at home.  I am not going to develop that argument any further but I hope the Minister's assurances in regard to objectors are assurances that these objectors can rely upon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I think he is afraid that the officers of the Forestry Division, the foresters, will go round the country putting their eyes on every kind mountain they come across. Supposing that the worst came to the worst in that regard, supposing the forester does the worst he can do, he can only go to the commonage owners and say: &ldquo;Will you sell me that piece of mountain?&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only allaying the Deputy's fears.  There is no preventive section in the Bill stopping the foresters from acting as I have suggested but what can they do more than to ask the commonage owners if they will sell their shares in a particular mountain?  Each commonage owner has a pretty well screwed head on his shoulders and if he does not want to sell all he has to do is say &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  If he wants to sell what about it?  I can assure the Deputy that none of these commonage owners will go into a jitter of nerves because a forester calls.  If the commonage owner is making a good profit out of his piece of mountain, if it forms part of his economy, he will refuse to sell. In case the Deputy might think otherwise, it is not the intention to send the foresters out.  I believe myself that because of this Bill there will be no need for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is happening is that there are small handfuls of commonage owners who are enjoying all the profits of particular commonages and whose neighbours, with shares in the commonage, enjoy none of the advantages although they bear their share of the rent and other expenses.  Some of the latter class might be living too distant from the commonage or they might be people with grown families whose work is restricted to the bit of land around their house and who do not bother about the commonage.  Some of these <Col N="1487" /> people might want to sell and I think it would be a cruel injustice to prevent them from selling what is their property.  Deputy Finlay raised the point before Deputy Bartley came in and in case Deputy Bartley did not hear him I should like to repeat what he said.  He said that under the existing law if there are, say, ten people who own a commonage and if eight are using the commonage and not prepared to sell, the other two who are not using it and are prepared to sell can take the other eight into court and have the whole commonage sold and the proceeds divided among the ten.</P>

The Deputies may come in here later on and grumble that the Bill did not go far enough.  The Land Commission has a duty in the partition of commonages as in the case of subdivision of holdings to see that the economy of the holding is not interfered with and the Land Commission being a court, a separate body, I think we can rely on them to look after the position.</P>

Under the existing law, the whole commonage is still undivided but under the law as proposed by the Minister the commonage will no longer be undivided commonage.  Is not that so?  I suggest that the Minister at a later stage should make provision in law for an application to be made on behalf of the Minister or the Forestry Division to the lay commissioners as to whether a particular commonage or any portion of it should be acquired or not.  That divided that will solve the problem and would be a much more just approach. If, having heard all the evidence, they decide it should be acquired or subdivided that will solve the problem and there will be no difficulty afterwards because of the people who, in the language of the Bill, would be called objectors.  This House should provide that the rights of people who hold land or commonage should not be unduly affected by measures of this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh yes.  Perhaps if I take the Deputy over the machinery proposed in this Bill, I might help to clear his mind on some of the doubts which he has.  In the first instance, disregarding where the initiative comes from&mdash;it will come from the majority of the tenants who are willing to sell their shares&mdash;the first positive step is that the Minister applies to the commissioners for an acquisition order for the whole of the commonage.  That raises the question with the commissioners at once of whether what the Minister wants will be given to him, whether the whole, or part, or none of the commonage will be given to him.  Under this Bill the lay commissioners have power to reject the Minister's application for acquisition entirely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>In the working out of these powers would it not be far better if the initiative were taken by those of the owners who are prepared to sell? The Minister has stated an application will be made for acquisition by the official authority and that is the element in it that I do not like, and as I tried to point out, has some danger in it.  Where is the use in making a comparison between the ordinary partition application by the owners themselves?  That is a matter of their own doing and they have their own good reasons for it, but here, even <Col N="1491" /> in the light of the powers given to the lay commissioners, the official authority steps in.  If some of the owners came along to the Forestry Division and said: &ldquo;We are prepared to sell our shares&rdquo; and that then the official machine were put into operation I think it would not be quite so dangerous.  But where small owners find themselves up against a huge Government machine like the Department of Lands there is an element of intimidation in it and the Minister must admit that.</P>

The initiative comes from the tenants who are willing to sell what is their property.

It was not a case of just jotting down something and shoving it in before the House.  In fact, Deputy MacBride and some others blamed me for not coming in earlier.  I had, in fact, hoped to have the Bill circulated before the summer recess.  I have given a good deal of thought to the matter and I can assure the Deputy that no injustice will arise out of this. I know Deputies Allen and Bartley are pressing the claim of those who do not wish to sell their shares.  I have taken that into account.  I admit they will be discommoded somewhat but they will not be wronged by one penny.</P>
      <P>Another point that has been lost sight of is this.  Deputy Bartley knows as well as myself what a cheerless, barren and inhospitable place a mountain commonage is.  These people who do not sell will have their shares cut off and segregated and we should not forget that they will have a forest fence along one side or possibly two sides of their holdings so that in the course of a few years they will have the shelter of the forest which will immensely enhance the value of the portion of land retained from the points of view of shelter and better grass-bearing potential.</P>

      <P>I think if I have made any mistake in this Bill it is that I have gone to too much trouble to safeguard the rights of objectors, and I imagine that they will come out better than those who are selling their property in the long run.  Deputy Bartley drew my attention to something said earlier to the effect that it was the intention of the Bill to force objectors to sell ultimately.  I believe it will work out the other way.  I believe that the land retained will be so much enhanced and improved and sheltered by the presence of the forest on one or two sides that the holders of that land will ultimately be better off than their neighbours who decide to sell.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finlay</NameTxt>
      <P>Generally speaking, I welcome this Bill on the basis on which it has already been welcomed by other Deputies.  I think it is of some importance to remember what the Minister said in introducing the Bill, namely, that nothing except the rather markedly bad condition of the greyhound industry at the time the commission was appointed&mdash;and it was the commission which was really the origin of this Bill&mdash;would justify the Bill. Everyone seems to be agreed that the greyhound industry had got itself into such a state that it was both socially and nationally desirable that there should be some measure of control. That fact must be emphasised in passing a Bill of this description, because its general tenor is one about which the House should be very careful indeed; its tenor is something that must be scrutinised with care because the Bill is putting a monopoly of control&mdash;not a monopoly of interest&mdash;of one industry or occupation into the hands of a statutory board.</P>
      <P>As I understand the general scheme of the Bill, nobody can in future run greyhound racing as an occupation or an industry, unless he brings himself within the control of the control board by obtaining a licence from the board. I think that step is more than justified by the situation in which the industry was when the commission was first set up; and the industry is still awaiting some reform.  I think it is no harm for the House to remind itself of the fact that, when it gives this type of control to a small board, fairly weighty reasons are required to bring it to such a step.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now I have considered the report of the commission.  It was against any form of sectional representation. Reading that report and without having any background, apart from the report itself, in relation to the problems, that did not seem to me a <Col N="1494" /> very convincing recommendation.  I would prefer to see an honestly sectional board representative of all the interests, if that is feasible.  It may not be feasible within the confines of a reasonably limited board; if it is not feasible, then I think we should approach the board with considerable suspicion in the sense that if one appoints a board in which one cannot find room to represent all the people, interests or occupations concerned, then one must hedge the board round with a very considerable number of safeguards and one must put a considerable number of limits to its powers.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would reconsider the question of putting the other sectional interests concerned, other than those which will be represented by the standing committee of the Irish Coursing Club, on to the board in some form or another.  If it is intended to give them representation, then that intention should be clearly stipulated in the Bill rather than merely appointing.  Appointing is too transitory. One man may appoint one person to represent a particular interest; a few years hence, another Minister, with a different viewpoint, may appoint an individual whose interests are not truly representative. I should like the Minister to consider the possibility of giving representation to people who are not already represented under the Bill.  That would include the bookmakers, and possibly their employees, as well as racecourse employees.  To a certain extent, it might include owners or trainers as well.  Between now and the next stage, I would ask the Minister to consider the possibility of giving minimal representation to the other interests. If that is not possible on a board of seven, it might be justifiable to increase the number to nine or 11, in order to do that.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us in his opening speech that he has a very considerable concern for the interests of the small bookmaker, as they will be affected by this Bill.  Now the small bookmaker fears&mdash;I do not think this point has been mentioned so far&mdash;that under this Bill he will be forced out of business <Col N="1495" /> by the larger bookmakers, as a result of the imposition of a levy.  That can arise in this way: if a levy, particularly a small levy, is applied to course betting, the small bookmaker fears that a sort of cut-price war will be operated by the larger bookmakers; in other words, the larger bookmaker, with as small a levy as 1½ or 2½ per cent., can afford to take from his backers only the amount of the bet and give back the full amount of the winnings; on a night's racing, he will be able to pay the levy out of his own pocket on his turnover, thereby giving, in fact, a shade of odds to the backer, and that will be sufficient to put the small bookmaker out of business.  It has been rather plausibly represented to me that that is quite conceivable and quite possible.  I understand that, when the Racing Board are granting course betting licences under the 1945 Act, one of the conditions is that each bookmaker must give an undertaking that he will collect from the punter the levy on each bet.  That undertaking does not in a sense affect the Racing Board, but it protects one section of the bookmakers against another section.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to consider whether it might not be possible under Section 29 to bring in an amendment providing that one of the conditions applicable to the granting by the board of a course betting licence to a bookmaker will be that he must give an undertaking to the board that in all cases where levies are payable, he will collect the levy from the punter at the time of the making of the bet.  In one sense, as I say, that is a protection not against the board or against anything arising from the Bill; it is a protection against a possible danger to the small bookmaker arising from the situation which a levy creates.</P>
    <P>I should also like the Minister to consider the question of the maximum and minimum charges for admission to racetracks.  This is a matter which has been the subject of very hard bargaining between greyhound racing track managers and promoters and bookmakers, both collectively and individually. I think there is considerable <Col N="1496" /> force in the argument that, where the board are getting power to fix a maximum admission charge and where the effect of this Bill will be to provide for the installation of totalisators on greyhound racing tracks, that must take away from bookmakers, as a group, some of their bargaining power with racetrack managers.  Up to this, the bookmakers were in a position, as a collective bargaining unit, that they could force racetrack managers because there was the possibility that they would refuse to operate on the track. The manager will now be independent of that.  He can, perhaps, run a bad night's racing if he has a totalisator and no bookmaker.  If that situation arises under the Act I would ask the Minister to consider the possibility of tying down the maximum charges for admission to bookmakers to the maximum charges for the admission of the public.  The exact ratio is a matter which could be discussed.  It is not a matter on which I have any information which would be sound enough to be of assistance to the Minister.</P>
    <P>I accept that the Minister's idea is that the board which he would appoint, and which, presumably, is the first board, would be responsible for fixing these maximum charges to start with. They would set the headline for any subsequent board that might be appointed and would fix reasonable maximum charges which would prevent a racetrack manager from having an unfair advantage over any bookmaker or vice versa.  But if, as appears to be the case, the bookmakers as a trade are worried about Section 48 (1) in its present untrammelled form and are concerned particularly because there was this specific ratio contained in the Racing Board Act of 1945 and if they see something sinister in its exclusion from this Act, I think those fears may be groundless.  The board appointed by the Minister will and should act with complete fairness in a matter like that.  If it is possible to assess now what would be a reasonable ratio between the charges which could be made for the admission of the public and the charges which could be made for the admission of the bookmakers, it would allay the fears of those who are being effected by this Act.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1497" /> There is only one other matter which I would like to mention, one which was dealt with I think by Deputy Walsh and by Deputy O'Malley.  It is the question of the three-year period during which the unreformed Irish Coursing Club must become part of the board of control.  It seems to me that the arguments which have been advanced on that ignore one fact.  This Bill is giving over to the Irish Coursing Club, with this three-year period of reorganisation immediately before it, the entire control of the breeding and coursing end of the greyhound industry.  Nobody has raised his voice against that and I assume from those who have spoken here that they are satisfied that that should be done.  It seems to have been a unanimous recommendation of the report.</P>
    <P>If that is so, it is obvious that the coursing club must have substantial representation on any control board created under the Bill, and they must have it in three years' time.  I think the Deputies opposite are agreed about that.  The objection seems to be that they will have it in the intervening period of three years.  They cannot all be black sheep and it is absurd to suggest that the individuals who will form a reorganised Irish Coursing Club in three years' time will be completely different and completely unrelated to the individuals who form the standing committee of the existing Irish Coursing Club.  If that is right, you should not start off by slapping the existing Irish Coursing Club in the face as hard as you can and then, in three years' time, expect them or the individual members, as reorganised or as leavened with new members, to co-operate with all the other sections of the industry. I think the Minister's view is right. If you want to do something of this kind, it is much more likely to be valuable if it is done slowly, and certainly more likely to be valuable if it does not contain any unnecessary alienation of sections of the greyhound industry and other people who are concerned with it.</P>
    <P>I am not in a position to speak from experience or from adequate hearsay to make my remarks reliable in regard to what the Irish Coursing Club did <Col N="1498" /> before the report issued by the commission was published, but it certainly does not ascribe to them anything like the malpractices which have been suggested against them.  It does suggest that they bit off considerably more than they could chew and that a very large extent of their failure was that they were a group adequate to deal with a small industry and that they suddenly got themselves into the position where they tried to deal with a much larger problem and a much larger industry.  If that is so, it seems to be fatuous to insist that the inclusion of four members in a board of seven&mdash;the board having wider powers, much better machinery for enforcing them and having proper financing and proper staffing&mdash;would result, as one Deputy said, in the industry being ruined before it got on its feet.</P>
    <P>As an outsider, I much prefer the Minister's idea that the reorganisation of this club, whatever may be wrong with it, should be gradual and certainly that during the period before it is reorganised the provisions of this Bill should not unnecessarily alienate people who have done service for the industry and who, whether we like it or not, will remain interested in the industry so long as they live and so long as the industry goes on.  These people who have been in the Irish Coursing Club, whether efficient or inefficient, whether honest or dishonest, are very likely to stay interested in it as long as they live. There are provisions in the Bill which provide, certainly after three years and probably after two, adequate safeguards against any group or any section seeking control.  I think everybody is agreed that at the end of the three years some members of the committee of the Irish Coursing Club should be members of the control board.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would urge strongly on the Minister to consider sympathetically the two matters I have mentioned, namely, the question of the compulsory collection of the levy as a condition of the granting of a licence and secondly, and even more so, this question of the maximum charges for admission.  There is a real fear among <Col N="1499" /> a large section of bookmakers that the result of this will be that they will be charged out of business in endeavouring to gain admission to some of the tracks, that some of the tracks will impose a charge for the admission of a bookmaker which will make it possible only for the biggest of those operating to get in.  Taking the Minister's views on other subjects, I think he is most likely to be in favour of the maximum possible contribution. If that is to be achieved, then it would be desirable in the Bill to ensure by some method&mdash;and the best method seems to be tying it to the admission charges for the public&mdash; that the smallest reasonable bookmaker will be able to get in, having regard to the maximum charges which the board will fix.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. A. Byrne Mr. A. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>My contribution will be very brief because most of the things I wish to say have already been said, especially by the last speaker.</P>
      <P>With the rest of the House I congratulate the Minister on bringing in the Bill.  I welcome the Bill.  I have read the explanatory memorandum and a few little grievances occur to me, when one speaks of the bookmakers in the country as a whole.  I notice that there is just that danger that they are being given over to an authority that may deprive them of their recognised status.  Every bookmaker who attends greyhound courses has a certain pitch and anyone who frequents the course knows where to find a particular bookmaker. There is a danger that the new authority may shift bookmakers to pitches which may not be as popular as the pitches that they have.  I would ask the Minister to ensure that no rights will be taken from bookmakers that they already enjoy in respect of pitches.</P>
      <P>I notice that there is no representation for the Bookmakers' Organisation on the board.  The recognised, selected delegate of the Bookmakers' Organisation ought to get representation on this board.  If he saw or thought he saw any injustice being done to his members, he could put forward their grievance, have it remedied there and then and save agitation outside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1500" /> Another point arises&mdash;the last speaker emphasised it&mdash;that an effort may be made to keep some bookmakers out by charging high prices.  According to the Bill, if the authorities wish to charge a bookmaker £10 admission charge, they can do so.  In the Racing Bill there was a fixed charge for the bookmaker to go in and operate.  I think there was a maximum of five times the ordinary admission charge to the public.  The Minister ought to safeguard the bookmakers' interests and ensure that there will be no penal or exorbitant charges imposed that would prevent some decent man going in and carrying on his business.  Such an exorbitant charge would take his capital from him before the first race started.</P>
    <P>I express the hope that the Minister, with the encouragement he has received, will give reasonable consideration to the bookmakers' fair and reasonable demands.  They are not making excessive demands.  They are merely asking the Minister's protection from penal charges that would keep them out.</P>
    <P>Some people may refer to a few of the bookmakers disparagingly.  I could never refer disparagingly to a bookmaker. My only knowledge of bookmakers' clubs and of racing is that when I was in another position I had the pleasure of asking the Racing Board to hold a meeting for a charitable purpose.  We got the charitable meeting and a handsome subscription as a result and we never came away without a collection from the bookmakers.  The smallest and the biggest of them always subscribed handsomely to any charity that they were asked to support.  From that point of view, they are a very fine body of men and deserve the consideration and the protection of the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister moved the Second Reading of this Bill, he gave the history of the business for which we are now trying to legislate and, in particular, the causes and grievances which led up to the necessity for legislating in a manner which would try to bring about some confidence, from beginning to end, in the whole industry.  The Minister hoped <Col N="1501" /> that the House would approach the Bill in a spirit of trying to make it the best Bill we could so that the best results would flow.  It is in that spirit that I am approaching this matter.</P>
      <P>Many things have been said resulting from deductions or conclusions, the evidence for which, to me, is not quite clear and I would like to ask the Minister a few questions in regard to that before I come to certain definite matters.</P>
      <P>Section 3 of the Bill refers to the &ldquo;Establishment Day&rdquo; and says that the Minister may by Order appoint a day to be the establishment day for the purpose of this Act.  Why should it be &ldquo;may&rdquo;?  Why should it not be definite, that the Minister shall?  If the Bill is passed in its present form, any Minister&mdash;I do not mean this particular Minister&mdash;has the right to say that he does not propose to do that now because the Act does not demand it from him in a statutory form.  All it says is that the Minister &ldquo;may.&rdquo; Everything, of course, flows from that.</P>

I want to come, then, in connection with that, to Section 6&mdash;the establishment of the board.  I do not know where the three years comes in.

      <P>From the very beginning, apart from what other amendments may be suggested, I want the Minister to ensure that there shall be set up a board at a specified time which will have the absolute and full confidence of everybody concerned.</P>
      <P>Deputy Finlay referred to the report of the advisory committee and said that he could see nothing in the advisory committee's report which would warrant some of the allegations or references that had been made earlier in the debate.  I would recommend Deputy Finlay, not to get this final report, which is, in a sense, a recommendation, but a verbatim report of the proceedings and the evidence adduced to the board which forced them to come with this recommendation. Then he would find that there were ample grounds for some of the statements made in connection with this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister should <Col N="1503" /> say that the first of the operations of the new board should be in 12 months from the passing of this Bill and not six months as is intended at present. Within that 12 months' period the Irish Coursing Club should have concluded proper elections for their own board and for its subsidiaries.  Then the nominations to the new board of control will come from these properly elected people in a proper democratic way.  If the Minister does that he will remove a great deal of the misapprehensions already held by a great number of people.  If he does that he will start off on the right foot and will get the co-operation and assistance of all those who are concerned that this new board of control should start off properly from the beginning.  If he does not do that, the four nominees to the new board will come from the present board of the Irish Coursing Club.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>You must put them in from the membership of the board of the Irish Coursing Club and it is suggested that these people are not democratically elected.  The Minister should now tell these people to hold their elections in a democratic way. Then he could make his own selection and he would have established confidence in the new board.  He would then have gone a good distance to getting rid of the present fear and suspicion and apprehension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister really appreciates that, if the wrong people get on that board in the beginning, they can do a lot of damage by making bad decisions or by lack of co-operation so that by the time the full board comes to operate they will have nothing but trouble to face in trying to reorganise and re-establish an industry which will have suffered considerably, over and above the depths to which it has fallen at the present moment.  I hope that what we are saying here now will induce the <Col N="1504" /> Minister to reconsider some of the sections and that he will be prepared to introduce certain amendments to meet the views expressed by various Deputies so as to put the Bill through the House as far as possible as an agreed measure.</P>
    <P>I come now to Section 3 and I want to point out to the Minister that here again the draftsman may be to blame. The heading of the section reads: &ldquo;Levies on bookmakers in respect of course bets.&rdquo;  Surely it is a levy on the members of the public who make the bets.</P>

      <P>There have been precedents for the introduction of amending legislation to correct mistakes in earlier legislation.  I think the phraseology should be changed and that the section should be entitled: &ldquo;Levies on course bets.&rdquo;  The word &ldquo;bookmakers&rdquo; should be left out.  You are making it a levy on the bookmaker as against a levy on the contract.</P>

      <P>I believe it is the draftsman that is wrong and not the Minister.  I would ask the Minister to let the draftsman have another look at it.  It is in fact a levy on the bet and not on the bookmakers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Coming to the question of the levy itself, I think the Minister is making a very serious mistake in accepting the recommendation.  I am not accusing the Minister of being the inventor of what is in the Bill and I believe that he is accepting what he regards as the best advice offered to him.  A levy of this nature, of 1½ per cent., is going to be almost impossible to operate.  If a person gets six to four or even money on a two-shilling bet, which is quite a <Col N="1505" /> normal transaction, there will have to be a calculation as to what is 1½ per cent. of two shillings.  The bookmaker will have to carry around with him a sack of farthings and halfpennies and pennies so as to be equipped to give change and to provide the levy.  At the moment, you have seven races on a track, being run at intervals of 15 minutes.  The introduction of this operation is going to upset everything. It will be physically impossible to carry it out both from the point of view of the money required and the levy.</P>
    <P>The totalisator is promised and in the report of the advisory committee there are quite long paragraphs dealing with the advantages of the totalisator and the operation of it.  Then there are the calculations involved.  Certainly I do not know whether the advisory committee were unanimous in their conclusions.  They say the turnover in betting in the two tracks in Dublin in one year approached £2,500,000.  Out of the blue then they say, without any evidence whatsoever and without any indication of an example, that £500,000 of that turnover would now go to the totalisator.  They then start calculations and say that if you were to take 10 per cent. of that £500,000 it would bring so much, that if you were to take 5 per cent. it would bring so much and they come to the conclusion that it would be better to take 1½ per cent. from the bookmakers and a certain amount from the totalisator and then to estimate the income.</P>
    <P>The advent of a totalisator in any of these tracks would lend additional attraction from the point of view of racegoers.  It would introduce a new form of betting transaction which does not at the moment exist.  I do not know whether the Minister has been to a track in England; I have. There they have the type of transaction where you can back a dog for a win or for a second or you can place dogs to be in the first three and you get some return.  Sometimes you might back the &ldquo;dud&rdquo; dogs and one might win and the other be second and you scoop the pool.  The committee says that the two Dublin tracks have a betting turnover of <Col N="1506" /> £2,500,000 a year.  I say that the advent of the tote would not take very much away from the bookmakers. Some of them will go, of course, but there will be a very extensive addition to the betting transactions so that instead of talking about 10 per cent. of £500,000 you will be talking about a percentage of £1,500,000.  I do not know where these figures came from&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to stand over my figures.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised to hear that from Deputy Barry who was a member of this board and probably knows a great deal about how the conclusions were arrived at.  First of all, I have ascertained that the number of racing days in the two Dublin tracks is 240 per year.  In other words, there is racing on six days of each week when racing is carried out.  If £500,000 is to be the turnover in a year of 240 days, it would mean that there would be about £2,000 per day turned over and if you divide that among the seven races each night it will give you something like £285 per race.  Surely to goodness, it would be ludicrous to think that you are going to install machinery in the shape of a totalisator which will have 20 forecast sections and 12 win and place machines in these circumstances.  That means you are going to have 22 places of betting and if you divide that into £280 the totalisator will never pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Obviously, the attraction of the totalisator has been very much underestimated by this advisory committee. With the advent of the totalisator, you will have a much greater number of betting transactions of smaller amounts&mdash;2/- and 4/- bets.  The bigger transactions will continue to be done through the bookmakers.  I say to the Minister it would be far better that he should experiment with the totalisator and come to conclusions from practical results.  Then he could <Col N="1507" /> decide whether or not he is going to get a sufficient income.  I interrupted the Minister when he was introducing the Second Reading and I said I had examined every possible aspect of the provision of revenue to meet the expenses of this board.  I asked him to consider a new suggestion and I think he said he would examine it.  I am going to make that suggestion now.</P>
    <P>There is in Section 48, the very grievous section as I have said, a provision which gives the bookmakers very much cause for worry because there is no limit to the entrance fee they may be charged by the racetrack managements.  I think we should all get the Minister to agree that this charge shall not exceed five times the admission charge of the public, whatever that charge may be to the various parts of the course.  The suggestion I am making to the Minister is that, instead of a levy from the bookmakers towards the upkeep of this new board, he would add to them a similar charge towards the upkeep of the board; in other words, if the management of the tracks charge the bookmakers five times the entrance fee charged to the public that an equivalent charge should be made on them towards the upkeep of the board.  That would mean a very substantial revenue without the least inconvenience to anybody concerned and I do not think the bookmakers will turn their guns on me for having made such a suggestion.  I believe they are quite willing to play ball.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Sub-sections (4) and (7) of Section 48 provide, in effect, for the collection by the board from bookmakers of specific charges for their attendance at meetings in lieu of levies on their course bets.  For example, tracks charges for admission of bookmakers at present exceed five times the charge for admission of members of the public and, if the board should consider the limit of five times appropriate to impose, it might suffice for the board itself at any time to collect the excess and waive course-betting levies.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and he is just as right now as he was then.  What I am saying, as distinct from that is here, is that there should be a levy of five times the public admission charge on them; that the board should get from them the exact equivalent of the amount they pay to go in.  I am saying something specific and definite and quite different from what is here.  If the Minister would find out the average attendances of bookmakers on these courses he could easily find out how much of a contribution that would make towards the upkeep of the board and if he adds to what would come from the tote, over and above the money needed to cover running costs, staff and so forth, a reasonable charge to racetracks for the use of the tote, or for the fact that the totalisator is put up on their property at no cost to them from the capital point of view and is bound to attract many more people, he will get his money without this horrible business of trouble and bother for everybody every quarter of an hour during a race meeting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know what the board will charge, what the cost will be.  I take it, it will be an automatic totalisator because otherwise races would have to be run every hour.  If you were to have someone to sit down to work out the calculation it would mean a race <Col N="1510" /> could only be run every hour and that would not help greyhound racing.</P>
    <P>I strongly urge the Minister to charge a reasonable fee to the racetracks for having the totalisator on their premises and to deduct a percentage from those who bet on the tote, and together with what this body estimates will flow into the coffers as a result of the broken bits of money which they cannot pay out&mdash;the halfpennies and pennies which are left over from their calculations and which they say will produce something like £5,000 a year&mdash;there will be sufficient money available, certainly in the first few years of the running of this board to enable them to contemplate what additions they will make in other parts of the country later.  They will be able to see whether they should go down to Cork, or to Cork and Limerick, or afterwards to other places. Obviously if the attendance, which I understand now averages between 2,500 and 3,000 per evening at race-meetings in Dublin, goes up by 500 to 1,000&mdash; which I believe it will&mdash;then everybody will benefit.  The racetrack owners will have more people coming in and paying at the turnstiles; they will sell more programmes; the tote will have a better turnover and the bookmakers will have a better turnover&mdash;I hope&mdash; to enable them to pay the extra charge I am suggesting should be imposed on them and we will get out of this trouble of having to deal with the percentage charge on small bets, thus making them tax collectors at a race-meeting.</P>
    <P>Deputy Finlay has rightly said you cannot force a bookmaker to do this work.  If I go to a bookmaker who knows me and he says: &ldquo;Here is your 2/-; I am not going to bother with the halfpenny,&rdquo; he may be able to afford to do that, but the smaller man may not be able to afford it.  Consequently, I ask the Minister seriously to consider dropping the levy and doing what I suggest as a contribution to the upkeep of the board.</P>
    <P>When we come to the board I agree with Deputy Finlay that you must have sectional representation.  The board must consist of people who represent every bit of interest from <Col N="1511" /> beginning to end; otherwise, goodness knows what kind of decisions will be made.  It is significant that one section &mdash;the bookmakers&mdash;is completely ignored.  It is not left out of the Racing Board.  The fault I see with the Racing Board is that they should have two representatives instead of one.  I think the bookmakers should have representation on this body. They could send to the Minister a list of names and he could select any one he liked to be the bookmakers' representative. I do not suggest they should have a right to nominate any particular person.  I think the Minister should accept the suggestion made by Deputy Finlay and other speakers that the bookmakers should be represented.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister admit that if we did not have bookmakers at race meetings or at dog tracks, if we did not have a gamble, we would have no race meetings?  The Minister must admit they are an integral and vital part of the whole set-up and represent a very strong section of the community. As Deputy Alderman Byrne said, they are good, patriotic citizens; they are generous and they are very substantial tax collectors for the State and in every way entitled to the same consideration as the representatives of the coursing club.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to realise that we are all agreed, so far as I can make out, to approach this Bill in the spirit in which he introduced it.  He wants the Bill to become an Act which will help to solve a great deal of the problems that exist, put this industry back on its feet and try to ensure that it goes on towards more and more prosperity rather than remain in the position in which it has been for the past few years.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the extent of the control will be by the stewards, but it will have to be a very exact control. If the grading of dogs was left in the hands of people who were not above suspicion, it would be very easy for certain people to get together, run a race for themselves every night and scoop the pool with the totalisator. <Col N="1512" /> Such a proceeding is a little more difficult with the bookmakers because they can say &ldquo;no&rdquo; to a bet.  With the totalisator, on the other hand, there may be a hot tip for a certain dog and the public may back it very heavily; someone in the know may back an outsider and scoop the pool.  From that point of view there will have to be very strict control in the appointing of the stewards whose function it will be to ensure that the running and management of the racetrack will be something quite definite and apart altogether from the grading of dogs so that there will be absolute control over their running.</P>
    <P>I come then to the state money and prizes.  The time has come when there should be more attractive prizes for those who have been engaged for so many years in the breeding and training of dogs.  In the past, the amounts made available have not been attractive to those who have invested time, money and skill in trying to bring up particularly good dogs.  There should be some reward for them.  These are the people who breed dogs, rear and train them for the glory of running them as distinct from merely trying to make money out of them.  But the board will have to make the stakes attractive because, the more attractive the stakes, the greater the prosperity of the industry.  Hitherto the attitude in that respect has been a rather lackadaisical one.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to accept the requests that have been made to him in relation to the attendance fees payable by bookmakers and their employees. There should be a specific maximum provided.  The board can arbitrate as to whether or not that maximum should be reduced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Does not the Act governing the Racing Board provide a maximum?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>It does, but this does not.  With regard to the levies, until we have got sufficient experience, the bookmakers should be asked to pay the equivalent of whatever their present entrance fee is to the Racing Board.  That would obviate the difficulty about the levies.  The advisory committee must have had it in mind <Col N="1513" /> that where totalisators operate more people are attracted and there is a bigger turnover.  As Deputy O'Malley said, the board should have responsibility for ensuring that proper amenities are available for patrons of these racing tracks.  A certain amount of the profits should be ploughed back into improvements.  As far as I know, the Coursing Club has been making large profits.  I understand that body pays very substantial income-tax.  As far as I know, racing tracks in Dublin have been very very profitable, and they will become more profitable.  Therefore, they should be asked to make their contribution towards this board and its upkeep.</P>
      <P>I do not know what attitude the Minister will take.  I believe he wants to be reasonable.  I ask him to accept our suggestions.  First of all, there should be a time limit&mdash;say 12 months from the passing of this Bill&mdash;during which the Irish Coursing Club will make its selections so that a duly representative democratic board will be in existence from which the Minister can choose his nominees.  I agree the Irish Coursing Club should not have a majority representation.  It is wrong that they should have four out of seven on the board.  I appeal to the Minister to reconsider that.  I ask him to consider the other points raised. The Bill is in a sense confusing and perhaps when we come to the Committee Stage, having heard the Minister reply, we will know where we are and what we can do to improve the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>In the concept of establishing adequate and effective control of the greyhound racing industry the Minister is possibly advancing in the right direction.  I feel, however, that a fundamental essential to the success of this particular venture will be a proper perspective in relation to the people associated with and vital to the industry itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This greyhound racing board is conceived in somewhat the same manner as the Racing Board; and that board, despite many doubts, has proved to be of immense value to racing generally. It is because this Bill differs vitally from that parent concept that <Col N="1514" /> many people here are urging upon the Minister that he should introduce certain safeguards.  Deputy Finlay adverted to that.  Deputy Briscoe followed on the same lines.</P>
    <P>There are certain safeguards vitally necessary to the greyhound industry. One wonders why, for instance, the draftsman in this Bill has excluded a safeguarding clause with regard to the charge for admission, a safeguard specifically set out in the Racing Board Act.  Why has there been a departure? Why has there been no attempt to fix a ceiling on the charge which can be imposed by the proprietors of a racecourse on the bookmaking community? It may sound far-fetched but this might be the very weapon by means of which many hardworking small bookmakers will find themselves excluded from their normal avocation by virtue of the fact that the racecourse management may fix some arbitrary charge of admission which will make it impossible for the small bookmaker to operate successfully.  It is a point that I am sure the Minister will consider because there should be nobody more anxious than he would be to safeguard particularly the decent, but maybe not so large, type of bookmaker who operates on many of the tracks not only in the city but throughout the rural areas.</P>
    <P>This matter caused a good deal of concern.  It is idle for us to talk of success for this particular scheme of the Minister's without drawing the analogy that we see year after year in the Racing Board returns.  It is not the earnings of the tote that are the main contributing factor to the success of the Racing Board; it is the levy collected by the unpaid tax collector, the bookmaker, that contributes by far the largest part of the revenue that has led to the success and development of the Racing Board.</P>
    <P>It would be well for the Minister to allay as early as possible the agitation in the minds of certain people.  I know the Minister can say with his typical devastating eloquence that we are envisaging fears that may not materialise but a simple safeguard, on the comparative lines set out in the Racing Board Act, would give a protection within the statute that would <Col N="1515" /> allay all those fears at once.  There can be, and there have often been, most unscrupulous things done at dog tracks.</P>
    <P>Let us face the other part of the problem.  No matter what the Minister may say I think all Deputies will be unanimous in the view that one of the vital factors in greyhound racing must be the bookmakers.  They are as vital as the dogs, as vital as the tracks or the track managers.  It seems extraordinary that in conceiving a board to control this particular activity the Minister and his advisers have not thought fit to give representation on this board to people who, in the ultimate analysis, will be the largest contributors in £s.d. to the possible and successful working of the board itself.</P>
    <P>There are many features of this Bill which commend themselves, I would say, unanimously to the House. I would say that the House is anxious to assist the Minister in getting something worth while and workable for the control and development of this industry. But I do feel that while this is at its experimental stage we should try to focus our minds on the future of this industry and on the experience that has been gained from the past running of the industry.  Looking at the industry in any light, we must concede that one of the vital and most effective parts of this general pattern of development of dog racing here is the bookmaker, be he big or small.</P>
    <P>The bookmaker will always feel that there is a serious encroachment upon his preserves when you put up a totalisator.  There was a great controversy in this House before on this question of a totalisator for dogs. Recognising that advance is necessary, that there are certain types of people who will use the automatic totalisator and who would be more anxious to bet on the tote, particularly small 2/- and 4/- punters, and recognising the necessity for giving them facilities we would point out that the fear is always at the back of the mind of the bookmaking fraternity that the same thing will happen as happened in many racecourses&mdash;that the bookmakers will <Col N="1516" /> be pushed out of their traditional locations and the totalisators built where the bookmakers may have at one time operated, wherever the track management may think it convenient to put them without any consideration of tradition, time factor or usage at the track.  That fear is there but if that fear is added to by a permissive clause within the Bill itself that will enable the track management to fix an arbitrary charge, then I can understand the degree of concern the bookmaking fraternity must feel if this Bill goes through in its present form.</P>
    <P>I do not want to labour this point as it has been argued by other Deputies on all sides of the House.  I feel it is a matter that can be ironed out in the Committee Stage of the Bill.  This is a type of Bill that might well be committed to a special committee where there is a good deal of unanimity and a good deal of anxiety to work out the best possible type of Bill.  I think it might be a good idea for the Minister to consider the possibility of sending it to a special committee on the next stage where there would be less controversy and a great deal more expectation about bringing back ultimately a Bill that could be regarded as the best unified efforts of the House to find a solution for this industry.</P>
    <P>The Minister should consider earnestly the practicability and the necessity for giving representation to this vital section in the board of control.  We all recognise there are very serious difficulties to be overcome in this industry, that there has been considerable abuse of the grading system over the years, considerable &ldquo;fixing&rdquo; of races and considerable scope within which the unscrupulous could operate successfully.  I feel personally that the Minister is right to try to get a central control that may become effective in dealing with this matter.  While we have in the racing world the stewards of the National Hunt, the stewards of the Jockey Club and the Racing Board exercising control, there has been the kind of control by the Irish Coursing Club which very often was a control for the benefit of the few.  The Minister must work on the foundations he has. <Col N="1517" /> It might be a very good thing if the Minister and his advisers re-examined seriously their suggested board of control.  He might also consider the practicability of having some kind of a body who would be in charge of discipline generally in relation to greyhound racing as distinct from an actual board of control of the industry as such.  They are two distinct functions and, I am afraid, if the two of them are merged in an administrative controlling body one may not get the best results.</P>
    <P>We want to see the best possible Bill come forth.  We want to see the best possible effort being made to put this industry on a permanent and progressive basis.  We want to ensure that the high standard and quality of our dogs will add to the prestige of the country.  We do not want something that may lead to many of the abuses that we have known in the past in relation to transactions with regard to dogs that were exported.</P>
    <P>I urge upon the Minister that we should continue to have during the course of the passage of this Bill a reasonable approach so that, in the spirit of helpful co-operation, as distinct from any political issue, we may ultimately emerge through, as I suggest to the Minister, a special committee, with a Bill that will be workable, practicable and will give all the safeguards the Minister and his Department feel are adequate for the various contributing factors to the industry, in particular, the bookmaking fraternity.</P>

      <P>The Minister seemed to be surprised that I should occupy a seat in the House during the time that this Bill has been under debate but, if the Minister will refer back to the year 1932&mdash;I think he was then a mere neophyte in this House&mdash;he will recall that, as Minister for Finance, I set up a committee of inquiry to investigate a proposal to establish totalisators upon greyhound-racing tracks in circumstances which were very similar to those which I fear will obtain under this Bill because, the real gravamen of any criticism which I have to make <Col N="1518" /> in relation to this Bill is that it will leave, I think, the old gang in virtual control of the greyhound breeding and racing industry here.</P>
      <P>I am sorry that that should be the case because, as we have heard, the greyhound industry is quite a valuable one to us.  Not merely is it valuable in its actualities but it is also very valuable in the potentialities which are inherent in it.  We should certainly develop it in such a way that our greyhounds would occupy the same position in the dog-racing world as our horses occupy in the horse-racing would and in fact, as it is easier to sell a greyhound than to sell a race-horse and easier to keep one, the value of our greyhound exports might even surpass those of our bloodstock.</P>
      <P>Before I go on to criticise some aspects of this Bill, perhaps more drastically or more severely, I want to ask one or two questions.  In many parts of this Bill, there are references to &ldquo;greyhound race track executive.&rdquo; A &ldquo;greyhound race track executive&rdquo; has rights under this Bill.  So too has what is referred to here as &ldquo;an affiliated coursing club.&rdquo;  I see further down that the board has power to formulate conditions for the grant of a racetrack licence.</P>
      <P>What is a greyhound racetrack executive?  It seems to me to be a term that requires some definition.  It is something which will have the right of representation.  It will have the right of representation on the reconstituted, reorganised Irish Coursing Club, but I do not know that there is any thing in this Bill which would guide the courts if a question arose as to what was a greyhound racetrack executive.  I will admit that I have not had time to study this Bill with the meticulous care which I think is necessary but, in reading the Bill through, I have not been able to find any definition of a greyhound racetrack executive any more than I have been able to find what is an affiliated coursing club.  There is no reference to them in the interpretation section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have there &ldquo;authorised coursing ground&rdquo; defined, an &ldquo;authorised coursing-meeting&rdquo; defined, &ldquo;authorised <Col N="1519" /> officer&rdquo; defined.  &ldquo;Greyhound racetrack&rdquo; is even defined, but there is no definition of a greyhound racetrack executive.  The failure to define either of these two terms may lead to a great deal of difficulty in future.</P>
    <P>In that connection, let us not forget that some years ago the Irish Coursing Club found itself involved in a threat of legal action if, in fact, the legal proceedings had not actually been embarked upon, in respect of some question of definition and of right to be present or to vote at a meeting of the governing body of the Irish Coursing Club.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that, since I have raised the matter, the Minister will look into it and, if he sees the points which I am making are of any force in that regard that he will amend it.  It is not a matter on which there can be any controversy.  If my impressions are incorrect, then, of course, I shall just have raised the point and I am sure the Minister will reassure me in regard to it.</P>
    <P>Under Section 22 of the Bill&mdash;here I think, is where this question of the definition of a greyhound racetrack executive may be of some importance&mdash;the board &ldquo;may grant or refuse to grant an application for a licence to operate a greyhound racetrack (in this Act referred to as a greyhound racetrack licence).&rdquo;  It does not say by whom the application is to be made.  Will this application for a track licence be issued to a body corporate or to an individual?  If, for instance, there is a racetrack owned by a private limited liability company, as I think many of them are, will the licence issue to the limited liability company as a body corporate or to some person or individual to hold it on behalf of the owners of the track?</P>
    <P>That is somewhat important because, under Section 23 of the Bill, the board may attach any condition to the licence.  There does not appear, so far as I can see, to be any restriction upon the number or nature of the conditions which may be attached by the board to the licence.  In sub-section (3) there is a statement that different conditions may be attached to different licences <Col N="1520" /> but, outside of these things which are particularly referred to, there does not seem to be any restriction to the limitations which the board may impose or any restriction upon the conditions which the board may exact from the applicant for a licence.</P>
    <P>Will these conditions be reasonable or unreasonable?  Will there be any conditions as to the ownership of the track; as to the ownership of shares in a limited liability company if a limited liability company should happen to own the track?  This is not a mere point raised for the purpose of trying to secure a statement of the conditions upon which the licences may be issued.  It has been very freely rumoured, over a great number of years, since the Irish Coursing Club took over control of the racing tracks, that licences were refused to operate tracks, not because there was not an area within which they might profitably operate, but because people were not allowed to participate in the ownership of a track.</P>
    <P>There have been statements made in that regard.  Very definite statements have been made to me from time to time in regard to the allegedly unfair use of the powers which have been, let us speak quite candidly about it, taken to itself by the Irish Coursing Club, to control greyhound racing.  That unfair use of these powers was highly detrimental to the rights of other people who had a desire to invest in providing this particular form of amusement.</P>
    <P>I think it is of vital importance, since this Bill is going to hand over the whole power of control to this body, that there should be some safeguard or provision in the Bill which will ensure that these powers are rightfully used; that they are not tyrannically used and that they are not used unjustly or used corruptly.  It seems to me that so far as this section of the Bill is concerned there should be same right of appeal.  The very nature of the board and its personnel seem to indicate that there is a real need to have some formal appeal from a decision of the board refusing a licence to a particular track.  The last word should not lie with them.  The Minister might consider whether that power of appeal might not lie to himself. <Col N="1521" /> He might possibly be reluctant, as I myself might be in his position, to take that right but failing that, why not allow a right of appeal to the Circuit Court?  It would not lead to undue litigation but it would satisfy a great number of people who are very concerned about the manner in which the right to a licence with regard to tracks has been exercised over a number of years.</P>
    <P>Again, we are told that ultimately the Irish Coursing Club will consist, in so far as members with voting powers are concerned, of representatives of affiliated coursing clubs.  I think that we should have a clear definition of the words &ldquo;affiliated coursing club&rdquo; and that we should also have some sort of statement as to what conditions a club must fulfil in order to be affiliated so that arbitrary conditions will not again be imposed which would prevent a <i>bona fide</i> club from being recognised as an affiliated coursing club and therefore having the right to be represented in the Irish Coursing Club.</P>
    <P>I think it is very important that these matters should be cleared up because many people feel, with uneasiness, the possibility that those who have control&mdash;the old gang, they are called&mdash;may become more solidly entrenched than ever in the control of the Irish greyhound industry.  These fears have been encouraged by the proposed composition of the board and the predominant position secured under the Bill to the Irish Coursing Club.</P>
    <P>Many references have been made in the course of the debate to the position of the licensed bookmakers under the Bill and their apprehensions in regard to it.  Most of these apprehensions spring from the reasons to which I have referred.  I know that these fears are shared by breeders and owners and they arise from the fact that they fear that the Bill will mean that the old hands will be more solidly in control than ever.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1522" /> Debate resumed on the following motion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>That Dáil Eireann is dissatisfied at the present system adopted by the Land Commission with regard to the allotment of holdings; and that it is of the opinion that the following matters should receive prior consideration in the division of land: (a) the provision of a cow-plot where such is necessary, (b) the enlarging of uneconomic holdings within five miles of the land to be divided, (c) the provision of holdings for landless men who are living within five miles of the land to be divided and who are in a position to work the land, and (d) the provisions of holdings for landless men requiring accommodation plots.&mdash;(Deputies Tully and Desmond.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Since I proposed this motion a few weeks ago many views have been expressed by the different Deputies who spoke on it. Some of them have been favourable but many of them were, I am afraid, deliberately framed in such a way as to try to give an incorrect impression of what was intended by the Deputies who put down the motion.  I have discussed the matter with Deputy Desmond and I can now tell the Minister that, if necessary, we are prepared to withdraw from sections (b) and (c) of the motion the five miles stipulation. During the debate the Minister stated that he considered it would be undesirable to have five miles separating two portions of a holding.  I am not inclined to agree with him, but at the same time the Minister's view seems to be the general view of the House&mdash; that it would not be possible properly to work two portions of a farm divided by five miles.  As I have said, I am prepared to withdraw that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is the question of men who are being transferred from one area to another.  Deputy Hilliard referred to that the other night and said that the motion was overlooking those people. <Col N="1523" /> That is not correct and that was not my intention.  I think the motion would have strengthened their position. In fact, if the people who are living within five miles of a farm to be divided, were considered for a transfer, this provision would remedy the position because I honestly believe it is more just to give portion of the land to a person living five miles away in the same parish than to give it to somebody living 100 miles away.</P>
    <P>The suggestion was made by Deputy Hilliard and by Deputy Giles that it was wrong to think that land could be provided for landless men because there was not an unlimited amount of land available.  Deputy Hilliard used the words <i>ad lib.</i>&mdash;that land could not be given <i>ad lib.</i> to landless men.  My motion did not suggest any such thing. The terms of the motion are easily enough understood by anybody who wants to understand them.  What I sought was that landless men who are prepared to work the land should be given holdings.  That does not mean that it should be given <i>ad lib.</i></P>
    <P>Deputy Cunningham showed a truer appreciation of the position than some other Deputies who have, or should have a knowledge of what happens. He pointed out the position of what I call the conacre farmer who has no land of his own and yet who has been making a living off the land by paying excessive rents for it.  I think these people would make the finest farmers in the country.  They are able to make money and a living on other people's land at the moment; yet they are refused land by the Land Commission. I think they should be considered very seriously.  I also think that people who have been working on the land all their lives and who have big families of boys, as many of them have, should be given a chance of setting up in a farm of their own.</P>
    <P>There is no use in anybody inside or outside the House saying it is not possible to give land to the landless and that such a suggestion is just vote-catching. The Constitution guarantees equal rights and equal opportunities for all and it does not say that those who have something should get more <Col N="1524" /> and that those who have nothing should get nothing.  That appears to be the attitude of a number of Deputies.  Apparently the man who has not got land through an accident of birth is supposed to belong to an inferior race.  These men should be given the same opportunities as people with holdings.  It is a ridiculous state of affairs that a Land Commission inspector can survey an area and because he finds a man trying to rear his family on a small plot plus a few days' work outside with the county council or with a neighbouring farmer, he will report that such a man is not an uneconomic holder.  That position should be changed immediately.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with the Minister when he says that the amount of land available for division is getting smaller. If the commission were to take up the farms which are not being properly used, in County Meath in particular, there would be plenty of land available. These lands at the moment are being handed over, lock stock and barrel, to people who come in from other countries with plenty of bank notes.  I think the Land Commission should not allow that to happen.  These farms should be bought and divided.  It is no answer to say that those people have the right to buy the land.  About 18 months ago, I gave lists of farms to the Land Commission.  I noticed in many cases that as soon as the Land Commission were notified that the farms should be inspected the owners, who had not used the land for years except to set it on the 11-month system, sold their farms by private treaty.  That should not be allowed.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission should see to it that when farms like that are sold, after they have been inspected, and listed as suitable for acquisition, they should still be taken over.  The story that is going around, that the land is so dear that the Land Commission are afraid to pay the big prices on the open market, should not be accepted particularly when one looks at it from the point of view of the poor man who has been paying from £15 to £30 per acre for land in order to try and make a living.</P>
    <P>There are numerous instances of <Col N="1525" /> men living in labourers' cottages on some of those farms about to be divided.  The Minister says he is prepared to reconsider the position of these people and to give them accommodation plots if considered suitable. As far as the allocation of accommodation plots is concerned, I should like to correct a statement made inadvertently perhaps, by Deputy Hilliard. He said the Fianna Fáil Government did make provision for accommodation plots.  They did, up to a period but since 1939 none of those plots have been given in Meath.  I agree with him that it was a very good day's work the Minister for Lands of that Government did.  I would appeal to the Minister now to go back to the 1939 position and give such plots to landless men when land is available and when the people concerned are considered suitable applicants.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no land divided during the war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite well aware of that.  Since the war ended no plots were given to landless men in Meath.  I do notice they were given in other counties and I wonder why this difference has arisen?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as cow-plots are concerned I would again ask the Minister to consider very deeply this whole question. The big trouble with these plots apparently is that when Land Commission inspectors visit an area they find a lot of people have not got cows.  I would like to ask how do they expect the people to keep cows unless they put them in their pockets?  There was a system where people were grazing cows on &ldquo;the long acre&rdquo; but the Department of Justice attended to that and after a while the people found it was, perhaps cheaper to buy milk at 6d. a pint than to pay the fines imposed by the district justices, court after court, for having their stock wandering.  This occurs chiefly where big farms are divided, and where people who had the use of portions of those farms for cow-plots now find they are being ruled out by new tenants who, perhaps rightly, say they have not enough land for themselves. The result is that people who have had <Col N="1526" /> cows over a long number of years have had to sell them, and the Land Commission inspectors say: &ldquo;Those people have no cows to put on cow-plots.&rdquo;  I think that argument is simply an excuse and I would ask the Minister not to accept that excuse any more.</P>
    <P>A man with a family in a country district&mdash;as one man told me to-day&mdash; finds that while he might be able to buy a cow if he had somewhere to keep it, he must pay the Dublin price of 6d. a pint for milk which the creamery lorries collect from his own village one day and bring back the next day.  This could be prevented if the Minister would consider giving cow-plots where they are needed.  I know over a number of years some of these plots were handed back; and I know the Land Commission has put up the argument that they were not being used by the people but I would suggest that, if the Minister has any doubts on the matter, he should get in touch with Meath County Council which has a number of these plots and has a knowledge of how they are worked.</P>
    <P>I have an intimate knowledge of these cow-plots and they are working well.  Cows are being grazed on those plots at a very cheap rate and earn a profit which can be spent, after paying the rates due, on improving the land by artificial fertilisers.  I think there is no doubt at all about the fact&mdash;as Deputy Kennedy said about Westmeath&mdash;that the cow-plots are successful at the present time and that there is no reason in the world except prejudice which could prevent the Department of Lands or the Land Commission from allowing the reintroduction of these plots, particularly in County Meath and areas like it.</P>
    <P>I said at the beginning of this discussion that I did not want anybody to get the impression that I, or anybody supporting the motion, was anti-migrant. We are not and we do not want to be put in the position of condemning people who come in from outside counties but we must insist that, no matter what anybody thinks, so long as there are people in the areas surrounding the farms to be divided whether in County Meath or <Col N="1527" /> County Cork, those people should get preference if they are people to whom land can be allocated.  I am sure there is absolutely no objection to that.  It is common justice and I believe that if the Land Commission adopt that policy they will find very little reason for regret.</P>
    <P>Returning to the question of the landless men may I make this further observation?  During the early years of the Fianna Fáil Government a big number of landless men were allocated full-size farms and while a small number who did not use them properly, and some sold them when they got an opportunity, and some handed them back to the Land Commission when they were not able to use them, the majority turned out to be very good farmers.  It is to the credit of the Government of that time that they introduced that system; it is to the credit of the people who used the farms given them that they were taken off the labour market and are now comfortable farmers.  I believe there is no reason why that experiment, if it was an experiment, should not be tried again.  I think the one thing that should be insisted on is that people who get land are in a position to work it and are people who know what they are doing.  I think if the Land Commission insist on that they will find that the hardy tenant farmer can be reinstated on the big ranches.</P>
    <P>I do not want anybody to suggest that there are no big ranches in existence to-day that can and should be broken up rather than have them fall into the wrong hands.  An old man said to me a few week ago and I think it has a bearing on this, that outsiders who come in and buy up farms are making use of what in other countries is known as peaceful penetration. It was a very big task to get some of these people out of this country when they were put out.  Is it not a great shame that, when they find it dangerous to invest their money in Africa or elsewhere in case they may lose it, they are likely to come back to Ireland and pay out in notes what he described as fairy gold, money which through devaluation of the £ might be turned into useless paper in 24 hours? <Col N="1528" /> When you look at it from that angle it does seem a shame.</P>
    <P>The question of the cost of purchasing land arises from time to time. I think at no time has this House refused to supply money for this important work and I am sure if the present Minister feels at any time that the money allocated is not sufficient, the House will be only too ready to make money available for the purchase of land for allocation among suitable tenants.</P>
    <P>There are so many different angles to this difficult question that perhaps a three-hour debate is too short to cover them all but I would appeal to the Minister to carry out what he promised on the last evening when we debated this question, that is that where a cow-plot is necessary and where land is available, the cow-plot will be made available.  I am asking him to accept the amendment which I suggested which would read &ldquo;the enlarging of uneconomic holdings&rdquo; by taking the five-mile limit out of it and I think he would have no difficulty in accepting that portion of it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Chair is not affected in any way except that the Chair cannot accept amendments at this stage.  Obviously the House has expressed no opinion on the matter.  The Chair cannot ask the House to accept a motion which it has not considered.  This is an almost entirely new motion which is now being discussed by the Deputy and the Minister.</P>

While I must insist on the wording I have suggested, I want also to tell the Minister that I am not satisfied with the present position.

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That Dáil Eireann is of opinion that extra service charges should not have been and should not be imposed on persons availing of the rural electrification scheme, and calls on the Government to introduce the necessary amending legislation to abolish these charges with retrospective effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many Deputies on all sides of this House who must, in their hearts, agree with the idea behind the motion.  We have only to search through the Dáil Debates for the last <Col N="1533" /> three or four years to find Deputies from Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Labour and Clann na Talmhan requesting the Minister for Industry and Commerce to ease the burden placed on certain sections of the rural community in respect of extra service charges imposed for the new amenity&mdash;electric light.</P>
    <P>I have the greatest respect and the greatest praise for the E.S.B.  This State body is an example of what can be done if the proper men are selected and if the goodwill of this House is behind the work.  The work of the E.S.B., pursued as it has been throughout the entire country, can be used as an example anywhere of how successfully a State body can function if properly organised and conducted. We all realise that, were is not for the fact that the State stepped in and decided that private enterprise was not capable of embarking on such a nationwide programme, to-day in rural Ireland the people would be depending on the paraffin oil lamp and the penny candle.  It was a State body, and not private enterprise, that was responsible for the revolution that took place in rural areas.  No greater amenity has been given to the people of rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>Frequently, inside and outside this House, expert views are expressed as to the reasons for emigration.  It is accepted that one of the causes of emigration is the lack of social amenities in rural areas.  To-day, the E.S.B., through the rural electrification programme, is helping to meet that great need and demand.</P>
    <P>The motion before the House is to persuade the Minister for Industry and Commerce, a man with a generous heart, to ensure that the rural electrification programme, which is now being pursued so energetically, will receive greater impetus by the acceptance of this motion.  If the motion is accepted, it will remedy an injustice that has been perpetrated on many people who have already taken advantage of the rural electrification scheme.</P>
    <P>As I have said, a search of the Dáil Debates for the last few years will disclose questions from Deputies on this subject, some Deputies asking that the <Col N="1534" /> facilities be extended to certain smallholders in rural areas, and the reply given by the Minister or his Parliamentary Secretary, that a contribution towards the capital cost of extension is necessary to render the supply economic.</P>
    <P>In another case, we find a Deputy from the West of Ireland requesting that the scheme be extended to the Gaeltacht areas, pointing out that the locality was very sparsely populated. The reply was that the extension of the service in these areas&mdash;mark you, the Gaeltacht areas&mdash;involves special service charges which would be quoted to the interested residents on application to the board.  That is another way of saying that there is no hope of these people getting the supply at a fair charge.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Crotty, is in the House.  In reply to a question on this very thorny problem, he pointed out that neither he nor the Minister had any power to remit, ease or reduce the extra service charge. According to Deputy Crotty, Section 93 of the Electricity Supply Act prohibits the granting of preferential treatment to consumers within the same area of supply.</P>
    <P>That is a very important sentence. The Parliamentary Secretary said that Section 93 of the Electricity Supply Act prohibits the granting of preferential treatment to consumers within the same area of supply.  I suggest that what is happening at the moment is that preferential treatment is being given.  Otherwise, how have we the unfair situation that two or three small farmers who happen, unfortunately, to live perhaps 200 or 300 yards outside the area planned by the E.S.B. are expected to pay double the charge for the installation and that that charge should remain permanently on them?  I think that they are not getting preferential treatment but that the people in the actual planned area itself are getting preferential treatment to the detriment of these other people.</P>
    <P>In a recent Dáil question the Minister for Industry and Commerce stated that at the present time the number of consumers paying special service <Col N="1535" /> charges amounts to 4,831.  That represents 3.2 per cent. of the consumers who are using rural electrification. That may not sound a very large percentage but I would like to point out to the Parliamentary Secretary that we have no figures available of the number of people who have refused to accept service from the E.S.B. as a result of the likelihood of an extra service charge being imposed on them. The number who have not accepted the service from the E.S.B. far exceeds those who have had it installed with the extra service charge involved.</P>
    <P>Taking it on the basis of equal rights for all our citizens, surely it is unfair and unjust that a man with a valuation of £8, £9 or £10, who happens to live along a bohreen 200 or 300 yards from the area mapped out by the E.S.B. has, under the terms of the Act, to pay exactly double the charges that his neighbours within the area have to pay.  Some Deputies may argue that the cost of the installations have to be paid for.  Suppose we grant for the moment that the smallholder has to pay an extra service charge for the initial installation, why should that extra service charge be imposed on him for all time, long after the plant and wire have been paid for?  He, and his people after him, have to bear this particular service charge.</P>
    <P>I have letters from many parts of the country from people who have taken advantage of the rural electrification scheme and who are to-day bearing the exorbitant charge of this nature.  I will give a few examples, but I will not give the names, although if the Parliamentary Secretary wants the details I will let him have the letters when the debate has concluded.  I take the case of three neighbours in a certain part of my constituency.  I will call them A, B and C.  The letter from the E.S.B. to Mr. A states that, due to the distance of his premises and those of Mr. B and Mr. C from the nearest point of supply, he would be obliged to bear a special service charge in addition to the ordinary fixed charges if he wished to avail of the service.  These are the charges involved for these three smallholders <Col N="1536" /> who live outside the planned area.  For Mr. A the ordinary two-monthly charge would be 16/2 and the extra service charge imposed is 15/10, making a total two-monthly charge of £1 12s.  For Mr. B the ordinary two-monthly charge would be 13/10 and the service charge 13/9, making a total two-monthly charge of £1 7s. 7d.  For Mr. C. the ordinary two-monthly charge would be 15/- and the service charge 14/10, making a total two-monthly charge of £1 9s. 10d.  The letter added: &ldquo;Should you wish to avail of the service at the above terms, please let me know and I will arrange to have the necessary extensions erected.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The ordinary charge for the householder within the specified area in which the E.S.B. has been working would amount to 16/2 for two months but these three people, because they happen to live a couple of hundred yards outside the area, have to carry almost double that amount, not over the period in which the value of the plant and line are being repaid, but for all time.  I think that is a gross injustice to people in the rural areas.</P>
    <P>This is a letter to another prospective applicant.  It states that, in the original survey of X area, Mr. A was advised that 14/6 was the charge applicable to his case.  In the course of development it was found that a longer length of line was required to get to his premises.  The normal fixed charge of 14/6 did not cover the cost of the extra line and it was necessary therefore to seek an additional fixed charge of 11/7.  That is the case of an unfortunate smallholder who, because he was unlucky enough to have his house built outside the planned area, perhaps by the Land Commission or somebody else, has to pay 11/7 extra every two months.  That is almost double the normal charge.  It would not take very long to pay off the value of the extra line which the E.S.B. had to put up but why should he have to pay for that for the rest of his life?</P>
    <P>The purpose of this motion is to secure the amendment of the legislation to ensure that this injustice will be remedied and that it will have retrospective effect, wherever these charges have been imposed in the past.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1537" /> Deputies may say that this may sound very nice but they may ask how is it going to be done and where will the money come from?  We have had this statement of the Minister for Industry and Commerce that, so far as the E.S.B. is concerned, there is plenty of money available.  All we want is to have it directed towards this purpose.</P>
    <P>In Volume 149, column 484, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, in reply to a question by Deputy Lemass, is reported as having said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In each of the last six years during which the Deputy sat in Kildare Street as Minister for Industry and Commerce, the E.S.B. yielded a surplus as it yielded a surplus last year and as I have no doubt it will continue to yield in the future.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These are the words of the Minister himself, pointing out that the E.S.B. have a surplus revenue.  I understand that under recent legislation the E.S.B. themselves are now required to bear the burden of rural electrification. My belief is that whatever profit is made by the E.S.B., with particular reference to the rural electrification programme, should be ploughed back into rural electrification to subsidise the people who pay extra service charges.  I do not think that is an unfair suggestion to make.</P>
    <P>If, as we understand, there was a surplus of from £80,000 to £90,000 last year on rural electrification, why should that money not be used to subsidise these unfortunate householders who just happen to be in pockets that are by-passed by the E.S.B. in their normal programme?  It is not unfair to suggest that the Minister should have this matter reviewed. I have on a number of occasions discussed this matter with E.S.B. men and I have found that all of them are more than sympathetic towards these people in rural Ireland.  I think these men believe that some Government should take the necessary steps to amend the E.S.B. Acts in order to <Col N="1538" /> ensure that this extra service charge is removed.</P>
    <P>In reply to a letter which I forwarded to the E.S.B.  I got this reply from them in connection with a case I mentioned: &ldquo;I appreciate that these charges may fall heavily on the householder in this case but you will understand that under existing conditions no reduction is possible.&rdquo;  In reply to a further letter I got a similar reply. Therefore, you have the E.S.B. officials and engineers themselves appreciating and admitting the fact that there are hardships imposed on people who have to pay the extra service charges.  I am sure that Deputies on all sides of the House have received similar letters.  I am sure there are Deputies who have received requests from their constituents to try and have this matter adjusted.</P>
    <P>In bringing forward this motion, I do not want under any circumstances to halt the present programme of the E.S.B. or to alter their present plans with regard to the particular areas in which rural electrification is likely to be installed in the near future.  If the decision were made straight away to do away with these extra service charges, I know perfectly well there would be an increased demand immediately from all over the country from people who have up to this refused to accept rural electrification. I am not suggesting that they should get priority of installation or anything like that because I do not think we should alter the arrangements made by the engineering section of the E.S.B.  But I do think legislation should be changed so as to ensure that this burden will be no longer placed on the backs of these people.  I think that the general view of Deputies in this House is that the areas yet to receive E.S.B. benefits are the hardest areas to deal with.</P>
    <P>I think many Deputies will agree with me that what I should describe as the most favoured areas have received rural electrification benefits already and that the areas which are still to come before the board present greater problems.  In many cases, frequent and repeated surveys and canvasses have been carried out of <Col N="1539" /> people in the poorer areas where the population is widely scattered and where the holdings are poor.  It will be very difficult for these people if they are asked to bear these extra service charges.</P>
    <P>I shall not say any more until I have heard what the Minister has to say on the question but I do think the Government should give some consideration to the motion.  If there is any snag with regard to the wording of the motion that can easily be got over. The Parliamentary Secretary himself is aware of what I have in mind.  If it is found, on closer examination, that it would be unwise to remove the extra service charge immediately, then I would suggest that, when the cost of repayment of the extra lines and the extra poles is met, the extra service charge would be eliminated.  I think the House should make it quite clear that when these costs are repaid through the extra service charge, the charge should cease altogether.</P>
    <P>Of course, the Parliamentary Secretary may tell me there are areas where, if other sections of the populations come in later, the extra service charge will be lightened on those who have been linked up earlier.  That may be with regard to certain individuals, but the Parliamentary Secretary is as well aware as I am of the pockets of single individuals scattered throughout the country who have no relief and who must, under present circumstances, bear this extra service charge. I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to give this matter his most careful consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I could not fully accept the wording of this motion.  People who have been electricity consumers since the inception of the E.S.B. are paying through the nose.  We have them in the towns especially in the area from which I come.  We should approach this matter in the light of what will it cost and who will pay for it?  Certainly I would agree with much of this motion if the Gaeltacht area was mentioned.  We hear a good deal about saving the <Col N="1540" /> Gaeltacht, and on the question of power in the Gaeltacht I think it would help to encourage industry.  If this motion were worded to suggest the Gaeltacht areas it would help, but definitely I would not be in favour of giving special charges to wealthy farmers who can well afford to pay&mdash;and we have such in this country.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy McQuillan that this extra charge should not be retained after the expenses of wiring an area and putting in these special transformers have been covered.  I think the first thing we should find out is how much this proposal would cost and who will have to pay for it.  We can then approach this motion in the proper light.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. MacCarthy Mr. MacCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>While one may agree in principle with the motion that has been proposed, it raises a good many problems.  The first problem that arises to my mind is: if these people who, by reason of the fact that E.S.B. equipment is on the spot, take advantage of an extension and a consequent priority for which they are willing to pay, do they by so doing cut off, so to speak, the merits of the particular parish or locality to which they belong in seeking its due place on the list in any subsequent survey?  Are these people counted in or out?  In other words, if they are already supplied, if a number of them in a particular area pay for a priority and get it, are they, by that very act, delaying the extension of the supply to the particular area or locality to which they belong?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy McQuillan completely that pockets which can easily be linked up and which lie between areas already served should be linked up while E.S.B. equipment is on the spot and while these charges would be small.  But where this system of priority in the case of people who are anxious to get a supply and pay for it applies to my mind, if that were extended too widely, it would cut out the merits of selected areas.  A point is made about reducing these special service charges when payment is completed for the service given.  Of course there is a certain amount of equity in that, but my point would be that, as <Col N="1541" /> soon as that particular area is selected for connection under the rural electrification scheme, those charges should no longer apply.  I do not know whether charges already made could be remitted. I feel that would probably require legislation and it would not be easy to administer but at least the extra charges should be removed when the particular areas in which people have got priority by paying for it are included in the general scheme of rural electrification.</P>
    <P>These are the few points that strike me about the matter.  While we may all agree with Deputy McQuillan that the extra charges that have been made should not apply for all time, the simple point to my mind is that when these areas are selected in the ordinary way, the special service charges should then cease.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy McQuillan's motion is a very sensible one.  I do not think Deputy MacCarthy got the real point of the motion because it is not suggested in the motion that people who do pay for priority should have a refund or that anything should be done about them.  What I think Deputy McQuillan is aiming at is that people who happen to be sandwiched in between two areas already connected&mdash; that happens in a big number of cases &mdash;should not be ruled out because it would cost the E.S.B. a little more to provide poles and wire to reach those outlying areas and because they are not in many cases in a position to pay the extra charges they would be asked to meet in order to get a supply.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. MacCarthy Mr. MacCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>As I read it, these are the terms of the motion and I heartily agree with it.  It is not a question of areas out in the mountains that are omitted.  Even in places like my own constituency, where rural electrification is almost completed, we have one, two, three or four houses, usually odd houses, but sometimes groups of three or four, that are not connected simply because it would take a few extra poles to bring them in.  In one particular case of which I got <Col N="1542" /> notice a few weeks ago, a county council labourer earning £4 17s. 6d. a week was asked to pay on top of 12/7 ordinary meter charge, 14/7 extra per two-months period to have electricity installed.  In his case it would take an extra pole, and I think it is a bit unfortunate that cases like this should occur.  If it were a question of a company or some concern working on a profit-making basis, I could understand the E.S.B. carrying out this system, but in my opinion electricity is a public service and, since people all over the place are being serviced without any extra charge, it seems rather unfortunate that those who are least able to pay are in many cases the people who are left out of the scheme simply because they cannot pay the extra charge.</P>
      <P>That is a problem, because when one meets these people they do not blame those who are really responsible but blame the local E.S.B. officials whom they sometimes call terrible names. The people believe that they were deprived of electricity because of some spite or some reason of that kind.  The people concerned do not realise that the officials are not responsible; the members of this House are those who are really responsible because the officials are bound by a regulation which was passed here during the passing of the Act and that is why these isolated houses are excluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy McQuillan says, the local officials are only too anxious to have those houses serviced at the usual charge because they know quite well that it is unfair to discriminate against those people who should be subject to the same rate of charge as anybody else.  Very often one individual may be in a position where he will use a lot of electricity and the service is brought to him over a long distance, at no extra charge, because he uses such a lot of current the service will eventually pay for itself.  But that does not apply where there is an isolated householder using very little electricity&mdash;perhaps lights and a radio and so forth&mdash;and the fact that he is using a very small amount of current is held against such a man.  He will not get the current at the same rate as <Col N="1543" /> his neighbour who consumes a lot of current.</P>
    <P>I think this motion should be accepted by the Minister.  It is now recognised that the E.S.B. are coming to the end of their programme and they should ensure that everybody who wants current should be given current and they should get that current without having to pay a charge which amounts in most cases to an extra £3 or £4 per year over the lifetime of the tenant and possibly over the lifetime of three or four generations to come. In that period not alone will the poles and the wiring be paid for by the particular consumer but all the poles and wiring used in the area will be paid for because of the extra charges imposed on him.  Possibly someone slipped up in framing the Act.  There may have been an oversight.  The Act may have been drafted without advertence to the hardships which would be imposed on people like those to whom I have referred.  If there has been a mistake the position should be remedied at the earliest opportunity. If there has not been a mistake it would be no harm for the Minister's officials to check on the areas where people are affected and check on what is the actual position.</P>
    <P>Deputy McQuillan has quoted the fact that slightly over 3 per cent. of those who are serviced are paying this extra charge.  He says that quite a number of people did not take the current because they could not afford it.  Now I cannot make that case in my constituency because a very small number proportionately has been left out there.  There are not very many. There may be only 100 or 200 over the whole county.  But those people are entitled to current and to service from the E.S.B. and they should not be treated any worse than anybody else in the area just because others happen by a fortunate circumstance to be living sufficiently near to the service to be connected without any extra charge. We had a good deal of trouble from time to time with people who had big, old, rambling houses and who were asked to pay a good deal more than <Col N="1544" /> people living in the smaller and more compact houses.  That was a big problem in the county, but the present problem is one which affects the whole country and I think Deputy McQuillan was very wise to put down this motion and I hope it will get the support of the House.  We may be looking at this from just one angle and there may be factors in it of which we are not aware. I do not agree with Deputy Coogan that the cost should be estimated.  I do not think that has any bearing on the problem good, bad or indifferent. I believe these people are entitled to the same treatment, and only the same treatment, as anybody else who is serviced by the E.S.B.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Crotty)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure everybody would like to agree with Deputy McQuillan on this because everybody feels that service charges should be the same for every consumer, if that were possible.  That is the popular point of view and I suppose we would all like to see that point of view implemented.  At one time I thought I would like to see these people getting current at the same rate.</P>
      <P>The E.S.B. was set up for the purpose of bringing electric current to the cities and towns and, when that had been done, to rural areas.  When rural electrification was planned in 1943, it was agreed that current would be brought to people where the capital cost of connection was not more than 16 times the prescriptive revenue from the fixed annual charges.  While we have given power to the E.S.B. and expect them to balance their books, we do not expect them to be a profitable concern but we do expect them to fix their charges so that they will be sufficient, and only sufficient, to meet all their outgoings properly chargeable to income in any particular year.  As Deputy McQuillan pointed out, Section 93 prohibits the granting of preferential treatment to consumers within the same area of supply.  If we agreed with this motion we would be giving preferential treatment to these consumers.  As I said, it is laid down that the capital cost&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have no doubt that if <Col N="1546" /> they are able to show an increased revenue when rural electrification has been fully developed they will then be able to give back all these charges again.  Deputy McQuillan pointed out that people were not inclined to take current because of these extra charges. I think the main reason is that people do not like to be charged more than their neighbours, irrespective of whether or not they think it is justified. They like to be on the same plane as their neighbours.</P>
      <P>Deputy McQuillan is wrong in his conclusion because originally and up to some years ago, the rate of acceptances was running about 62 per cent.; it is now running about 82 per cent. and, therefore, the argument adduced has not had any material effect on keeping down the number of applicants.</P>
      <P>Deputy McQuillan also made the point that people living outside the planned area would have to pay an extra charge.  Deputy MacCarthy pointed out that if they want to get priority over other people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in agreement with Deputy MacCarthy.  Deputy MacCarthy took me up wrong.  I understand that where a person is outside the actual area&mdash;in other words, in a pocket&mdash;that person has to pay an extra service charge.  He is not looking for the luxury of getting extra installations, but he has to pay an extra service charge because he is unlucky enough not to be in the planned area.</P>
