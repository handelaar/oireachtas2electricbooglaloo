      <NameTxt>Messrs. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Coburn</b> asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce what is the maximum tonnage of ships that can be accommodated at the ports of Drogheda and Dundalk, respectively; further, how many ships of such tonnage or less are owned by Irish Shipping, Limited.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Norton) William Norton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Norton)</NameTxt>
      <P>The size of vessels which can be accommodated with safety at a port is determined by each harbour authority concerned.  The principal determining factor is the draught of vessels, but length, breadth or tonnage may also be taken into account.</P>
      <P>Particulars of the depths and the range of tides in the principal Irish ports, including Dundalk and Drogheda, are shown in the <i>Shipping Handbook</i>, 1954, published and issued under the direction of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Copy of the handbook has been placed in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>I am advised that two of the present vessels of Irish Shipping, Limited, could probably be accommodated at both ports.  The question could only be determined, however, in consultation between the company's officials and the harbour authority concerned. I understand that Irish Shipping, Limited, would always be prepared to arrange for the inspection of any port for which business offers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state if it is intended to undertake boring operations in places, other than Roundstone, in the search for molybdenite, and, if so, in what places.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state (a) how much money has been provided out of public funds for the purpose of boring for deposits of molybdenite at Roundstone; (b) how much money has been provided from other sources; (c) what agency is carrying out the work; (d) when operations began and what progress has been made; and (e) when it is expected that the exploratory work will be completed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 3 together.</P>
      <P>Under a technical assistance project for the geological survey a drilling programme on State-owned deposits of molybdenite at Murvey, near Roundstone, County Galway, was commenced in January, 1954, and completed in December, 1954.  The drilling was carried out by the State-sponsored company, Mianraí Teoranta, as agents for the geological survey.  Expenditure from public funds on the work amounted to £12,000.  There was no money provided from other sources towards the cost of the work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The drilling programme carried out at Murvey failed to establish the existence of the minimum quantity of ore of a grade which would be suitable <Col N="315" /> for commercial development.  However, braces of molybdenite have also been found in the vicinity of Mace, County Galway, which is near Murvey, and a preliminary examination is being undertaken in this area to determine whether a drilling programme there would be justified.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will ascertain if G.I.E. are prepared to provide a bus service twice or thrice weekly through Glandore to Skibbereen, and, if they are not, whether he will grant a licence to a private bus company to serve the route.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>No application has been made to me by any private bus company for a licence to operate over the route in question.  Any such application would fall to be considered under Section II of the Road Transport Act, 1932, which provides that the Minister for Industry <Col N="316" /> and Commerce shall have regard to certain matters, including the need for the proposed service and the organisation and equipment at the disposal of the applicant for the licence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that the residents of Glanturkeen, Cashel, County Galway, were informed by the E.S.B. in February last that service would be given them provided a certain householder agreed to contract for supply; that this householder subsequently so agreed; that the board has since withdrawn its offer, and intimated that a special charge will be payable; and, if so, if he will ascertain from the board why it withdrew its written offer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the E.S.B. that, following the receipt of local representations, the board have decided that the original offer should be allowed to stand and supply will be extended to the residents concerned at the charges originally quoted to them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the E.S.B. that it is not at present proposed to extend supply to the villages of Cushatrower and Ervallough in the Roundstone area as a sufficient number of applications has not been received from the residents. I am also informed that it is intended to re-examine the position before construction work is completed in the area and that supply will be extended if the demand then warrants that course.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary say whether or not those who agreed to take the supply have been asked to pay a special charge&mdash;that is, to pay extra for the installation of the service?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the E.S.B. that the Kilbeacanty area, County Galway, which includes Shanaglish and Tubber districts, has recently been selected by the board for development under the rural electrification scheme and that work will shortly commence on the erection of networks in the area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Seán Mac Eochagáin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will ascertain from the E.S.B. the present position in regard to the demand for the extension of rural electrification to the following townlands: Cleggan, Renvyle, Letterfrack, Leenane, Cornamona and Ballyconneely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the E.S.B. that the areas of Cleggan, Cornamona and Letterfrack, which includes Renvyle, have been considered for selection by the board but have not so far been selected as then-returns have not compared favourably with those for other areas still awaiting development in the Galway district.  The areas will be reconsidered by the board at a later date and the decision of the board will depend on how their returns compare with those for other areas awaiting development at the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="318" /> I am also informed that the Ballyconneely area has been investigated but that the extension of supply to the residents involves consideration of special service charges which will be quoted to interested residents on application to the board.  The Leenane area has not yet been investigated as, owing to the sparse population, it appears unlikely that its returns would compare favourably with those for other areas still awaiting development in the Galway district and in any case supply could not be conveniently extended to it until the Letterfrack area has been developed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the E.S.B. that supply has already been extended to the village of Ardgroom and that the results of a preliminary canvass carried out by a local committee in the undeveloped region between Kenmare and Ardgroom on the northern side of the peninsula have been received by the district engineer in Tralee.  I am also informed that an official canvass of the area will be carried out in due course and when the results are available, the area will be considered for selection by the board. The decision of the board will depend on how the returns for the area compare with those for other areas still awaiting development in the Tralee district.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy does not wish to get particulars of areas to which priority has already been given and which have already been developed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed by the E.S.B. that the Ballylongford area has been selected for development and that the Listowel area has been considered by the board but has not so far been selected for development.  I am also informed that <Col N="319" /> an official canvass of the Rathea area is being carried out and that arrangements have been made for an official canvass of the Brosna area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the E.S.B. that the Birdhill area, which includes Killoscully and Newport, has been considered for selection by the board on a number of occasions but has not so far been selected as the returns for the area have not compared favourably with those for other areas still awaiting development in the same district.  The area will shortly be reconsidered by the board and the decision of the board will depend on how the returns for the area compare with those for other areas awaiting development at the time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands if, with reference to the reply to a question on 21st April that the general scheme for relief of farmers in the flooded areas of the Shannon Valley provided <i>inter alia</i> for the provision of housing above the ascertained <Col N="320" /> flood line for those whose houses were at present liable to inundation, and that this would be done, he will now state if this provision will be made retrospective in respect of those who were given accommodation land on which to erect dwelling-houses and out-offices on the Trench estate and other estates a few years ago, but who were unable to proceed with the erection of such dwelling-houses and out-offices, owing to the inadequacy of the grants offered by the Land Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. Blowick) Joseph Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Blowick)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Land Commission have prepared a scheme on the lines already indicated for the relief of the farmers in the flooded areas of the Shannon Valley. As it has been decided to obtain the advice of an American expert on remedial measures for the control of the Shannon, it is mere prudence to await his report before implementing the scheme.  It would be undesirable at this stage to disclose details of the scheme which may need some revision in the light of the expert's report. The position of each of the persons the Deputy appears to have in mind on the Trench estate will be examined separately and will be decided on its merits.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Can we take it then that the question of relieving these people will be postponed until the report of the American engineer is available?  Is that the position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is not.  The Deputy used the word &ldquo;postponed&rdquo; for, I presume, a very definite reason. The answer I gave to Deputy Beegan was that the implementation of the scheme which has been prepared by the Land Commission will await the American expert's report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Egan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not consider that the Land Commission should have acquired this land in view of the fact that there are numbers of smallholders living quite close to this estate?  Would the Minister not consider that the land should be acquired in view of its close proximity to the flooded area of the Shannon Valley since it would serve a very useful purpose in providing land for some of the people whose holdings are subject to flooding?  Furthermore, in view of the grave difficulty that exists in getting land for these people near their own holdings and their well-known unwillingness to take land further away, would the Minister not consider the desirability of acquiring this estate?</P>

Neither will there be any undue delay in the acquisition of suitable areas but, as the Deputy is aware, negotiations for suitable land are sometimes held up and occasionally break down completely on the question of price and production of satisfactory legal title can also be a source of considerable delay.</P>

      <P>The information sought regarding forest lands in possession of the State in 1922 and annual acquisition and planting since that date is in the form of a tabular statement which, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to have circulated with the Official Report.</P>
      <P>As regards the estimated current money value of State forest lands a figure is not available.  Various attempts have been made to estimate the capital value of State forests as a whole but such estimation cannot be effected on a reliable basis because of the difficulties associated with the volumetric assessment of large areas of growing plantations on the one hand and the impossibility of reliable adjustment of actual immediate value of young plantations by reference to their ultimate potential value many years later.</P>

      <P>I am aware that there has been a marked decline in egg production since 1953, and I accept that this has been due to the low prices for eggs in the months of heavy production.  The price to producers this spring, so far, however, has been substantially higher <Col N="325" /> than the price last spring.  The futnre prosperity of the poultry industry in this country depends, not on what I can do, but on the willingness of poultry-keepers to supply eggs in the autumn and winter months when they are wanted on both home and export markets.  The advice and assistance of the poultry officers of my Department and of the county committees of agriculture are available to all farmers to help to achieve this end.  Substantial grants have been offered to farmers for several years now towards the cost of the necessary poultry accommodation and equipment to enable them to bring about more efficient poultry management on their farms.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The delay in this matter arises from the fact that the number of suitable applicants is insufficient to enable a viable scheme to be operated. Obviously, unless there is a sufficient number of participants among whom to apportion the necessary overheads, the burden on those taking part will be unduly heavy, and I am not disposed to put the 63 eligible applicants now on our list in that unenviable position.  I am prepared to proceed with the scheme should it yet be possible to obtain the requisite number of auitable participants&mdash;approximately 100&mdash;whom I would hope to have formed into a co-operative society.  On this point of securing an enlarged participation in this scheme, I am in consultation with Oifig na Gaeltachta agus na gGeantar gCúng.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy I <Col N="326" /> will consider anything, but as the Deputy from his own bitter experience knows, there is great danger that if the area to be serviced by a central packing station is unduly extended you can make the whole scheme uneconomic and deprive everybody of any benefit. Similarly, if you cannot get within a reasonable area around the central packing station a sufficient number of participants the whole thing can become uneconomic and the burden of overheads makes it inevitably bankrupt before you begin.  I am trying to resolve these difficulties and if we can get 100 participants within reach of the central packing station by one method or another we will go on.  I will certainly have the proposal to include Ballyferriter in the existing area considered, but the Deputy will bear in mind that that may mean a problem of spreading over too wide an area.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that applicants from outside districts&mdash; I mean areas as far away as Sneem and Glencar&mdash;30 or 40 miles from the Fíor-Ghaeltacht, applied and were excluded at one time?  Would it not be more feasible to include those applicants who were turned down on that occasion than to suggest including Ballyferriter or any other district?  My point is that the area of South Kerry which this scheme was to serve is still under consideration and the applicants who were turned down on the grounds that it would be uneconomic to have people residing 40 miles from the&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the Deputy expressed dissatisfaction with regard to (1) the recruitment of labourers on one scheme in the Dunmanway area and (2) the delay that occurred in employing a particular ganger in the Adrigole district.  The situation in regard to the Dunmanway scheme was fully explained to the Deputy in a letter from the Special Employment Schemes Office, dated 19th March, 1955, and the circumstances regarding the Adrigole appointment were adequately explained in the letter dated 26th January, 1955, from my office.  I do not, therefore, propose to take any further action in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that the <Col N="335" /> representations made by me from time to time were of a general nature and I gave him several instances where the recruitment of gangers and labourers was made on a political basis?  I feel sure he has received from another Deputy from West Cork similar representations that the work of the Special Employment Schemes Office is carried out on a political basis.  Deputy Collins will confirm that, because I believe he has made similar representations. It has happened in the Dnnmanway area, in the Berehaven peninsula and all over the place and in view of the fact that two agents employed by your office are political agents I want to know if you intend to take further steps in this matter?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>The regulations regarding the appointment of gangers provide that preference should be given to persons who have previously been employed on similar schemes and who have given proof of their competence and trustworthiness.  Where a suitable ganger with previous experience is not available, preference is given to any suitable person submitted by the employment exchange, and if no suitable person is available from that source, the inspector is free to appoint the most suitable and competent person available from any other source.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government whether he is aware of the dissatisfaction that exists in the Ballyvourney district because of the indiscriminate rejection of applications for the right of interment in St. Gobnait's burial grounds, and, if so, if he will take immediate steps to terminate this situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>When a burial ground is closed to further interments on grounds of public health and decency, it is the practice to refuse exemption to any person claiming right of interment who is not either&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  a widow or widower whose late partner in marriage is already interred there;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="337" /> (b)  a single person of advanced age who is the sole surviving member of his or her family.</P>
    <P>If it appears that adequate space will be available in the grave, persons within these categories may be exempted from the terms of the Closing Order.  I consider this a most reasonable approach and in applying it to St. Gobnait's the most lenient interpretation possible has been adopted.  Since the closure 52 persons in the special categories have been refused exemption.  A further 88 claims were allowed because soundings of the graves indicated that the depth available was sufficient.  The total number of exemptions is now 111 and although this is abnormally large any further claims on the basis indicated will be sympathetically considered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, in view of the reverence and the traditional veneration in which St. Gobnait's cemetery is held by local people, I would suggest that he should consider implementing proposals for legislation to waive this Closing Order.  No good has been served by introducing that Closing Order and I would ask the Minister if he intends to take any further steps on the lines I suggest?</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £4,937,260 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1956, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Agriculture, including certain Services administered by that Office, and for payment of certain subsidies and sundry Grants-in-Aid.</P>
      <P>The House will observe that a motion has been set down to refer back this Estimate.  That is a motion which I welcome, because I think it gives us a somewhat wider scope for our discussion and permits of general questions of policy being raised and discussed which otherwise would not be accessible to us.  I, therefore, propose in my introductory remarks to look at certain questions of broad policy in order that I may have the benefit of views of Deputies upon them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="344" /> Firstly, I would like to say categorically that I grow a little weary of the people who consider themselves qualified and called upon to tell every Minister for Agriculture, whatever Party he belongs to, what should not be done. What I long to hear from the critics is what they think ought to be done.</P>
    <P>It has become a popular pastime with certain elements of our community to promulgate the proposition that stagnation characterises the agricultural industry of this country.  The implication of that kind of talk is that the farmers are constitutionally lazy and that the Irish Department of Agriculture is no damn good.  Both propositions are false, as I hope to demonstrate conclusively in introducing this Estimate.</P>
    <P>We have in this country an annual average rainfall of approximately 40 to 42 inches.  That is an inescapable fact and if we face it and welcome it and mould our agricultural policy to use it. we can realise that it is a great blessing that many other countries covet but do not enjoy.  There is no use people blandly comparing our system of agriculture&mdash;which is conditioned by that annual rainfall of 40 to 42 inches&mdash;with the system obtaining in countries where the average annual rainfall is in the order of 21 inches and repeating the parrot cry: &ldquo;Why don't you do in Ireland what they do elsewhere?&rdquo;  The answer is: &ldquo;Because our conditions are fundamentally different and because we know how to use our own land according to our own methods and the circumstances which surround them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>One of those circumstances appears to me to be of dominant importance, that is, that we have at our door a virtually inexhaustible market for live stock and live-stock products which for veterinary reasons no other country in the world has access to on the same terms as we enjoy.  If we fail to exploit that advantage to the limit of our capacity, I think we are guilty of supreme folly.  That we should seek every other outlet is also certain, but it would be great folly to ignore the proximate and readily accessible market, in the search for the more remote and competitive markets that may exist elsewhere.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="345" /> Those of us who are concerned to consider agricultural policy should bear this also in mind.  It is not only the farmers who depend on the capacity of our farmers to export profitably: everybody in this country, whether he lives in town, city or country, depends in the last analysis for his standard of living on the capacity of our farmers to export profitably.</P>
    <P>It is no harm to emphasise again that if a situation ever arises in which our farmers are unable to export profitably, the first people who will feel the blast of adversity are the industrial and distributive workers of this country for whose employment the importation of raw materials is essential. Let us remember that the raw materials of every industrial process in this country that have to be imported are paid for, as to over 80 per cent., by agricultural exports.  If the export of agricultural produce ceases to pay &amp; profit to the farmers, exports of agricultural produce will stop.  If that should ever happen, the farmer can have recourse to his traditional remedy&mdash;a return to subsistence farming. He goes back, at least, to a home where he will find eggs, milk, oatmeal and the essentials for maintaining existence.  The industrial and the distributive worker, however, who depend for their employment on the availability of raw materials, once that supply ceases for the want of capacity to pay for them, have nothing to go home to but the dole or the search for accommodation on an emigrant ship to seek employment elsewhere that is no longer available to them in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The operative word in all I have said up to now is &ldquo;profitably&rdquo;.  I would invite Deputies to note that we have before us an example of what happens when a particular branch of agriculture becomes unprofitable to the producer: I refer to eggs.  We had vast exports of eggs so long as the price obtainable for them yielded a profit to the producer.  When the price available for eggs fell below the level at which the producer could earn a profit on them, the export of eggs virtually melted away.  I think I can show the House that where, under the terms of <Col N="346" /> the 1948 Trade Agreement, we were able to establish the principle of the rigid link between prices payable in Great Britain for British live stock and prices payable in Great Britain for Irish live stock, thus preserving the profitability of exports of live stock, we have had a dramatic expansion, unrivallsd in Europe, in that branch of agriculture; that it is on that expansion that the economic life of this country at the present moment depends and that, but for it, we would be confronted to-day with an economic crisis of the first magnitude.</P>
    <P>Before I turn to the figures to demonstrate the truth of that proposition, I want to direct the attention of Deputies on all sides of the House to this inescapable fact: it may not be popular but it is the truth and so long as I am Minister for Agriculture I will tell the farmers of this country the truth because they are entitled to hear it from me, and I must abide the consequences of discharging my duty in telling it to them.  We are rapidly passing out of a sellers' market, to which we have become familiar in the past 16 years.  The time of world scarcities has gone and the theme at international congresses, wherever they are held, is to-day not an increase of production to meet urgent and clamant needs but the marketing of surpluses to avoid hopeless disruption of world markets.  In that situation, we still enjoy great advantages if we have the prudence to exploit them&mdash;and here is the unpopular fact that must be faced.</P>
    <P>If we are going to grasp our share of the available world market, the objective we must set before ourselves is to reduce our own costs of production. If we do not, once we have arrived at the point of saturating the domestic capacity to consume&mdash;and we have arrived at that point&mdash;we have to face the fact that all increased production must be undertaken on terms which will enable us to earn a profit in the export markets available to us.</P>
    <P>I invite the House to survey the international market for agricultural produce at the present moment.  We have priced ourselves out of the market for eggs.  We have priced ourselves <Col N="347" /> out of the market for butter.  We have priced ourselves out of the market for cheese.  We are in grave danger of pricing ourselves out of the market for bacon.  There remains to us cattle, beef, sheep and mutton.  The desperate danger is that we should not face in time the fact that unless we retain our competitive position in these commodities we might unconsciously stumble into catastrophe.  I am as certain as I am standing here that, by the exercise of common prudence, we have available to us an unlimited market for cattle, sheep, pigs and butter.</P>
    <P>It will be a great catastrophe if all those interested in agriculture, no matter on what side of this House they sit, will not combine in persuading our farmers to do what is eminently possible&mdash;to march out and capture their share of that market; to take the lid off potential production and expand production indefinitely&mdash;for it is through increased production that we can raise the standard of living of our people and, what is infinitely more important, enable them to stay in their own country and earn their living working for their own people.</P>
    <P>Let there be no illusion about it. The ability of this or any other Government to provide employment for our people in their own country depends on whether the farmers are prepared to undertake the maximum production of which the land of Ireland is capable, at a cost which will leave them a fair margin of profit when they sell their produce at the best prices available in the world to-day.  Do not let us embark upon that project with any inferiority complex.  At the present moment, Irish butter is earning a premium on quality above any other butter going into the British market. We are getting more on a free market in competition with all comers because the people want our butter.  If that butter were being exported, on a basis which earned a profit for this country, and we could all really put our backs into expanding the volume of that production indefinitely, in the knowledge that every extra pound produced <Col N="348" /> earned more profit for the man who produced it and for the nation to which he belonged, and we had before us the prospect of expanding indefinitely the numbers of our live stock, I do not think any of us would need to fear the future.</P>
    <P>I earnestly hope that we may get from all sides of the House the cooperation that is necessary to persuade our farmers of the truth of these vast potentialities and to induce our farmers to believe that the Oireachtas and everybody else appreciates that the future of our people and the nation is dependent on the measure of the farmers' effort to get from the land of Ireland for himself and his family the best living that land is capable of yielding, always provided that he leaves his land in autumn a little better than he foond it in the spring.</P>
    <P>Now let me turn for a moment to lay before the House the picture of what happens when you procure for the farmers of Ireland a market in which they can sell their produce at a price which leaves them a fair margin of profit.  I want to compare the year 1948 with the year 1954, so that I may compare the circumstances that obtained before there was a guaranteed market at a fair price for our cattle and the situation that obtained after our farmers had known six years of such security.  I know that some Fianna Fáil controversialists say that it is unfair to quote figures relating to 1947 or 1948 because they were very wet years.</P>

Wetness <Col N="349" /> does not affect the fecundity of a cow; wetness does not prevent a ewe from having a lamb.  I am going to talk of live stock.  In June, 1948, the total number of cattle in this country was 3,920,922; in June, 1954, the total number of cattle in this country was 4,504,026.</P>

Incidentally, I have already anpplied the Deputy and every other Deputy of his Party with a White Paper giving a good deal of statistical material and information with which to divert himself while I am talking, 80 that he may prepare his ballistics when it comes to his turn to move his motion to refer back.</P>
      <P>To return to the theme I was developing, the total number of cattle in this country in 1948 was 3,920,922 and in June, 1954, it had risen to 4,504,026. The number of cattle under one year&mdash;a very significant figure for future production&mdash;rose from 852,725 to 1,030,662.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The increase in national wealth signified by the increase in the total number of cattle is equivalent in terms of current values to over £20,000,000.  Sheep and lambs increased from 2,057,717 in 1948 to 3,112,842 in 1954, representing in terms of current values an addition of about £7,000,000 sterling to the nation's capital.  The number of pigs jumped from 457,065 in 1948 to 958,321 in 1954.  If we take the total value of the increase in the numbers of sheep, lambs, cattle and <Col N="350" /> pigs between 1948 and 1954, it amounts to approximately £32,000,000 sterling on the basis of current values.</P>
      <P>All these figures are, in themselves, significant, but when they are read side by side with the figures for our exports of these commodities and when I direct the attention of the House to the fact that, throughout the period in which this great growth in the stock upon the land was taking place, our exports were steadily rising, too, the House will realise how dynamic an effort has been made by the farmers in circumstances which allowed them to earn profits on the work they were called upon to do.  In 1948, the total exports of live cattle, plus the live cattle equivalent in carcase beef and canned beef, numbered 405,000 head, and, in 1954, the corresponding figure was 834,490, an increase of over 100 per cent.</P>
      <P>Will Deputies sympathise with me if I find myself getting a bit hot under the collar when I am told by well-intentioned observers that the agricultural industry is stagnant?  Is there any country in the whole civilised world that can claim to have increased its live stock exports by 100 per cent., while at the same time substantially increasing the foundation stock retained upon the land?  Sheep and lambs, plus the live equivalent of exported carcase mutton, rose from less than 60,000 head in 1948 to over 330,000 head in 1954, an increase of over 400 per cent.</P>
      <P>Deputies will remember that one of the stock gibes was that if you referred to exports in terms of money everybody would say: &ldquo;Ah, I remember Deputy Childers used to be very voluble on the subject&rdquo;.  He said: &ldquo;Let us talk of volume&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>How dearly we love 1939! I am talking of the year in which Fianna Fáil handed over this country to me with fewer cattle, fewer sheep, fewer pigs, than at any time in recorded history since the famine. That Party handed over this country with 12,000,000 acres of arable land in a greater degree of physical destitution than was ever recorded since the Normans landed here.  That is the position from which we had to start. That is the old game.  Deputy Flynn asked me to-day what happened to his scheme for tomato houses in Cahirciveen. It is another bequest from Fianna Fáil, but the sovereign bequest that this Government got from Fianna Fáil was the agricultural industry in the lowest slough of despond to which it ever descended in recorded time.  That is what we were handed over in February, 1948, and that is what we set out to remedy.  Here is what we did.</P>

I can tell the whole story from the day the blight of Fianna Fáil fell on this country to the day when we swept it finally away.  I will take any year on any terms affecting any branch of agriculture, and make a hare of them in any county in Ireland.  Let us return to this interesting statistical material.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>And that is something which may well be borne in mind when <Col N="353" /> we are considering expanding agricultural production in the new world where competitive conditions are much more stringent than they used to be. I will return from figures relative to volume to figures relative to value. The total value of all items which I have mentioned in terms of volume in 1948 was £16,031,589, and the corresponding figure for 1954 was £53,931,284, an increase of £37,899,695.  If that is not an increase of more than 100 per cent. in value my mathematics is wrong.  I agree that value unsupported by volume can be illusory but volume unsupported by value can be catastrophic. There is not the least use in shipping ever-increasing quantities of agricultural produce abroad if you have to pay the foreigner to eat your production. The reason for shipping agricultural produce abroad is to make the foreigner pay for the chance of eating your output.  When we start talking of the balance of trade, we have got to remember that the balance of trade ia expressed not only in terms of volume but in terms of cash.  Our problem is to pay for the goods we want to bring in.  There is no use offering a dozen hams to a man from whom you want to buy an electric motor.  He may not want a dozen hams and you may be a long time waiting for an engineer who wants a dozen hams.  If you cannot sell your hams for negotiable security you may be waiting for the electric motor a long time.  You will have to wait until you find somebody who has the raw materials you want to purchase and who at the same time requires the 12 hams you have to sell.  It is the money value of our stuff that goes out that enables us to pay the money value of the things we want to bring in. Fortunately for us the increase in our exportable surplus of live stock has been 100 per cent. at a price that will leave a profit to our producers.  Signs on it.  We were able to earn £53,931,284 from that class of export in 1954.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would remind the House that increased veterinary knowledge and its application to the live stock of this country has resulted in saving about 100,000 calves a year where they used to die and which are now going out of this country at two and a half to <Col N="354" /> three years old at prices varying between £70 and £80 apiece.  That is not for one year, but year after year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Who started the scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that one of the first things I did when I came into office was to close down a Fianna Fáil factory, put a padlock on the door, sack the men and tell the proprietor that I would summon him if I caught him opening the door again.  Do you know what the factory was for? Slaughtering calves.  It was going full steam ahead the day I took office.  I was not in office a month until there was a padlock on the door.  A Fianna Fáil deputation asked me to reopen it. Was it not a mercy that I stuck to my decision to keep a padlock on the door? Does anybody deny that?  If they deny it I can give them the name of the factory and if they are still in doubt I will provide an escort to bring them down to have a look at it.  For the 17 gloomy years that Fianna Fáil was in office 80,000 calves died through slaughter or disease every year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>And a good proportion of them for the three years the Minister was in office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>How many die now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>A good proportion of them&mdash;possibly 60,000 or 70,000 a year while the Minister was there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If you look now at the return you will find that the average annual mortality of calves has dropped to between 10,000 and 12,000 and it is still going down.  It would be indelicate for me to claim too much credit for that but at least I can claim credit for putting a padlock on the calf factory and that was indicative of my general outlook on the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The output per person in agriculture has increased by 36.5 per cent. since 1940.  That indicates a substantial increase in productivity of those employed on the land.  The number of agricultural instructors in the country in 1938 was 41.  In 1948 it was 71, and to-day it is 140.  In addition, there are <Col N="355" /> 51 horticultural instructors and 79 poultry instructors.  There are 111 parish agents in the congested areas and, under the recently introduced parish plan to which I shall refer later, it is proposed to strengthen further these advisory services.</P>
    <P>A great deal of work is being done in soil sampling, calf breeding and grassland research.  Very valuable work is also being done in the veterinary field in the Department's veterinary research laboratory.  I do not think it is good policy for us to hide under a bushel the fruits of the exertions of our scientific workers which we are all too apt to do but I would invite Deputies to have regard to the recent work that was done for the control of white scour in calves.</P>
    <P>I think that Deputies coming from the creamery areas in Ireland will agree with me that substantial as was the contribution of the Department of Agriculture in the control of parasitical diseases such as stomach worm and fluke in cattle and live stock, the control of white scour amongst calves is very great indeed.  I think we ought to recall also that over the period from 1948 to 1954 we have it to tell that whereas in 1948 the land was in urgent need of limestone and there was not available in the whole of Ireland enough ground limestone to fill one eggcup, to-day there is available in this country from 49 separate plants sufficient ground limestone to provide everybody's requirements at 16/- a ton and less delivered to their gates wherever they may be.</P>
    <P>I think it is an interesting thing also to realise that the land project has already rehabilitated 440,000 acres of land, including the work done under section A, section B and the fertiliser section.  It is now employing in addition to those directly employed on the land a not inconsiderable number of industrial workers producing 20,000,000 pipes per annum which are required for the drainage operations of the land project.  Those pipes are now rapidly approaching the point at which they are equal in quality and price to <Col N="356" /> anything we can get from any other source.</P>
    <P>I think there may be certain statistical matter which may be of value to Deputies in the course of this debate which I now propose to give them.  I cannot offer the House any precisely accurate estimate of the crop position as of to-day and so the figures I am about to give to the House are given subject to the warning that they are as near as we can go to the facts from all the sources of information at our disposal.  These figures are very much approximation.  I am thinking of the lamentation expressed in this House last December when I was told that if I pursued my headlong career in regard to the price of wheat our people would be starving for the want of a slice of bread, that there would not be a perch of wheat grown from one end of the country to the other and that I was sponsoring a policy designed to wreck the whole programme of wheat growing in this country.</P>

Some of the racketeers who were growing 1,000 acres of wheat have their holdings up for sale and their passages booked to Biarritz and the faster they go and the further they go the better pleased this Government will be.  The tragedy is that they are leaving behind them hundreds of acres of conacre land that they tore up last year and planted in wheat and that they have abandoned this year and which nobody has gown down and which is, left after them, a desert.  Is it not a mercy of God that they are going or that they are gone and that we still have farmers left in this country who agree with me that there is enough profit in the guaranteed price for wheat this year to justify laying down from 370,000 to 400,000 acres under the crop?</P>

My advice to the farmers of this country is the same to-day as it has always been: if they want to get the maximum profit on their oat crop, instead of paying transport companies and divers others, dealers, millers, shopkeepers and others, to handle it and take their profit on it, they will be much wiser to walk those oats off their land by feeding it to their own live stock and getting out of it all the profit for themselves.</P>

      <P>The Deputy understands, I am talking of actual acreage sown under the crops, not acreage saved.  I am talking of the actual acreage sown under these crops.  I agree with the Deputy entirely.  I share his hope that we shall not have a harvest this year such as we had last year.  God grant that, if we have, the Deputy will have as efficient a Minister for Agriculture in office as he had last autumn.  He will remember that he was apprehensive that 50 per cent. of the wheat crop would be rejected as unmillable and I was able to reassure him, when the harvest was over, that only 3 per cent. had been rejected as unmillable and he will remember Deputy Corry expressing amazement at the performance of the Department of Agriculture.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Now, Sir, I want to turn to the parish plan.  The aim of the parish plan is to bring within the reach of any group of farmers in this country who want to establish a parish council and to have made available to them the services of a highly qualified agricultural advisory officer such a person on a request to the Department of Agriculture.  I am glad to observe that when the <i>Irish Times</i> suggested last February that the Fianna Fáil Party was opposed to this plan, the Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party, Deputy de Valera, lost no time in addressing a letter to the <i>Irish Times</i> on the 4th February, 1955, angrily repudiating any such suggestion and saying that Fianna Fáil strongly supported the parish plan but were deterred from putting it into operation because they were unable to recruit the personnel.  I know Deputy Walsh will be glad to hear that I immediately secured authority from the Government and the Minister for Finance to publish an advertisement seeking 20 parish agents with whom to initiate the plan and that I had the good fortune to receive 89 applications so that parish agents are at present being chosen and we may now hope to see the parish plan expanding and broadening in the years that lie ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to give this categorical assurance to the House: it is no part of my intention to thrust the service on any parishes that do not want it and no parish will get an agent if they do not ask for one.  But those that want it will have it made available in order that they shall have at their immediate disposal an expert to serve as their friend and adviser in any problem relating to the output of their land.  I am very glad to inform the <Col N="361" /> House that to date we have received applications for such assistance from almost every county and as soon as we can reach it we propose to make it available with such dispatch as we may be able.</P>
    <P>I would like to give the House now the latest information available in regard to the eradication of bovine T.B.  To date the progress in regard to this scheme has exceeded our most optimistic anticipations and in so far as our exertions are restricted they are restricted as a result of the difficulty of securing the services of trained veterinary staff.  I think most Deputies are familiar with the provisions of the scheme.  To date the number of applications received from County Glare, County Sligo and from Greater Bansha represent 33 per cent., 30 per cent., and 51 per cent., respectively, of all the herd owners in the areas.  The initial testing of herds by the private veterinary surgeons is proceeding rapidly month by month and each herd owner is aubsequently visited by a veterinary inspector from the Department of Agriculture to arrange the herd programme including, in most cases, the purchase of reactors and their removal for slaughter.</P>
    <P>The response by herd owners in the general areaa&mdash;meaning of course, the entire country&mdash;has been most enthusiastic and widespread, almost 16,000 applications having been received up to the 31st March, 1955.  The applications, while spread over the general areas as a whole, are particularly numerous from Counties Cork, Kerry, Galway and Mayo.  This extremely heavy response far exceeds the anticipated demand for the facilities available and creates an acute problem in regard to the arranging of herd programmes, etc., which it was intended would, as in the intensive areas, be dealt with by the Department's veterinary inspectors.  Valuable co-operation by the veterinary profession has, however, enabled this difficulty to be overcome for the present.</P>
    <P>It has been arranged that the private veterinary surgeons will advise herd owners on these matters and, pursuant to this arrangement, over 6,300 of the applicants in the general <Col N="362" /> areas have already received professional guidance and advice which should enable them effectively to deal with the eradication of the disease in their herds.  It is noteworthy that almost 95 per cent. of the herd owners in all areas who have so far had the preliminary test of their herds carried out&mdash;which is done without obligation on the part of the herd owner&mdash;have elected to participate in the scheme. Participants in the bovine T.B. eradication scheme are given priority in respect of applications under the farm buildings scheme.  Herd owners in the three intensive areas have been offered grants at double the existing rates under the farm buildings scheme. And this provision has now been extended to the participants in the bovine T.B. scheme in the general areas.  Participants in all areas in the bovine T.B. eradication scheme may now also obtain grants under the water supplies to farm dwellings scheme, so that they can have piped water supplies to their farmyards and farms.</P>
    <P>Now I should like to dwell for a moment on the land project.  As I have informed the House, to date 444,000 acres under sections A and B of the fertiliser scheme have been dealt with and when you realise that almost all of that area of land was producing less than 50 per cent. of what it was capable of producing before being dealt with, I do not think we have any reason to be ashamed of having begun the land project.  Great capital was made by certain people in its initial stage of the proportion of the total outlay involved in overhead expenses. I grant that that was a vulnerable line of attack, extremely difficult to repel in the early stages of the project.  I gave the reason for it and every reasonable Deputy in the House accepted it, but it was broadcast widely to misrepresent the matter. We started from nothing in 1949. We had to build up the whole machine and in the initial year there was relatively little work being done with the result that overheads amounted to 33? per cent. of the total outlay.</P>
    <P>We knew very well that as the work got under way the value of the work <Col N="363" /> being done would very rapidly catch up on the overhead expenses involved and I think Deputy Walsh will confirm that with every year that passed the proportion of overheads steadily declined and that it is now down to 15 per cent. of the total.  Deputies will find the matter dealt with in greater detail in the White Paper.  During the period of office of the previous Government certain upward limits were put on the expenditure that might be undertaken on any particular scheme. That resulted in a growing problem which rendered the use of machinery and the headquarters staff more and more uneconomic because so many proposals had to be turned down on the grounds that they exceeded the maximum permissible under the Order made by the Government, which had machinery travelling all over the place to find work which was susceptible of being irndertaken, and you had the ridiculous position that a large part of the staff's time was spent working out schemes for farmers only to discover, when the scheme was completed, that it exceeded the permissible maximum by £1 or £2 per acre, and all the work had gone for nothing and we simply had to tell the farmer it could not be undertaken at all.</P>
    <P>The Government, therefore, has consented, at my instance, to abolish that limitation and to provide that, where the amount of money involved is greater than the maximum laid down by our predecessors, the work can still be undertaken provided that, in respect of the excess above the maximum fixed by our predecessors, the applicant will pay 50 per cent. of the cost.  It is, however, provided that outlay on no acre of land will be undertaken at a sum of more than £60 without special reference to the Minister or to the director of the project.</P>
    <P>But there can arise cases where in the middle of a 40- or 50-acre scheme an acre or an acre and a half may be found which, were it standing alone, would not be touched, but which must be done in this particular case if all the rest of the land is to be done also; in such cases I believe it would be justifiable to spend a sum which, under ordinary circumstances, would be <Col N="364" /> regarded as excessive for the rehabilitation of the specific acre and in such cases I will have no hesitation in approving of such a scheme.</P>
    <P>Generally, however, it is my intention to press forward with the rehabilitation of every acre of land I can find that can be converted into productive arable land.  I would ask the House to remember that the project will undertake the reclamation of no land that cannot be converted into productive land, whether it costs 1/- or £40 per acre to do it.  I believe that where you can make productive land out of derelict land it is good business for this nation to put its hand to that work instead of sending those who might be employed on such work to Birmingham, Manchester or London to get employment there.</P>
    <P>Now there is another matter I want to mention, in passing, in relation to the land project.  I need hardly say I shall be happy to answer any detailed inquiry that may be put to me in the course of this debate.  In dealing with 444,000 acres of land when we started I anticipated that we would get bogged down in certain places, and make mistakes as we felt our way through this new departure.  I want to say now, having an opportunity of looking back over the first five or seven years during which this work has been in progress, that what astonished me is how few mistakes were made.  I want to tell the House that mistakes were made.  I would like to reassure Deputy Walsh, if anyone wants to draw down certain errors of judgment that may have been embarked upon during his period in office, by saying that, had I been in office, exactly the same errors of judgment would have been perpetrated and I would have stood over the officers who made those errors of judgment just as Deputy Walsh did.</P>
    <P>What astonishes me is, looking back over the work, considering the novelty of it and the possibility of getting drawn into a job which, when you are in it up to your neck proves to be very much more burdensome and difficult than any ordinary precedent would reasonably anticipate, how few such cases there were; what encourages me <Col N="365" /> is, wherever there has been such a case, and there have been very few, how carefully they have been noted and how consistently that experience has been used thereafter to ensure no similar mistakes will occur again.</P>
    <P>I issue this challenge because I know that Deputies will be anxious to give me help, help which will be very valuable to me as Minister for Agriculture: I anticipate that there will be Deputies here who can point out to me isolated instances where perhaps zeal outstripped discretion.  I challenge any Deputy to show me two similar cases where zeal, having outstripped discretion once, was allowed to do so in similar circumstances again.  Any enterprise which can make that boast is entitled to the credit of being described as a well-run enterprise that did not allow itself to be tied down by an excess of caution when there was important work to be done.</P>
    <P>Now let me turn to the question of artificial insemination, progeny testing and the breeding policy of the country generally.  I want to suggest to the House that here is the very key to the whole future of the agricultural economy of this country; and here is one of the few criticisms I want to make of Deputy Walsh's administration. During his three years we were in grave danger of losing that key.  I do not know what line of live-stock policy Deputy Walsh ultimately decided when he was Minister for Agriculture should be pursued here.  I heard him say, and I applauded him when he said it, that in his judgment the foundation of the live-stock and dairying industry here must be the steadily improving dual-purpose Shorthorn cow.  I agreed with him 100 per cent.  But, when I came to examine Ins performance while he was Minister for Agriculture, I cannot for the life of me see how he set about the implementation of that policy.</P>
    <P>Up to 1951 I maintained strenuously that, though I would restrict no farmer from doing what he himself thought best in his own interests, in so far as the Department of Agriculture provided artificial insemination, particularly where they were subsidising <Col N="366" /> them, we would seek to use the artificial insemination centres to bring special facilities to the door of the man who was breeding the dual-purpose Shorthorn cow which I regarded, and I understand my successor regarded, as the foundation of the whole live-stock industry here.  As far as I can discover, from 1961 to 1954 that whole line of policy was abandoned and one finds now in the artificial insemination centres Shorthorns, Friesians, Herefords, Aberdeen Angus. I could understand it if the Minister for Agriculture decided that in the special circumstances of a certain area a certain number of farmers urgently required Friesian bulls for their Friesian herds and in that way facilitated them.  I could understand him saying: &ldquo;Very well.  I will allow so many Friesian bulls in that artificial insemination centre provided it is clearly understood, that Friesian is used with Friesian and that there is not a kind of hybrid mongrel live stock bred out of the artificial insemination centres to a point where there would be no foundation stock, of any kind.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am sorry to say that, as far as I could see, the line has been irrevocably broken and one will find records now of a man coming this year with a Shorthorn cow and breeding her to a Friesian bull and coming back in three years' time&mdash;I would not mind if in three years' time the farmer said: &ldquo;I have made up my mind to turn over to Friesian and I will breed this hybrid heifer to a Friesian bull again and I will go on breeding all my cattle to Friesian bulls until I have ail Friesian cattle&rdquo;; that I could understand&mdash;with a hybrid Shorthorn Friesian heifer which he wants to bring now to a Hereford bull.  If that continues we will end up in this country with cattle that are neither Aberdeen Angus, Herefords, Shorthorn nor Friesian.</P>
    <P>I think that policy is wholly wrong. It is very easy to break the line but once you have broken the line it is very hard to get back again.  Once you have told everybody: &ldquo;It is free for all, let every man go in and breed his cattle whatever way he likes and the artificial insemination centres will co-operate&rdquo;, <Col N="367" /> it becomes extremely difficult to take up a new line and say: &ldquo;That must stop, and the artificial insemination centres will only breed Shorthorn with Shorthorn and Friesian with Friesian and where a man wants to turn over that he will be allowed to follow a steady policy of breeding his cattle with Friesian bulls continuously in order to effect a complete change of cattle on his holding.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not want to disguise from this House that I am very concerned about the tendency that is spreading throughout the country of forgetting any fundamental breeding policy and I would be very much obliged to Deputies for any measure of co-operation they can offer me in restoring to this country a breeding policy&mdash;not a particular breed of cattle because I cannot expect that we would all agree on one breed of cattle.  But I think that we should all agree on this: there is one breed of cattle to avoid and that is a mongrel breed.  We should all agree to exhort our friends, whatever their political views may be, that they ought devise some breeding policy for themselves and follow that consistently.</P>
    <P>In my judgment, it was never more evident than it is to-day that the whole future of the agricultural industry of this country is intimately bound up with the development of the dual-purpose Shorthorn cow.  That will vex some of us.  I do not want to restrict the liberty of anybody to do otherwise than he wants to do but I am trying to look at the country as a whole and I want to remind Deputies of what I said earlier, that the future of agricultural exports is fiercely competitive. Now, if we are going to produce butter in the future for sale on the export market we have got to produce it at the lowest possible penny and I am going to suggest to Deputies that if butter is to be produced at the lowest possible cost the only way in which it can be sold is to produce it from grass, growing, ensiled and in hay, and that the price of butter on the world market will not pay for the feeding of concentrates to cattle in the winter.  I <Col N="368" /> do not want to see butter produced in this country from a 1,200-gallon cow because a cow cannot give 1,200 gallons on grass, hay and silage.  You must feed such a cow concentrates if you are to keep her alive if she continues to give 1,200 gallons.</P>
    <P>What I would ask Deputies in this House is to realise that there are two entirely different milk economies in the world.  One is the milk economy of Great Britain which is the liquid milk economy.  No milk is produced in England for conversion into butter.  The guaranteed price in England is related to liquid milk and in a great industrial country like Great Britain they can decide to pay any price they like for milk.  But even in Great Britain they have paid so high a price for liquid milk that they now have a milk surplus. They are beginning to cut their losses-and the surplus is beginning to find its way into the chocolate crumb factories, with the result that our exports of chocolate crumb are beginning to dwindle.  We have to realise where you have farmers producing liquid milk for consumption in Dublin and in Cork or for sale anywhere in liquid form, their whole outlook on milk production will be fundamentally different from that of the man who is producing milk for conversion into butter and cheese.</P>
    <P>The man producing for liquid consumption is interested in maintaining equality of supply summer and winter to meet the demands of his customers, and at the prices he can get for liquid consumption milk he can afford to feed concentrates.  He can afford to mash his cows and, therefore, the higher the milk yield he can get out of milch cows probably the higher the profit he can get if he is in a position to get an outlet for his production.  But if a man has no outlet except the creameries and the milk has to be converted into butter and there is a surplus of butter over our own ability to consume&mdash;over 75O,OOO cwt. per annum &mdash;it has to be exported into competitive markets.  I submit to this House if we are to substitute an expansive dairy policy for a restrictive one we have to try to produce butter at prices that will secure a profit on the world market.  I know of no other <Col N="369" /> way to do that than through the medium of a cow that can produce milk to her maximum capacity from grass, growing, in hay or ensiled.</P>
    <P>I submit to the House that the type of cow that can do that is the Shorthorn cow whose annual lactation will be in order of 600 to 800 gallons.  That cow will have a calf which the farmer can sell to-day at anything from £10 to £15 within a week of its being born. Suppose a man gets £15 for a dropped calf: convert that into pence&mdash;is not that 3,600 pence?  Is not that equivalent to 4d. per gallon on an 800 gallon cow or 6d. per gallon on a 600 gallon cow?  Here you have a farmer who is catering for the most competitive international market in the world and our object is to get for him for every gallon out of that cow the maximum price we can&mdash;I do not care whether it is through the medium of butter or beef.  But if we can work out a cow that will pay through butter and through beef is not that a better cow if it requires no mash at all, because it will yield from growing grass and can be maintained in good condition through the winter on ensilage and hay?  Is not that a valuable cow in our economy?</P>
    <P>What will you do with an Ayrshire bull calf?  What will you do with a Jersey bull calf, or what will you do with a Friesian bull calf?  You will be living with the Friesian bull calf until you are sick looking at him before he is fit to sell for beef.  He will be as old as a bush before you can sell him, and he will be walking about and you will be looking at the landscape under his stomach&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If the Deputy were going to a fair in the morning to buy cattle to feed on his own grass would he search the fair to seek out the Aberdeen Angus or the Friesian bull calves?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well.  Nothing could be fairer than that.  But there are damn few Deputies in this House who, if they went to a fair and if there were six Aberdeen Angus there and six Friesian bullocks both of the same age and both at the same price, who would pick out the six Friesians and drive them home, and if anyone did, his wife would get him committed to the local lunatic asylum, and there would not be a voice raised in the parish to say her nay.  They would say it was high time that he was shifted somewhere or otherwise the poor woman would starve.  And the neighbours would be perfectly right.  I ask him to apply that simple test: If there are six Friesian bullocks there and six Aberdeen Angus Shorthorns, both the same age and the same price, is there any Deputy in this House who would take the six&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Who on earth ever milked a bullock?  What are we going to do if argument is reduced to this level?  This is fantastic.  However, I think Deputy Allen knows what I am talking about.  I want to say that I believe that, whether we like it or not, artificial insemination is going to become a regular feature of the live-stock industry of this country.  I know there are views strongly held about them, in favour of natural insemination and artificial insemination and I see a good deal of force in the view strongly sustaining the maintenance of natural insemination as against artificial insemination.  I do not believe, whatever views we may have, that it is possible to turn back the clock and I believe artificial insemination is going to become a feature of our live-stock industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, artificial insemination has a great danger in it because the potentiality of an individual bull that is passing on bad characteristics to its progeny becomes immensely magnified and therefore the precautions of progeny testing become infinitely more <Col N="371" /> important and more urgent than they are under conditions of natural insemination. But here is the difference. You will find two bodies of experts, equal in distinction, learning and experience, one of which will tell you that field progeny testing is the only method of value and the other which will tell you equally categorically that station progeny testing is the only one which will give you significant results. Therefore, where you have two bodies of experts, equally distinguished internationally, giving diametrically opposite views, it is extremely difficult for any Minister for Agriculture, whether Deputy Walsh or myself, to know what course he should take, particularly when the ultimate responsibility rests upon him for the consequence of whatever policy is decided upon.</P>
    <P>However, I can try to get the best advice I can, and then, decide. Accordingly, I have invited Dr. Hammond of Cambridge to come and give us the benefit of his advice in a consultative capacity and I am bound here and now, which I gladly do, to acknowledge the courtesy of the British Ministry of Agriculture in freeing Dr. Hammond from certain contractual obligations which he had in the British Department to come to us for a limited period in a consultative capacity in order to provide the best opinion I can get on progeny testing and artificial insemination so that in determining lines of policy at least I can say: &ldquo;I got the best advice I could before accepting the responsibility of taking final decisions&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>While I hope to fortify myself with such professional advice, I do sincerely say to Deputy Walsh, to all his colleagues and to my own colleagues on the benches behind me, that I would value their opinion on these problems relating to live-stock policy, progeny testing and artificial insemination. After all, there is in this House a very considerable reservoir of common sense and experience on which it is, a great advantage for any Minister for Agriculture to draw, provided the advice tendered is <i>bona fide</i> and <Col N="372" /> given in good part.  If it is I can assure Deputies, wherever they may sit, it will be received in a similar spirit and given just as careful consideration as advice arising from any other quarter.</P>
    <P>Let me say that I was never more convinced than I am to-day that the sheet anchor and foundation of the economic life of this country is intimately associated with the dual-purpose Shorthorn cow and that any short-term, illusory conviction that you are to measure the value of a breed of cattle exclusively by the volume of its annual lactation has in it the seeds of great possible disaster for this country. If that view had prevailed ten yeara ago and if the Minister of that time had accepted the advice then pressed upon him that we should abandon the Shorthorn breed and go over to Friesians and Jerseys&mdash;and remember that advice was pressed strongly ten or 15 years ago&mdash;where would we be to-day?  And we could have done that in 15 years, we could have turned over practically completely.  Where would we be to-day if we had turned over to Friesian and Jersey cattle?</P>
    <P>I invite Deputies who have the opportunity of doing this, to ask the agricultural authorities in Northern Ireland, who saw their farmers lured out of the Shorthorn breed into Ayrshires and Friesians by the artificial price for liquid milk in Northern Ireland, how they feel about that to-day.  Ask them what they are trying to do and I think you will find that in Northern Ireland to-day they are trying desperately to get back into the Shorthorn breed and they are going to have a very hard job to do so.</P>
    <P>I freely concede this, that by the prescience and wisdom of some of my predecessors, they withstood fierce pressure from many quarters to persuade them to jettison the Shorthorn cow and to turn over to Friesians and Jerseys.  If they had accepted the bad advice that was pressed upon them 15 years ago I want to tell you that, in my considered judgment, to-day this country would be close to bankruptcy. We would be faced with the obligation <Col N="373" /> of placing on our foreign trade savage restrictions which they are initiating in Australia, Denmark and elsewhere at the present time and we would have to forbid the public to purchase large ranges of imported commodities.  Do not forget that in Australia and Denmark they are having to do that now owing to exchange difficulties into which they are getting, and those are countries that are constantly held up to us.  I think I am right in saying that the same problem affects New Zealand.  This is one of the few countries left in the world in which our expanding exports, in volume and value, are financing practically unrestricted imports.</P>
    <P>I ask Deputies in this House to ask themselves: if to-day we had nothing but Friesians and Jerseys in this country, what would our export-import position be?  I would ask Deputy Walsh when he comes to speak on this to give us the benefit of his advice on what our future policy should be in regard to the live-stock industry.  I know what my own advice is.  I want to coerce nobody but I want to increase and multiply facilities for the farmer who will maintain sound, improving dual-purpose Shorthorn cattle in this country.  I want to leave the farmer whose special circumstances induce him to establish a herd of Frieaians, Jerseys or anything else&mdash; goats if he wants to&mdash;to do so, but I want there to be no illusion or doubt that any special facilities provided will bo primarily designed to help the man who in my opinion is serving not only his own personal interest but the long-term interest of the nation as a whole in preserving what we have in unique degree at the present time, a foundation stock of Shorthorn cattle.</P>
    <P>Let me add this.  It is impossible to say too much on this subject, for it is the very cornerstone of our future economy.  There are many people who say that it is the Aberdeen Angus or the Shorthorn or the Hereford bull that makes the Shorthorn-Aberdeen Angus cross or the Shorthorn-Hereford cross so valuable.  That is quite illusory and wrong.  Ask any experienced live-stock man is it not true that he has <Col N="374" /> seen his neighbours break themselves trying to fatten Aberdeen Angus cattle and you will find a surprising number of experienced old cattle men who will tell you that the people who bought pure bred Aberdeen Angus cattle in the belief that they were buying something twice as good as the first cross Shorthorn-Aberdeen Angus broke themselves trying to finish them but the man who buys the first cross with the hybrid vigour of the first cross Shorthorn-Aberdeen Angus in it, is the man who makes money.</P>
    <P>There are other parts of the country where the first cross Shorthorn-Hereford with the hybrid vigour of the first cross in it may be the best, but I would like the House to know this, that when we were negotiating the trade agreement in Great Britain one of the most experienced advisers of the British Ministry of Agriculture was one of the toughest persons with whom we had to deal and one of the toughest persons in putting up objections to the case we were making.  Subsequently that distinguished public servant retired from the British public service and came to live in Ireland and we were able to be of some service in finding him a suitable holding on which to retire and live amongst us.</P>
    <P>I remember very well his coming back to me in 1951 and expressing appreciation of the courtesy shown to him and he said: &ldquo;I would like to show some courtesy in return; you might have thought I was very tough in objecting when you were making your case&rdquo;.  I said: &ldquo;Not at all; far from it, I admired you for your tenacity and for the zeal with which you served the Minister whom you were charged to advise&rdquo;.  He said: &ldquo;I am now retired and want to express some appreciation of the courtesy shown to me here in Ireland and I will give you the best advice I can, having had 50 years' experience of the British meat market&rdquo;.  He said: &ldquo;Now in 1951 the bigger the beast and the heavier the beast, the better demand there will be for it in England; but a day is coming, Mr. Dillon, when the British housewife will recover her right to choose and when that day comes the man who will make the money is the <Col N="375" /> man who has Aberdeen Angus-Shorthorn crossed bullocks to sell on the British market&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That advice was given to me in 1951.  Was it not good advice?  Certain Deputies may remember my relaying that advice at that time and saying that the Aberdeen Angus-Shorthorn cross was the type of live stock that would pay when the British housewife recovered her right to choose.  Has not his advice proved right?  It was never more right than it is to-day and it will continue to be so for the next ten to 15 years.  I wish I were as sure of everything in connection with agriculture as I am sure of that and I would invite Deputy Walsh to join with me in laying down two general propositions&mdash;one, that there is no desire on any part of this House to coerce any individual farmer into doing anything contrary to his best Judgment, provided he does not injure his neighbours, and, two, from the point of view of the individual dairy farmer and the nation as a whole, the best proposition is the dual-purpose Shorthorn cow and that the first charge upon our progeny testing and artificial insemination resources should be steadily to improve the strain and quality of the foundation stock of Shorthorn cattle in this country.  If we are all agreed on these general propositions, we would make very real and valuable headway indeed in improving the economic structure of the nation as a whole.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter to which I would refer in these introductory remarks&mdash;I apologise if they have seemed unduly protracted, but this is a fascinating topic&mdash;it is the matter of soil testing.  I like to remember that in 1948 the total of soil samples tested was 4,547.  Deputies will not forget what an achievement that represented, because most of these soil samples were tested in the old medicine bottle, tied to the discarded bicycle wheel which was revolving on the fourpenny nail in the back room of Ballyhaise Agricultural College.  Some day we ought to erect a monument to the valiant 14-year old boy whose first employment in life was spinning the <Col N="376" /> discarded bicycle wheel with the medicine bottle attached to if, in the back room in Ballyhaise.  Some day, if I can find out who that fellow is and where he is, I will try and get the Government to give him a leather medal.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have the wheel.  I do not know if Deputy Walsh disposed of it.  I kept it as a national relic and I was going to send it to the museum to put it beside Deputy de Valera's boots, so that posterity might admire two relics of great value to the nation. However, in 1949 we graduated out of the bicycle wheel and 25,000 samples were tested.  In 1950, 50,000 were tested; in 1951, 72,000; in 1952, 67,000; in 1953, 100,000; and in 1954, 101,000.  I think few services have given better value for money than the soil-testing facilities which have been built up at Johnstown Castle.  I like to look back on the fact that we went forward boldly, at very considerable expense, in equipping these laboratories to be as good as any in Europe, that we have got abundant return from them to date and that we cap confidently look forward to getting increasing value from them with every year that passes.</P>
      <P>I want to express categorically my confident faith in the ability of the farmers of this country to carry the whole of our community on their backs &mdash;as they have done&mdash;if they were given the chance.  We have at our disposal 12,000,000 acres of the best land in the world and we have upon it as fine a body of farmers as is to be found in any country in the world.  The most precious quality they have is that they are independent and they are free, and they will not be coerced by anyone or anything into doing what they do not want to do.  They can be persuaded and they can be educated into getting from our land more than any other class of people in the world could get.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I like to recall that, at a recent meeting in Paris of the agricultural Ministers of Europe, one Minister mentioned, <Col N="377" /> in explanation of his failure to get some particular branch of agriculture developed as fast as he would have wished, that they in their country had the problem of certain farmers, small farmers, who did not like being pushed about.  I lost no time in replying to him and saying: &ldquo;My colleague, the Minister of so and so, should thank God he has in his country that most precious of all agricultural assets&mdash;a body of farmers who will not be pushed about.&rdquo;  We have plenty of them in Ireland and God grant we always may.</P>
    <P>I would ask Deputies of this House, when they are being told to compare conditions in this country or that country&mdash;I will not name them&mdash;when they are being told that the farmers of this country or that country are making much more money than the farmers here in Ireland to go and find out how the farmers are living in this country and that country and compare how they are living here.  If our farmers were prepared to bind their necks to the yoke of regulations which evoke the glorious monetary income that some of their competitors enjoy elsewhere they could earn just as much money but God forbid they ever would. I would sooner see them free and independent and retaining the right to take part of the reward in a leisure that farmers in other countries are never allowed to know.</P>
    <P>We can have too much leisure, but it is none the less true on the land of Ireland as it is everywhere else that all work and no play makes a dull boy. I would like to see plenty of work&mdash; and the work is there to be done&mdash;but I would like to see the people on the land guaranteed the same right to a decent life as the trade unionist, the shopkeeper, the banker, the doctor or barrister or anybody else.  It is the policy of the Department of Agriculture, so long as I am Minister for Agriculture, to ensure that they get it.</P>
    <P>We have a glorious opportunity before us.  There is only one possibility of that vast potentiality for an abundant life for all our people being frustrated and that is that our farmers should be persuaded that there is some <Col N="378" /> particular virtue in insisting on their right to continue producing at a price which nobody else in the world is prepared to pay.  If that becomes a kind of obsession with the farmers of this country, the future of this country is black indeed.  If, however, our farmers are prepared to face the future confident of their ability to meet competition from all quarters and to beat it, we can do it with the resources we have got and we can get out of the land with which God endowed this nation a higher standard of living for all our people than is enjoyed by any other agricultural country in the world.</P>
    <P>I agree most cordially that it is desirable that the fundamental principles of agricultural policy should be lifted out of and above the day-to-day desirable&mdash;I say deliberately &ldquo;desirable&rdquo;&mdash;cut and thrust of political debate.  I am not one of those who believe that the normal functioning of Parliament is a disedifying spectacle when men clash vigorously across the floor of this House and differ, and differ trenchantly, on matters that fall to be discussed and settled in this Parliament.  However, I would welcome it if we could arrive at an agreement on fundamentals.  I am bound to say that for the three years during which I sat in opposition to Deputy Walsh when he was Minister for Agriculture&mdash;while there were-many matters of detailed administration which I conceived it to be my duty to criticise and perhaps criticise trenchantly and repeatedly&mdash;I felt there was a certain residual fundamental policy, in certain branches of agriculture at least, about which we were in substantial agreement.</P>
    <P>I am not asking that this fundamental policy should be limited as my property or Deputy Walsh's property: what I hoped for was that it would become our common policy to which we would all be prepared to give a common allegiance, reserving to ourselves the right energetically to criticise the administration on details of policy in general, as is our duty in a democratic Parliament.  At the very apex of that common structure of policy I would place the Shorthorn cow.  I would dare to say the future <Col N="379" /> of this country is closely associated with the Shorthorn cow.  If we make of it the best that can be made, and use our land to provide the raw material of all our exports in the agricultural sphere, we have a fine future before us.  If, however, we recoil from that challenge and accept the doctrine that it is a legitimate aspiration to produce from our land what our own domestic market will consume, and no more, so certain as we are in this House to-day we will lose not only our sovereignty but our independence as a nation.</P>
    <P>Nothing sustains and nourishes the sovereign independence of Ireland but the land.  If that ceases to prosper, Ireland's independence will perish with it.  Do not forget that the economy of Newfoundland, one of the oldest nations in the Commonwealth of Nations, was founded on the sea and the harvest of the sea and that she forgot that.  She allowed that harvest to dwindle while she turned her mind to other things.  When she awoke from those illusions and discovered that her economy was no longer virile because she forgot the natural harvest with which God endowed her, she became the ward in chancery of the British Treasury for the duration of the war and, at the conclusion, was told to opt not for sovereignty and independence on the one hand or servitude on the other but that now there were left only two options to her&mdash;permanent existence as a crown colony of the British Crown or incorporation into the Federation of Canada.  She chose the latter.  She had a natural colonial affinity with that great Dominion and found in it a new freedom as an integral part of a young Federation.</P>
    <P>Where will Ireland find so suitable a home?  We are older than the oldest of them.  Our independence was venerable seven centuries ago and this generation have got it back again, by the exertion of those who went before &mdash;the founders of this State.  It is possible for this generation to throw away, through economic folly, what it took seven centuries to recover.  Remember, that victory can never be reproduced in the new world in which we live.  It <Col N="380" /> is on our shoulders to determine whether we make good on the confident sacrifice of those who went before us and it is on our decision and on our actions that the issue of history will depend.  I put it to this House that it is on agriculture that the future of this country depends.  I am proud to have the responsibility for agriculture and I urgently bespeak the collaooration of Deputies from every side of this House in establishing the agricultural industry on a sound foundation.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration.</P>
      <P>I put down this motion for the purpose of having a much wider discussion than is usual on Estimates in respect of which there is no motion to refer back.  We have been treated this evening to one of the gloomiest and most pessimistic speeches that has ever come from a ministerial bench.  The Minister prefaced his remarks by talking about our rainfalls, implying that there was. nothing to be produced in this country. but grass, and further implying that the only way in which agriculture could be carried on was by producing beef for a foreign market.  The speech we have listened to was an admission of failure.  It made no provision for disposing of the surpluses that were handed over to the Coalition Government in June of last year.  There was a surplus in milk; there was a surplus in cattle; there was a surplus in pigs and bacon; and there was a surplus in wheat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>In other words, agriculture, as we know it&mdash;the form of agriculture which is most suited to this country, mixed farming&mdash;had its surpluses and the Minister has confessed that he was unable to deal with the problem that had arisen.</P>
      <P>Let us divide agriculture into the different groups and categories into which it should be grouped.  There are dairying, livestock production, tillage and poultry.  When you cover these, you cover most of agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="381" /> Let me take dairying first.  The Minister states that there is no future for dairying, that there is no prospect of finding a market for dairy products. The Minister agreed to subsidise the export of butter this year, the surplus of butter that was handed to him by the Fianna Fáil Government.  In subsidising butter.  I wonder did it ever occur to the Minister that he was subsidising the wrong dairy product.</P>
    <P>There was another dairy product that might have shown a better return had he subsidised it.  I refer now to the chocolate crumb which might not have cost the Minister as much money and still would have disposed of the milk surplus in the creameries.  I do not know the exact sum of money he received for butter, but I do know that it must have cost from 2½d. to 3d. per gallon on the export market, and I know that if a subsidy of 1½d. were given on milk going into chocolate crumb, that chocolate crumb could be sold in the free market.</P>
    <P>The price of chocolate crumb on the free market last year was £158 per ton. The difference between the English and the Irish price was £6 10s. per ton. One penny per gallon is £3 per ton of chocolate crumb and 2d. per gallon would have enabled him to get into the English market.  Not merely would it have made it possible for him to go into the English market with his chocolate crumb, but it would have encouraged those engaged in the production of chocolate crumb to produce more.  There is, for instance, one of our producers producing chocolate crumb at £165 per ton.  It would have encouraged other manufacturers of chocolate crumb to avail of the free market that was there and it would have cost the State less to subsidise chocolate crumb than to subsidise butter.  It was a mistake; it was bad administration.</P>
    <P>Again, we left office last year on 2nd June.  In May, we had a quantity of butter, foreign butter, in store here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister had not to get rid of it.  That butter had been <Col N="382" /> disposed of and the Minister was never able to get the same price for Irish butter as we got for the foreign butter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What did you get for the foreign butter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>We got 411/- per cwt. for it.  We had a profit out of it, even after storing it, and the market in July for Irish butter, or any butter for that matter, was better than it has been since.  Why did the Minister not avail of the May production and sell it in the July market?  It would not be necessary for him then to go to the Exchequer to get money to subsidise butter.  It cost from 9d. to 10d. a 1b., I understand, to pay the foreigner to eat our butter.  We need not have given him any butter.  We could have given him another dairy product that would have paid the Irish farmer equally well and would have maintained the price of butter.  That is not a question of policy&mdash;it is a question of administration.</P>
      <P>While I am on the subject of milk, let me for a few minutes talk about milk costings.  When we gave an increase in the price of milk away back in 1951, the Minister's attitude was that we were great fellows for doing it and he paid tribute to us for increasing milk by 1d. per gallon, but thought that we did not go far enough. What is the Minister's attitude to-day, so far as the dairy farmer is concerned? His attitude is one of denying him the right to know how much it is costing him to produce a gallon of milk.  He is denying him that right.  There was a staff working on milk costings for the past two and a half years.  That staff has been reduced.  By whom? Who reduced that staff?  The Minister took away the men who were working on it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister asked for it?  The people of this country are producing milk at the same price as that at which they were producing it two years ago.  It is now two years since the price of milk was fixed, but they are still waiting for that report. When that report is presented it will give an indication of how the dairying industry is getting on, and what policy should be followed.</P>
      <P>We have listened to the Minister talking about Shorthorn cows.  There is another cow.  There is a volume of opinion in this country that favours the Friesian cow.  The great majority, I admit, favour the Shorthorn cow. But when we are dealing with various items, we must know where we are going.  We must establish, once and for all, which is the better type of cow for our purpose, if that can be done. There must be somebody who can tell the Minister that I had that in mind. There is a farm at Grange where this experiment can be carried out.  Take the two classes, Friesian and Shorthorn. We could get the value of the milk at the end of 12 months, and the value of the calves.  If they are steers, we could get the value of them then. You could then give a direction to the people of this councry and say: &ldquo;Here, is the Shorthorn cow's production of milk, value so much, feeding so much in order to produce this amount of money.  Here, on the other hand, is its progeny.  Here is a steer; it costs so much to feed him; he was valued at so much at the end of 12 months, at the end of two years or three years, at current, market prices.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then you can get up on any platform or in this House and say to the people of this country: &ldquo;A Shorthorn or <Col N="385" /> Friesian is the only solution, the only cow that we should have&rdquo;.  But until we have done that there is no use in getting up and making a statement agitating for the dual Shorthorn, when another person gets up and talks about the Friesian.  There are people who will tell you about the Friesian&mdash;as a matter of fact it did happen at one time at meat sales that the Friesian had won first prize for the best quality meat.  That happened, I think, two years ago in England, in competition with Aberdeen Angus, Shorthorns, and Herefords.  So, while you have people who are prepared to produce that evidence, there is no use in any person standing up here and saying: &ldquo;This type of animal or that is a better one for this country&rdquo;.  We mast prove these things, and it is only when they arc proved that you can go ahead.</P>
    <P>Grange farm is the ideal place to prove it.  I had it in mind&mdash;in fact, there was a certain sum ot money put down for progeny testing.  That was the scheme I had in mind, that, we could go ahead with these tests, and be able to say to the people: &ldquo;Here is the line we must follow&rdquo;.  I think the Minister would be very well advised if he would go ahead with that scheme even at the present time.</P>
    <P>This evening the Minister went to great trouble in trying to establish the condition of affairs here which he would like, I am sure, to claim as being correct&mdash;that there has been, for instance, a general improvement in auriculture since 1948.  I regret to say that is not true.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh!</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not true, and the statistics prove it.  There is no difficulty in proving it, even in his own White Paper.  If you examine the figures in the statistics of the cattle population it shows that we were on the downward trend in June of 1951, as compared with June of 1950.  I deprecate the use of these figures.  If the Minister had not used them I would not have used them, but he wanted to establish that a general upward trend started in 1948, and continued through all the years down to 1954.  That is not correct.  There was a decline in <Col N="386" /> one year.  In 1950 the total number of milch cows was 1,208,508.  In 1951 that number was reduced to 1,189,380.  That is not really significant, because for the past 100 years there has been a fluctuation in the number of cows.</P>
      <P>What is significant, and where the real danger lies, is the reduction in the number of calves and animals under 12 months.  In 1950, we had 982,866, but by 1951 the number of calves and animals was lower than in 1950, when it was 977,150.  That is the significant point, that we were on the downward trend in the number of cattle.  I disregard the numbers of two- and three-year-old animals.  If you refer to the figures for 1952, there was still a further reduction in the number of young cattle.  In that year they were down to 927,000, a reduction of 50,000, a reflection of what was happening from 1949 and into 1951.  It was only in 1953 that we began to pick up, when the number increased from 927,000 to 998,000.</P>
      <P>Similarly, if you refer to the number of pigs, you will find that there was a reduction from 1950 to 1951.  There had been already a reduction from 1949 to 1950.  In 1953, under the heading of sows for breeding, the number had gone up by over 20,000.  These are the things that matter, the significant things.</P>
      <P>What was the trend at that time? At that time, in 1951, the trend was downwards.  We had already lost over 500,000 acres of tillage from 1948.  From the statistics, you will find that we were not able to recover.  In 1952, there was a slight recovery in tillage, and it was not until 1953-1954 that we had the great expansion of which the Minister now talks and compares it with the figures for 1948.  The Minister said that what he would say to the House, and to the people of this country, would be the truth, and nothing but the truth, but the Minister should distinguish between what is truthful, as far as he is concerned, and what is not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to the 1948 agreement.  The 1948 agreement has nothing whatever to do with the high prices which we are getting for our live stock to-day.  What is responsible for <Col N="387" /> the high prices to-day is the arrangement that was made in 1954 regarding the entry of our cattle into the British market.</P>
    <P>In the 1948 Agreement it was a question of bulk purchase.  The British Ministry of Food, acting on behalf of the British Government, bought all the food that was going into England, and distributed it.  Naturally, they dealt with the Governments of the countries from which they were buying at that time.  Our Government representatives met, and concluded an agreement with them which obtained until derationing took place in England.  Derationing took place in England on the 6th of July last.  From then on our cattle and sheep went into a free market.  The arrangements made by Deputy Lemass and myself with the British Minister in March and April of last year enabled our cattle to go into that free market without let or hindrance to fetch the same price as the British farmer was getting for his cattle.  It has not been claimed by Fianna Fáil that they were responsible for this, that or the other thing Deputy Flanagan, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture, went down the country and stated: &ldquo;The present Government were responsible for the present cattle prices.&rdquo;  This is absolutely false.</P>
    <P>Let us have a look at the pig situation. What is the prospect for pork in the future?  Does the Minister suggest that the farmers should continue to produce pigs at 214/- per cwt. and pay £24 10s. for pollard, £26 for bran and £30 for milo maize.  Were we to do the things the Coalition Government did we would be shouted out of the country.  At the time we left office the price of pigs was 252/- per cwt. The price of maize was £27.  From August, 1953, until March, 1954, there were reductions in pig prices.  There were reductions in the price of bacon and pork.  Consequently, there was a reduction in the price of pigs, but for every reduction that took place during that period there was a corresponding reduction in the price of feeding stuffs.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding that reduction, the farmer who produced the pig was able <Col N="388" /> to make a profit and there was a tidy sum of money left in the barley fund. The Minister for Agriculture has not yet told us what he did with that fund. It was there to subsidise the price of barley or reduce the price of feeding stuffs.  Was it used for the purpose of providing a price for barley?  No, it was not.  It would have enabled Grain Importers to pay a price of 48/- per barrel or thereabouts but the Minister fixed a price of £2.  He could have reduced the price of feeding stuffs by £1 a ton.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a good profit for the pig producer who was still getting 252/- a cwt. for his pigs.  What happened the price of pollard?  It went up £5 per ton.  The price of straight maize to-day is £33.  The farmer has to take 214/- a cwt. for his pigs.  Would anyone believe that in a short period of 11 months such a thing would happen in this country?  Would anyone believe that in such a short period the farming community would be taken out of the safe and secure position they were in?  We know that the British producer is now almost in a position to supply most of the pork that is needed in Britain.  We know that he has been developing bacon and pork production.  We know that we have made no provision to compete with him.  The provision we made was to give as far as possible a ration of food that would enable us to produce a pig that would possibly compete in the course of time with the Danish landrace.</P>
      <P>The custom in the past has been to feed our pigs on potatoes and maize, particularly in the West of Ireland. Maize and potatoes produced a heavy, soft, oily, fat bacon.  Nobody wants that bacon to-day.  The best judge of bacon is the housewife and there is no housewife in this city or in any city or town in the country, or even on the farms, who is prepared to go in and buy heavy, fat bacon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I was Minister for Agriculture I could appreciate the idea that we should by the education of our people <Col N="389" />&mdash;not by coercion&mdash;get them to produce a better quality bacon.  We proceeded to set up a scheme to enable that to be done.  There was a time when the price of straight maize was £7 a ton higher in the West of Ireland than the price of barley.  In other words, the western farmer was prepared to pay £7 a ton more for his maize than he was for barley.</P>
    <P>It was very hard to wean the people away from the old system that operated in the West of Ireland and possibly in many other parts of the country as well where great quantities of maize were used for the feeding of pigs and poultry, but it was necessary to wean them off if we were to hold our own in any, market and if we were to produce a bacon that was suitable for the home and foreign market.  The home market and not the foreign market is the largest for bacon.  Our people are consuming more bacon now than ever before&mdash;possibly two-thirds the number of pigs going to our factories.</P>
    <P>There was no use continuing to produce that heavy, fat bacon we were accustomed to producing.  Consequently, I introduced a scheme whereby barley and maize would go together.  I wanted to make the feeders barley-minded so that they could see the value of feeding barley by producing a better quality bacon.  That scheme has been abandoned.  The Minister has permitted the sale of straight maize.  We are getting back into the old groove of producing the heavy fat, oily bacon for which there will not be a purchaser or a market.</P>
    <P>Is it any wonder, therefore, that the price of our bacon is being cut on the British market; that we are not able to get into the first-grade category? Our pork and bacon is not of the first quality.  It is not because we have not the pigs.  We have the pigs to produce that first quality.  The whole trouble is in the feeding of our pigs.  The sooner the Minister follows the example that was there for him and gets our people to produce a better quality bacon by using better quality food the sooner will we be able to get into the good foreign markets.  Until then, we will continue to be kept out of these good markets.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="390" /> Before I left office I made a submission to the Government to devote money from the National Development Fund for the purpose of setting up progeny testing stations.  I have no doubt in my mind at all about the large white York pig.  I do not believe it is in any way inferior to the Danish landrace.  As a matter of fact, I saw a result of an experiment on the two types of pig in Denmark.  That experiment established that the large white was as good as the landrace.  The experiment was not completed but as far as it went, there was no difference.  The balance was in favour of the large white.</P>
    <P>We have established in this country that we have a large white as good as the landrace; we have a large white pig here with 16 ribs; we have a large white here with an equally good distribution of lean on the shoulder as the Danish landrace, with an equally good distribution of fat and lean on the bellies as the Danish landrace but our trouble is that we are unable to put our finger on him; he is going to the factory.  My contention is that we should get that pig.  We should be able to trace him and get it back and get the sows into the progeny testing stations and have progeny testing carried out.</P>
    <P>The Minister has set up a progeny testing station at Ballyhaise.  He has invited in the pedigree breeders.  The pedigree breeders are all right.  I have nothing to say to them.  But we must remember that the large white York is a pedigree pig in every sense in this country now.  There has been nothing else used for the past 20 years.  They are as purebred as any pig you will find in any of the pedigree pig producers' houses.  The only difference is that it has been produced in Ireland and most of the boars in the other case may have been produced in England. There is no difference as far as the breed is concerned.</P>
    <P>In our breed we have 16-rib pigs, better distribution because most of the pigs that are bred by the pedigree pig producers are show pigs whereas the best place for our pig to be shown is on the table and it is not the pig which gets first prize at a show <Col N="391" /> that will get first prize from the housewife.</P>
    <P>We should concentrate in our progeny testing stations on getting in that pig and progeny testing that pig and producing bacon that we will be able to sell in competition with the Danes and the Dutch on the British market.</P>
    <P>In criticising the Minister's policy or the Government's policy I must refer to the price of wheat.  The Minister's policy as outlined this evening is a policy of grass.  There was no room for anything else in the country.  There was no hope for tillage.  There was no hope for milk.  There was no hope for pigs or bacon production.  The only solution he had was to produce more beef and send it to England.  The Minister may believe in that policy.  I do not.  I believe in the policy of sending beef to England but I do not agree with the manner in which the Minister states it should be produced.</P>
    <P>If we are going to send beef to England we can send it for the 12 months round but, first of all, we have to increase our live-stock population&mdash; the number of cows.  That gives rise to a question.  If you increase the number of cows, what are you going to do with the surplus of milk products? The Minister says he cannot dispose of them, that he tried one method and that it was a failure, that he lost money to the Exchequer in doing it. He failed to get a market that was at his door for chocolate crumb.  He has confessed failure as far as that is concerned.</P>
    <P>The other method is that of producing beef from tillage.  I will deal with that matter later.  Tillage, in this country, must have a basis of income for the farmer.  There must be some crop at least for which be is guaranteed a price.  Wheat is the natural crop to guarantee.  The production of wheat or its cost of production has no effect on other agricultural products. It does not matter what is paid for wheat, it does not affect the price that you get for beef, milk, mutton or bacon.  It is consumed only by human beings.  You can subsidise it for that <Col N="392" /> purpose.  You can guarantee a price to the farmer.  The farmer must have some guarantee that if he ploughs a field he will get a price for what he grows there.  Wheat is the only crop that you can guarantee.  It is wise policy to guarantee wheat.  That has been proved over the years.  It was proved from 1932 to 1939.  It was proved during the war period that if we had not our own wheat there was no possibility of getting wheat from outside.  Having regard to present world conditions, is it wise policy to drive the people away from wheat?</P>
    <P>The Minister was very vocal this evening about the slight reduction there was in the acreage under wheat this year.  There is a substantial reduction. I hope the figures given by the Minister will not be like the figures he gave on a motion here last November when he was asked about the unmillable wheat in the country.  However, it was wrong policy to cut the price of wheat because there is no market for malting barley outside.  If we are unable or unwilling to produce more beer, stout and whiskey than we are producing at the present time, that market is limited to about 120,000 acres.  Sufficient barley can be produced from that acreage to supply all the needs of our maltsters, distillers and brewers.  Regarding the market for feeding barley here we are up against the same problem as exists in the case of wheat.</P>
    <P>The Minister's slogan is buy in the cheapest and sell in the dearest.  How can we sell in the dearest market if we do not buy in the cheapest?  That is his theory.  It is a good theory but, unfortunately, it cannot be altogether applied to this country.  If the Minister is serious in guaranteeing to the farmer the price that he has already stater he was prepared to guarantee, that is, £2 per barrel for feeding barley, is he buying in the cheapest?  Is it not possible for him to go to Iraq and buy feeding barley at £23 per ton?  If our Irish farmer is providing conditions for grinding it would cost at least £24.</P>

      <P>It is so to the extent that the subsidy is being taken away from the farmer.  The farmer is going to lose 12/6 per barrel in the coming year.  The farmer is the sufferer because the Minister is prepared to subsidise feeding barley for animals and he is not prepared to subsidise wheat.  Which is the more important? Which was the more important in 1939-46, animal food or human food? Is it not far more important to see that the wheat growers of this country are encouraged to grow more wheat?  Is it not far more important from every point of view?  If grain growing is to be subsidised is it not wheat that must and should be subsidised?  But the Minister next year is prepared to subsidise barley to be fed to animals.</P>

But he did not know what they lost or at least if he did he did not tell the people or tell this House.  The Minister came into this House and said that the total quantity of unmillable wheat produced in this country last year was in the neighbourhood of 3 per cent. of the total.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Wheat rejected as unmillable was 3 per cent.  That was not the total quantity of unmillable wheat.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>We will accept any statement the Minister makes or any excuse he may give.  Last year we grew 486,000 acres of wheat and the Department's estimate was one ton per acre, so that we had 488,000 tons&mdash;the average per acre, as a matter of fact, was 1.1 ton.  I put a question to the Taoiseach some time ago asking tot this information and he gave it to me. On the same date I asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce the quantity of wheat purchased by the millers and their agents this year and he gave me a figure.  His figure was 393,000 tons.</P>
      <P>Now, if the Department's estimate as given by the Taoiseach was correct at 488,000 tons and only 393,000 tons reached the mills up to the 12th March last, I wonder what became of the other 95,000 tons of miUable wheat.  To where did it disappear?  Nobody heard of its leaving the country.  I have not heard of it, but the Minister did say when making his introductory speech this evening that it was his duty to be truthful to the people and to the House.  Was he truthful when he said only 3 per cent. of the wheat was rejected, when he must have known at the time that up to 20 per cent. had been rejected?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come from a good wheat-growing country myself.  I have a fairly good idea of what was rejected, and my area was no worse than any other area <Col N="395" /> throughout the country.  If the Minister is going to be truthful to the people of the country and to this House he must not try to deceive, but I say it wag deception to come into the House and through it to tell the people of the country that only 3 per cent. of the wheat was rejected. Another matter I should like to raise is the question of loans.  The Minister has now transferred his responsibility for the issuing of loans for machinery, and for fertilisers I presume, to the Agricultural Credit Corporation.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows as well as I do how difficult it is to get money from these people.  We had the Dungarvan experience.  The Minister knows very well that this transfer of the responsibility for the issuing of loans to the Agricultural Credit Corporation is tantamount to saying to the farmers of the country: &ldquo;You are not going to get any money.&rdquo;  It would be far more decent if the Minister had said: &ldquo;We are going to abolish loans for machinery.&rdquo;  It was reported in the Press that only a sum of £28,000 was issued by the Department of Agriculture last year under this scheme.  I do not know who is responsible for such a statement, but I read it in one of the papers.  It was also suggested, I think this time by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture, that this was not a departmental scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O. Flanagan Mr. O. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no such statement made by me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>For the information of the House let me quote from the scheme of loans for the purchase of agricultural implements and machinery, which reads:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The Minister for Agriculture (hereinafter referred to as the Minister) is prepared to consider applications from persons engaged in agricultural production for loans for the purchase of agricultural implements and machinery (including milking machines) costing over £40 each.  Application for a loan must-be made on Form 245 (b).  (Loans for the purchase of agricultural implements <Col N="396" /> and machinery costing up to £40 each may be obtained under scheme No. 18, particulars of which may be obtained from the Department.) The maximum loan under this scheme shall not exceed £1,000. Loans will not be granted for the purchase of imported machines and implements if home manufactured machines and implements of the same type are available, nor will loans be given for the purchase of secondhand machines and implements. The applicant for a loan (hereinafter referred to as the applicant) shall forward to the offices of the Department, with the application, the vendor's quotation for the supply of the implement and/or machinery to be purchased, together with one-eighth of the price of the implement and/or machinery and the necessary legal fees (see clause II) in connection with the agreement and guarantee referred to in Clause 6 of this scheme.  In the case of every application approved by the Minister&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Mark you, &ldquo;approved by the Minister&rdquo;. So it was actually a Department scheme which had no connection whatever with the Agricultural Credit Corporation only in so far as the Agricultural Credit Corporation acted as the agent.  That was the only connection that the Agricultural Credit Corporation had with this scheme.  The Minister and Deputies on all sides of the House know how difficult it is to obtain money from that organisation; they are so conservative that there is no possibility of their advancing over £1.  Why, a letter of approval from them would be a passport to any bank in the country.  If you once got through the Agricultural Credit Corporation you could get all the money you need in any bank in the country. The criticism I have to make is that the Government set out to mislead the people in connection with these loans. The suggestion was that it was going to be made easier for them to deal with the Agricultural Credit Corporation. It was also suggested that in the past no such sums were paid out by the Department of Agriculture. Now last year there was a sum of over <Col N="397" /> £300,000 paid out for the purchase of agricultural machinery.  In 1953-54, the exact sum was £327,797 paid under that scheme alone.</P>
    <P>There was another scheme.  As we all know, not a quarter enough lime and fertilisers are being used.  Possibly there are many reasons for their non-use.  One reason is that the farmers may not be educated as to their value.  Another reason may be that the farmers cannot afford to invest money in lime and fertilisers. Now, last year, I introduced a scheme &mdash;I admit it was introduced rather late in the month of February&mdash;to help people who were anxious to use fertilisers, who could not get credit and had not the cash to pay for them.  I hoped at the time that scheme would become a permanent feature of our agricultural policy.  I think the present Minister is wrong in not making the scheme a permanent one.</P>
    <P>The scheme should start in the month of November.  There is an abatement in every month from September up to February and the fanner could get the benefit of that abatement.  He could also get the trade discount and save 10/- or 12/- per ton on the price of his fertilisers.  He could repay the loan at the end of the harvest or at the end of the milk season the following year.  It would be a short term loan, and it would guarantee more widespread use of lime and fertilisers and we would, in time, reap the benefit in getting good dividends from the land.</P>
    <P>I think it was foolish of the Minister to hand that scheme over to the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  That in tantamount to putting it into a dead hand.  On that scheme alone last year £60,000 was advanced.  Probably more would have been advanced had the scheme started earlier in the previous November.</P>
    <P>There is then the replacement of stock scheme.  I take it that also will be handed ovor to the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  Three schemes have been handed over.  That is bad policy because it is tantamount to telling the people that they will not get any more money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if that is good policy.  Is it good policy to offer unlimited grants to people?  I think £30 per acre was a princely gift to any farmer to reclaim his land.  It was a very generous offer from the State.  If we are to have no limitation on the amount of money for land reclamation I do not know where we will get to in the end.  I can see one thing happening straightaway.  I can see the price per acre going up.  It is bound to go up <Col N="399" /> under the B scheme.  I have seen land that might be regarded as marginal being reclaimed; at first there was objection because it was said it would cost too much and no contractors would undertake it.  When we refused to give way the contractors came to the conclusion that they could still earn money and they went in and did the land.  I think it is wrong for the Minister to take the ceiling off the £30 per acre.</P>
      <P>With the best will in the world his officials, particularly his field officials, may not estimate enough because they may not be able to get the work done on their estimates once the contractor knows there is no limitation to the amount that will be spent.  That places the farmer who wants his land reclaimed in a very invidious position because he will have to go to the contractor and make a private deal. That has happened before and it will happen again, particularly now that there is no limitation.  The amount of marginal land left as a result of contractors not being able to go in and do the work at £42 10s. per acre&mdash;that is, £30 grant and £12 10s. from the farmer&mdash;is very very small.  Any farmer who has three or four acres which might not be done if there was a limitation on the amount of money could easily leave that three or four acres out and the profit he receives of £10, £15 or £20 should enable him to spend a little more on the three or four acres himself.  Under the A scheme he could get a grant for the reclamation of those three or four acres.  It is bad policy to take the ceiling off the £30.</P>

    <P>I am glad the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary have forgotten the grievance they voiced against me when I suggested the land reclamation machinery should be disposed of and sold to contractors.  The Minister must have lost a handful of hair that evening because he was so vexed at my attitude in disposing of the machinery. Now apparently he is perfectly satisfied we did a good job of work in disposing of it.  Since its disposal, more land has been reclaimed at a cheaper rate than was reclaimed when the <Col N="400" /> Department was responsible for it.  It is obvious now to everybody that it was the right and proper thing to dispose of the machinery and get the work done by contractors.  That has saved money because the people who purchased the machinery were prepared to work harder and for longer hours to earn a livelihood and, possibly, were prepared also to do with a little less profit.</P>
    <P>Land reclamation under that scheme made progress.  Last year we did 100,000 acres.  I think something like 77,000 acres were done under the A scheme and almost 24,000 under the B scheme.  The Minister did say that he had reclaimed 101,000 last year&mdash;I am not too sure that he gave us the figure but I thought he mentioned 101,000 for something.  However, as far as I know, it has been going pretty well, but I did criticise the Minister when he brought in his Supplementary Estimate and said that he was short and that he was not able to spend the £123,000. If I did that when I was Minister for Agriculture I would be told I was wrecking the scheme if I did not spend the £123,000.  I am not going to accuse the Minister of that.  It was too great a pet of his for the Minister to come along and wreck it.  He would like to boost it as much as he could and he would not deliberately try to wreck it. But the Minister made the excuse that we had very bad weather in the autumn and winter and consequently he was not able to do the amount of work that would use up all the money.</P>
    <P>I could have had as an excuse last year that when we were selling the machinery from January until March it was idle for about three months because it was not used once it was advertised and did no further work. But we succeeded in spending all the money that was there and in fact we could have spent a little more.  If the Minister does 100,000 acres every year on the £2,400,000 as he said, he will be doing a good job and I will not be the one who will criticise him.  I am very glad that I was right in what I did and that I now have the Minister's approval for the sale of the machinery in 1953.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister knows very well it is doing a better job of work now than it could ever do under the direction of the Department of Agriculture.</P>
      <P>The Minister has mentioned the parish plan which he is going to introduce. I am glad the Minister is able to get the personnel to implement the parish plan.  I was never opposed to it.  Peculiarly enough&mdash;the Minister may not know it&mdash;but not merely was there a three-parish plan but there is a creamery in County Cork where I sanctioned the appointment of one man for a parish, and was very pleased to do so because I think it was an experiment we should carry out in this country; to have the people of such bodies as co-operative societies get together and get in their own man to do the advisory work they will save the State money.  What I do object to in the parish plan is that direction is coming direct from the Department of Agriculture without any reference to the county committees of agriculture.</P>
      <P>Why did the Minister embark on that departure?  What is the reason for it?  Is it true that the county committees of agriculture are not giving satisfaction?  Is that the reason why the Minister will not trust them with his parish plan?  The people on the county committees of agriculture are as anxious as anybody else is to get all the services they can.  They want to benefit by all the technical services that can be given in every county but it is the system and the principle that is involved that is being objected to. That is the real objection at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It cannot be said that I in any way withheld technical services from the people during my time.  I encouraged them in every possible way I could te employ more people and the reason that more could not be employed was that they were not there.  There was a certain number coming out of the universities each year&mdash;I think about 14 or 15 graduated in one particular year.  Now that an improvement has taken place we will have more in the future.  I remember some five or six <Col N="402" /> years ago how two agricultural scholarships went a-begging in my own county for two years because no one was there to take them up, the reason being that parents were not sending their children into the agricultural schools or advising them to do agricultural subjects in the universities on the scholarships.</P>
    <P>That attitude has changed now to a great extent over the past three or four years and we will have the personnel.  I think it will be available by 1956 or 1957.  We will have a sufficient number of graduates to provide one to three parishes.  Until such time as that we will not have sufficient to send them round.  I think one committee is pretty well catered for already, that is, Carlow.  I think they must have nearly one for each four parishes, if not for three.</P>
    <P>There is no objection and I saw no objection and Fianna Fáil saw no objection to this plan which would enable counties to get as much technical service as it was possible to give.  My belief is that one man to 1,000 if it were possible would be sufficient.  I think that is the number they have in Boherbue in County Cork. The great objection I have to the parish plan as envisaged by the Minister is that the control is now taken away from the committees of agriculture and vested in the Department of Agriculture solely and the direction comes from the Department down to their employees in the counties directing them what services they are to render.  If the employees were under the control of the committees of agriculture they would take instructions from the committees of agriculture and would be paid half the amount of their salaries by the committees, and in that way would be employees of theirs.</P>
    <P>A scheme that I have not heard anything about and to which the Minister made no reference in his statement is the demonstration plots scheme.  In 1953 the Government permitted me to use a certain sum of money to demonstrate the use of fertilisers and lime&mdash; I think it was something in the neighbourhood of about £35,000.  Unless that scheme was continued, very little value <Col N="403" /> would be derived from the expenditure of that £35,000.  The Minister has not stated whether these plots are to be continued or not.</P>
    <P>Another matter that was not dealt with at all was the provision of grain storage.  The Minister has talked about the acreage of oats and the acreage of barley for next year, but I do not know who is going to buy it. The Minister has mentioned for instance the oatmeal millers.  They are fat buyers&mdash;20,000 tons out of a possible 560,000 tons would be sufficient to keep these people quiet; 20,000 tons would be ample for all the oatmeal millers in the country.  Where are the other buyers or what other market is to be found and what provision has the other market made to dry and store this oats when it is sold?  Does the Minister realise&mdash;I am sure he does&mdash; that all the cereal crops to a very large extent at the present time are cash crops?</P>
    <P>The Minister has a policy which is a good one, but very difficult to put in practice and that is to walk the barley and oats off the farm.  All farmers cannot do that.  We must have regard to the farmers living in the tillage areas where there is no tradition of beef or anything like that.  Provision must be made for them to dispose of their corn crops.  There are no prices, no markets, no provision for storage or drying that I have heard of at the present time. The same thing applies to a very great extent in regard to barley.  Barley will be produced this year to a greater extent than last year.  Has the Minister made any provision for this barley to be dried and stored?  Who is going to bear the expense, and will it be borne by the feeders or the producers?  I understand the price suggested by the Minister already is about £2 per barrel, but if the farmer does not find a market at harvest time it will cost about £4 or £4 10s. to store and dry and pay the other incidental expenses attached to storage from then until the following March or April.  Who is going to bear that cost?  Will it be borne by the pig feeder and the poultry producer or the person who is producing <Col N="404" /> milk and beef?  These are things which we would like to know.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Whoever disposed of it, it was there.  The Minister can tap any files he likes.  I will tap the files and produce the figures as far as I was concerned.  I had them up to 31st May regarding that same scheme.  But I would like to know from the Minister-what provision is to be made in that connection.  Is the farmer who produces feeding barley this year and wants to dispose of it in September or October, sure now that he will find a market straightaway for his barley? Can the Minister guarantee that a market will be readily available for that feeding barley on the day the farmer threshes?  It is very easy for the Minister to talk about the oatmeal millers.  It is great propaganda when he goes down the country; when he is speaking to the people who do not know how much oats the oatmeal millers need.  You can deceive them for a while until they go to sell their oats next year.  But I am telling the <Col N="405" /> people now the quantity of oats the oatmeal millers need.  They will be doing very well if they buy 20,000 tons although we will have something like 560,000 tons.</P>
      <P>The same thing applies to barley. In 1953 when I introduced a scheme to ourchase barley we purchased 45,000 tons in that year at a price of 48/- per barrel and we were able to sell barley and maize at £27 a ton to the pig feeder; we were able to store the 45,000 tons all during the winter and pay the people for storing it.  And the pig feeder was able to make a profit out of that barley that was purchased at 48/-.  What guarantee has he now that he will make a profit even at the £2 if he buys that barley?  There is no guarantee that he will.</P>
      <P>That 45,000 tons of barley was finished some time in May and when some Deputy asked a question in this House as to why we were importing barley I said it was in order to keep the people barley-minded but these people opposite did not understand the position.  Now I believe they understand, when the American maize is purchased and we have the bacon going into the British market to be rejected and sold at lower prices.  I call that Just bad administration, nothing else.</P>
      <P>The Minister has stated that the 1951 Pig Agreement with Britain expires next year.  What provision is he making for our people to hold their place in the British market when that agreement expires.  Is it going to be a free for all then, among the Dutch, the British, the Danes and ourselves t I am speaking the truth&mdash;and it is not. to please or displease people I speak the truth; while I was on those benches over there I always spoke the truth&mdash;when I tell the Minister and the people that unless a change takes place and greater regard is had to the quality of bacon we are producing, then it is not priced out of the British market we shall be but driven out of it.  I had adopted the system that, in time, would have educated the people to hold our place in that market by producing a better quality bacon.  The Minister has discarded it.</P>

      <P>We imported barley for that purpose.  This evening the Minister stood up and said we would not have to import barley in future and we would not have to import oats in future.  I would like to tell the Minister that so far as malting barley was concerned, during my term of office not one pound of malting barley and not one pound of feeding oats came into the country, although the Minister and many of the Deputies sitting on the benches behind him have gone around the country telling the people we imported barley and oats.  There was no malting barley and no feeding oats imported in that period.  There was a quantity of seed oats and a quantity of feeding barley imported.  I suggest to the Minister now that he would be far better employed importing barley than milo maize.  Milo maize is inferior in quality to River Plate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. O'Donnell) Patrick O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. O'Donnell)</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly it is right that, in view of the amount of discussion we had on the section, I should explain it in detail to the House and I propose to do so.</P>
      <P>Section 61 of the Local Government Act, 1925, placed a responsibility on the chief executive officer of every local authority to advise the members before they voted on any resolution to do any act in consequence of which an illegal payment would be made or a loss or deficiency in the funds of the local authority was likely to arise.  The names of the members who voted for the resolution, were recorded in the minutes.  The purpose of this section was to protect the members of the local authority by requiring the chief executive officer to give warning whenever the council were considering some proposal which, if adopted, might result in a surcharge or charge.  If the warning were not given the council as a body might subsequently be surcharged or charged.  When, notwithstanding a warning given under the section, the council adopt the proposal the names of the members voting for the proposal are recorded in the minutes and these members and no other member are liable, in the event of a surcharge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the law dealing with audits the auditor is required to surcharge a person making or authorising any payment which he deems to be illegal.  He must also charge any member or officer with the amount of any loss or deficiency which he deems to have been caused by that person's negligence or misconduct.  Where an objection is made under Section 61 of the Local Government Act, 1925, or under Section 16 of this Bill it does not necessarily follow that the auditor will make a surcharge or charge.  The auditor may, notwithstanding the objection made, consider that the payment that arises was not illegal or that no loss was suffered by the local authority.  Even where a surcharge or charge has been made it does not follow that the person surcharged or charged must meet the <Col N="409" /> amount involved.  He has the right to appeal either to the courts or to the Minister to test the validity and the equity of the auditor's decision and to have the amount involved remitted.</P>
    <P>In Section 61 of the Local Government Act, 1925, the term &ldquo;responsible officer&rdquo; is defined as meaning the secretary, clerk, resident medical superintendent, or other chief executive officer of such local authority. This definition was all right in the pre-management period.  It must now be brought into line with the management code under which the manager is the chief executive officer of the local authority.  This is done in subsection (1) which places responsibility for objecting on the manager or in his absence such other officer as may be designated by him.</P>
    <P>During the discussion on this section there was a good deal of confusion with Section 4 which provides that the members of the local authority may require a manager to do any particular act, matter or thing which can lawfully be done and for which the money is or has been provided.  It has been argued that Section 16 nullifies Section 4.  I think it was Deputy Blaney who suggested that on the last evening here.  This argument is not correct.  A requisition under Section 4 docs not apply to acts which are unlawful. It applies only to lawful acts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Why is it in Section 16, at all, then?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Deputy was not listening.  A requisition to do an unlawful act does not, however, necessarily involve an illegal payment. For instance, the council could requisition a manager to close a road to traffic without complying with the necessary statutory formalities.  The manager need not comply because to do so would be unlawful.  No payment is, however, involved and no surcharge or charge could arise.  On the other hand, an act which is lawful could give rise to a surcharge or charge.  For example, a manager could be directed to accept a tender other than the lowest submitted.  I quoted that <Col N="410" /> example the last night.  It is perfectly lawful to accept a tender other than the lowest and the manager would have to comply with the requisition under Section 4.  The auditor might, however, consider that the acceptance of a tender other than the lowest involved the local authority in a loss or deficiency, and he might feel he should make a charge.</P>
      <P>There was also some confusion arising out of the use of the word &ldquo;deficiency.&rdquo;  The words &ldquo;deficiency or loss&rdquo; come from the statutes dealing with audits and their meaning has been judicially defined time and time again.  A deficiency in the funds of a local authority arises where a sum of money has not been brought into account&mdash;for example where a sum due to the local authority by a person is remitted without sufficient reason.  It would seem that some Deputies confused this word &ldquo;deficiency&rdquo; as used in Section 16 with insufficiency of funds to provide for the carrying out of a work which was the subject of a requisition under Section 4.  Under Section 11 the manager cannot exceed the amount provided in the estimates for a particular purpose unless the local authority authorises the proposed excess expenditure.  The provision of funds is a matter solely for the elected members and has no relevancy whatsoever to Section 16.</P>
      <P>Reference was also made to the practice of local authorities of inserting in an advertisement inviting tenders a clause to the effect that the local authority will not be bound to accept the lowest or any tender.  While an invitation to tender and the submission of a tender does not constitute a contract nevertheless in order to avoid controversy and to prevent litigation, public bodies usually consider it desirable to make it clear to contractors that they are not bound to accept any tender; that they may decide to carry out the work otherwise than by contract or that they may accept any tender other than the lowest when they consider it desirable to do so, for example, because they are not satisfied as to the competency of a particular tenderer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is necessary to stress that the <Col N="411" /> question of warning does not arise where a local authority are proposing lawful expenditure outside the provision made in the estimates, e.g., the repairing of a road the repair of which was not included in the road works scheme.  Once a work requisitioned by the members is a work that can lawfully be carried out and the council provide the money (by authorising the expenditure) the manager must carry out the work.  If, however, he considered that there was a cheaper way of doing the work he should warn the members and Section 16 would then operate.  I think I have made the matter very clear.  Under Section 4 the council may requisition&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The stupidity of the Minister or of myself does not arise on this Bill.  Last Thursday the Minister mads the lamest explanation it was possible to make about the provisions <Col N="413" /> of this section and what it applied to. &ldquo;Deficiency in funds.&rdquo;  How does deficiency in funds arise?  Deficiency in funds may arise under any particular heading of a local authority.  Money may run out or what was provided may already have been allocated to a particular service.  The county manager, the secretary of the council, the county engineer, the chief medical officer, and so forth, could get up and tell the council that such and such would create a deficiency in funds.  Personally, I do not see any advantage, so far as the law stands at the moment, in Section 4.  The Minister put it in the Bill and he is claiming for it that, under Section 4, the council are getting certain powers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Brennan described it as the principal section of the whole Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>However Deputy Brennan, or the Minister, or myself, or any other Deputy may interpret something here that does not make it law.  Judges and justices and auditors interpret the law.  The Minister and every member of a local authority knows well that the auditors are past masters at interpreting every line of the law.  When they want to catch out members of a council or a manager or any official they can do so, without a doubt.  The auditors the Minister sends down to the local authority are the best versed set of officials in this country in every line of the law.</P>
      <P>In my view Section 16 of this Bill is a most reactionary section and I should be surprised if the House would accept such a section.  The Minister said at the beginning that he would leave the question of whether or not the section should stand to a free vote. I have no doubt but that he will do so.  Section 16 begins:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where a proposal is made at a meeting of a local authority to do or to effect any act, matter or thing&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  which constitutes a reserved function or is mentioned in a resolution <Col N="414" /> under Section 4 of this Act, and&rdquo;</P>
    <P>(b)  in consequence of which an illegal payment is to be made out of the funds of the local authority, or a deficiency or loss is likely to result in or to such funds,&rdquo;</P>
    <P>They have, maybe, these reserved functions &ldquo;in consequence of which an illegal payment is to be made.&rdquo;  It is a reserved function.  The council have a right, in law, to make that a reserved function.  I am sure all the reserved functions are legal and, as they are legal functions, the council have a right to perform them; we assume that. &ldquo;... Where a proposal, which con stitutes a reserved function, is made in consequence of which a deficiency or loss is likely to result in or to such funds...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The members of local authorities are adults.  The number of illegalities they have committed in the past 25 years is, I am sure the records of the Department of Local Government will show the Minister, taking them by and large, one and all, very low.  They have consistently worked within the law, whatever the law may have been.  They have committed very few illegalities in their time.  If a local authority have any functions whatsoever, and the reserved functions set out in the Management Act that the local authorities have a right to perform&mdash;if they have a right to perform, in law they do not become illegal because a local authority set out to perform them.  I do not mean to be disrespectful when I say that if any tinpot officer of a local authority objects to performing any of these functions&mdash;if the county engineer, the medical officer, the accountant, the manager or secretary, and so forth, stands up and says: &ldquo;It will create a deficiency in funds. You cannot perform that function&rdquo;&mdash;I think no self-respecting member of the local authority would ever seek reelection. Members of local authorities have proved to be just as responsible as members of Dáil Éireann, in performing their functions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so, but we find here a Minister who claims to be a super democrat, who is giving to the local authorities more powers than they had for the past dozen years&mdash; he proposes to give them more powers under Section 4&mdash;and who then says in Section 16: &ldquo;Gentlemen, be careful. If you do anything under Section 4 that any officer does not like you to do, you may be surcharged and may have to pay.&rdquo;  There is no power in law, I want to contend, for a local authority to make any payment under the County Management Act.  Section 21 of the County Management Act, 1940 sets out:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The county manager for a county may, by order signed by him and countersigned by the nominated officer or, where there is more than one such officer, the appropriate nominated officer for such county, authorises the making of any payment out of the funds of the council of such county in respect of any expense or on account of any liability incurred by such council or by such county manager for such council in the exercise or performance by such council or such county manager (as the case may be) of any of the <Col N="416" /> powers, functions or duties of such council which are exercisable or performable by them or him (as the case may be) under this Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>No officer of any council, where there is a county manager, can make any payment.  No council can force a manager to make any payment which he considers illegal.  They have nothing whatever to do with any payment. They cannot accept a tender and cannot compel a manager to take any tender.  They may consider tenders and give their views to the manager on them and may do as the standing orders set out.  Under the 1948 Act, they were entitled to do the same thing, to consider tenders, but we know the standard rules which came down from Local Government which enabled these councils to receive tenders, to look at them and to hand them over to the county manager.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 29 of that Act, the reactionary Act which gave no powers to local authorities at all and under which the Labour Party believed &mdash;I suppose, honestly, as they did not know better&mdash;no powers were given at all, that very reactionary Act which took all the powers from local authorities, states:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any council of a county or any elective body, at a meeting especially summoned for the purpose under this Section, may by resolution proposed and passed in accordance with this section, require any particular act, matter or thing specifically mentioned <Col N="417" /> in such resolution and which such council or the county manager for such county or such elective body or the manager for such elective body (as the case may be) can lawfully do, to be done in exercise or performance of the executive functions of such council or body.</P>
    <P>The very same power is in Section 4 of this Bill.  There was a more involved procedure in regard to the number of members of the council necessary to pass it, the number of days' notice to be given and so on, but the very same powers are in Section 4 of this Bill. There was, however, no Section 16 in the 1940 Act and the manager at the moment carries all the responsibility in the matter, if he makes a wrong payment.  An effort is being made in this Bill to unload that responsibility on to the local authority.  That is the difference between the 1940 Act and this Bill which is supposed to be far more democratic and enlightened than the 1940 Act for which Fianna Fáil were responsible.</P>

There was nothing so reactionary in it, but there is a proposal in this Bill by the Minister to saddle the responsibility on local authorities and to make them liable to surcharge.  I think that is a reactionary suggestion and one which the Minister should reconsider.  I ask him at this stage if he is prepared to withdraw the section and redraft it for Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has put up one argument on this by which he hopes to carry it out, namely, that county councils might compel a manager to accept a tender which might cause a loss in the funds.  I would put something else to the Minister in relation to this section.  The Minister's contention is that, if this section is passed, the members themselves can be surcharged.  We spent a long time here a few weeks ago thrashing out the appointment of rate collectors.  We have a scheme in Cork under which we pass on vacant rate collectors' areas to the office for collection and we save about 3d. in the £ thereby, but if we should decide at any time, still exercising our rights and functions, after this section is passed, to take one of these areas out of the office again and appoint a rate collector for it, the Minister can come down on us under the section, if his contention is correct.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>We will see how you vote for this.  If it would cost about 3d. in the £ to collect the rates by rate collectors, we might decide for one reason or another that we would do it by this method.  We would be within our rights in doing it.  Under the section the manager can say: &ldquo;Well, that is going to create a deficiency in the funds.  It is going to cost more to collect the rates than it does at present.  It would not be the lowest tender for collecting the rates, and, therefore, I am getting a list of those who vote for or against the motion, for the purpose of surcharge&rdquo;.  But if there is any substance in the Minister's argument in regard to tenders, it is equally good in regard to this.  Therefore, I see no justification for this section.  I think it is taking away whatever power we are supposed to have under Section 4.</P>

      <P>I must confess that <Col N="420" /> when we were discussing this previously I had a certain amount of suspicion about the section, but having listened to Deputy Corry, I am not too sure that the section is not perfectly right.  Deputy Corry suggested a hypothetical case which might happen in Cork, and he said that under this section the members of the Cork County Council might be surcharged. On the hypothetical case he suggested, I think they should, if, regardless of the fact that rates in Cork could be collected more cheaply through the office of the county council, some members decide to appoint rate collectors.  They must be doing it for some reason other than economy, and I think it is perfectly right they should be surcharged.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased to hear the views expressed by Deputy Sheldon because I hold exactly the same views.  I would be more than amazed if, after the result of the local elections, when Deputy Corry found his Party in a majority, he would come in here and say: &ldquo;No, we will have rate collectors this time.  It would only be right&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer to the question of illegal payments.  I have noticed, and other members of a local body have noticed, that when an engineer recommended a certain sum to be paid for a house offered to the council, members proposed, in spite of his recommendation, that more should be given to the owner of that house.  We know that there have been occasions when, unfortunately, the manager, in accepting the recommendations of the members, bought a white elephant. Deputy Corry knows that.  If there is a provision in this section to prevent such a thing happening, then I say it is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Allen spent a lot of time in pointing out various things which could arise.  I believe that it would be only rarely where such a situation as I have referred to would arise.  Deputy Corry knows, and other members of a county council know, that recently there was a question of a surcharge recommended by an auditor.  I presume, notwithstanding the inclusion of this section, <Col N="421" /> that members, if they were so named as having voted on a particular issue, would equally have the right of appealing against the recommendation of the local government auditor, either to the Minister or to the courts, if necessary. Surely, as members of local authorities, if we are prepared to take a certain stand, if we recommend a certain payment, we should be prepared to face up to it.  Surely no one here, who is a member of a local authority, is going to suggest that members would make recommendations for payment if it were not just.  That is my opinion of the section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">

    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I am giving examples from everyday life.  Take the example of where under present circumstances a local authority has been saddled with paying more money for houses than they were worth.  The engineer pointed it out but, unfortunately, because the manager accepted the views of the members, the result was that the purchase turned out to be a white elephant.</P>

      <P>I am concerned with what is going to happen local authorities; otherwise I am not interested. I am not concerned with Donegal, but I want to make sure that everything will be above board in Cork.  Whether it is a matter of purchasing houses by a local authority, or any other thing, the question of illegal payments might arise only once in 20 or 30 years.  If it should happen, say, once in 20 years, is it not right that we should have that safeguard?  After all, we want as large a power as possible in local authorities, <Col N="422" /> and with that power must go responsibility. It ill becomes any of us in this House to say that the powers must be ours, but not the responsibilities. If we want to adopt that attitude, then I believe we are drifting a little away from the true sense of democracy in local government.  Even if a situation of which I have spoken arose only in 20, 30 or 40 years, it is only fair and just that the responsibility is placed on the members to see that what is right and what is just will be done, and nothing else.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>When we were dealing with the section on the last occasion, a point which I felt should be made, and which I thought was not made too clearly, was that no matter what act was performed by the elected representatives of the council, as I understand it at the moment, such an act must be countersigned by the manager. In the last analysis, the manager must give his signature to the performance of any particular act, no matter what is involved&mdash;expenditure, or the administration of the local authority.  If that is true&mdash;and I believe it to be true&mdash;why the necessity for this section at all?  Despite all the talk just now as to why we should have it, candidly, I did not hear anything that made me believe we should have it any more than I heard the other night. Since the manager is there, he must countersign every item or an officer appointed by him must do so before it is really performed.  Where is the necessity for this section at all?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why not let such a matter as is referred to under Section 16 come to the manager who in the exercise of his own powers and functions would be in a position to say he could not go ahead with this function because it was illegal?  The council can compel the manager to do a lawful act but I fail to see where they are empowered to compel the manager to do an unlawful act.  In that event the next thing is that we would have the council saying this must be done and the manager saying he would not do it.  The logical thing is to send the matter to the Department of Local Government for a decision as to whether or not it should be done.  I fail to see what <Col N="423" /> danger there is in wiping out Section 16 altogether.</P>
    <P>We have the manager between the council and before the council at all times.  No matter what they decide to do the manager must give it his O.K. before it is done.  Is not that the proper safeguard?  If the manager is, in fact, the manager of the council or of the local authority he should have the last say in the matter.  At the moment he has that.  Having the last say, he ought to exercise it and let the matter go to the Minister for his decision in the last analysis.  I cannot understand people, particularly people from the Labour and other benches, talking about Section 16 and the necessity for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I see a much more serious aspect in regard to Section 16. A proposal&mdash;it may be a very necessary one&mdash;may be made by a member or members of a local authority.  It may be an issue on which the council are equally divided.  At some crucial stage during the discussion on this proposal an officer of the local authority, the manager or his designated officer for the purpose of that meeting may object and say: &ldquo;Look, if you vote for this proposal it will be an illegal spending of the council's moneys and you will be likely to be surcharged&rdquo;.  If that should happen I feel that in any local authority you will not get the majority of the members, even though they might think otherwise, to vote for that proposal in view of that objection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I see the matter now, the manager is being given directly or indirectly a veto on every matter that could possibly be put before the council by any member of the council, thereby taking away from the local <Col N="424" /> authority any power they ever had. We will not be able to do anything in the future by reason of the fact that we may have a manager saying it is illegal.  A simple remedy is to let the proposal go through and if the manager refuses to sign the order giving effect to the proposal the council should direct that it be sent to the Minister who ought to decide as to whether or not it is illegal.  Having got that decision&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We do not have a legal adviser sitting with us in the council.  The cost is enough already to have one sitting outside the council.  That is not the point.  Why should we make provision for giving them more money and prevent us spending money on something we ought to do in the county?  Surely it would be better to spend money in the county than give it to legal advisers?  You have competent people in the Department of Local Government to advise the Minister.  I am not too sure that the Minister or the Bill gives us anything.</P>

      <P>Ask the Minister about that.  There is a long story to it. Section 16, as I see it, takes from us any benefits, if there are any benefits in the Bill, that were conferred on us. Any extra authority that may have been given to us under this Bill is completely nullified by Section 16. Section 16, I contend, is absolutely unnecessary because of the circumstances I have quoted.  I would ask the Minister again seriously to consider this matter because I do not think that Section 16 is really worth rowing about from his point of view because it is unnecessary.</P>

On the question of illegality, surely it is provided in the Bill that disputes would go to the Minister?

Can anyone who is on a local authority visualise the position that a manager wantonly&mdash;because that is the suggestion&mdash;obstructs a council by telling them that what they are proposing to do will be illegal and that they may be surcharged?  Wantonly is the point because, if it is right, he is right to do so.  It is only if it is wrong that there is going to be any trouble.</P>

What county manager or city manager will behave in that way?  I admit there is a good debating point in Section 16, but in plain fact what will happen in ordinary life?  There is not tuppence worth in it.  Deputy Blaney knows it and so does Deputy Briscoe.  It is a good debating point but everyone knows perfectly well that county managers and city managers are not going to be so foolish as wantonly to tell the council that something will be illegal which can be demonstrated not to be illegal.  They never will keep their jobs on that basis and that is the best safeguard.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to prolong the debate.  I think it can all be boiled down to one particular point in relation to what Deputy Sheldon has mentioned, and I hoped that he would say it.  Should a manager, whether he <Col N="427" /> is a city manager or the county manager, say it is illegal under this particular Section, 16, surely the very fact that Section 4 states that members have the right to requisition that a particular thing be done, taking for instance, the local authority to which I belong, means that the first thing Deputy Corry and the other members of the local authority would do would be to use our right under Section 4 to ask him to prove it.  We are entitled to do that under Section 4.  We are entitled to ask him to do a particular thing.  Deputy Briscoe and Deputy Blaney may wish to make a laugh of it.  I am giving credit to Deputy Corry, knowing him as I do on the local authority.  If we were convinced that a certain line proposed by us was legal and if the manager should say to us that it was illegal, then Section 4 would give us the right to demand of him to show that it was illegal.  The onus must be put on the manager to prove that he is right in directing us that the act was illegal. If it is illegal we have no right to do it, and should not do it.  If it is not illegal we have the right to do it.  Why worry and talk as some Deputies are talking here to-night?</P>

      <P>I cannot understand that people who for so many years have been condemning the powers given to the managers under the County Management Act should be so loud in upholding that Act here to-day in supporting a clause which, as Deputy Blaney has said, nullifies anything that is being given in the Bill to elected representatives.  The phrase &ldquo;if they do something that is illegal&rdquo; has been used.  It is not merely that. If my interpretation of Section 16 is correct, if the elected representatives do anything which will cause a deficiency in funds, the manager may, by simply objecting to their doing it, have <Col N="428" /> them surcharged afterwards.  I would like to be contradicted if that is wrong.</P>
      <P>I can visualise a position where members of a local authority, seeing that a certain road needed attention, requested the county manager to have £1,000 spent on that road to put it into repair.  The county manager or the county engineer or any official designated can point out that that will cause a deficiency in funds and the members who supported the motion may be surcharged.  If I am wrong, I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to contradict me.  In other words, it is giving the elected representatives something with one hand and taking it from them with the other.</P>
      <P>Section 16 completely nullifies anything given under Section 4.  Not merely does it do that but it gives to the county manager the big stick to hold over the elected representatives and the power to say: &ldquo;If you dare command me to do anything, I have a means by which you will pay dearly for doing it.&rdquo;  It is entirely contrary to what the people on the other side of the House have preached since the County Management Act came into force.  It is showing no confidence whatever in the elected representatives and absolute confidence in the manager. That is my interpretation of Section 16 which is held to be as necessary as Deputy Desmond has pointed out.  It does not entrust the doing of anything under this Bill to the men who will be elected by the people without having a section to save them from themselves.</P>
      <P>The people who have been calling out for years for more power for the elected representatives now tell us that they must be saved, they must be brought under the manager's big stick in case they would spend money that he could not veto or have the last word in agreeing to it.</P>
      <P>The Minister may tell us that he is giving us what we asked for.  For that matter, we did not ask for anything. We were administering the County Management Act for all it was worth.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that some of the Deputies who have spoken on this section have not read it and have tried to take part in the debate on it purely on debating points.  I say emphatically, that this is the most vital section of the whole Bill. A great deal of it is eyewash. A great deal of it is window-dressing, but you have in Section 16 here a control superimposed by the authority of the Custom House, on the manager and the local authority.  Now, you have the control of the manager over the elected representatives. Deputy Desmond says that Section 4 is the safeguard we are concerned about and that if the manager wishes to do something under Section 16 to which the local representatives object, Section 4 safeguards them.  The position, Sir, is quite the reverse, and I would ask Deputy Desmond to read it again.  Section 16 takes away from the local representatives all that is purported to be given them under Section 4.  I say that with all the emphasis I can possibly give it.</P>
      <P>Section 4 is a pious expression once you associate it with Section 16.  Does Deputy Desmond or does Deputy Sheldon, who has entered into this debate with a certain sense of humour, not realise the seriousness of it? Section 16 starts off in sub-section (1) as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Where a proposal is made at a meeting of a local authority to do or effect any act, matter or thing:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  which constitutes a reserved function or is mentioned in a resolution under Section 4 of this Act, and</P>
      <P>(b)  in consequence of which an illegal payment is to be made out of the funds of the local authority, or a deficiency or loss is likely to result in or to such funds,</P>
      <P>the manager (or, in his absence, such other officer as may be designated by the manager) shall object and state the grounds of his objection,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="431" /> Now, under Section 4, it is quite lawful and legal for the representatives to decide to do something or anything.  If it is, as Deputy Brennan says, their opinion that a certain road is in an unfit condition and should be repaired at a cost of say £1,000 and if they are prepared to strike the particular portion of the rate involved to do that job, that particular lawful decision becomes unlawful and illegal if and when, under Section 16, the engineer or manager says it is not necessary and holds it is not necessary.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sheldon waves his head and says &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  We had both Deputy Sheldon and Deputy Desmond grasping on to the illustration given by Deputy Corry as one of the effective reasons which they are taking to vote for the section.  I agree Deputy Corry was not so far wrong.  Supposing a local authority decides that they are going to employ a certain number of additional members of the staff for a particular purpose, whether it is new or whether it is a continuation of some other operation, and the manager does not want to do it, it immediately becomes an illegal decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps not, but perhaps Deputy Sheldon might come to us and give us the benefit of his vast experience.  Under Section 4, if the local elected representatives decided to do something which involved expenditure or an increased expenditure, <Col N="432" /> what happens?  The manager, or, in his absence, such other officer as may be designated by the manager, shall object and state the grounds of his objection, and if a decision is taken on his proposal, and so on.  This does not limit the manager to making objections to anything.  This is an over-all control.  I say again that you have at the present moment a control over a local authority.  Now you are going further to extend a control so that you will have more firm control by the manager over the council and the councillors.  What is meant by &ldquo;if the manager objects&rdquo;?  Objects to what?  He can object to anything.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Brennan rightly says, if the local representatives want to white-wash or paint or improve a road, whatever the cost may be, and the manager objects on the grounds that he does not think it is necessary, and if the local representatives, in spite of the objection of the manager, persist in pursuing their decision, they become liable to surcharge. Does Deputy Sheldon say that is not so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course it is not so. No court in Ireland would be such a fool as to give such a decision.</P>

      <P>I say that Section 16 is the beginning and the end of this Bill.  If this section goes through you have completely finished with any suggestion of democratic control on the part of local representatives because&mdash; and I repeat this&mdash;everything that you are supposed to get under Section 4 is repealed if the manager so acts under Section 16.  During the discussion, and particularly as regards one of the statements made by the Minister, I became confused.  The Minister talked about the position where a lawful decision under Section 4 becomes illegal in certain circumstances under Section 16 and he then talked about the surcharge. Listen to the sense of the language, Sir: &ldquo;A surcharge for an illegal payment for an unlawful act.&rdquo; We are now legislating to the extent that what appears to be lawful under Section 4 becomes definitely unlawful when Section 16 comes into play.  You have provided the money under Section 4 for the then lawful act and this becomes an illegal payment for an unlawful act under Section 16 if the manager objects.</P>

      <P>Now, Deputy Desmond talked about white elephants in connection with properties bought at excessive prices.  He said that the only safeguard against such transactions is the county manager.  First of all, before any such purchase can be made, payment has to be made by the county manager and, unless the payment for such a purchase is out of the rates, the <Col N="434" /> purchase is subject to sanction by the Department of Local Government. Therefore, the white elephant purchases to which Deputy Desmond has alluded would suggest to me that, instead of Section 16 as it stands, we should put in a new Section 16 which would stipulate that the local authority should do its business itself because, apparently, the safeguard of sanction from Local Government has not prevented the purchase of white elephants.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Then the manager was a party to it.  There are very few purchases of property out of the rates and any purchase made in the manner suggested by Deputy Desmond would leave the councillors open to the severest reprimand and criticism from the ratepayers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Now, we have had all kinds of expressions of opinion on this section, and I hope the Minister will admit the seriousness of the section and what it really means.  The Minister says that it is what we say here that counts in the interpretation of an Act of Parliament.  It does not.  Deputy Allen quite rightly says it is not what we say here that counts; it is the interpretation by the courts of the cold language in the Act of Parliament that decides matters.  We have had cases in the past where the Official Report was produced in court indicating the Minister's intention and judges have invariably pointed out that they are not there to adjudicate on intentions; they are there to interpret what is in the Act.  I agree with Deputy Allen that it is what is in the Act that decides ultimately.  The auditor does the same.  The auditor will interpret the Act and not the intention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister must not assume for one moment that the people who participate actively in local government are all fools.  I ask the Minister to realise that this is a complete reversal of his own expressed opinions <Col N="435" /> in connection with local government. It is in complete opposition to what the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Davin, has said over a number of years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;over here, I might agree with him.  Labour have always stated that they stand for the fullest control of local government by the elected representatives of the people. I hold that Section 16, as it stands, completely nullifies the control that we all believed was intended&mdash;the control we want over our own local affairs. One would assume from this section that all, or nearly all, the mistakes made in local government administration are made by the local elected representatives.  In recent months I have discovered that more mistakes are made by managers and by the Local Government Department&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary will in due course have a good opportunity of examining the matter to which he is now referring in the greatest detail and I think he will be one of the first to admit that what I am now saying is correct.  It is not solely the elected representatives who make mistakes and on whom the brake <Col N="436" /> must be applied.  I have learned in the last few months that mistakes are made by managers, and the mistakes made by managers have been confirmed by the Department of Local Government.</P>
      <P>In my opinion, the greater the freedom and the greater the right of elected representatives, subject, of course, as I have always said, to an administrative head and subject to an overall examination and control by the Department of Local Government, if you like, the better local government we will have.  Section 16, as it stands, will create a disastrous situation and I appeal to Deputy D. Larkin, who is a very active member of our local authority in the City of Dublin&mdash;I am sorry Deputy A.  Byrne has left the House; I would venture to say that he agrees with the point of view expressed on this side of the House and has gone outside to examine his conscience&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The only thing one can do is to destroy it and we are unanimous on this side of the House in our objection to this section.  We will oppose it.</P>

Nobody suggests that because the House of Parliament under the direction of a particular Minister of State with his host of officials and draftsmen behind him&mdash;because under those circumstances faulty legislation or mistaken legislation was passed&mdash;this House should be abolished and a dictator put in.  That is what you are doing under Section 16.  You are dismissing the county manager and creating a dictator.  That is what you are doing.  Deputy Davin grunts and says nothing.</P>

I feel that there are a great number of members of this House who have served for a great number of years on local authorities and served many hours of every week trying to unravel their rights under local government legislation, trying to find out what they can do and what they cannot do, and finding themselves hamstrung.  The Minister said before in justification of this Bill that this section was included in the Bill introduced by his predecessor in this House, but I do not know whether he has read the debates on the Second Reading of the Bill as it was then introduced.  If he has, he would have found that our Minister for Local Government, the present Deputy Smith, was quite willing to listen to criticism, and at least he had personal practical experience and knowledge of the work not only as a member but as chairman of a local authority.</P>

      <P>I am trying to refrain from making certain answers to certain interruptions, but it is very difficult sometimes to control oneself.  The <Col N="440" /> Minister for Local Government has, on many occasions during the passage of the Local Authorities Bill and on previous sections and on the Second Stage of this Bill, claimed to have expert knowledge of local government, having acted as legal adviser to a local authority for many years.  The Minister has said that.  Now I appeal to the Minister, and I think he will agree that whatever Party a member of a local authority belongs to, particularly in the case of the local authority to which I belong, the elected representatives have always tried to do their best in the interests of the people they represent, and they are not just lunatics, knaves or fools, and that the manager is not the little green-eyed god to whom local authority representatives must bow down.  Surely the combined wisdom of the majority of a local authority in coming to a decision should be sufficient to offset the opinion of a single individual.  Surely that particular idea will be subscribed to. Further, if the local authority unanimously decides something, is it not to be assumed that a body of sensible men&mdash;as they should be&mdash;in unanimously deciding something should be more than a match for the manager who has to have the safeguard of paragraph (b) of sub-section (1) of Section 16?</P>
      <P>I would like to hear Deputy Larkin on this, not&mdash;if you like&mdash;from a Party point of view.  I would like to hear from him on this from his own experience in the City of Dublin.  Does he not agree that the reserved functions &mdash;and we have very few reserved functions&mdash;should be left in our control without having them reduced to a farce or to nothing, which is the position that Section 16 would bring about. I would ask the Minister, having heard the various opinions on this particular section and having heard, as I said before, the very lukewarm expressions in favour of it, to take courage and admit that Section 16 is not necessary and will be withdrawn.</P>

I find great difficulty in accepting that they have <Col N="441" /> a common or an agreed approach on this matter.  Listening for some time to Deputy Briscoe, one gathers that it would be almost impossible for a local authority to make a decision that might result in an illegal act being performed.  On the other hand, Deputy Blaney told us that there was ample provision against local authorities committing an illegal act which would result in a deficiency or loss to the funds of the local authority by the fact that, in his opinion, a decision could be made by the Department of Local Government.

      <P>I think the very few remarks I have made in the matter have proved very clearly that there is some confusion between the Deputies representing Fianna Fáil in this House. On the section itself, it appears to me on reading Section 16 (b), that the section is there for the purpose of giving to the manager power to advise very definitely the local authorities that a decision they may be about to come to may be an illegal decision and may result, if carried into effect either in an illegal payment being carried out or in a deficiency or loss in local funds arising from an illegal decision. I am not a lawyer, a solicitor, or anything of that kind but that to me <Col N="442" /> appears to be the interpretation of the sub-section.</P>
      <P>Deputy Blaney is not worrying evidently whether the local authority should be advised or not that any proposal they are considering is a legal or an illegal proposal, because he made it quite clear that, in his view, the procedure should be that the resolution be adopted by the council; subsequently the report would go from the manager to the Department of Local Government and the Department of Local Government could refuse to sanction the proposal because such proposal might be illegal.</P>
      <P>Deputy Briscoe said, to my surprise &mdash;I think I am correct in quoting him &mdash;that he believed the manager should be an administrator under the control of the councillors.  I am somewhat surprised to hear this statement from Deputy Briscoe because of the fact that when the Minister visited our local authority in connection with this Act the only member of the local authority who indicated that it was their due that the manager should be an executive officer only was myself. None of Deputy Briscoe's colleagues&mdash; I do not think he was there at the time&mdash;had any quarrel with the present system as such.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>In my view, it is proper that local authorities should be advised, whether by a manager or anybody else, if a course they propose pursuing may lead them into committing an illegal act.  My interpretation of this section is that this section places upon the manager the clear duty of advising the local representatives if the course they are taking would entail an illegal payment.  Consequently, I see no particular objection to the section.  I would feel somewhat easier in my mind if the Minister would consider making the position plainer by adding two or three words to Section 16 (b).</P>

      <P>I am not suggesting any particular words.  I think the Minister may feel at this stage that it would be advisable to make a clear position even clearer and so at least assist Deputies Briscoe, Blaney and Brennan to avoid any further confusion among themselves in this matter. I cannot see the difficulties visualised by Deputy Briscoe.  I cannot accept that the adoption of this section would, in effect, mean taking all authority away from the local representatives because the section, as I read it, clearly and only refers to the question of an illegal payment.</P>

Deputy Blaney suggests that there is protection, by every action about which there was any doubt whatsoever being referred to the Department of Local Government and that Department would decide on the legality or otherwise of any particular action.  I suggest that before the Deputies opposite conclude their observations they might spend about five minutes in the lobby and arrive at some common understanding as to what they wish the Minister to do.</P>

      <P>We would have been glad if the Minister had given us some more justification for the inclusion of this section.  The County Management Act has been in operation now for 12 years and the Minister did not give one single instance that came to his notice or the notice of the Department in that period of 12 years which would justify taking from the shoulders of county managers what they have carried for 12 years and putting it on the shoulders of members of local authorities.  The Minister was not able to give us a number of instances, nor was he able to give examples of important and serious matters where wrong decisions were made by local authorities that forced the manager into doing illegal things.  He did not make a case for taking the burden off the shoulders of the managers, as he is doing in this section, and putting it on individual members of local authorities. That is in effect what he is doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="445" /> If you take Section 16 out of this Bill it is a Bill of tatters&mdash;a tattered old coat and breeches, that is what it amounts to, the old coat is before Section 16 and the breeches after it, and they are tattered.  Section 16 is definitely anti-local authority and antimembers of local authority.  I say that in all seriousness.  It is antimembers of local authority and anti-local authority.  For 12 important years in the life of this nation the local authorities have operated a new Act, a new service, the County Management Act.  In not one single instance has the Minister quoted any irregularity that took place.</P>
    <P>We know for a fact, as I said on Thursday evening, that managers have been fighting for the last 12 years to get that onus taken off their shoulders and put on the shoulders of the local authority.  The managers' association desired that, we know that quite well.  The Labour Party should understand this better and should know quite well what they are voting for in this Bill.  They should know that for the first time, in 12 years under the Management Act, the Minister proposes to put on the shoulders of individual members of local authorities an onus and responsibility, as far as surcharge is concerned, that they had not on them before.  The Minister had the cheek to get up here to-night, and state that under Section 4 when it becomes law the local authority has power to accept tenders.</P>

Under the law as it exists to-day and under this particular Bill when it becomes an Act, the local authority may requisition <Col N="446" /> the manager to accept a particular tender.  They will never accept the tender themselves but they may requisition and compel him to accept it.</P>

I am trying to point out that the council of a county have certain reserved functions which they have a right to perform and the manager has certain executive functions which he must perform.

This section is reactionary and it should not be in any Bill setting out democratic powers.  For the past 12 years the position in local authorities has been that the manager has carried the responsibility for surcharge on his shoulders.  We object most strenuously to the Minister's proposal that that responsibility for surcharge be removed from the shoulders of the manager and transferred to the <Col N="449" /> shoulders of members of the local authority.</P>

      <P>Earlier in this debate Deputy Briscoe challenged the right of Deputies who are not members of a local authority to speak on this Bill.  I am not a member of a local authority but, as a Deputy, I claim the right to speak on this Bill.  If one were to follow his line of reasoning no Deputy who is not a showman would have the right to discuss the Gaming Bill.  I should like to have clarified whether or not the Opposition want the position to be that if a county council decide to do something against the advice of the county manager&mdash;to do something which the county manager knows is an illegal act&mdash;and, as a result, there is a loss or the money is spent illegally, the responsibility for that act should not rest on the shoulders of the people who decide to do it?</P>

I should be very glad if the Opposition would give me the benefit of their long years of experience and state whether or not that is correct.  I have heard talk during this debate as to whether or not authority should be given back to local authorities.  I believe it should.

      <P>Before ever the managerial system was introduced, I think it was the practice to have an adviser at all meetings of local authorities&mdash;the law adviser or the secretary&mdash;who, when matters were being discussed by the elected body, chimed in from time to time and suggested that a decision about to be arrived at was dangerous and looked like being illegal.  I agree entirely with Deputy Larkin as to the desirability of making provision for such technical advice.  I agree that a local authority should have some technical people at hand who would <Col N="450" /> warn them, in the course of their discussions, that if they decided in a certain way it might prove to be illegal.</P>
      <P>I have not heard the Minister on this section but I understand that he spoke on it.  While I admit that there should be some provision for preventing illegal action I am anxious to know what this word &ldquo;deficiency&rdquo; means. Like every other Deputy I know what &ldquo;deficiency&rdquo; means in its ordinary sense but what does it mean in this section?  Sub-section (3) of Section 16 reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where, in accordance with sub-section (1) of this section, the names of the persons voting for a decision to do or effect any act, matter or thing are recorded in the minutes of the meeting of a local authority, those persons shall be surcharged on any surcharge or charged on any charge that may subsequently be made as a result of the decision as if they had made or authorised the making of the payment or caused the loss or deficiency, and no other person shall be surcharged or charged.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>What could they do under Section 4? What decision could they make under Section 4?  That is the section in which they are supposed to have got all these powers.  It might be a perfectly legitimate expenditure from their point of view but nevertheless it might create a deficiency.  Is the word &ldquo;deficiency&rdquo; here to be interpreted in the ordinary way?</P>

      <P>I may mention to the Deputy that the word &ldquo;deficiency&rdquo; has been defined in the statutes governing audits.  Also, we have many judicial definitions of the word &ldquo;deficiency&rdquo;.  I take it that the Deputy himself, when he introduced his Bill in 1953, had in mind his own definition of the word &ldquo;deficiency&rdquo;. I am prepared to accept that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I know, but the information the Minister is giving me makes me even more suspicious of this term than I was before I got it.  I will tell you what this word &ldquo;deficiency&rdquo; means now.  It means the giving to Local Government auditors of complete power in determining surcharges.  If a county council were to decide to take on a road and even if the council felt they were legally entitled to do so, if the auditor came to the conclusion that the work in question was not of sufficient public utility to warrant their decision, he could surcharge the council. This word &ldquo;deficiency&rdquo; is intended to give to Local Government auditors a freedom almost to surcharge for anything that is in any way progressive, even if the act itself is covered by some Act of Parliament or another.</P>
      <P>I am not objecting as an individual to the illegal payment part of the section, to safeguarding local authorities against making decisions which would result in illegal payments; but whether this word &ldquo;deficiency&rdquo; was part of a section introduced by me on a previous occasion or not, I am saying as a layman now that if my attention were drawn to it in this House, even if I were Minister, and if there were pointed out to me the dangers that could result from such words as these, I certainly would have a very serious talk with my officials, with my advisers and the people responsible for the section in order to ensure that the charges made from this side, which are apparently held to be extravagant, were not justified.</P>

      <P>What does it matter? What is Parliament for?  Acts of Parliament are being amended every day of the week in every land.  Surely the fact that some section was introduced in the Act of 1925 or that I introduced a section containing these words in a Bill which was never enacted is not a reason for asking the House to accept their inclusion here.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister seriously not to ask for anything so sweeping as is contained in the section.  By all means, protect the local authority from doing something which is illegal and from making themselves foolish&mdash;I do not say that they would rush into doing these things if they were not protected by some legal provision like this&mdash;but, in our anxiety to protect them, let us not go too far and take away from them the very powers we are pretending to give them now.</P>

      <P>This section is, to my mind, the most serious section in the Bill, because it is a section purposely prepared and framed as the big stick to be held over members of a council. It is all very well for Deputy Desmond and others to say that we would do certain things.  We would, and we would get half a dozen to do them with us, but we know what always happens when the legal adviser tells us that something we are doing is illegal.  I have memories of the period before the Management Act when one would be getting something through and there would be a threat of surcharge. The moment there was a threat of surcharge all the boys who had spoken in favour would be talking against it for the next couple of hours to have it knocked out.  That is what this section is meant for.</P>

I cannot see any freedom given under this, and these sections, with the exceptions of Sections 4 and 16, are only padding.</P>
      <P>Deputies alluded to the law courts. Fancy a county councillor, in order to straighten out something, having to go out to a court of law.  Has he not time enough lost representing the ratepayers inside, without having to go out to a court of law to help the ratepayers again?  Most of these sections are framed for the sole purpose of giving work to the lawyers.  The section is an objectionable section.  It is a section which, in my opinion, has been brought in with a definite object and it should be dropped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid the Minister does not at all appreciate the approach we are trying to make to this section.  The Minister and his Parliamentary Secretary see the section through the glasses through which they are looking and do not realise that, if they were sitting on the opposite side and looking the other way, they would see this section in the perspective in which we see it.  First of all, the auditor is an unknown individual.  He is a Local Government official, one of 100.  Any one of these, or even the whole 100, can come down and we could have 100 different definitions on a particular subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said before and I still say that the section means that, notwithstanding the fact that under Section 4 local authority representatives have the legal right to make certain decisions by resolution, under (b) of Section 16, sub-section (1) the very fact of an objection by the manager or any of the officials, some of whom were specified by the Minister in introducing the section, immediately creates the position that if the local authority representatives proceed, notwithstanding <Col N="454" /> the objection, to do what they have decided to do by lawful resolution, they commit an illegal act and are therefore liable to surcharge by the auditor, because the manager, in making his objection, is bound to record the names of councillors who are opposing his point of view.</P>
    <P>Deputy Smith put his finger more definitely on that point.  That is why the Minister, in introducing the section, or interpreting it as it stands, or as he understood it, or as he has been advised by his expert officials,, points this out in column 299, Volume 150, of the Dáil Debates of 21st April, 1955.  He divides (a) and (b) and in (b) there is the phrase: &ldquo;in consequence of which an illegal payment is to be made.&rdquo;  Nobody is objecting to an illegal payment being presented, but the Minister goes on and says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(b) in consequence of which an illegal payment is to be made, or a deficiency or loss is likely to result...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The word &ldquo;or&rdquo; brings in the &ldquo;deficiency or loss which is likely to result&rdquo;, and now becomes an illegality.</P>
    <P>What is a deficiency?  The Minister says it is defined in statutes and in court decisions.  We all have a layman's view of what a deficiency means. If we strike a rate in accordance with the estimates and if, in the course of the year, we decide on certain expenditure which is not included in the raising of the rate, we shall obviously cause a deficiency as between income and expenditure.  Is that going to be called an illegal act?  Then every Supplementary Estimate would be illegal, because it is trying to make up a deficiency. The Parliamentary Secretary need not think that we are approaching this from the point of view of obstruction.  Some of us have to work these Acts on local authorities, and some of us have become fairly experienced.</P>

What does &ldquo;loss&rdquo; mean?  &ldquo;Loss&rdquo; can be defined by a local government auditor.  We buy some gadget with which to experiment &mdash;let us say, something for a new form of street lighting or a new form of protective gadget for street crossing, and we put it into use, even on a trial basis. When we discover that it is useless, that the position is worse than before, and we decide to discard it, we have created a loss.</P>

      <P>Many of us on this side of the House who have spoken in this debate have great experience of local affairs.  I am trying to bring the Parliamentary Secretary with me step by step.  I am trying to be courteous, and I am trying to correct his interjections when they are made, might I say, wrongfully and illegally.  I am trying to illustrate with these definitions and these interpretations, because the words of an Act of Parliament, in the hands of a body of Local Government auditors, can bring chaos into the control of local affairs.  I have given illustrations of certain things.  There is no use in quoting what is in an Act of Parliament of 1925, as being comparable with a similar set of rules or sections, in a different context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="456" /> I will give another illustration.  A council may, under Section 4, decide to acquire certain water rights from a stream or spring.  That stream or spring may suddenly dry up, and the local government auditor can come along and say: &ldquo;That was a very foolish thing to do.  You were warned by your engineer not to do it.  Therefore, you have created a loss for which you are responsible.&rdquo;  I appeal to the Minister not to regard local representatives as a body of school children who do not take their responsibility seriously.  I should like to make a present of this to the Minister.  I do not care who the advisers in his Department are.  I can pick officials or representatives of local authorities who could teach local government to some of the Minister's officials.</P>
    <P>It is all very well for a Department of State to design all the ropes necessary to bring about a complete stranglehold on the operations of a local authority.  Local representatives have to deal mainly in operations with human beings.  There is, as it is, a sufficiency of red tape that makes it impossible to act quickly sometimes, particularly in emergencies.  Now we are going to put into this Bill a section which will provide an example of puppets dancing to the pull of strings from the Custom House.</P>

When the Minister is talking about illegal payments, nobody objects but then he brings in the question of a deficiency or a loss without defining the limitations to the creation of this deficiency or loss in some form or explaining in the section to what extent the manager is limited in making his objections.

Can we have these words interpreted or defined for us?  I have heard many interpretations but I want them defined and if these limitations can ease my serious suspicions about how this thing will operate afterwards it will perhaps make it much easier for us to get together on the matter but, on the present wording of that section, and having regard to the implications I see in it freedom of action in respect <Col N="465" /> of most of the things the local authorities want to have freedom to do, the control of their city manager in cooperating and working with them, is greatly endangered here.  I object very much to having a situation where unknown auditors with unknown interpretations of certain things will be the final arbiters and the final judges, imposing on local representatives these punitive measures for action which they may take in the course of their duty with the best intention of doing what is right and proper for the people who elected them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenMaguire" hpid="Mr. Maguire Mr. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>The discussion on this section this evening has been rather intriguing.  On the one hand the section takes away from public representatives powers which should have been left to them and there is a threat in the section that if the public representatives do wrong they are liable to be surcharged for their wrong-doing. Apparently the person who is going to make that decision and issue that edict is the county manager who is implied under the Bill generally as being an officer of the council, subject to their advice and in an executive position after that.  In this section he is given the power of determining whether the real representatives of the people, the custodians of the people's purse, are to be penalised if they do something to which he objects.  That may be a good thing because if public representatives are warned that they are trespassing on the law and breaking the law, they should gladly accept such advice and restrain themselves from so doing.</P>
      <P>The section to my mind is right in so far as it applies in that regard, but what is far more fundamental in my view is that we want to get the right type of person in the country to take an interest in local government and in the administration of local affairs. These men must be men of discretion and honour and integrity and understanding and should not be dictated to from any direction or by any official. It may be in the form of advice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is all it is.  That is all the manager does&mdash;he gives advice.  He does not surcharge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="466" />
    <Speaker pid="BenMaguire" hpid="Mr. Maguire Mr. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>But the threat is there if this Bill is carried through that certain acts of the county councillors may lead to a surcharge.  By imposing that threat you may be undermining the responsibility and the authority of the men elected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the same wording as that of the 1925 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenMaguire" hpid="Mr. Maguire Mr. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>The same form of threat was carried on there and do not think for a moment that you are doing a good thing in leaving the public representatives of the country subject to such threats.  Local government should be administered by men who use their own consciences, their own experience and their own knowledge without such threats.  They should be men capable of using their own understanding without the shadow of such threats.  The whole principle of the thing seems to be not only to discourage the right type of public representative but to encourage the individual who does not want these responsibilities.</P>
      <P>The principle of a Bill like this should be the encouragement of the individual who is capable of carrying responsibility and of carrying out his duties in a right and proper manner. That should be the aim of any local government Bill.  What this Bill does to my mind is to destroy initiative and independence and keep out of public life those who would be capable of managing their own affairs successfully. It not only does that, but it encourages the person of no responsibility to shelter himself behind the protection of the manager.  Afterwards the representative may say, if he feels like it, that he wanted to do something irresponsible, but that the manager would not let him.  So you have a dual prospect in this Bill aiming at destroying the proper management and protection of the people's affairs.  It may be expedient to threaten the local councils with damages if they pursue a certain line, but this threat will make them feel that they are endangering themselves in so far as the Department may suc them and surcharge them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="467" /> I say that the responsibility should be put on the councils.  I tell the Minister to get on with the job and give local councils men of responsibility and integrity and not give the managers the notion that it is their duty to order and that their orders must be accepted.</P>
    <P>Supposing the manager makes a mistake.  Is he to be surcharged?  Has the Minister taken the same precautions to ensure the public against the manager's mistakes as he has from the point of view of the public representative? If not, why not?  The Minister is giving the manager a prime responsibility and a final word.  This section is wrong.  It may be expedient to bring it in; it may be expedient to devise these schemes, but it is not aimed at getting better local government and I advise the Minister to reconsider the whole thing and to withdraw the section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. MacCarthy Mr. MacCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to withdraw this section as being objectionable in character and unnecessary in import in relation to the whole Bill.  In the first place, this section is linked up with Section 4, which purports to give certain authority to councillors which before this they did not possess.  In that section they are tied up by various subsections setting out very carefully the time necessary for notices of motions, the period which will be given for consideration of the resolution, and the particular objects to which it may or may not apply.  Now we are told that anything that is not in conformity with sub-section (9) of Section 4 is null and void.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. MacCarthy Mr. MacCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>I know we are, but, is not the very first sub-section in Section 16 linking it up with Section 4?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may only discuss Section 4 in so far as it relates to Section 16.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. MacCarthy Mr. MacCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>And I am discussing Section 4 in so far as it is linked up <Col N="468" /> with this section in its very first sub-section. Section 16 states that anything done against Section 4 is null and void.  We have this section in order to provide for penalties, but how can a penalty arise, and if it does arise who is to be charged with the responsibility for having caused it?</P>
      <P>In Section 4, sub-section (8) it is stated that if money is provided for a specific thing the manager can, by resolution of the council, be authorised to go ahead with that particular business in so far as the money is provided. If he goes ahead only to that extent, how can there be a deficiency? What is all this talk about deficiencies then?  If there is a deficiency is it not the people who did not provide enough money in the first instance who should be surcharged rather than those who voted for the work going ahead on the estimate of the officials?</P>
      <P>The resolution can only authorise the manager to go ahead in so far as the money has been provided.  Consequently, the resolution of the council so authorising the manager cannot cause any penalty to be imposed on any member of the council.  In that case, why have this section at all?  The three who put their name to the resolution originally may not attend the council meeting at all, and it is not the people who voted the money but those who voted for the resolution to expend the money who will be surcharged if there is a deficiency.  Is not the whole thing confusion from beginning to end?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are told this cannot apply to the functions of the council generally.  Is that not so?  We are told it cannot apply to the functions of the manager in so far as it deals with officers or servants.  Sub-section (9) states what it cannot include.  Under this section we are discussing the council can vote money for certain work.  By giving certain notice, signed by three members of the council, a special meeting can be called to authorise that work.  Under Section 8 that work can only be proceeded with in so far as the money is provided.  If the members of the council vote in favour of the work, then everything should be in order, and there is no necessity at all for the confusion this sub-section tends to <Col N="469" /> introduce or the discredit it would seem to cast on public representatives by implying that they will act irresponsibly and pass resolutions for the illegal expenditure of money.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand how anyone could come into Parliament with a sub-section like this.  To my mind it has no application.  It is, as has been said, the big stick held over public representatives: &ldquo;You can do certain things, but, if you do them, even though the money is provided and you authorise the manager to go ahead, and anything happens subsequently in the carrying-out of that work and there is a deficiency, those who voted for that particular work are the people who will be surcharged.&rdquo;  Did anyone ever see a more senseless section put before Parliament for adoption?  I certainly did not.</P>

      <P>If members of the county council vote for the squandering of the ratepayers' money, then they should be surcharged.  If this section had been in operation before this the ratepayers of Dublin would be getting a refund to-day from the Dublin Corporation in respect of the monument on O'Connell Bridge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="470" /> Any member elected to a local authority takes on a certain responsibility in relation to the expenditure of rates collected from the ratepayers.  It is their responsibility to ensure that those moneys are not squandered and that they are put to proper use.  Up to this Fianna Fáil have always backed county management.  I voted against the County Management Act.  I would like to see it abolished to-morrow and I would support its abolition.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party is anxious that local representatives should have more powers.  Is not that what the Fianna Fáil Party wants?  Why the delaying tactics then?  Why take a different line from that adopted by them in 1942?  I cannot understand it.</P>

      <P>We have a legal adviser in the Wexford County Council to keep us right and tell us if we are going wrong.  That is what he is paid for.  If local representatives commit an illegal act with the ratepayers' money they should be brought to book. Why should they escape?  Ratepayers in many counties condemn their local representatives because the rates are not put to proper use.  Now, we in the county councils can strike the rates, but we have no check on the expenditure of the rates.  I think it is about time that local representatives faced up to the fact that they should protect the ratepayers and the ratepayers' money.</P>
      <P>These are delaying tactics on the part of the Opposition.  Are they waiting for their members to arrive?  I do not know.  All I do know is that they are wasting time.</P>

      <P>The one thing which seems to emerge from the discussion here is the fact that the last speaker, <Col N="471" /> and a number of previous speakers on the Government Benches, now try to make it appear that by being against this section we are in fact against any system of protection of the ratepayers' money.  That is a completely wrong interpretation of our attitude.  It is wrong to say that because we are against this section we are in favour of illegal payments.  Did anyone ever hear of anything so ridiculous?  We are against the section for various reasons but speakers on the opposite benches pick out only one reason and say that we are against the section because we are in favour of illegal payments and squandering the ratepayers' money.</P>

Who is being put up by the Government and the Labour Party as the ratepayers' protector?  None other than the persons who have been vilified over years&mdash;the county managers.  They are now to be the protectors who will protect the ratepayers from the local representatives elected by the people.</P>

In the past the cry was that the people's representatives had to be protected from the county managers.  You give us in Section 4 some semblance of power&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do and I want to interpret it, because like many another member I have experience for some considerable time on a local authority of trying to interpret certain of these Acts and trying to get through the red tape that is continued and perpetrated on local authorities by people in the Custom House, such as the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister.</P>
      <P>Section 16, as has already been pointed out, appears to this side of the House to be objectionable for one particular reason.  There are many, but the one particular reason is that the general trend of opinion here is that it takes away from us some of the provisions, some of the advantages or powers that are being given to us under Section 4.  Let us have either this power under Section 4 or not have it at all.  Why waste the time of the House and the time spent in drafting Section 4 giving certain powers that are later taken from us in Section 16?</P>
      <P>Candidly, it is almost beyond comprehension that a Minister, backed up by a Parliamentary Secretary with all their advisers, should for any reason, except some ulterior motive, give us power in one section and go to the trouble of wording another section in such a way as to take it away, and all this is contained in the same Bill. The only reason for this that I can suggest is that, having blown their trumpets so much about what they were going to give us by way of power in the local authorities, they are now faced with the local elections in June and have to mend their hand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under Section 4, they have to give us this power, but from the official point of view they do not want to give that power and they take it back in Section 16.  They believe that the people will not wake up to this until the election is over.  They hope, and it is only a hope, by this means to retain some of the support they gained <Col N="473" /> by using such tactics in the past.  That is the only motive that is sensible.  It may be a base move, but it makes sense.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 27:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before sub-section (3), page 15, to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(3) Notwithstanding sub-section (2) of this section, where a delegation to an officer is made under this section&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  the manager may, in any particular case of the performance of the function, inform the officer <Col N="477" /> that he has decided to perform the function himself, and the function shall thereupon be performable in such case by the manager and not by the officer, and</P>
    <P>(b)  if the officer is satisfied that, in any particular case of the performance of the function, performance would, on account of the importance of the decision involved or on account of any other reasonable consideration, be more appropriately effected by the manager, the officer may refer such case to the manager, and the function shall thereupon be performable in such case by the manager and not by the officer.</P>
    <P>This amendment is divided into two parts.  The purpose of paragraph (a) is to enable a manager to step in in any particular case and perform a function himself, despite the fact that he has delegated such function to an approved officer.  The purpose of paragraph (b) is to enable an officer to whom a function has been delegated to refer back the performance of a function to the manager on a particular occasion.  Otherwise, an officer would be bound to perform a delegated function in all cases, even if he differed from the manager as to how the function should be performed.</P>

The purpose of the first part of amendment No. 28 is to enable the county manager or the Dublin City Manager to intervene in any particular <Col N="478" /> case and perform a function himself, despite the fact that the performance of such function was delegated to an assistant manager.  Hitherto, the manager has had no power to perform any function which he had delegated to an assistant manager.  As a corollary to the provision in paragraph (a), the second part of the amendment will enable an assistant manager in any particular instance, if the situation so warrants it, to refer back the performance of a function to the manager, despite the fact that this function has been delegated to him; and the manager will then have to perform the function himself on that particular occasion.</P>

      <P>I am afraid I will not be able to deal very adequately now with these amendments.  First of all, in the case of Dublin, where we have two permanent assistant managers, does the section with the amendments before us included, envisage the position that the manager would in addition to delegating powers to the assistant managers delegate powers to other officers?  That is the first point. Can the manager do that?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Secondly, under this section even as amended, we have an officer, who is an assistant manager, completely in charge of housing, for instance.  Does it mean now that, notwithstanding the form of appointment which that officer has from the Minister, the manager now can take over to himself the functions being performed by that assistant manager appointed by the Minister?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>At Question Time to-day I asked the Minister for Local Government whether he is aware of the dissatisfaction that exists in the Ballyvourney district because of the indiscriminate rejection of applications for the right of interment in St. Gobnait's burial grounds and, if so, if he will take immediate steps to terminate this situation.  The following is the reply which I received from the Minister:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;When a burial ground is closed to further interments on grounds of public health and decency, it is the practice to refuse exemption to any person claiming right of interment who is not either&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  a widow or widower whose late partner in marriage is already interred there;</P>
      <P>(b)  a single person of advanced age who is the sole surviving member of his or her family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If it appears that adequate space will be available in the grave, persons within these categories may be exempted from the terms of the Closing Order.  I consider this is a most reasonable approach and in applying it to St. Gobnait's the most lenient interpretation possible has been adopted.  Since the closure 52 persons in the special categories have been refused exemption.  A further 88 claims were allowed because soundings of the graves indicated that the depth available was sufficient.  The total number of exemptions is now 111 and although <Col N="480" /> this is abnormally large any further claims on the basis indicated will be sympathetically considered.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am completely dissatisfied with the Minister's reply.  Let me preface my remarks by saying that, in dealing with St. Gobnait's burial grounds, we are not dealing with an ordinary cemetery.  St. Gobnait's burial grounds are regarded as a place of sanctity and reverence and pilgrimage and the reason why that cemetery is so revered is that it contains the remains of St. Gobnait who was interred there some time about the sixth century.  People from various places in County Cork and, indeed, I might say, from all over Munster make pilgrimages regularly to these burial grounds.  It has been held that as a result of these pilgrimages, many cures have been effected.</P>
    <P>The Minister is already well aware of the indignation with which his Closing Order was received by the people in the Ballyvourney district, irrespective of who or what they may be.  The general opinion there is that there was no need whatsoever for this Closing Order.  I have inspected the cemetery myself and I have heard the viewpoint of the residents in the district and I must say I fully agree that there was no need whatsoever for the making of this Order by the Minister. In my view, the Minister erred when, in August last, he signed this Order closing the burial grounds.</P>
    <P>What gave rise to the Closing Order was a report from the county medical officer that, in the interests of public health and decency, St. Gobnait's cemetery should be closed.  I realise very well that the county medical officer of health is probably a capable man, but I do not believe he viewed this question from the aspect of the great tradition behind this cemetery because he is not of the religious persuasion of the majority of the people in the district.  That being so, he may have discounted the great tradition associated with St. Gobnait's burial grounds and which was so very forcibly put before the Minister prior to his making of the Closing Order and again subsequently.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="481" /> When the Minister is replying he will probably tell me that all the people who had any grounds for objection had a right to come before the inquiry and make their case while the inquiry was being held.  Some of them did.  However, the Minister can visualise the difficulty involved for people of 70 and 80 years of age to come before an inquiry and to have to go before a peace commissioner and make a statutory declaration in respect of a right of interment in St. Gobnait's cemetery. I submit that that was an unfair and unjust burden to place on those people, and when I say that I am not satisfied with the findings of that inquiry I am expressing the view of practically every person in the Ballyvourney district. Deputy McAuliffe will bear me out in that statement and so will the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach, who represents portion of the Ballyvourney district.  Again and again, the Irish people have upheld their faith and fatherland, and they are doing so again now in this controversy. St. Gobnait's cemetery is held in reverence by the people of Ballyvourney&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is particularly so in the case of St. Gobnait's cemetery.  It is the aim of the people of the Ballyvourney district that their remains will lie in the same grounds as lie the remains of their revered saint, St. Gobnait.  The county medical officer of health was the only person who believed, at the outset, that this cemetery should be closed.  He made a report to the Minister that, in the interests of public health and decency, the cemetery should be closed. For more than 1,400 years people have been buried in that cemetery.  We must bear in mind the fact that the population of our country was almost three times as large as it is to-day and we can assume, therefore, that the number of burials in the past was far in excess of the number of burials that take place at the present time.  The Minister cannot put forward or adduce any evidence of danger to public health or <Col N="482" /> decency by reason of burials taking place there through the centuries. Now, after 1,400 years, a county medical officer of health in Cork has made this report&mdash;and the report is upheld by some inspector who was sent down by the Minister and it is upheld by the Minister himself.</P>
      <P>When the inspector's report was submitted to the Department there was a serious delay before the signing of the declaration closing the cemetery because the Minister and his Department were aware that there were very good reasons for not making the Order. When the Order was made, the people banded themselves together for the purpose of protesting against it.  They issued circulars to the Deputies representing North and West Cork constituencies. A deputation of local people, together with the Deputies in question, met the Minister some time ago. If I am interpreting correctly the viewpoint of the Minister at that meeting, he made it quite clear that all elderly people would be granted the right of interment in Ballyvourney cemetery. He also made it clear that the claims of widows, widowers and single persons of advanced age would be granted. Out of more than 600 applications only 111 have been granted and 52 persons in the special categories have already been refused the right of interment there.</P>
      <P>I claim that that is unfair and unjust on the part of the Minister and that he did not give us a true picture of the position when we went before him as a deputation.  The Minister should have explained to the local people who came to Dublin that it was within his rights and his functions, if he so decided, to refuse right of interment to these aged people and I can tell you that that refusal has been made in some cases where the people are more than 80 years of age and I can also tell the Minister on their behalf that they resent his attitude very much indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next item we have to deal with is whether this Order was justified and on whose information was it made.  On whose report does the Minister say that any particular person should be denied right of interment in Ballyvourney cemetery?  My information is that the Minister asked for a report <Col N="483" /> through the county medical officer of health from the local health officer and that the local health officer, in conjunction with the caretaker of St. Gobnait's Cemetery, investigated every application made for interment.  Let me say this much to the Minister: the people down in Ballyvourney have no faith whatever in the local caretaker.</P>

      <P>I am putting it to the Minister that he is relying for a report on the county medical officer of health.  The county medical officer gets it from the health officer, but, in the final analysis, the people of Ballyvourney believe that it is the caretaker who makes the recommendation.  They further believe that he has no right whatever to make that recommendation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I make the charge that the Minister has not taken proper steps to ascertain whether these applications should be granted or rejected.  That is quite in order.  I believe that the Minister has erred very much in not doing so and that there was an obligation on him to see that every application was closely and carefully scrutinised.  The deputation which came before the Minister, and the local people, supplied data indicating that there is a big decline in the number of interments in Ballyvourney cemetery in recent years and they claim that, if the Minister or his Department did not interfere, the position would rectify itself by reason of the fact that an extension has been made to the cemetery.  An unfortunate feature is that no further extension can be made, having regard to the nature of the land in the area contiguous to the cemetery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people there claim that the whole position would have come right without any interference and what I am asking the Minister to do is to reconsider the whole question of the closing of this cemetery and the rejection of a substantial number of applications by elderly people, widows and widowers, in that district for right of interment.  I ask him in the light of all the facts that have been put before him by the representatives of the two constituencies and by the local people themselves to review the whole position and at least grant all the applications which have been submitted by people of, say, more than 50 years of age.  If the Minister sees fit to refuse these applications, I want to make it perfectly clear to him that I intend to test the matter in the House by way of a Private Member's Bill, as I am fully entitled to do and as I believe there <Col N="485" /> is an obligation on me to do, if I am to interpret correctly the viewpoint of the people in that area whom I have the honour to represent.</P>
    <P>I do not want to labour the matter any further because I should like the Minister to hear some of Deputy McAuliffe's comments.  I am sure he will bear out every word I have said. I have sufficient faith in the Minister to feel that there will be no need to go into this question at a future date, that he will give heed to the many representations made to him by the people of this district and that he will review again all these applications for interment and grant them.  If he does so, he will be acting in the best interests of the people and will earn the gratitude and thanks of the people of Ballyvourney district.  That is the message they have given me for the Minister.  I have put it before him and I hope he will consider it as favourably and as sympathetically as it is entitled to be considered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcAuliffe" hpid="Mr. McAuliffe Mr. McAuliffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McAuliffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Deputy Murphy in the views he has expressed in relation to this cemetery.  He has covered the ground very fully and has presented the case very forcibly to the Minister.  There is one point I should like to make quite clear, with regard to the deciding authority whenever an application for right of interment is made by a particular family.  We are led to believe that the only way in which this is decided is by driving into the ground an iron bar or spoke.  I do not think that is fair because any body who goes out with a bar of iron to decide whether a coffin is underground or not may easily meet the old board of a coffin or a stone and I feel that it is wrong for the Minister to rely on that information.  We are led to believe from people in this part of the area that that is so and those of us who represent the people of this district undoubtedly have a right and a duty to bring the matter to the attention of the proper authorities.  We are doing so and I am very glad that Deputy Murphy has raised this matter here to-night, because, knowing the Minister as we do, as a man with a thorough knowledge of rural Ireland, <Col N="486" /> I am sure he will give the situation very careful consideration.</P>
      <P>There is no need for me to refer to what Deputy Murphy has pointed out &mdash;the general position with regard to this cemetery.  The people of every part of Cork County have a special regard for it and every year there is a pattern to that cemetery and people pay a special visit to it in a particular month.  In view of the fact that the people have this special interest in the cemetery, it is the duty of the Minister to do everything in his power to ensure that the people will be safeguarded and that their rights will be safeguarded. We know at present that a considerable number of people who have been separated from their partners desire to be buried with them. That case was made to some of us by people in the locality and I join with Deputy Murphy in putting that point to the Minister and in urging him to give very careful consideration to applications made in cases where a wife or husband has died and the remaining party wishes to be interred in the same grave.  I hope he will give the matter raised by Deputy Murphy very sympathetic consideration.</P>

      <P>In January, 1952, Cork County Council applied to the then Minister for Local Government for an Order closing the old part of this burial ground to further interments. This application was supported by a report from the County Medical Officer to the effect that the old portion was obviously filled to capacity, and that further interments would be prejudicial to public health, public decency, and the respect due to the remains of the dead.  It appeared, incidentally, that the County Medical Officer had been reporting adversely on the condition of the burial ground for many years prior to the county council's request.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In conformity with the request mentioned, a public local inquiry was held into the question of closing the old burial ground in October, 1952.  At this inquiry, evidence was given by county council officers which made it plain that the cemetery was grossly overcrowded, and that burials were taking place in graves which could not decently or properly accommodate further coffins.  I should mention, perhaps, that every opportunity was given to the local people interested to appear at the inquiry and make their case either against the closure, or in favour of their own continuing burial rights, if the cemetery were closed.  Comparatively few appearances were, however, made by applicants for burial rights, and no real evidence was offered to disprove the necessity for closure on public health and other grounds. Having considered the evidence, and the inspector's report, the then Minister made an Order prohibiting further burials in the old portion of the cemetery as from the 1st September, 1954. I did not make the Order.  The then Minister made the Order prohibiting <Col N="488" /> burials from the 1st of September, 1954.</P>

I have allowed three feet nine inches as sufficient space in which to bury and cover the coffins.  I think I have gone a long way.  I am sure that neither the Deputies nor the relatives of the dead would like to see these coffins laid on the surface of the ground, and covered over, as I have seen in some graveyards.</P>

The county council, the local authority, and the clergy, realised the overcrowding, because they themselves acquired an addition to the graveyard.

None of us likes it, but we have to like it from the broad point of view, and we have to see, in the interests of common decency and public health, that overcrowded graveyards should not continue to be used.  I think we must answer in the affirmative.  I am prepared to give both Deputies the undertaking that if they can make cases, if any individual can make a case to me for burial in that particular graveyard, and there is more than three feet nine inches from the surface of the soil to the top of the coffin, I am prepared to reconsider favourably such an application.

      <P>Did you take the soundings?  I understand that exception was taken to this boring machine being used on the graves, and I find now from the Deputies that other than authorised persons have been taking soundings there.  That discloses, therefore, a very serious matter.  I accept the Deputy's word that he was present.</P>

      <P>You can rest assured that I did not make the Order.  The Order was made by the then Minister, and it was to come into force on the 1st September, 1954.  I had nothing to do with the fixing of that date.  I have not even power to cancel the Order. All I can do is to add to the schedule of permits for further interments in it. I am prepared to take, and have taken, a very liberal view in that respect.  I have allowed 111 people to procure further interments there.  I think that is a very liberal view in view of the fact that the deputation assured me that there would be very few applications for interments in that particular portion of the old graveyard.  I am not finished yet.  If the Deputies or applicants can put up a reasonable case, I am prepared to add to the schedule of permissive users of the graveyard.  I want the Deputies to be clear that the initiative in this case was taken by the Cork County Council, that the Order was made by the then Minister, and I have had neither hand, act nor part in the making of it.  The only thing I did was to add to the terms of the schedule.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Thursday, 28th April, 1955.</P>
