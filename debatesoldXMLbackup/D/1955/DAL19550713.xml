    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Everett) James Everett">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Everett)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the resolution standing in my name on the Order Paper:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="681" /> That Dáil Éireann hereby approves of the Garda Síochána Pensions Order, 1955, made on the 7th day of June, 1955, by the Minister for Justice, with the sanction of the Minister for Finance, under Section 13 of the Police Forces Amalgamation Act, 1925, and laid before Dáil Éireann on 18th June, 1955.</P>
    <P>The Garda Síochána Pensions Order, 1955, which I am asking the House to approve, contains several amendments to existing Pensions Orders.  A memorandum has been circulated to Deputies explaining the effect of the amendments.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will observe from the memorandum the Order effects many improvements in the Garda Pensions Code.  It increases the annual allowance payable in respect of a child of a deceased member; provides, in certain cases, for the allowance for a child to be payable until it reaches the age of 18½ years instead of the previous age of 16 years and also for the payment of allowances in respect of children adopted under the Adoption Act, 1952.</P>
    <P>It removes a provision which pressed very hardly on some pensioners in the past&mdash;the provision that pension awards payable, following injury to or death of a member of the force, could be reduced if compensation was received in respect of the injury or death.</P>
    <P>It also includes a provision to enable members of the force who were formerly members of the Taca Síochána to reckon in certain circumstances, up to half their service in the latter force for pension purposes.  A defect in an earlier Order regarding the calculation of retirement gratuities payable to members retired on special pension in consequence of injuries sustained on duty, has been remedied.</P>
    <P>The Order will operate to the advantage of members of the force and I trust that the House will find no difficulty in signifying its approval.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Everett)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £59,320 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1956 for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Justice.</P>
      <P>I propose, if the House agrees, to follow the same procedure as in previous years and to deal generally with the group of Estimates Nos. 29 to 37 for which I am responsible as Minister. These Estimates, which are all for essential services, show little change as compared with previous years and I am sure that the House will not expect me to give a detailed explanation of them.</P>
      <P>The aggregate amount of the nine Estimates is £5,206,920, an increase of £53,880 as compared with the Estimates for 1954-55.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first Estimate, No. 29, is for a total of £88,980 for the Office of the Minister for Justice.  It shows an increase of £3,700 as compared with last year.  This is mainly due to the occurrence during the year of 53 pay days for staff paid weekly, and the provision of additional staff for the Office of An Bord Uchtála.  The increases due to the foregoing are offset to some extent by the retrenchment of other clerical posts.  Last year reference was made to the Adoption Act, 1952.  The administration of this Act is now proceeding smoothly.  During the year 1954 the number of adoption Orders made was 888, an increase of 507 as compared with 1953.  The board now have the services of a specially <Col N="683" /> qualified inspector to assist them in the investigation of applications to adopt.</P>
    <P>The next Estimate, No. 30, is for £4,519,920 for the Garda Síochána.  It shows an increase of £69,670 as compared with the Estimate for 1953-54. There is a decrease of £65,815 under the pay sub-head due mainly to the retirement of members receiving the maximum rate of pay and their replacement by recruits at the minimum rate. The main increases are £18,012 for clothing and equipment (sub-head E), and £122,385 for pensions and gratuities (sub-head P).  The increase in the cost of clothing and equipment is due to the provision of better quality cloth for Garda uniform.  The cost of pensions is an ever-increasing charge and will continue to increase for some years before the peak is reached as more and more of those who were recruited in the early days of the force reach the age of retirement or become eligible to retire on full pension.</P>
    <P>Since April, 1948, the strength of the force has fallen from 7,510 all ranks to 6,699 on the 1st April of this year; a reduction of 811.  Two factors have operated to reduce the strength; the stoppage of recruiting for some years and the large increase in the number of retirements on pension during the past three years.  Retirements on pension either voluntarily or on reaching age limits in 1952 totalled 156; in 1953 the number was 310 and in 1954 it was 362.  The total wastage in 1954 including retirements on health grounds, deaths, dismissals, etc., was 448.</P>
    <P>As indicated in the previous paragraph, an increase in the number of retirements may be expected each year over the next few years.  There are nearly 3,500 members of the force who are over 50 years of age.  A very large number of these have 30 years' service and can consequently retire on pension at any time.  Over 1,000 members of the force have 33 years' service and are in a position to retire and receive full pension in addition to the maximum lump sum gratuity payable under the Garda Síochána Pensions Order, 1951. It is anticipated that pensions and/or gratuities will be payable in respect of 480 additional members of the force <Col N="684" /> during the year 1955-56.  It is proposed during the year to enrol 450 recruits.</P>
    <P>The provision of cars for use at district headquarters is continuing. Fifteen additional cars are to be provided during the current year and this will leave about 30 districts yet to be supplied.  The cars are required to provide greater mobility for the smaller number of men now attached to stations.  In addition to these cars it is proposed to provide six motor cycles to increase the traffic control squads on duty in and around Dublin.</P>
    <P>The Prisons Estimate, No. 31, at £185,740, is £9,790 less than last year; the decrease is mainly due to the fall in the number of prisoners and reduced expenditure on the improvement and maintenance of buildings.  The daily average number of prisoners in custody has fallen over the past ten years from 732 to 450.  There is a very marked decline in the number of women prisoners, the daily average number in custody in 1945 was 97, in 1954 it was only 27.  Having regard to the continuous fall in the number of persons in custody, I am considering whether it would be possible to close some of the existing establishments.</P>
    <P>Estimate No. 32 for the District Court is for £83,540 and shows a decrease of £10,000 as compared with 1954-55.  This decrease is accounted for in the main by reduced provision being required for the pay and travelling expenses of temporary district justices, lesser factors being a reduction of four in the total staff employed and a smaller provision for additional clerical assistance.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is need for me to say anything about Estimates Nos. 33 to 37 for the Circuit Court, the Supreme and High Courts, the Land Registry and Registry of Deeds, the Public Record Office and the Office of Charitable Donations and Bequests. The small variations in the sums included for the current year as compared with 1953-54 are due to minor adjustments in staffs and adjustments of pay consequent on the grant of normal increases in salary.  With regard to the Land Registry I would, however, like to refer to the arrears <Col N="685" /> which accumulated, following the end of emergency, in connection with the completion of the registration of Land Commission vestings.  These arrears were caused by the progressive increase in the number of such vestings over the post-war years.  Last year when the Estimates were being introduced the hope was expressed that when introducing the Estimates for 1955-56 the Minister for Justice would be in a position to report that the arrears had been cleared off.  I am glad to be able to state that this is so, the work in connection with the registration of Land Commission vestings is now up to date.</P>
    <P>It has been customary for the Minister for Justice when introducing the Estimates for his Department to give a brief summary of the volume of crime in this country.  I propose to continue the practice.</P>
    <P>I am glad to be able to tell the House that the upward trend in indictable crime which was a cause of much concern in recent years was reversed in 1954.  The interim figures for 1954 show a substantial and very welcome decrease of 22 per cent. compared with 1953.  The actual decrease was 3,514, the number of indictable offences being 12,088.</P>
    <P>The decrease is accounted for mainly by a decrease of nearly 3,000 in the Dublin metropolitan area where the number of larcenies of pedal cycles was down by over 2,500 and the number of housebreakings down by 382.  Decreases in other classes of indictable offences were smaller but there was some decrease in every class.</P>
    <P>The decrease can be attributed in part to an increase in police strength in the metropolitan area and we may hope that this will continue to have effect.  It is too soon to say whether the improvement shown last year will be maintained and while we welcome it as a step in the right direction (and a very big one at that, for a single year) we cannot be satisfied while the figures are still nearly double what they were before the war.</P>
    <P>There was little change in the level of juvenile crime.  The number of persons <Col N="686" /> under 18 years of age who committed indictable offences was 2,524, a reduction of 33 compared with 1953. The number charged in court was, however, down by 416, to 2,058, but this was almost entirely due to the fact that, in certain types of cases, the Attorney-General has authorised superintendents to caution children under 14 years of age instead of prosecuting them.  This authority was exercised in 471 cases in 1954.  I would refer Deputies who may be interested in this point to the Dáil Debates for 11th November, 1953, where the instructions are quoted in full.</P>
    <P>There was a reduction of over 21,000 in the number of prosecutions for summary offences.  The number of these prosecutions in 1954 was just over 109,500.  This is much the same as before the war.  In 1938, for instance, the number was 104,188.  As usual, most of the prosecutions&mdash;over 61,000&mdash; were for road traffic offences.  Next came offences against the licensing laws (16,634), unlicensed dogs (7,167), and offences against the School Attendances Act (4,457).  The prosecutions for road traffic offences were down by over 17,000, compared with 1953, but I fear that I cannot go so far as to say that that reduction is a sign of improving standards of driving.  I think it is mainly due to the fact that the Garda are becoming less inclined to prosecute for trivial traffic offences of a technical nature.  That is a tendency which I am glad to encourage, for it is more important to concentrate on bad and inconsiderate driving on the roads than to watch out for motorists who may spend half a minute too long in a limited parking place.</P>
    <P>The Estimates, as I said at the beginning, are all for essential services.  They vary little from year to year and I trust that the House will find no difficulty in approving of them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter for congratulation that the crime figures have gone down and the Minister for Justice is right in saying that in Dublin it is largely due to the increase in the police force.  When I was in office I agreed with the commissioner's action in closing some of the country stations where <Col N="687" /> the Guards are hardly needed at all. hope that trend will continue.</P>
      <P>I have not got a great deal to say on the remainder of the Estimate but I want to bring up some matters not mentioned by the Minister.  When I went back to the Department in 1951 the Department had almost completed a scheme of reorganisation of the District and Circuit Courts.  They had it on paper after the passing of the Courts of Justice Act of 1953 which increased the jurisdiction of the Circuit and District Courts.</P>
      <P>I promised the Dáil to set up a small committee of inquiry to examine the question and to see what the effect was likely to be of the increased jurisdiction&mdash;whether it would mean less work for the Circuit Court and more for the District Court, and so on.  We had gone as far as getting the consent of a High Court judge to preside, but when we saw there was going to be a general election and as we did not know what the result would be, I thought it better to postpone it.</P>
      <P>On the Estimate last year&mdash;I think the Taoiseach took charge of it&mdash; I asked if it was still proposed to go ahead with that reorganisation of these courts and he said it was, or that it was proposed to go ahead with this committee of inquiry.  The opinion of his Department, with which I agreed at the time, was that, if the District Court and Circuit Court were reorganised, it would result in a saving of perhaps seven and certainly five district justices and one circuit judge. I have not heard anything about that yet and I should like to know if the idea has been dropped altogether.  I am quite satisfied that the Department when I was Minister were perfectly satisfied that we could do with at least five district justices and one circuit judge less.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was just a matter of deciding whether the increased jurisdiction would increase the amount of work and if there was an increase in Circuit Court work there should be a corresponding reduction in the work of the High Court.  I should like to know what the Minister has to say, if anything, <Col N="688" /> on the matter.  I should also like to ask whether the increased jurisdiction decided on here by a free vote &mdash;a very big majority of Deputies voted in favour of increasing the jurisdiction in tort up to £50&mdash;has been given effect to yet and if the rules of the District Court have been agreed to.  I think the House is entitled to know something about that.</P>
    <P>There is another matter on which I got plenty of abuse here in relation to the Rent Restrictions Act.  I am not advocating legislation, but I should like to know what has been the result of the examination by the Government of Judge Conroy's report.  Are we to expect anything from it or is it to be put on the long finger again?  I do not think the Minister can do what my predecessor did&mdash;set up another commission.  That saved a few years, but he will find it difficult to do that. I notice that the Minister very carefully avoided any reference whatever to that important matter.</P>
    <P>A further matter which concerned me as Minister at the time was the matter of conviction of drunken drivers.  I took a different line from the present Minister with regard to this matter and I am sure that people must have thought that I take a lighthearted view of it.  That is not the fact.  When the 1951 Act was going through, I strenuously opposed giving the Minister for Justice or any Minister power to restore a drunken driver's licence, and we went so far on this side as to put down an amendment seeking to exempt forfeitures under the Road Traffic Act from the powers being given to the Minister to restore a licence.  We were turned down by the House.  I pressed the matter, and, on my pressure, the Minister promised to introduce an amendment in the Seanad to make it obligatory on the Minister for Justice to publish in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> any case in which he restored a licence which had been forfeited as a result of conviction for drunken driving.</P>
    <P>When I came back, I found this power there.  I had been Minister previously, but had no such power, and was glad that I had not, although I did feel that there were cases in which <Col N="689" /> somebody should have the power of restoring a drunken driver's licence&mdash; but not the Minister.  The Minister should never have it and the advice I got from the Department was that I should not exercise that power at all. I felt, and still feel, that I had no right to take that advice.  I feel that when an Act of Parliament was passed even though I disapproved of it, there was a duty on me to listen to any petition brought before me and to decide the question on its merits.</P>
    <P>As I say, I do not think it is a power that should have been given to any Minister, but it was there, and consequently I went into every petition that came to me.  Perhaps I may have been too lenient&mdash;I do not think I was&mdash;but there were some line-ball cases, and in some cases where a man was convicted, the justice said that if he petitioned the Minister, he would recommend the restoration of the licence, but that the Road Traffic Act gave him no option but to call for the forfeiture for a year of the offender's licence.  There were some cases like that&mdash;not very many, I admit&mdash;but there were others in which a man with a wife and family would have lost his job as a result of conviction.  In those cases, a job might turn up six or eight months before he could get his licence back and the line I took in these circumstances was that if the Guards were able to report that he had not been drinking in the meantime, and was likely not to offend again, I thought I was entitled to restore the licence, and I did so.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister is justified in the line he has taken, but if he had gone into even one such case in the year he has been in office, it would be an indication that he had considered these matters, but I read a statement by him in the papers that under no circumstances whatever would he restore such a licence.  I doubt very much if any Minister is entitled to ignore an Act of this kind, and I think the Minister is bound, if anyone puts forward a petition, to consider it&mdash;not necessarily to grant it, but to consider it on its merits.  That was my line and I have no apology to make for it.  I raise the matter here because I am <Col N="690" /> sure I was made to appear in a very bad light before the general public.</P>
    <P>What the Minister should do now is to press for an amendment of either the Road Traffic Act or the particular Criminal Justice Act which gives that power to the Minister.  Somebody should have the right to restore a licence.  If a person commits murder or other such serious crime and is not executed, in due course he gets a remission of sentence.  If a man is sentenced for an ordinary crime, if his behaviour is good, he gets a remission of one-quarter of his term and there should be no differentiation made as between those cases and the case of a person who loses his driving licence as a result of conviction for drunken driving, if he has behaved himself in the meantime. A question was raised with regard to this matter which had the effect of making me appear in a very bad light, although I did get a certain amount of satisfaction because there was a time when I was considered to be the reverse&mdash;too soft.</P>
    <P>The question of a registrar in Kilkenny was raised by Deputy Walsh some time ago and the Minister gave me a shock when he said that I had censured the particular county registrar. I remembered the circumstances when he mentioned the matter, although I had forgotten them.  There was something amiss in that office, but I have no recollection whatever of having censured this registrar.  He wrote a letter when he had gone out on pension, stating that he had never been censured by me, and I am quite satisfied that he was correct in saying that.  The Minister said I did censure him, but I remember now exactly what happened.  There was some little difference of opinion between two members of the staff and something had to be done by the Department to set the matter right and it was set right, but the registrar was in no way responsible, except that he was head of the office and, I suppose, should have kept discipline there.  It was merely a matter of a disagreement between two members of the staff which was afterwards settled.  This particular man seems to be very upset indeed&mdash;he thinks there is a reflection <Col N="691" /> on his character&mdash;and I think the Minister should look into the matter and make it clear that there was nothing against the man's character and that I did not, in fact, censure him.  It is due both to me and to the person concerned that that should be done.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated on that occasion that these county registrars were pampered servants of the State because they got a pension after 30 years.  The fact of the matter is, as I know, that most of those who are appointed registrars are generally in the early 40's. They are very rarely in their 30's and it is impossible for them to serve the 30 years to enable them to get the full pension, unless they are allowed to go to 70 years of age, and the practice always has been to give a man a year by year extension, provided his health remains good.  Those people were always entitled to expect that they would get an extension if they were satisfactory.  If there is a change in policy, that is another matter.  When I was there, except in one or two cases, I always agreed to give that extension.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that the Adoption Act is working well.  I made a note of the figure the Minister gave, 888 cases during the year.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister must be troubled about the possibility of a great number of Guards retiring. When I was there, I was saying that if those who were entitled to retire on pension and get a gratuity did so the Estimate for the Department was going to soar.  For that reason the Minister will have to take care that plenty of new men come in.  It is over 30 years since the State was set up and a great number of the men&mdash;I think he said over 3,000&mdash;are in a position to retire.  For that reason he will have to see that, even though it would cost money, the recruits are kept up.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>It is heartening to hear from the Minister about the reduction in crime and I hope it will continue. There is one point which was mentioned by Deputy Boland.  Notwithstanding that he was Minister for some years&mdash;and whatever comments I have to make there is no question of <Col N="692" /> personality in them&mdash;I cannot agree with his views about the Minister's action towards drunken drivers.  I want to congratulate the Minister wholeheartedly on his recent statement that he would show no mercy to them. Why should he show mercy to drunken drivers?  Why should drunken drivers be allowed to career around the country with so many lives at stake, going into court afterwards with a sob story about having had &ldquo;a few too many&rdquo;?</P>
      <P>We have seen many letters in the evening papers about faulty education of our children.  I wonder if some of those drivers ever had any education. Do they realise that they have not full authority, when sitting behind the wheel of a car, to ignore human life on the side of the road?  Too often have we heard and known of cases of unfortunate victims left dead on the roadside through the action of drunken drivers.  If the present Minister never did anything else during his term of office than act according to what he has said, showing no mercy to them, he will have justified his inclusion in the Cabinet of the present Government as Minister for Justice.</P>
      <P>We want to make it perfectly clear that we are solidly behind the Minister. On any occasion on which I have been asked in South Cork&mdash;as we all are in our own constituencies&mdash;to make representations on behalf of a person who comes along with a story that he was drunk, I have said, and I believe it is right to say, that we should take nothing into consideration on behalf of these people.  I know we cannot go into it in any detail here.  Deputy Boland has said that the Minister should consider border-line cases.  What are the courts there for?  My reading of the local and national newspapers is that in some cases the doctors and the judges seem to place them all on the border-line, even where the victim was left dead on the road.  It has been amazing to see people getting away with it.  Where there is a conviction, there is no question of border-line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that during his term of office the Minister should do everything possible to tighten up the law as regards fair play and as to whether a person is drunk or sober.  There should be no question of doubt one way or <Col N="693" /> the other, or giving such a doubt, if there is one, to a person who believes that just because he or she is behind the wheel of a car they have the road to themselves.  I believe the Minister meant what he said and, please God, he will continue to put into operation his policy in that respect.  We want none of these people leaving Dublin City or Cork City, going out to road houses, having a good time and when they are coming back acting in such a way that no one is safe on the road with them.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Boland in regard to the Rent Restrictions Act and the Minister knows our attitude in the matter.  Too long have people been suffering from injustice in this respect. It is about time something was done to give them justice and to help those who have been victims of this vicious system, which unfortunately is still in operation.  I have no intention of blaming one Government or the other. All the years back this system, which should have been altered long before now, has been continued.  We want something done at the earliest possible date to help the people who are suffering under this present unfair system of rent restrictions.</P>
    <P>As my final remark, may I say there is credit due to the Garda Síochána for their work?  I wonder if the Minister is aware that in various parts of the country there are rumblings going on from time to time.  As the old saying goes, &ldquo;there is no smoke without fire.&rdquo; It is being suggested from many parts of the country&mdash;not just Dublin or Cork &mdash;that if you want promotion in the Garda Síochána now you have to come from a certain small part of a certain big county.  I am not saying whether that is right or wrong&mdash;I have my suspicions, and I think I have reason to have them&mdash;but I am making it clear that in making this statement I am not saying that the Minister is responsible. I leave it to the Minister with these words, that we believe that in a force like the Garda Síochána promotion must be given on merit and on merit alone and not in relation to where you come from or where your father and mother came from.  The sooner that is stopped, the sooner we will have a better force.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="694" /> We know there was a time when there was grave danger&mdash;some seven or eight years ago&mdash;of the police force becoming political.  We do not want that to happen in this country.  We want to have the police force far removed from Party politics.  We want the members of the police force to be content knowing that they will get promotion on their merits and not because they come from a certain place.</P>

      <P>Between the persons unused to the consumption of alcohol and those who are used to some extent to consume alcohol the quality of mercy becomes strained as would appear from some of the speeches made from time to time in this House.  I think the Minister is a very remarkable man for having pursued the policy he has pursued in relation to this matter of the drunken driver.  I think he has done a great deal of social good.  Apart from whether he has not waived a right inherent in the law or whether it is advisable for him to do an act of that kind, the stand he has taken in refusing to consider the restoration of licences which are revoked or any amelioration of the sentence imposed on drunken drivers has done a great deal of good.  There is no question about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is remarkable inasmuch as his attitude in this matter has been at times, I suppose, to nearly every Deputy in the House an irksome attitude because all of us have had the experience of constituents of ours being in trouble of that kind.  I think we all had the job of trying to change the Minister's view in respect of the particular person in whom we were interested.  They all uniformly met with the same attitude on the part of the Minister.  I think he deserves credit for that particular stand alone.  He stood against the importunities of practically all of us in that matter.  From that has flowed a social good inasmuch as people are somewhat more careful now about the amount of alcohol they will consume when they go out to the bona fides and when driving cars generally. Enough has been and will be said, God knows, about that.  Drunken drivers cannot be condoned in any circumstances <Col N="695" /> by those in authority and must be put down.</P>
    <P>It is rather peculiar though to me and somewhat inexplicable that in the returns showing the incidence of fatal accidents through road traffic for the past 12 months&mdash;they were published two or three months ago &mdash; there was only one fatal accident out of about 170 directly attributable to drunken drivers.  That is an extraordinary and inexplicable thing but there it is.  The Minister has stated his attitude and although, as I said, at times it may irk us as individuals, we all certainly appreciate it from him.  He has done a great social and national good in taking that step.</P>
    <P>Another remarkable development and a very healthy one, I think, is that mentioned by the Minister in his speech, that the average daily prison population has reduced in the past ten years from 732 to 450.  That surely is a pointer to the direction in which things are going generally.  I think it can be said that to some extent, not entirely, of course, the number of people in prison indicates the condition of prosperity of a country.  It indicates whether the country is improving in material prosperity or not and it reflects an advancement in the general condition of the people over the years.</P>
    <P>As for the 450 unfortunate people we now have in our prisons, I would urge the Minister&mdash;I do not think there is much need for me to urge this upon him; I do not think there would be any disagreement among any members of the House in respect of this particular view of mine&mdash;to treat them with the greatest possible kindness and, bearing in mind the correction of the vicious elements that at all times are there, see to it that when these people eventually complete their prison sentence they will be helped back to a normal living.  The old idea of putting offenders against the law in prison for the sake of prison and the old idea of vengeance of the State is gone.</P>
    <P>In most enlightened countries the drive now is to secure that persons in prison will emerge from their imprisonment resolved to take up a normal occupation <Col N="696" /> and become normal members of society and fulfil their obligations to society.  I do not think we are too well equipped to secure that here in so far as our prisons are concerned. We have not given enough attention to the problem as to what happens to the person when he walks out of Mountjoy or Marlborough after serving a sentence.  We certainly have not studied his mental attitude when he emerges from prison.  We should have a special sympathy with those who have the misfortune to languish in prison.  Indeed, very many members of this Dáil have spent not an inconsiderable length of time in jails of various kinds.  They should know, and they do know, indeed, the particular problems that are engendered by the confinement of people in jail.</P>
    <P>A great number of us have seen the position of the unfortunate person who has broken the law.  Having served his sentence, he emerges from prison and finds the breath of Ishmael upon him because he has done something as a result of which the social finger is pointed at him.  In other countries efforts have been made to try to do something about that particular problem and to make it somewhat easier for that man or woman to resume a normal way of life.  I think we might do a little more here along these lines. I do not think we are doing enough.</P>
    <P>I confess that I do not know how far the Minister can work towards that end, but it would be a good idea if in the coming year his Department would give some thought to the matter.  It would be a good thing for the community in general if some thought could be given towards better provision for those who leave our jails, after having, to use an old cliché, paid their debt to society.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to a matter which has been very much in the public mind recently and, indeed, over the years. I refer to the blood sport of motor cycling and car racing.  It has become a blood sport.  I wonder how long we will tolerate it?  In my own constituency, in Skerries, I have over a number of years consistently, as a member of the county council and possibly to my own detriment so far as the votes <Col N="697" /> in the Skerries area are concerned, opposed the closing of the roads for what is known as the &ldquo;Skerries 100,&rdquo; a motor cycle contest which takes place each year.  I do not know how many young men have smashed their brains out against walls and gate posts along that circuit, but it is quite a considerable number.</P>
    <P>The same thing applies to the Wicklow circuit.  Only last week we had another fatal accident, a tragic affair, on what is normally a very dangerous part of the road from the Beehive to Rathnew.  As many Deputies know, it is a road on which you would need to be careful even if there were no traffic at all and you were going at a very reasonable rate of speed.  Instead, we had them flashing round&mdash;for what? What good does it do?  What contribution does it make to the interests of humanity to have motor cycles going at 120 miles an hour or motor cars for that matter?</P>
    <P>We have young boys going out from their homes to the distress of parents. Broken-hearted mothers, fathers, brothers and sisters and acquaintances see these young people being killed with almost clock-work regularity every year, and it is called sport.  Then there is the degradation of the individual that is to be seen&mdash;the Roman holiday idea&mdash;the crowds massing at the corners where there is likely to be an accident.  Is that socially good?  As far as I can see the only people benefiting from this are the combines who make the motor cycles and the motor cars.  The young people are hardly to be blamed because young people are always inclined to be adventurous and to do the dangerous thing.  It is the most natural thing in the world that that should be so.  But how often does it end in tragedy?  And are we not contributing to some extent to this foolishness by allowing these, what I describe as blood sports, for they are nothing more than that?</P>
    <P>They are no good nationally or parochially. Some people justify them on the grounds that they bring crowds of tourists.  We would, perhaps, be just as well off without that kind of tourist. Some people say that it means an expenditure of money in the towns <Col N="698" /> when these races are on.  I think it is a very poor mentality that is behind that sort of case where human life is concerned.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister&mdash;and I know no man who would more quickly rush to sympathise with those who suffer by this activity&mdash;to consider what more can be done about stopping these things.  Are we going to go on until we have something like what happened in France at Le Mans when a motor car cut a swathe through a crowd of people and when over 70 people were killed and as many more maimed?  I think we ought to stop it now no matter what organised letter-writing there may be in the papers.  I think the average man or woman will agree that it is a senseless, meaningless practice and there is no justification for allowing any further performances of this so-called sport throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to a very important matter which affects my constituency. It affects the town of Rush and I am sure the Minister has some knowledge of that area.  Rush is a rather unique district inasmuch as it is famous for its small farms, famous as being one of the most productive pieces of land, it is said, in Europe&mdash;and it is probably true from what can be seen of the products.  It is an area on which the City of Dublin leans very heavily for supplies of essential vegetables for the homes of the workers and for the Dublin market generally.</P>
    <P>The people of Rush have been known to be industrious and hardworking for many more years than this House has been in existence.  Many of them have worked their way into positions of relative comfort through long years of hardship.  But it is the pattern of life in Rush I want to talk about. Manual workers as a class, particularly those who work on the land and are associated with land, generally speaking, have little other recreation than the public house when their work is finished in rural and semi-rural areas. Further to that it has been said, and is generally accepted, that a man who works hard with his hands, particularly if he is working on land, will get some physical good in drinking a pint as well <Col N="699" /> as the social recreation with some of his fellow workers.</P>
    <P>That is true of every area in this country, but in Rush a problem has now arisen.  The people of Rush of course work on their land all the hours of daylight.  They do not stop working until daylight leaves the sky.  They must do that in order to preserve their economy, in order to get the fullest production from their land, in order to fulfil their obligations to the City of Dublin regarding the production of vegetables.  They must follow that pattern of life which their ancestors followed for generations.  There has been a general acceptance of that situation by the Gardaí and it has been possible at other times for workers, small farmers and their employees, when they finish work at ten, 11 or 11.30 at night&mdash;and that is the time they will finish working now, having started in the morning at, say, four o'clock: they work from four o'clock right through until possibly 11.30 at night&mdash;to get a drink.  It was accepted that these people were in a rather special position and the licensed vintners of the Rush area were more or less enabled by the exercise of common sense on the part of the Garda authorities to allow those men to come in after their day's work and get a drink.</P>
    <P>Not so now.  The letter of the law is now being imposed on the town of Rush.  For these hard-working men, any law which imposes such hardship&mdash;and it is a real hardship although it may not appear to be a hardship to those who do not drink, the saintly ones&mdash;for men who have been working hard in the fields losing a lot of the natural juices of the body and perspiring and who come in weary at the end of the day of 14 or 15 hours and find they cannot get a drink in their own town as they have been able to get it for many years before&mdash;surely, that is a legitimate grievance.  I am not asking that the law should be changed in respect of the town of Rush.  I hope at some future date it would be possible for us to come into this Dáil untrammelled and unpersecuted and take a free decision about Sunday opening <Col N="700" /> and opening hours generally.  As we all know, it is rather difficult to get in that door untrammelled and unpersecuted at present.  We know that from previous experience.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to direct, in the town of Rush&mdash;and there may be other similar towns where the same thing would apply&mdash;that the Garda authorities in that area should be asked to exercise common sense.  If the law is being so operated in any district as to cause hardship to the majority of people in that area, surely common sense is called for.  The Minister, I think, has always been a broadminded man so far as I know on this particular issue, although a teetotaller himself.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister very strongly to direct, in so far as lies in his power, the Garda authorities in County Dublin to alleviate the position.  They should be asked to allow men who have been enjoying a certain amenity over the years to resume the enjoyment of that amenity.  There was never any trouble given by these people; there was no blackguardism or fights, and they were always well-behaved.  They are the only people that suffer in this respect and I think it is very wrong that that should be so.  In conclusion, I wish to join with other Deputies in complimenting the Minister on the efficient way in which he discharged his onerous obligations during the year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is rather pleasant to hear from the Minister in the course of his statement that the first fruits of his predecessor's policy of recruiting the Garda Síochána is now having its effect.  That is understandable because with greater vigilance I am satisfied that the question of crime can be dealt with.  I believe that if that vigilance is increased by reason of further recruitment to the Garda Síochána, this country can perhaps hold a record of less crime than most other countries. It is quite possible that at the present time we hold such a good record but I am satisfied that the recruitment of the young, active, energetic Gardaí that we can see now around the cities and towns is having its effect on the reduction of crime to which the Minister referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="701" /> Most of us here who live in the city and who have down the years admired the magnificent manner in which the Gardaí on point duty carry out their task have now good reason to say that that efficiency is being handed on to the young men who are now replacing their older comrades.  From every possible point of view the young men that are on view at these various points in the centre of the city must be admired by the thousands of tourists, foreigners, who pass through the city and see these men on point duty.  I think that is one of the most excellent advances that have been made in regard to the Garda Síochána for some time, and I naturally hope that the present Minister will continue recruitment to that organisation.</P>
    <P>There is just one other point I wish to make and that is in respect to the Minister's recent statement in regard to his refusal to deal, good, bad or indifferent, with any question of an appeal from drunken drivers.  I am not advocating that he should grant appeals when they are made to him but what I do feel is that to ignore the legislation which this House passed is not worthy of any Minister or any member of the House.  We have deliberately in this Parliament exercised our rights to pass certain legislation.  As far as I am concerned, I think I was against that particular section or clause in the 1951 Act which empowered the Minister to deal with appeals from sentences by the courts.  I think I am right in saying that I voted against that.  But I cannot understand that, when the House passed that legislation in its wisdom or otherwise, it should be ignored by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The right thing for the Minister to have said would be that his first act in regard to that legislation would be to have it repealed but I think it was entirely wrong to say that every appeal to him would be prejudged whether there was anything in the appeal or not.  On the basis of that statement I assumed the Minister had prejudged every possible case that would come before him.  I think that was wrong and that the Minister ought to make it clear to the House that at the earliest possible opportunity he will take steps to have that <Col N="702" /> particular section repealed.  If he does I can assure him that, as far as I am concerned, I will support him in that.</P>
    <P>The Minister's statement in regard to drunken drivers amounts to prejudging the case.  If any person who was sentenced&mdash;I am speaking now about the loss of his licence&mdash;to the loss of his driving licence, whether it be for a short or a long period, appeals through the legislation provided by this House, he at least ought to be entitled to have that case examined. Unfortunately, as far as I see from the very definite and final kind of statement that the Minister made, that is now denied to him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make reference to-day to one particular matter which is the concern of the Minister for Justice and which has been shown nothing but complete indifference by the members of Dáil Éireann during this debate.  I refer to the matter of game.  The complete indifference which the Minister seems to have shown towards it is only paralleled by the indifference of all the Governments right through the years, since the establishment of the State, to the potentialities of game and the opportunities which exist for the propagation of game birds.</P>
      <P>The first thing to be considered, of course, is the suppression of poaching of game and the illicit taking of game. I think the Guards have been notably inactive in all areas.  They have certainly been noticeably inactive since I first began to go out with a gun and that is since I was legally, and perhaps before it, entitled to be out with a gun.  I have gone out on the first day of each shooting season in my own area.  I am 31 years of age and in the last 11 or 12 years I have never seen a Guard on duty on the first day of the shooting season.  There were times when the shooting of hen pheasants was prohibited during the season.  I have never met a Guard on duty on the first day of the shooting season to ask me to show him the contents of my bag.  I do not think that one fowler out of every 20 or 30 has had the experience of meeting a Guard on duty and being asked had he a hen pheasant, or hen pheasants, in his bag.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="703" /> The Guards are noticeably inactive. That is the only way I can put it; but, if they are, the present policy of the Department of Justice of closing small Garda stations and replacing them with patrol cars will mean that the extreme difficulty facing the Guards, if they did try to do anything&mdash;and, mark you, they do not&mdash;would be multiplied and will in future be multiplied. As I see it, therefore, there is not the slightest chance of getting any degree of control exercised through the efforts of the Garda Síochána.  The only way in which I can visualise such control is by convincing the holders of the land, if necessary in conjunction with a liaison with the Minister for Agriculture and his Department, that they must see to it that the game birds upon their lands are not meddled with during the close season and ensure that only reputable persons who will not do things like shooting hen pheasants are allowed to shoot over the land.  No effort has been made up to this by the Minister for Justice to do anything along that line.  Until he makes an effort there will be no hope for game in this country.</P>
    <P>Recently, a European nobleman, Baron Konopke, arrived in this country and he made a survey of the potentialities of game stocks and shooting here.  He inevitably&mdash;I think inevitably anyhow&mdash;arrived at the conclusion that we had wonderful potentialities but that at the moment all he could see from the point of view of tourism and the bringing of people here to shoot was that we had very good snipe shooting.  That is all we have because snipe are not wanted for the pot.  That is the only reason why we have them; most snipe are migratory with the exception of those which are more or less indigenous. Baron Konopke said that in Scotland groups of people went to shoot and paid colossal sums for the privilege of doing so.  They thereby enriched the tourist industry in Scotland.  Now I will be sincere and say that I do not think a man like Baron Konopke or our own big landowners have a great contribution to make towards the propagation of game because I think there are <Col N="704" /> so few of them left that all they can do is preserve a certain game sanctuary in places where the game laws are naturally adhered to.  The day of the titled landowner is gone.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Thanks be to God, is right.  The person whom the Minister for Justice must convince now is the ordinary small farmer, the average-sized farmer and the farm labourer; he must convince them that there will be something for them if they can keep their game from being interfered with and from being poached.  I want to make a suggestion now to the Minister. There is at the moment a scheme about to be launched under the aegis of the Minister for Agriculture.  In ten or 15 years that scheme will cover the entire country.  I refer to the parish plan.  There is envisaged in that scheme a parish committee covering three parishes.  If the Minister for Justice in liaison with the Minister for Agriculture could initiate inside this parish plan schemes for the propagation of game and the destruction of vermin he could with very little expenditure do a tremendous amount to improve game stocks here.</P>
      <P>If he does that the people who own the land will become interested.  At the moment they are not interested and the son of the house when he is eight or nine years old can go out and take 13 eggs out of a pheasant's nest, bring them home and try to hatch them just for the novelty of it, and his parents do not see anything wrong.  That is true all over the country.  If these people could be brought to a realisation that they have something which is both beautiful and profitable for the country as a whole, and in relation to which they themselves will have the right of deciding who shall enjoy this privilege, we would get somewhere.</P>
      <P>I recommend the suggestion to the Minister.  When he does what I have suggested, if he does it, and I think it is the only way in which game can be propagated here, he should at the same time offer bounties for the destruction of vermin and offer pheasant eggs or game bird eggs at low prices or at no price at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="705" /> About two months ago I instituted a kind of private inquiry into what was being done for game stocks here.  While I discovered that very, very large sums of money were being collected through the medium of licences, etc., it is no harm to say that the total amount expended&mdash;and I asked questions of practically every Department of State which would have anything at all to do with the matter&mdash;on the propagation of game was £210 which the Minister for Industry and Commerce advanced to hotels last year for the purpose of buying pheasants' eggs.  That was the total expenditure.</P>
    <P>If the Minister for Justice will approach the people on the land, the decent farmers and their workers, and initiate through the parish plan a scheme, first of all, of subsidy for game birds' eggs or game birds themselves in certain areas and, secondly, a bounty for the destruction of vermin he will do something which will bring to this country even from a financial point of view considerable profits.  I ask him to consider that suggestion very seriously.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The question raised by Deputy Traynor is, perhaps, one of the most serious arising under this Estimate.  I would like to add a gloss because of the personal knowledge and experience I have had in seeing how the courts work in these matters.  There was at one time a certain type of offence in relation to which the Legislature for one reason or another thought it wise to remove discretion from the courts.  In other words, a penalty was imposed in regard to the crime of being drunk in charge of a car&mdash;undoubtedly a very serious crime&mdash;and that meant that the penalty so imposed was not in the discretion of the judge who awarded it.  If the accused was found guilty there was an automatic or mandatory sentence involving disqualification for 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was a rather unusual thing in our law.  Generally speaking, the maximum penalty is what is prescribed and the rest is left to the discretion of the judge or justice, as the case may be.  The only other outstanding instance I can think of of this kind of thing is in relation to murder; in that <Col N="706" /> case the death sentence is mandatory. Obviously an exceptional provision like that was not inserted without very good reason and the reason behind that provision, if my interpretation is right, was that some justices were inclined to be too lenient and others were perhaps a little bit too harsh.  There was a lack of uniformity.  Furthermore, there was always the feeling that in dealing with a matter of this nature, such as the licensing laws as a whole, it was very difficult for the courts to administer the law equitably.  Therefore this provision was put in away back, I think, in the 1933 Act.  I wonder was that wise?  Was it wise to deal with the matter in that way?</P>
    <P>It meant, first of all, as it did in the beginning, that, having found the person guilty of that crime, there was this automatic disqualification without any variation.  That was originally as the law was.  Like the penalty, that was not strictly equitable.  A number of us have seen cases like that.  We have seen where a relatively well-to-do free type of youngish person, whose father or somebody close to him has plenty of means, misbehaves himself with a car and is disqualified.  It does not mean a snap of the fingers to him. On the other hand I have seen an unfortunate lorry driver&mdash;this is some years ago in the Minister's own county &mdash;who was not given the benefit of the doubt, and I think certain people who heard the case felt there was a doubt. The case was on appeal and the lorry driver lost his licence for 12 months. He lost his employment and his family were destitute.</P>
    <P>That is a case I saw.  In the two cases there was inequity.  There was the case where the disqualification was not a penalty at all.  For instance you have a wife or somebody well off who drives a car only for pleasure.  Disqualification does not mean a snap of the fingers for her as it did in the case of the lorry driver who had two bottles of stout after a very tiring day but who, nevertheless, on his way home was held up.  Undoubtedly he was a danger and the Guards acted quite properly but the judge, having found him guilty within the section, had to disqualify him as the law was and the <Col N="707" /> consequences to that man and to his family were entirely out of proportion to the consequences in the other type of case of which I have spoken.  I can conceive that that probably was the genesis of the amending section that has been the cause of dispute in that sense.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>You have a very different thing there.  If it applies to all law it only reinforces the argument I am going to make where you have made an exception in regard to all law, a very great exception, because in the case of all law there is, in the first instance, discretion.  In the case at the first hearing and in the case of the appellant judge there was a discretion to vary and to adjust within the maximum.  Secondly, in the case of all law when these things are dealt with in a routine, unexceptional way with a discretion to exercise the prerogative of mercy&mdash;but I think the Parliamentary Secretary has been anticipating the argument I was about to make.  Perhaps I am slow.  An amending provision was brought in in 1951. I have not gone into detail about it which does not matter.  It is the principle of the thing that is difficult. I cannot remember rightly at the moment but I think I moved an amendment to this and having been the person who opposed the provision&mdash;I want to state that again, I was the person who opposed it&mdash;I am perhaps in the strongest position to say what I am about to say now.</P>

    <P>That Bill was passed by the Government of that time but it was not passed without qualms on all sides of the House.  Some of us voted against it.  What was the effect of that provision? It was, we will say, brought in to meet the dangers as already outlined but it meant putting the appellant jurisdiction in the hands of the Minister.  I think that was unwise and I shall always think so.  Two successive Ministers have dealt with it in two different ways and I do not think the situation is a satisfactory one from the <Col N="708" /> public point of view.  The present Minister's predecessor considered&mdash;and I think rightly considered&mdash;that Parliament having placed a duty on his shoulders, he was compelled to adjudicate on these cases.  Parliament had seen fit under the leadership of the Minister for Justice at the time&mdash;a colleague of the present Minister&mdash;to place the appellant jurisdiction on the Minister.  Deputy Boland as Minister for Justice, exercised that jurisdiction. That there was need for exercising such a jurisdiction in the particular circumstances anybody who looks at the files will have to admit at once.</P>
    <P>There were, as I have said, cases like that of the lorry driver and the other types I have mentioned and there could be considerable hardship and positive injustice.  Deputy Boland when Minister came under criticism for exercising that jurisdiction and probably, as I believe, it is not a proper jurisdiction for a Minister to have.  I think, from various points of view, that it is undesirable there should be any more interference with the ordinary and common law procedure than is absolutely necessary.  It is a question of principle completely.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>It can be delegated but it would be much better to have the procedure follow ordinary practice. The present Minister seems to have met this dilemma in another way.  He has simply refused to adjudicate in these appeals at all on the basis, I take it, that it was not proper &mdash; that it was not a proper matter for the Minister to have to adjudicate on such matters.  Of course I may be wrong in so summarising the Minister's attitude but I am open to correction.  I think the way the present Minister meets this situation is no better and no more satisfactory than the previous situation because there will always be cases which demand a review as Deputy Traynor says.  There will always be such instances where a variation will be necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of ordinary crimes, after the initial hearing there is the machinery for a later review as Deputy Traynor said.  There should be more <Col N="709" /> elasticity in the beginning, otherwise the most difficult cases and the cases most deserving of adjustment may receive harsh treatment at the beginning just as the Minister has pointed out in other cases decisions may be completely inadequate in view of the circumstances.  In the light of that I think the first thing to be done is to remove that jurisdiction from the Minister. But that must not be done by the Minister just disclaiming the responsibility.  That is a very bad precedent&mdash;to have Ministers, particularly Ministers for Justice, throwing off their responsibility or, in effect, disclaiming it.  I am sympathetic and I understand what the Minister is up against in this.</P>
    <P>I think that the Minister should divest himself formally and legally of these powers.  It is a very easy thing to do, and I think that he would have support in doing it.  That would immediately restore the <i>status quo</i> and solve the Minister's problems, but I regret to say that I do not think it will solve the whole problem surrounding this experiment in regard to drunken drivers.  It is a very serious crime and often is a murderous crime.  I think that, when all is said and done, looking at it by and large, we will have to rely on the judiciary to enforce the law equitably.  That is what they are there for.  It is too easy an escape of your problems or of the differences in judgment, or the criticisms which will always be with us, no matter what action is taken by anybody, to try and hedge the judiciary or any other institution with formal rules to ensure absolute unanimity and an apparent automatic determination of cases.</P>
    <P>You cannot reduce justice to, shall I say, the working of certain Departments in the Civil Service.  I think that, in the last analysis, you will have to get back to the principle that judges and justices are properly appointed, that they are in their job and are competent to do it.  Where you have a system where there is an immediate appeal, as there is in these cases which are decided in the first instance by the District Court, and where there is an appeal to the Circuit Court, surely that is the best mechanism to ensure justice.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="710" /> We have had this experiment.  We could go over all the arguments for and against it and possibly come to the same decision that was come to in 1943, and before that, but the difference in the present situation is that we have had experience in trying out this experiment of automatic disqualification, and then of trying to meet any injustices that came in its train which, I think, was something as objectionable&mdash;if not more objectionable&mdash;as what went on before.</P>
    <P>Therefore, in asking the Minister to repeal this provision, I think we can go further and say: fix your maximum penalty, as you do in the ordinary case, but put the duty back on the courts, where it properly belongs; put an appellate jurisdiction in the courts, and put this crime on all-fours with other serious crime.  In the long run, that would probably be the better thing.  We should be able to stand up to the occasional criticism that there will be of court decisions.  You have that in all cases.  At the time, these decisions may appear to some people to be outrageous, but in the long run, if one reviews the general administration of justice by the courts, and particularly of criminal justice in peacetime, the record is very satisfactory.  I think we are all agreed on that.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy MacEoin, when he was Minister for Justice, who introduced the provision which is the cause of the trouble now.  I think that the present Minister, in the light of our experience and equally with our experience in regard to the 1933 Act, should now tackle this problem and put it on a regular basis.  So much for that.  At the moment, his position is as unsatisfactory as ever, particularly as the Minister is now simply evading responsibility, if you like.  He is not carrying the responsibility that has been placed on him.  I would agree, if he argued, that it is not a proper responsibility to be carried, but the position is unsatisfactory.  It is a position for which I do not blame the present Minister himself.  In regard to crime as a whole, the position is unsatisfactory.  Under the present situation you have the position where there is virtually no appeal &mdash; where <Col N="711" /> there should be an appeal in all cases. Therefore, here is something that wants to be cleared up.</P>
    <P>I should like to say a word about the Gardaí as we are going, to a certain extent, through a transition phase as regards the Garda Síochána in that we have had a large number of young men recruited in recent times.  They are now replacing the older generation of Gardaí who were, more or less, all of the one age and experience.  The setting up of a police force in this State was successful.  The Guards with, shall I say, an appalling background and record of police work behind them, had to start very much behind scratch, taking the place of other policemen who were hated and abhorred by the population.  In a relatively short time they were quite successful.  As we know, in the past, the R.I.C. were not a police force but a garrison who pretty ruthlessly suppressed the population.  Deputies know that the Gardaí had to take over legitimate police work with such a background.</P>
    <P>Now, it is very much to the credit of that force that they not only did that in the circumstances in which they did it, and of the upsets of the time, but that they were able to establish themselves with the people as part of the people.  They are now accepted throughout the country as part of the people and part of the nation, and there are very good relations between the Gardaí and the civil population. The people are proud of them.</P>
    <P>There is another thing in connection with the Gardaí that I should like to advert to.  It is that they have proved themselves to be the loyal servants of the people and of the legitimate Government of the day.  They have been prepared to do their duty to all the successive Governments that have been here, loyally and fearlessly.  They have administered the civil law, in so far as it comes within their purview, and the criminal law as fairly and efficiently as any police force that I know of.  They have resisted all attempts at demoralisation, whether direct or indirect.  That is a very fine tradition.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="712" /> There are young men now replacing the older men in the force.  So far as one can judge from seeing them, the young men now coming in are of the calibre that we want.  You will find amongst them as fine a specimen of young Irishman as you will get anywhere. That is the impression left on one when one sees these young men in uniform all over the country.  Let us see that the good material that we have in these young men, with the good tradition that they have behind them, is made the best use of; in other words, that they are encouraged, that they are given the facilities and the conditions of service that will ensure that they will be the best police force in Europe, because they can very easily be that&mdash;very easily&mdash;if one looks at them now.</P>
    <P>There was a tendency some time ago, I was afraid, and some others were, that Guards were getting a little bit slipshod in their appearance.  It is a grand thing to see that these young men, in particular, are proud of their uniform and are carrying themselves well.  They have obviously been well-drilled and well set-up in the Depot. They are carrying themselves well and behaving well.  Their discipline appears to be good.  The way to maintain good discipline and good morale is to see that their conditions of service are right, that their numbers are adequate to the tasks they have to undertake, that they have the facilities to carry out these tasks and that they have the backing of the civil authorities in carrying out these tasks.</P>
    <P>That nearly gets me back again to one of the Minister's problems, this drunk-in-charge problem.  You cannot get Guards, for instance, properly to administer the very difficult traffic laws now&mdash;the situation is difficult there&mdash;or, say, to handle this question of alcohol and driving properly if they are not properly supported by the executive.  There is always a problem for the Minister and for the Department in that alone.  Now there is a force in existence which promises to be even better in the future than it has been in the past.  You have a large body of young men whose morale at the moment is high and whose dicipline <Col N="713" /> is good and who are efficient as a police force.  It is the duty of any Government to see that they get the support they need in their duties and that support must be of a practical sort. They must get facilities for carrying out their duties.  They must be backed when they do carry out their duties even in such small things as being unnecessarily overruled, if I may put it that way.  They should have the conditions of service and all the rest of it.</P>
    <P>On that matter, I have no hesitation in saying that a police force, particularly a well set-up police force as we have now, belonging to the people, loyal to the people, with a good sense of duty, is an extremely valuable thing in a modern State, so valuable, in fact, that there is no need to justify provisions for making that force as efficient as possible and having its conditions of service the best that we can have.  I would like the Minister to pay particular attention to that.</P>
    <P>The Guards are absolutely essential to the morale of the community as a whole and, in small things as well as in big, the conduct of the community will largely depend on the conduct of the Garda.  It is reassuring, as I say, to see the men that are there at the moment, these young men coming on, and to see them as well set-up and as well trained and as proud of themselves as they are.  It is up to the Minister and those who succeed him to see that that fortunate situation is maintained and, above all, to see the Guards getting the support, both in conditions of service and otherwise, that is necessary to keep that force in good trim.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to hear the tribute that Deputy Vivion de Valera has paid to the Guards.  I am especially pleased to hear that tribute coming from that side of the House, particularly from Deputy de Valera.  We all know that the Garda force was established in very trying times.  They had their baptism of blood. They endured severe trials over a long number of years.  Now the Guards have the respect of all the people.  That is something that we may be proud of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tribute must be paid to the memory <Col N="714" /> of the first Minister who established the Garda force for the fact that, in those trying times, an unarmed police force was set up.  The secret of the complete success of the Garda lies in the fact that it was established as an unarmed police force.</P>
    <P>Now that we have reached the end of an epoch and old members of the Garda force are passing out and the new Garda are being recruited, it is only right that there should be a complete review of the position.  When the Garda force was first established it comprised a fine, able body of men, such as the new recruits that we see in our streets are.</P>
    <P>It was unfortunate that the police force had to be entirely recruited at one time.  Whether we like it or not, we know that over the last eight or ten years the Garda force was not as we would like it to be or as it was in the past.  It was becoming an old force.  The men were getting old.  No new men were coming along.  I think it would be a good thing to stagger recruitment over a number of years. There is no use in taking on an entirely new force and allowing them to serve their full time and then recruiting another new force.  Recruitment should be staggered so that there would be always a high percentage of young men on active duty.  The old force did their job very well but the stage was reached when there were too many older men in the force and in many cases they did not command the respect of the people that the Garda force should command.  I do not blame either the people or the Gardaí for that.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the members of the force were never adequately paid. That is one of the things that helped to reduce the force.  If members of the force are not paid a good salary and if they are trying to maintain a family and keep a house they must supplement their income in some way. Throughout the country, instead of carrying on police duty as they should, many Guards had to go out as farmers or jobbers or to do some other type of work in order to get money to maintain their families.  That is a bad thing. It happened to a great extent.  A <Col N="715" /> policeman should be exclusively a policeman.  He should not have to go out to cut turf or to buy and sell hay or to graze cattle on the 11 months' system in order to make a few pounds. That is all wrong.  A policeman cannot be a policeman if he has to seek ways and means of supplementing his salary. The position should be reviewed, now that we have a new force, to see if they are being adequately paid to keep them as a police force and to ensure that these men will be policemen and nothing else.</P>
    <P>It certainly was not very nice to see Guards having to fend for their living in the way that they did, to see their uniforms becoming old and shabby, through no fault of their own, to see them having to go out footing and cutting turf, buying and selling cattle, buying and selling hay in order to earn a living.  It is time for a review, now that we have a new force, to see that the men are adequately paid.  If they are adequately paid, let them do nothing other than police work.  There is nothing as fine as a manly, vigorous, young policeman doing his job well.  A policeman should be paid a salary on which he can rear and educate his family.</P>
    <P>It is right that these things should be said.  I saw the force being established almost 30 years ago.  I witnessed all that they went through.  I realised the fine force they were and the courage of the men in the force. As years went on and peace was established, these men, who were not half paid, could not stand up to the demands on them on the few pounds a week that they were paid.  That caused disintegration of the force and there has been a shabby-looking force for the last ten or 15 years.  Much of that was caused by the fact that we had to recruit the entire force at one time and they all grew old simultaneously. Recruitment should be staggered over a number of years so that there will always be a certain number retiring and a certain number of new recruits.  It would be no harm to have a full review now.</P>
    <P>Deputy Donegan referred to the gaming laws and I should like to say a few words on that matter.  Over the <Col N="716" /> past 30 years, a vast amount of money has been collected by the Government on gaming licences.  I think we are entitled to get some of that money back by way of the establishment of a fund for the preservation of game and for the destruction of pests.  The scald crow, the fox, the magpie, and so forth, are too numerous in this country. There seems to be no concerted effort to wipe them out.  As recently as 15 or 20 years ago the scald crow was very scarce in this country.  I think he is the villain of the piece.  There are nearly as many scald crows in the country now as there are ordinary common crows.  They are very destructive.  They take a vast amount of game eggs, with the result that our stocks are by no means what they should be.  Some of that money which has been collected by the Government should be ploughed back into a fund to eradicate these pests.  As I have said, a fair amount of money has been collected.  I think there will be a big falling-off this year because, as a result of the wiping out of the rabbits by myxomatosis, there is very little to do now.  In my part of the country a man has now to wait for the few months of the gaming season.</P>
    <P>I come now to the subject of poaching. I would not find fault if, in present circumstances, this country were full of poachers.  What tradition was ever handed down to us in this matter?  All over the country there were vested interests.  There were big mansions with big preserves.  Most of the people living in those mansions got the lands unlawfully.  They would not allow a man to look across the ditch into the preserves, let alone shoot in them.  At that time, our people were right in their approach to the whole question.  What right had those other people from another country to come over here and lord it over the simple people of this country?  I believe that, in those times, the poacher was a manly man.  He had courage, and he needed it, to stand up to the difficulties which confronted him.  Now, however, there is not much need for poachers. Most of those big estates have been broken up, and rightly so.  I hope that the remainder of them will be broken up as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="717" /> I want to see in this country a manly type of people who will respect each other's property.  I do not believe in a certain number of people joining together to form gun clubs here and there throughout the country and preventing anybody else from joining them.  I find there is a tendency for people from Dublin&mdash;lawyers, doctors, veterinary surgeons, and so forth&mdash;to go down the country and to get a number of simple-minded farmers to give them the shooting rights of their land.  I do not believe in that.  There should be none of this thing of vested interests coming along and taking up the shooting rights on our countryside, to the exclusion of everybody else.  Any man who has a £2 licence and who keeps a dog should be free to go on his neighbour's land and shoot vermin and game during the season.  I will let any man come into my land who wants to shoot lawfully there.  I would not try to stop him from doing so.</P>
    <P>The position in this country now is that we have twopence-halfpenny looking down on twopence, just as we had in the old days under a foreign Government.  I do not want that type of outlook revived in this country.  Let us all be free and manly.  Let us all be free to roam around our countryside and let us be content with what we can get but, at the same time, let us have respect for the rights of others.  If what I see going on now in this country continues for another ten or 15 years then I am of the opinion that we shall have a lot of poachers in this country again, and rightly so.  It is not just that, in any area, land should be handed over to vested interests.  We now have free tenants in the country and I hope that those farmers who own their land will hold on to their shooting rights and will not sign them away to groups of persons who want them for themselves and who will not allow anybody else to avail of them.  Such persons are public bounders and nothing else.  They are looking after their own interests without considering other people.</P>
    <P>I believe that the man with a licence will be manly and that he will not shoot hen pheasants, and so forth, at the wrong time of the year.  I believe <Col N="718" /> he will make every effort to do the right thing.  Now that the old estates have been broken up, we see a new type of vested interest getting new gaming rights.  The farmers are signing away those rights wholesale.  A lot of people from Dublin go down to an area and, having purchased the gaming rights there, regard that area as their vested interest.  There is no need to make this country a country of poachers.  Those of us who keep a dog and a gun and who like a day's sport should be free to go in on other land, just as our neighbours are free to come in on our land.  Let us be free agents in this matter.  If things continue as they are going to-day then, very shortly, we shall have the same old trouble as regards poaching as we had in the past.  Men will try to creep in on the preserves.  There is very little need for those types of preserves at all.  They have been handed down from an old fake aristocracy and now we find that we have people in this country once more trying to look down on somebody else.</P>
    <P>Just as men who are fond of gambling or greyhounds, and so forth, are free to follow those pursuits, the man with a licence and who likes shooting should be able to have his day's sport and should be free to do so.  When we give our word let us keep it so that no man will dare to shoot a hen pheasant at any time of the year when it is prohibited to do so.  Let us try, as free agents, to preserve the stock of this country so that those vested interests will be put an end to as soon as possible.  If that is not done, our people will reassert themselves once more, and rightly so.  If our people are deprived of the right to shoot over bogs and ranges then I feel they will adopt the underhand way of doing things.  We paid very dearly for our freedom.  I hope the Minister will see to it that a good deal of the money that was collected by the Government in respect of gaming will be ploughed back so that those people who follow gun sport will get the benefit of it and so that we shall get after the vermin of all types in this country.  I am sorry the rabbit has gone.  Rabbits were a damn nice shot on a Sunday evening when you had nothing else to aim at. <Col N="719" /> I hope, also, that the scald crow, the magpie and all the other pests that destroy game will be dealt with and that we shall have fine Sunday sport for the next two years getting rid of vermin.  I would be just as happy shooting a scald crow as shooting a cock pheasant.</P>

      <P>I again appeal to the Minister to give back some of that money which was collected to the genuine man who pays £2 for a licence and to see to it that he will be free to roam over the countryside and that no other man, whether from Dublin or anywhere else, will prevent him from doing so.  We have had too much of that in this country for hundreds of years and now that we have attained freedom in this part of the country we do not want to see twopence-halfpenny once again looking down on twopence.  We want every man to respect himself and to respect the rights of others and we want to leave our land open to the man whom we know to be honest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry I was not here during the earlier part of the discussion on this Estimate.  I hope that I am mistaken in the view that I formed from a short portion of the discussion that there was a suggestion that the system whereby sentences are imposed for drunken driving should come up for review before the Minister.  I hope that view is not seriously being put forward.  To my mind that was an extremely bad procedure which shook the confidence of the public in the administration of justice.  It is obviously not the function of a Minister to remit sentences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have here an elaborate system <Col N="720" /> of courts charged with the responsibility of carrying out the law and of imposing sentences prescribed by law and those sentences are measured reasonably well in accordance with certain standards.  It would reduce the administration of justice to a complete farce if, after a person was tried, convicted and sentenced, the sentence would come up for review before a Minister.  I know that the life of probably every T.D. in this House was made miserable by this provision, while it was in operation, by people who approached him to interview the Minister and request him to remove sentences and disqualifications imposed by the courts.  It is not the function of a T.D. to intervene in cases of that kind, nor, I believe, is it the function of a Minister to deal with cases of that kind.  No matter how carefully or how properly such powers would be exercised by the Minister in this regard, nothing would convince the public that powers of that kind were not being exercised improperly for political considerations.  I think the action of the Minister in declining to intervene in these cases is a wise one and I hope he will maintain that attitude.</P>
    <P>I should like to say a few words in connection with the whole question of drunken driving.  In my view, from experience in the courts, in the case of most accidents I suggest that not less than 50 per cent. of the serious accidents that occur are due to alcohol, possibly not to the fact that the driver is drunk and incapable, but due to the fact that his judgment has been impaired by the consumption of alcohol. I appreciate fully that in possibly 90 per cent. of the cases that occur where a Guard suspects that a driver has had a drink he may not be in a position to prove it, or even level a charge, but certainly at least 50 per cent. of the serious cases that occur are due to the consumption of alcohol.  So we have the position now, a serious position, where night after night death stalks our streets and roads, particularly around the cities, as a result of drunken driving or semi-drunken driving. It is a serious problem and one which I think should not be dealt with leniently.  I am afraid that we are <Col N="721" /> rather inclined to have a <i>laissez faire</i> attitude with regard to drinking.  It is extraordinary how ready we are to say, whenever anyone misbehaves himself: &ldquo;The poor fellow had a few drinks in.&rdquo;  That should not be a justification for misbehaviour in any degree.</P>
    <P>One suggestion I would like the Minister to consider is this&mdash;it is the suggestion which, I think, is analogous to the system which obtains in Scandinavian countries&mdash;that there should be a sentence of, say, one month's imprisonment for the first or second occasion of drunken driving.  But I will say that provision should be made whereby the gaol sentence could be served at any time within 12 months or, if necessary, two years after being imposed.  One of the difficulties about a jail sentence is that in many cases it may deprive the accused person of his employment permanently or semi-permanently. Hence, judges are slow to impose a jail sentence.</P>
    <P>I can conceive of no better way of curing a person who is inclined to drive when under the influence of alcohol than to make that person spend his week-ends and his holiday time in Mountjoy Prison, preferably at his own expense.  If such a form of punishment was contemplated it would be easy to work out the details.  The judge, when imposing sentence, could issue a certificate providing that the sentence be served at any time within the following 12 months or two years.  In that way a person who depended for his living upon the driving of a car, say a lorry driver or a taxi driver, would not be deprived of his employment.  He could go in every Friday night or Saturday morning and serve two days of his sentence and also serve his holiday time in Mountjoy until he had purged his sentence.  That would have a very sobering effect on drunken drivers.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister seriously to consider the possibility of initiating such a scheme.  I would also empower the judge to make an order whereby the person sentenced could be charged with the cost of his keep in Mountjoy or wherever he was locked up.  That should be left to the discretion of the judge as there are cases in which the <Col N="722" /> person could not afford it but where he could afford it there is no reason why he should not actually pay for the cost of his detention and his upkeep during the week-ends and holiday periods.</P>
    <P>There is another matter in regard to drunken driving which, I think, will require the attention of the Minister. To a certain extent it is purely a legal question.  It is the definition of &ldquo;driving&rdquo;.  This question has given a considerable amount of difficulty not merely to our own courts here but to the courts in England.  In some cases, the word &ldquo;driving&rdquo; has been interpreted to mean being in charge of a car, even remotely in charge of a car, and that creates a number of difficulties. A man who realises he has drink taken decides not to drive the car but to sleep in the back of the car, which is probably the safest course to adopt, but it has been held that he is still liable.  By reason of various interpretations of the word &ldquo;driving&rdquo; as including being in charge of a car, he remains in charge of the car.</P>
    <P>It has even been held in England, I understand, in some recent cases, that to be in possession of the key of the car, though you may be some distance away from the car, sitting in a house, still makes you liable.  I merely mention the point; I do not think the matter is an immediate problem, but I suggest that the Minister might follow the difficulties that have arisen in England in regard to the matter where I think some new legislation is being introduced in an effort to clarify the position.  I do not know whether the new legislation deals adequately with the position or not.  I understand that there are some doubts as to whether it does or not.</P>
    <P>There is another matter in connection with the administration of the Garda which I should like to mention. I join with other Deputies in paying tribute to the good work they do, but I do feel that here in Dublin the Detective Branch, the Criminal Investigation Branch, needs to be strengthened for the investigation of what I would term business crimes. There are many cases where infringements of the law probably take place, but the public investigation of these offences is rendered difficult by <Col N="723" /> reason of the fact that the members of the Garda who carry out the investigations are not qualified accountants and not experts in business dealings. Therefore, it would seem to me that it would be well if the Minister could consider the appointment of, say, one or two special business investigators.</P>
    <P>Possibly the Minister would have to go outside the existing members of the force, and preferably special investigators of that kind should be men of considerable business experience, men well versed in accountancy and company law.  I think it is obvious, even from newspaper reports of different matters that have arisen in regard to companies in recent years, that some form of special investigators to deal with business offences or with offences under company law are required.  The Detective Branch, as at present constituted, may be, and I am sure is, quite an efficient instrument for the detection of ordinary crime, such as burglaries, robberies and so on, but I doubt whether they are in a position to deal with the more involved type of fraud which no doubt occurs from time to time and which remains undetected by reason of the lack of persons with sufficient experience to pursue the proper investigation.  I make that suggestion to the Minister and ask him to consider it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with other members of the House in tendering our congratulations to the Minister on the success of the new members of the Garda.  From what we have seen of them in the performance of their duties, they are a great credit to the country and to the Garda Síochána. I have heard, however, that there is a little grievance amongst them, that, in the case of young men thinking of getting married, there is a difficulty in getting housing accommodation in the city.  Some few years ago, it was put up to the Minister that the Garda Síochána might get an organisation to build their own houses which could be let to the Gardaí on the basis of the wages and the rent allowances given to them at present to ensure that they will not be charged extravagant rents <Col N="724" /> for inadequate accommodation.  If that suggestion were followed up and if it resulted in having a contented body of Guards, the country would benefit greatly from it.</P>
      <P>There is another point which has worried me somewhat during the past year.  I occasionally get papers sent to me from America and England in which some of our usual critics seek to belittle this country by drawing attention to the type of begging that goes on, especially in the City of Dublin. In the case of these journalists, somebody evidently approached them here in Dublin.  Children in the city, if they see an American sailor or soldier, say to him: &ldquo;Have you any chewing gum, sir?&rdquo; and groups of children collect around these American soldiers, with the result that other people get the opportunity of saying that our children are begging in the streets of Dublin.</P>
      <P>I always held that these charges were unjustifiable, but, at the same time, if a uniformed Guard&mdash;I intended to make a case for more uniformed Guards in the city&mdash;were seen in the distance his presence would act as a deterrent on these children and might also act as a deterrent to some types of visitors&mdash;not the type one often sees &mdash;who are inclined to encourage that kind of thing, with the result that we find our country being accused of permitting begging in the streets and making it appear that there is poverty in the city.  I go out of my way to tell visitors that there is no poverty in the city and no need for children to be barefooted in the city because our Governments and public assistance authorities have provided a system for the past few years under which children can get boots or shoes, where they are definitely in need of them, free of charge and can get boots and shoes at half-price, where their parents are lowly paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no need for anyone to be sympathetic to barefooted children in the City of Dublin.  Sometimes people are played on in that respect.  The population of Dublin has increased very much, but I do not see that the police patrols have increased accordingly. I would ask that the patrols <Col N="725" /> be a little more frequent and more plentiful.  Some of our main thoroughfares at busy times are inadequately policed.  I remember days gone by when there would be a patrol from the Parnell Monument to College Green, three or four Gardaí constantly patrolling on one side and a similar number on the other side going in the opposite direction.  I know the Gardaí have been very busy and that traffic regulations have taken up many of them, and it may have been difficult to get new Gardaí, but the Minister has told us that serious crime is on the decline in the whole country.  We are glad to hear that and congratulate him and the Gardaí and the Garda executive.</P>
    <P>On the outskirts of the city there are new traffic arteries, new roads on the canal side from the Pigeon House to Ballyfermot.  There is heavy traffic on those roads but no Gardaí are put on them to protect the public.  People are finding how convenient these new traffic arteries are and the time has come when the Garda Síochána also should find them and give adequate protection there.  There are many busy areas on the outskirts of Dublin beyond the canal bridges where Deputies have seen the need for either traffic lights or traffic Gardaí.  I put it to the Minister that he should continue his recruiting campaign and give us more Gardaí in the city for the general protection of the public.</P>
    <P>I am glad to congratulate the Minister on his statement that serious crime is on the decline.  It may be due to the fact that the Gardaí are more plentiful.  I would rather see one Garda in uniform than half a dozen detectives. The Garda in uniform acts as a deterrent to one type of person and shows the other type that there is protection there for him.  I would ask for more Gardaí in the city for the purposes I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>Deputy Giles has talked about the inadequate pay of the Gardaí.  That is the case we can always make&mdash;the inadequate pay for our splendid services such as the Gardaí.  I put it to the Minister that in some cases benefit could be conferred on them by the housing proposal I have put to him.  A <Col N="726" /> young Garda who gets married and goes outside the city and looks for a room has to pay 45/- for a single room in the city or on the outskirts.  That is the rent being charged in many cases at the present moment.  He becomes very discontented if his conditions are not improved.</P>
    <P>Again, I wish to congratulate the Minister on the men's appearance, the men's ability and sobriety and on everything else that concerns the force.  It is a force he should be proud of, as we all in the City of Dublin are proud of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to give me information on one of the more important matters of the few I wish to refer to here to-day.  On Monday night last in the Limerick Corporation a question was discussed which concerns other parts of the country as well&mdash;it is that of horses wandering on the public thoroughfare and the damage they do to private property.  We have an amazing statement from the city manager, that evidently, to the best of his belief, there is no constructive suggestion as to what could be done to safeguard people's property, to keep these horses off the public streets and to avoid serious accidents.  We had a lot of talk here to-day about drunken driving and I think Deputy MacBride suggested that 50 per cent. of these accidents could be avoided or could be traced back to the effects of alcohol.  From the remarks of coroners and district justices of late, as may have been observed in the papers, some of the more serious accidents have been attributed to wandering animals, horses and cattle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every Deputy will agree with me when I say that the law at present is lax with regard to these animals.  I understand it is so archaic that, first of all, some hours' notice must be given to the owner to remove his animals from the person's land in question, irrespective of the damage that the animals are doing.  Further, if the owner of the land in question&mdash;which is being trespassed on and damaged by these animals&mdash;puts them on the public highway, he himself is responsible for any accident or damage they may do <Col N="727" /> thereafter.  I know the Minister may not have time to go into the merits and demerits of the legal difficulties and implications of amending legislation.  I am not advocating amending legislation: I am advocating the clarification of the position as it applies to the whole country.</P>
    <P>The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals has been very active of late and they might take it upon themselves to see if anything could be done.  The ordinary man in the street cannot drive these horses to the pound.  The members of the Garda Síochána have enough to do&mdash;if they did it, and they do in most cases&mdash;without hunting ten or 15 horses to the pound.  That is an impossible task for a couple of Guards.  In some places there is no pound at all.  The position in Limerick City about these wandering animals is appalling.  It has been going on down through the years. Representations have been made by the Limerick City Council and other local authorities in the country to successive Ministers for Justice to see if anything could be done about this matter.</P>
    <P>Another thing applicable to Limerick City and other built-up areas is the matter of a speed limit.  I wonder would the Minister once and for all give us clarification on the matter.  Our corporation and various local authorities receive letters from the Department of Justice or the local Garda authorities saying one can apply to have a speed limit in respect of such and such a built up area.  Evidently, there are many difficulties attached to this simple task.</P>
    <P>We have heard a lot of talk about accidents.  Yet we can see cars careering down the main streets of Limerick, Cork and Dublin at fantastic speeds of 60 and 70 miles an hour.  All these accidents cannot be attributed to drink.  There is a matter to which the Minister did not refer in his speech as far as I can gather.  I do not think Deputy Boland got a copy of the speech.  I was not here but I do not think the Minister referred to a matter which he promised me last February <Col N="728" /> he would investigate&mdash;the question of free legal aid.  That is a very big question.  There were two enlightening articles in a daily newspaper recently.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Minister would clear up a point in his reply. Recently a workman working for a local authority suffered very serious injuries when a drain collapsed.  One of his key witnesses was a prominent Dublin surgeon.  I saw the communication from this surgeon to this man's solicitor saying he would only come to Limerick to give evidence in the Circuit Court if he got 50 guineas.</P>

      <P>He might.  He promised last February to look into the whole question.  I did not want to touch upon this matter of the drunken driver at all.  I am afraid that I never saw such a display of hypocrisy.  I am not suggesting that the Minister is hypocritical in his outlook on this matter.  Some of the Deputies in this House who have been most vehement on this subject are the people who have little or no knowledge of alcoholic beverages.  Twenty minutes ago we had a Deputy citing the case of a lorry driver who was up in court and got into serious trouble.  It was suggested <Col N="729" /> that he drank two bottles of stout and if one could get drunk on two bottles of stout&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It varies in different counties.  I think the Minister should be impeached, if we had the power to impeach him, because a decision was arrived at here.  I am one of those people who think that the rights of this House should be respected and I respectfully suggest to the Minister that he is not taking cognisance of a decision of the House.  He is turning a blind eye to the matter and setting himself up as an authority saying: &ldquo;The Government are great fellows; Gerry Boland was pulled, but we will not be pulled.&rdquo;  That suggestion was made in the daily papers and from political platforms.  When you analyse the matter you find that neither Deputy Boland nor any member of the former Government was ever pulled. Representations were made to Deputy Boland when he was Minister for Justice and to the Government by members from all sides of this House and from all political Parties in regard to certain cases.  I do not wish to refer in a derogatory manner to a body that cannot defend themselves in this House but it is a well-known fact that some district justices&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy says he does not wish to refer to a body that cannot defend itself, yet he proceeds to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;some district justices&mdash;I am not mentioning any names &mdash;have given appallingly severe sentences and it is a well-known fact that others are lenient.  I know one particular county&mdash;I will not refer to it by implication or otherwise&mdash;where if a man is up on one of these charges he tries to wait until the district justice goes on holidays so that he can be dealt with by a man with a more lenient outlook.  It is all very well to say that if a person feels aggrieved in <Col N="730" /> the District Court he can appeal to the Circuit Court.  How often have I seen in the county I have mentioned the learned Circuit Court judge not only not allowing the appeal but doubling the sentence.  The unfortunate individual was availing of a right given to him by this House of placing his facts in as clear a manner as possible before the Minister for him to consider them. I cannot see why the Minister is going to divest himself of that function because there have been many cases in the past of miscarriages of justice and the power which the Minister held made everything all right.  Deputy MacBride mentioned that it was not the function of the Minister to remit sentences.  Did not the Deputy say that?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Deputy not say that it was not the function of the Minister for Justice to remit sentences? I wrote that down just after Deputy MacBride said it.  Is it not a well-known fact that the Minister for Justice has remitted sentences?  Does he deny that sentences have been remitted since this Government got into power?  Let us be clear on that.  I challenge him to deny that.</P>
      <P>We heard Deputy Giles referring to matters that were more relevant, I think, to the Vote on the Tourist Board and Deputy Donegan referred to the question of abuses in game licences.  Unfortunately, he made no reference to the poaching of salmon.  I do not know whether the Minister has anything to do with that.  If he has, I suppose it is just as relevant as is the question of game.  Perhaps he might refer to that.</P>
      <P>With all the craw-thumping in this House and with all the talk there is about what good fellows the Government are and with other fellows backing them up, would the Minister tell me why this Government turn the blind eye to unlicensed arms which are being flaunted openly in this country to-day?  I have a letter here from which I will read an extract to the Minister:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;In a restaurant the other night <Col N="731" /> there were two young fellows, one of whom you know&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>that is, one whom I know,</P>
    <P>&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;flaunting two Webley .45s and live ammunition.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is true, and the Minister knows it is true because he has reports on his files to that effect.  It is all right to say I am a member of the House but it is none of my duty to be &ldquo;the poacher turned gamekeeper&rdquo;.  We had a few of those already.  I am not going to give full details to the Minister. I do not see in the first place that it is my job, but I am challenging the Minister and the Government to deny, if they can, that arms are being flaunted openly in this country by young fellows of 16 and 17 years of age.  This is a case in point and I do know one of them, as the letter said.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>But it is all right to kill people with motor cars when one is drunk?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I hoped Deputy MacBride would see and appreciate the analogies I mentioned here.  The point I am making to this House is that the whole reason that the House gave the Minister that power was not that for a second they approved of drunken driving as such or that they approved of any legislation which would suggest an amelioration of the penalties or anything like that.  The function of the Minister and the power he was given was purely to avoid a miscarriage of justice where he thought such would occur and I would not like to see him divested of that function.  You will always get suggestions of political pull.  That is inevitable in any country, and are we not saints here when we look at other countries?  Human nature being what it is, we will always have suggestions of abuse from one side or another.</P>
      <P>I think I heard a Deputy here to-day speak of that appalling phrase so prevalent in this country: &ldquo;There is no smoke without fire.&rdquo;  That expression is the start of scandals and slanders in many cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy A Byrne referred to the <Col N="732" /> housing accommodation of the Gardaí. I have raised that in this House by way of question with regard to Limerick City, and I am sure the same position exists in other cases.  The rent allowances of the present time do not give these Guards, young or old, married or single, a chance of meeting the prevalent prices sought by landlords for property.  I would suggest to the Minister for his consideration that he should take a leaf out of the book of the Minister for Defence and consider building adequate married quarters, or using his good offices in liaison with the Minister for Local Government to make representations to the appropriate local authorities that a certain section of a new housing scheme&mdash;the percentage would be infinitesimal&mdash;would be set aside for married members of the force.  I think that could and should be done.  After all, we are all agreed we want to have a happy police force; we are all agreed that members of the Gardaí, those young lads who are being turned out now, are deserving of the greatest praise and we are all very proud of them while visitors have commented favourably on them also.</P>
    <P>I was in this House&mdash;perhaps I am wrong&mdash;when the Minister promised that he was having an investigation and a report which he would place before this House on the whole circumstances surrounding the alleged kidnapping of children some months ago.  So far as I know we heard no more about that.  I heard the Minister definitely state that in due course a report would be presented to this House.  Perhaps there is some explanation for this.</P>
    <P>I understand at the present time that the High Court on circuit deals only with appeals from the Circuit Court &mdash; perhaps Deputy MacBride would know if that is correct.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, in Limerick the position is that the High Court will only take a case appealed from the Circuit Court and if a person wants to delve into litigation he will have to come to Dublin.  We know that justice is not being served in this country due to the lack of finance and due to the risk involved.  We hear a lot about social welfare and social security but this is only common justice, and I think the Minister might see that in the major centres&mdash;we have it in Cork&mdash;such as Limerick and Galway and, say, Tralee or other places like that, the High Court would take other cases besides appeals from the Circuit Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only other matter to which I wish to refer is this: the Minister for Industry and Commerce has thrown the onus on to the Minister for Justice regarding the licensing laws as they exist at present at Shannon Airport. It is like a shuttlecock; the Minister for Justice is shaking his head now indicating that it is not in his Department. What I want to point out is that if one goes to Shannon to see a visitor off after 12 o'clock, the person one is seeing off can drink all night&mdash; frequently a plane is delayed due to fog or mechanical defects&mdash;but the local or the Irishman has to sit watching. Anyway, it does not appear to be <Col N="734" /> a function of the Minister and he would want to know Shannon Airport very well.  I could talk all day on that but I think I shall write to the Minister and not delay the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TadhgManley" hpid="Mr. Manley Mr. Manley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manley</NameTxt>
      <P>A good deal of this debate has hinged around the power vested in the Minister for Justice of restoring licences to those who have driven under the influence of drink. The former Minister, Deputy Boland, and Deputy de Valera were very emphatic in stating that no such power should be vested in any Minister and the present Minister is all the more to be complimented in that he did not exercise that power.  It is not the exercise of the power at all that becomes objectionable; it is the exercise of the power in one case.  When it is done in one case the Minister is liable to be charged right away with partiality.</P>
      <P>I admire the Minister for being absolutely adamant on that point, that, in spite of the representations that have been made to him in the last 12 months, he has not in one instance restored a licence taken from anybody found drunk or under the influence of drink.  A person on the road nowadays must have all his faculties; even when in possession of all his faculties and in a state of complete sobriety he is still in danger.  But the person drunk or under the influence of drink is a potential danger at all times on the road.  If, as the Minister has shown in the past 12 months, there is no hope of having the licence restored, then there will be no grievance among those from whom licences have been taken that there was an exception made in any individual case.  I compliment the Minister on his wisdom in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Estimate deals largely with the Gardaí.  They are one of the most important bodies we have.  The position to-day is analogous to the position that existed in 1922, when the Gardaí were first recruited, except in this fact, that the men coming into the Gardaí at that time came in from the ranks of the national movement.  Although some of them might have come in purely from the material point of view, most of them came in from patriotic motives. <Col N="735" /> However, inexperienced as they were, they grew up to be a magnificent force. They got the respect of all the people although they had to encounter the anti-policeman mentality that had grown up here over generations when we were under an alien Government. They have emerged with glory and command the respect of all.  They reached a high standard in the late 20s and early 30s.  They took a great interest in athletics, breaking records in that sphere, and they were all the more to be complimented for that.</P>
    <P>The position to-day is that we are recruiting a new body of Gardaí.  It is not entirely analogous except in this respect, that we are going to have a good number of inexperienced young Gardaí coming in now, but the stage has been set for them.  I do not see the wisdom of this Government or any Government retiring men at such an early age, retiring them on limited pensions and at a time when they have heavy family commitments.  They cannot live on those pensions.  I think in respect of these men provision should be made for the extension of the age limit and they should be given an increase of pay as an enticement to continue their services so long as they have unblemished records.  Otherwise their experience will be lost to the younger men coming in.  These older men would not then be faced with housing problems and with family problems such as they must face when they are forced to retire at an age when they are physically fit and have amassed great experience.  We must bear in mind that a Garda must be trained, and experience is the greatest asset to any Garda.  He must be a model of tact and shrewd judgment. He must be a psychologist, above all things, and he cannot be a psychologist unless he is taught in the hard school of experience.</P>
    <P>I regret that the present Government and previous Governments have done nothing with regard to the extension of the age for retiring Gardaí. Of course, the case has been made that it would slow up promotion, but those people who would suffer from the slowing up of promotion would get the <Col N="736" /> same privilege with regard to retiring age limits if the extension were given.  I know there is dissatisfaction amongst the force in regard to promotion for sergeants. Those who are called up for interview and to do the examination must pass a very high standard of test.  So long as these men have unblemished records they should be graded up very considerably for their experience, because otherwise there will be dissatisfaction through having younger men officering older men who have given valuable service.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made here by the Minister for Justice of the closing down of Garda barracks in the country. No matter how remote a rural area is, I think it is entitled to have its little Garda barracks.  I agree that one or two men in a station in these remote areas would be sufficient.  Where efforts have been made to close barracks the people were up in arms right away.  They were in a state of nervousness because nothing will ensure safety in a locality so well as the existence of a Garda barracks, just as the presence of a Garda in any assembly will ensure safety.  I think it would be wise if the Department went slowly in that respect because you can have crimes of various kinds and unpleasant visitors in an area at all times, no matter how remote.</P>
    <P>Mention has also been made about straying horses on the roads.  I remember just three weeks ago passing a road within four miles of Cork City and counting over 20 horses on the roadside.  Granted they have plenty to eat at this time of the year on the roadside, but they are a danger there. However, it is in winter time that they are bound to be found in some farmer's field.  My greatest objection to the people who own these horses is that they leave their venues littered with all sorts of rubbish.  We are bringing visitors to this country and the rendezvous of these itinerants are unsightly. Some provision should be made in law to compel these people when they leave an area to leave it in as good a state as they found it. Surely that is no great hardship on them.</P>
    <P>I do not believe at all in these squad <Col N="737" /> cars.  I notice in the Book of Estimates, mentioned here to-day, that for the purchase of transport, for motor taxation, drivers' licences, allowances for officers using their own cars, cycling allowances, and so on, there is a sum of over £140,000 provided.  I believe myself that there is no method of policing as effective as the patrol method.  Outside Dublin City I cannot see any utility in a squad car.  I believe that it will be abused in time, that the people will devise a method to circumvent the activities of the squad car.  It may be necessary in an industrial area like Dublin but, generally speaking, we are too prone to base our institutions on what happens in the neighbouring island where you have a different set of circumstances.  I think that the presence of a policeman on the street is far more effective than a squad car going through the city, making public announcements.  If there is anything that is reprehensible it is the use of a loudspeaker from a car, whether it be a Garda car or a car used during election times.  It is a disturbance of the peace in our streets and should not be tolerated.  We should build our institutions according to our own traditions, our own requirements and particularly according to our own economy.  Many Gardaí are free now for duty in the cities because of the introduction of traffic lights and these men could be always available for patrol duty.  I am convinced that if we had Gardaí on duty who would patrol all exits from the State we would not have the situation we had here 12 months ago in the kidnapping cases.</P>
    <P>Those are the few points to which I wished to draw the Minister's attention. In my view he is a very generous and fair-minded man and I hope he will be hightly successful in the administration of his office.  I hope also that he will play fair with the Garda force which has given such service to our people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the first matters with which I want to deal is the menace in the city and in portion of County Dublin created by the travelling knights of the road, as they are called.  They are a menace in my <Col N="738" /> constituency.  There are horses strolling into the gardens of new houses that have been built right round the verge of the city and in the county.  Every place they go, as the last speaker and other speakers have said, they cause a lot of trouble.  It is about time the Government took some strong action in this matter.  People telephone to me from Drimnagh, Walkinstown, Ballyfermot and other areas stating that their gardens are being broken up by horses wandering into them at night.  If anyone says anything to these people they try to terrorise him.</P>
      <P>The same thing happens in lonely country districts.  I think this matter needs to be handled in a decisive fashion.  Legislation should be introduced or we should consider doing something which will prevent or deter these people causing destruction.  They are no credit to the nation.  They are rearing illiterate families.  Everybody is afraid to say anything to them.  I suffer enough persecution from them because of the number of people continually reporting to me.  The city manager in Dublin puts them outside the city boundary.  The county manager tries to put them somewhere else. The Guards remove them from one place and this kind of game of shuttlecock goes on.  That does not save our people from being annoyed or save the little gardens planted by industrious men from being damaged with these strolling horses during the night.  If the ordinary people object the possibility is that they may be beaten up. I think the time has come when the Minister for Justice must examine the position.  I urge that such an examination should take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Justice is responsible for the Garda Síochána.  Last Sunday in North County Dublin there were thousands of cars trying to reach the sea and thousands of pedestrians. On numerous occasions I have pointed out the lack of co-ordination between the various Departments of State.  The Gardaí in my own area have often raised the lack of parking space with me.  We are only a few miles from Dublin City.  There are co-ordinating committees consisting of Dublin Corporation officials and the Gardaí within the city area.  Such committees <Col N="739" /> should be extended to the county area. Conditions at Donabate last Sunday were positively chaotic and the Gardaí were helpless.  I have tried on numerous occasions to get adequate parking places.  That is why I am urging now some co-ordinating machinery as between the Department of Justice, the Department of Local Government, and the various authorities around Dublin. These conditions exist week after week.  If the coming week-end is fine we will have a recurrence of what happened last Sunday.  The unfortunate Gardaí are trying to do the impossible. They are overworked.  Traffic jams take place because of lack of coordination and the people who are responsible do nothing.  In the city area weekly conferences are held to deal with this matter.  There are 600,000 people living in the suburbs and county and nothing is done about conditions there.</P>
    <P>I want to raise another matter.  I am sorry I shall have to raise it here. I have nothing personal to say about any member of the Garda.  They are a fine, respectable, decent body of men.  There seems to be a new approach in County Dublin, especially in relation to the young Gardaí coming out of the Depot.  I think this approach is all wrong; the young Gardaí, it is alleged, are being told that the old Gardaí in the district were too lenient and their first duty will be to raid the pubs night, noon and morning.  Is that really police work?  If an unfortunate publican opens five minutes too early or closes five minutes too late his place is raided and the Gardaí run upstairs into his rooms.  Surely there should be some tactful way of dealing with publicans who commit breaches.  I do not wish to deter any Garda from doing his duty.  Neither do I want to see the Gardaí leaving any house open when it should not be open.  I uphold the law.  What I object to is the approach made by certain Gardaí in a matter of this kind.  I object to this picking on one publican just for the sake of hounding him.  I think the Gardaí should concern themselves with trying to eliminate crime.  I was in Ballina prior to a by-election and I went out to <Col N="740" /> a place in Sligo.  A sergeant and two Guards came in there at half-past ten.</P>

      <P>There is such a thing as discretion.  I am asking the Minister to see that some of the Gardaí &mdash;they are few in number&mdash;use what is known as discretion.  I have heard a good deal about drunken drivers.  It is a good job that some of the people speaking here about drunken drivers will never be on duty at the Gates of Heaven, because none of us would have a chance of getting in at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nobody has any sympathy for drunken drivers; nobody should have sympathy with a man who deliberately goes out and gets drunk and then drives his car around the roads. Nobody has sympathy for such a man <Col N="741" /> if he gets jailed.  But there is the case of the driver who may be compelled to take a few drinks for health reasons. There are very few men who do not slip by the wayside.  I have often myself done so&mdash;not through drink. Before now we had the position where we could go and see the Minister.  I have often approached the Minister myself, as has nearly every other Deputy in the House, to try and get leniency for a man or a woman.  When approached, the Minister may be as harch as he likes but he will find that there are certain cases where mercy should be exercised.  Such a case would be one in which a man, if allowed off on that occasion, would never touch a drink again.  There are human characteristics which should be considered in cases of that type.</P>
    <P>When the law has been administered I think the discretion should be left to the Department of Justice and as far as I know the circumstances of appellants to the Department have always been very closely investigated and I have never known leniency to be exercised by the Department except after close examination of all the circumstances, even to the extent of consulting with the local Guards and district justice.</P>
    <P>I want to come back again to the case of the young Guards.  I know several young Guards about to get married who are not in receipt of sufficient salaries to get loans under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act and who obviously are not able to build houses themselves.  Of course, the local authorities concerned will not provide them with houses unless they are married and have families, perhaps living under shocking conditions in one-room apartments.  This is an instance where there might be co-ordination between two Departments in order that these young Guards might be helped out, and I want the Minister to consider that.</P>
    <P>I should like to make reference now to a matter which concerns the Minister's Department, even though it may be only indirectly.  I am still reading Press reports about the condition of our courthouses.  District justices and judges have, on numerous occasions, <Col N="742" /> referred to the appalling conditions of these courthouses.  It surprises me that a number of our district justices have not died from pneumonia as these courthouses are so cold and so dreary. If they had been built especially for the purpose of keeping people out of them the job could not have been done better.</P>

      <P>I am continually talking about the situation we have in this country where one Department works independently of the other.  I do not say that should not be the case but I think there should at least be some co-ordination between two Departments in major matters which concern them both such as the question of the courthouses. I should like also to refer to the question of the squad cars.  I think the system is an excellent one and that it has done more work to put drunken drivers off the roads than any other system has done.  It has also succeeded in keeping the roads safe from other points of view.  It is a system which badly needs to be retained.  It will certainly compel the careless driver, who has no respect for himself or for anybody, to become more careful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HarryColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>On this question of the drunken driver, I should like to say that, from what I heard Deputy Manley say, I think he is under a misapprehension regarding the attitude of my Party.  None of us wants in any way to do anything that might encourage the drunken driver.  Let us be clear about that.  I, on my part, hold very strong views about it and I should like to say that when this question of allowing the Minister for Justice discretion to deal with cases <Col N="743" /> after they had been dealt with by the courts came before the House we, on these benches, actually moved an amendment aimed at leaving such discretionary measures in the hands of justices.</P>
      <P>The first Coalition Government in their wisdom passed an Act providing that the Minister could deal with this question.  In these circumstances, we hold that the Minister should deal with it and that he should not take the line that he is not going to consider any such cases.  He should deal with them or else amend the legislation.  This side of the House will not, I feel sure, oppose any such amendment which would aim at taking the power away from the Minister and having it left in the hands of the justices.  I think it is a very bad principle that the Minister should take the line that he will not operate certain provisions of an Act. If he feels it is wrong, he should bring in legislation to amend it.</P>
      <P>There are only one or two small points left on which I wish to speak. I want particularly to refer to the growing practice in Dublin of cars overtaking and passing out on the left lines of traffic.  Around Amiens Street in particular, it is becoming very common although it is prevalent in other streets as well.  For instance, where you have ten cars proceeding in line, you will always find some fellow to come along, driving along the line on the left and suddenly trying to cut in on the line which he left previously. Very often such a practice involves accidents.  One morning last week I saw a driver arrive at Amiens Street. He drove up along the left of the line of traffic.  At the Talbot Street lights, the line of traffic was held up by some obstruction and when it moved on again it turned out that this man wanted to turn into Talbot Street right across the whole line of traffic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Could the Guards not do something to stop that practice?  Could there not be some system introduced that would help to remedy that, because I believe there are a lot of the younger drivers who, in so acting, do not think they <Col N="744" /> are doing anything wrong; I have seen several near accidents because of this practice?  It is really becoming a menace.  I urge on the Minister to try and get the Guards to produce something that will enable a situation of that kind to be controlled.</P>
    <P>Again, there is the question of the cyclists.  I know that this is an old story.  My opinion is that cyclists cause nearly as many accidents as drunken drivers.  On the North Strand, one can see them cycling five and six abreast. It is quite a common thing to see them travelling four abreast.  I have seen myself, in a case where cyclists were travelling five abreast, two more come from behind, apparently in a hurry, and try to pass out.  These two cyclists did that without looking to see if there was a car approaching from behind. In the process they pulled out right in front of the car that I was travelling behind.  The driver had to stop at once and, in doing so, nearly crashed into my car.  I think something should be done to try and get cyclists to observe the rules of the road.  They are a real danger to the travelling public, especially during rush hours.  Anyone who happens to be travelling along the North Strand or Amiens Street can see that clearly for themselves.  The same applies to other parts of the city.</P>
    <P>I know there are different views held as to what should be done to overcome the menace that is caused by cyclists. I have come to the conclusion myself, from what I have seen going on, that a licence and an insurance policy are almost as necessary in the case of cyclists as in the case of motor cars. I think a small licence fee should be put on them, even if it resulted in a loss to the State.  Cyclists should also be required to take out an insurance policy.  I say that because, in my opinion, they cause as many accidents as drunken drivers.  When they are the cause of an accident nobody knows who they are because they are always able to get away immediately.  Therefore, somebody has to suffer and pay for the accident which they have caused.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a few words as regards itinerants in the <Col N="745" /> rural areas.  I know that practically every rural Deputy has referred to this menace.  About 12 months ago a resolution was introduced at a meeting of the Cork County Council in an attempt to control itinerants.  What amazed me was&mdash;it was a thing that I could never have anticipated until this resolution came up for discussion&mdash;the division that existed on the question. One member went so far as to say: &ldquo;How dare anybody interfere with or attempt to control or restrict these people; they are the ancient Irish and, as a matter of fact, some of them are descended from the native &lsquo;princes.&rsquo;&rdquo; A short time afterwards the resolution was passed and referred to the county solicitor.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, a decision was given in Limerick which, so to speak, nullified the resolution and rendered it absolutely ineffective.  Therefore, so far as the existing law is concerned, it would appear that the Guards have no effective control in regard to this problem.  The law, as it stands, seems to be defective.  The Guards are put in the position that, when they receive complaints locally, they have no power to deal effectively with these people. The only way, I think, in which they can deal with them is by harassing them, by getting them to move out of a locality by the use of harassing tactics.  The existing law does not appear to give the Guards any more power than that.  The result is that these people play ducks and drakes with the Gardaí authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I live in an area which is a county boundary where, very often, the problem arises of the Guards harassing an encampment over the county boundary. These people then move on a quarter of a mile when they find themselves in another county and in another police district.  There is then a repetition by them of what went on in the other district, so that they are able effectively to evade any attempt by the Gardaí to move them out of a locality.  The Guards are placed in a most unenviable position.  About a year ago Deputy Manley referred to the condition in which a locality is left when these people move their encampment.  Just <Col N="746" /> over a year ago, in North Cork, there was a serious outbreak of typhus in an encampment there.  The county medical officer of health was notified of it and he had considerable difficulty in inoculating and in treating these people.  The Guards had to be brought there.  That should give Deputies some idea of the danger which these people can be to public health in an area.</P>
    <P>Then, of course, we have the indiscriminate selection of camping sites. Travelling along our roads, one may find these encampments at a bend on the road.  One will find their horses wandering within half a mile of the encampment.  The horses wander along the road by day and are a menace to passing traffic.  At night-time one will find them in the fields of a local farmer. In many instances, one will find the horses in a farmer's cornfields.  I myself, coming back late at night during an election campaign, saw where these people had smashed up a wooden gate and made a camp fire of it, thereby leaving a farmer's property wide open to trespass from their animals.  We know ourselves&mdash;we have seen reports in the newspapers&mdash;of cases where farmers have been so exasperated by the conduct of these people that they have taken the law into their own hands, and, in some cases, have suffered in the courts for defending themselves against the menace of these encampments.</P>
    <P>I think myself that some method of control should be introduced.  We will have to introduce common camping grounds, and ultimately we will have to ensure, in certain specified areas, the provision of camping grounds and so force these people to go into them, thereby making it illegal for them to camp on the roadside or on the highway.</P>
    <P>Again, I can see that, ultimately, some Minister for Justice will be forced into the position of compelling the registration of these people.  I think that is the only effective way of controlling those who lead a nomadic existence&mdash;first of all registration, and, secondly, the power to compel them to camp in certain specified camping grounds.  I know that in England they have camping grounds which are <Col N="747" /> known as commons.  These people are compelled to move into them and they even have to pay tolls.  But here they are a law unto themselves.  They do what they like, they go where they like and they camp where they like.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether any census is taken of their numbers but I should say from my observations that the number of itinerants has increased very much in recent years.  I would say that, during the last 12 or 15 years, the numbers who have taken to the roads, judging by the number of caravans that one sees, have increased considerably.  I think that, no matter how we may try to get away from this problem, we will have to face it and put in the hands of the Gardaí some authority and some effective means for controlling this menace.  Otherwise, the menace will become much more acute, and the problems arising from the multiplication in numbers of these people on our roads will become much greater.</P>
    <P>Much has been said of drunken drivers and of the various other problems that arise from road traffic. Deputy MacBride, I think, said that he believed that 50 per cent. of the accidents occurring on the roads were caused mainly by people who had taken too much drink.  I am inclined to disagree. I do not know whether there are any statistics available segregating the various causes that are responsible for accidents on the roads.  I think myself that many accidents are caused by people who have decidedly bad manners on the road, people whose use of the road and whose discretion on the road is controlled by the horse power or the number of cylinders which they can sport under the bonnets of their cars.  Again, we have the problem of fast and slow traffic.  Much has been done by the removal of bends on our roads, but even that does not seem to lessen the number of accidents which occur.  As a matter of fact, the indication is that there are more night accidents on streets, caused by dazzling, than there are on roads which have a number of bends.</P>
    <P>In a number of towns, in particular <Col N="748" /> in towns where there is a main thoroughfare running through the main street, there is the problem of lack of effective control of speed.  There is no method by which, under the existing law, in an un-urban town, speed can be effectively controlled in a built-up area.  In my home town, Mitchelstown, which has a straight street, the public street has become a speedway. Interested people in the town have erected notices indicating that motorists should slow to 20 miles an hour but the motorists are well aware that these signs have no legal effect and that violation of the warning carries no legal penalty.  Under the old method, the local authority could, by resolution, seek control of speed in a built-up area.  There was a decision in the court&mdash;I think it was in the Borough of Dún Laoghaire&mdash;that was set aside and, as the law now stands, there is no effective control of speed through an un-urban town.  As a matter of fact, there is no control of speed, as far as I know, through urban towns.</P>
    <P>A great deal could be done if the co-operation of the teachers and the religious in the various schools in the country were sought in educating children in the &ldquo;do's and don'ts&rdquo; of road safety.  Three or four times a year time should be devoted to advising children on safety on the road, at least to educate them to save themselves. We know how unpredictable a child is and we know that it is only by continual emphasis of the &ldquo;do's and don'ts&rdquo; as to conduct on the road that we can save our little children from being knocked down, gravely injured and, in many instances, killed.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in co-operation with the Department of Education and the Garda authorities and teachers, should try to get a campaign afoot whereby children would be more effectively educated to save themselves on the roads from injury or death.</P>
    <P>I would like also to bring to the notice of the Minister the ineffective marking of cross-roads and intersections. Something should be done in regard to this matter.  As far as I am aware, road signs are being reviewed at the moment.  I hope that a better attempt will be made to give some <Col N="749" /> indication of danger ahead to those coming from a side road on to a main road.</P>

      <P>Deputy Boland has asked me about the reorganisation of the Circuit Courts and the District Courts.  I would inform the Deputy that it is only quite recently that the Rules of Court have been agreed to and, pending experience of the working of the District Courts with the higher jurisdiction, I am prepared to wait for some time before deciding on a change or reorganisation of the courts.  At the time Deputy Boland made his statement we had expected that, with the higher jurisdiction, a larger number of cases would be brought into the District Court.  The Rules of Court were not made at the time.  Hence, the lawyers brought most of the cases into the Circuit Court.  Now the rules have been agreed to and, in 12 months' time, when we see how they work, we will be in a better position to judge reorganisation.</P>

    <P>Deputy O'Malley asked a question about a plaintiff in Limerick or Galway who wants to have his case heard before the High Court sitting locally. He wants to know if that can be done. The plaintiff can apply to have his case transferred to the local venue and the matter will be decided.  The reason for not having sittings of the <Col N="750" /> High Court in Limerick or Galway was that no applications came in.  In Cork, people applied to have their cases heard in the High Court sitting in Cork.  It is a matter entirely for the people concerned.</P>

Seventy-five per cent. of prisoners, mostly convicted prisoners, are in prison for only a short period of ten weeks or less.  The State allocates over £1,000 a year to a very charitable organisation which takes an interest in discharged prisoners. Deputy Dunne will agree that, for persons who are only ten weeks in prison, it is very difficult to provide training.  In the Borstal institution in Clonmel, boys are given a trade. There is a system of parole.  They can come out at night-time and go to the pictures.  They are on their word of honour to return.  Very good employment has been found for these men in other countries in the trade that they learned.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dunne and Deputy O'Malley referred to the housing problem in respect of members of the Garda Síochána.  I am a member of a local authority that always allocates a number of houses in their building schemes for members of the Garda.  If the Limerick and Dublin and other public authorities allocated portion of the land or houses in the big housing schemes for the Gardaí it would help to solve the problem.  It has given my predecessor and myself some worry in connection with the lack of accommodation for Gardaí as a whole.  Deputy Byrne pointed out the serious position in Dublin and said the difficulties can be overcome if the Dublin Corporation will give facilities similar to those which other public bodies are giving throughout the country.  He spoke of the Gardaí and of the Gardaí in Dublin. I should just like to put these facts on the record.  In 1953 there were 1,424 Gardaí on duty in Dublin. On the 1st July, 1955, that number was increased to 1,619.  I am sure that when Deputy Byrne hears of those increased figures he will be satisfied that we have endeavoured to meet the situation.</P>
    <P>I hope that drunken drivers will not <Col N="751" /> be encouraged by some of the speeches which were made here to-day.  They may not understand the niceties of the phrases which were used.  There will be headlines that the Opposition&mdash;and I do not think it is their intention&mdash; have criticised me in this connection. I am afraid that people generally may not understand the niceties of what the Opposition are trying to suggest when they say I am failing to exercise the powers which I possess under the Act. It is all very fine for Deputy Major de Valera and Deputy Traynor to point out the great hardship that is involved for these people and to condemn me for things I never said.  After investigating every claim and every petition that comes before me, where there is no extenuating circumstance and no other evidence than that given in the District Court, I will not restore the licence.</P>
    <P>A man is prosecuted in the District Court.  When he is charged, a medical officer is brought to the barracks.  The evidence of the medical officer is given in the District Court.  Then the man appeals to the Circuit Court and the Circuit Court will probably make a change or may modify it in some way but may not restore his licence.  Then the Deputies of all Parties&mdash;it is not confined to Deputies of one Party&mdash; appeal to me as Minister.  We send back to get information from the Circuit Court judge and from the Gardaí. I investigated every one of the 110 petitions that came before me in the past 12 months and no evidence was submitted to me other than what was submitted to the two judges.  Were the judges right&mdash;the two of them&mdash;in their decision or were they wrong?</P>
    <P>It is no use for the Opposition to say that, by an amendment, they opposed the power given to the Minister.  Certainly, I would say that the powers were a bit too generously used in some cases.  Deputy Traynor will be interested to know that I have the support of all the trade unions in the country in the action I have taken, that is, that where no evidence is available other than what is given in the court I will not interfere with the court's decision.</P>

      <P>The ordinary member of the public will not understand the niceties of the phrases used by members of the Opposition.  I was informed that I refused to exercise my functions and duties as Minister for Justice in considering appeals.  I have already told the House that 110 appeals came before me and that we got reports from the Gardaí and the last judge who decided the cases and no evidence other than what had already been given&mdash;except that the man was out of work&mdash;came before me and that, therefore, I refused to interfere with the decision of the court.  The drinker might think he has a number of friends on all sides of the House and he is prepared to make his appeal.  I refused 110 appeals for the reason I have already explained&mdash;that there was no evidence other than what had already been given in the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been asked why I do not bring in an amendment to change the Act.  I think it was promised, in relation to the Road Traffic Act, that a section would be introduced to enable the driver to appeal to the court.  Most of the cases that came before me went before the appeal court.  It must be borne in mind that two judges have already decided not to restore the licence to a man who has been found guilty of driving while under the influence of drink.  Instead of impeaching a Minister&mdash;Deputy O'Malley suggested I should be impeached&mdash;I should receive the support of every member of this House in carrying out my duty and in refusing to allow myself to forget my duty to this House and my duty to protect the public. Surely no Deputy should disagree with me for protecting the interests of the public.  Nevertheless, the charge is made against me that I have not exercised the duties conferred on me under the Act.  I hope the House will accept my statement that I have carefully considered every case.  Having given very careful consideration to every case, I had to consider also the public. Like Deputy Traynor, I am a trade unionist and, if I could err on the side of sympathy, my sympathies would naturally be with a trade unionist who had lost his employment.  I had to ask myself who deserved the greater <Col N="753" /> sympathy&mdash;the man who had lost his licence or the relatives of somebody who had been injured or of somebody who had died as a result of an accident.</P>
    <P>If we get the co-operation of every member of this House then fewer men will be brought to court for drunken driving.  Furthermore, I am trying to save the Deputies of all Parties, because we know that, when a man is brought to court and found guilty, he asks Deputies to make an appeal to the Minister to restore his licence.  If the man feels that I will listen to the appeal of a Government Deputy he will ask a Government Deputy to get in touch with me and if that Deputy is not successful he will go to some other Deputy.  I am saying, in an endeavour to protect Deputies, that, no matter what Party a Deputy may belong to, if there is no other evidence than that given in court the person who has lost his licence will get no sympathy from me.</P>

      <P>That being so, I hope it will lessen the burden and the worry of Deputies who are asked to appeal to me in the matter.  The position is now clear.  People now realise the seriousness of driving while under the influence of drink and they know what the consequences will be.  They need not go to any Deputy for sympathy and they need not come to me because I will refuse to interefere with the decision of the courts.</P>
      <P>I agree with what Deputy Dunne said on the matter of racing.  However, it is not my function.  It is entirely a matter for the Minister for Local Government who gives authority to a public body to close the roads in a particular area.  Deputy MacBride has made some suggestions on the question of staggering the sentences imposed on persons found guilty of drunken driving.  I will give these suggestions to the Department.  They are very good suggestions and well worthy of consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some other Deputies raised questions but I want to refer in particular to Deputy Burke.  He made a statement that some of the younger Guards have <Col N="754" /> received instructions to keep on raiding the public houses.  I want to assure him that the very first opportunity I got of speaking to the Guards I asked them to try and recognise that they are of the people, and for the people and working with the people.  I asked them not to be looking for the most frivolous cases of cars parked a few feet away from the side of the path or of children getting into trouble. There were no instructions issued from my Department to the young Guards that they should go on making themselves busy at raiding the public houses.</P>
    <P>I know that drinking after hours is against the law, but in the country places there are many more serious things than that.  I see nothing criminal in five or six men sitting in a country public house at night-time after a wet day or talking about the threshing.  They would not spend 10/- in a whole night while there would be £10 spent in a club in Dublin.  I see nothing criminal at all in the instance I have mentioned and I ask the Guards to use their common sense and if they do so we will have a better country and better respect for the law.</P>
    <P>Of course, there will be the young or the old Guard who will take advantage of the law as it stands but it is my own personal opinion that the less trouble they cause the better.  I will make inquiries and have the Deputy's report sent on to the Commissioner.  I am sure he does not want the Guards to be over-anxious and to be annoying the people and I do not want the Guards to work under the old English code that they must have so many cases before they can get promotion.  I am satisfied that where there are too many summonses in a district the Guards are neglecting their duty; where there are less summonses it shows that there is respect for the Guards and that the Guards are doing their duty.  I will communicate some of the points made to the Commissioner but I want to assure the Deputies that all they have said will be given very careful consideration.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley made certain suggestions but I am sure that the members of his Front Bench do not <Col N="755" /> want me to mention them to-day.  He did mention a case where I exercised my prerogative to release some man.  If you were ever in jail you would know what it is to be in jail and you would like the House or the Minister to exercise the prerogative and release you.  I released a member of his constituency at the Christmas period. He had a very few months of his sentence unexpired and was offered a very good job if he was released before Christmas.  He had six children.</P>
    <P>The Deputy raised that matter by way of parliamentary question and I thought from the answer I had given him that he was satisfied and that he did not want to have that man detained for another fortnight and so deprive him of his job.  Any Minister or member of this House who makes representations to me on behalf of any poor man in a position like the one to which I have referred can be assured that I will do anything I can to rehabilitate that person and make him a good citizen.</P>
    <P>I do not think I have anything more to say except to thank the House for the manner in which they received this very important Estimate and I will endeavour to give matters raised by the Deputies fair play and impartial consideration.</P>

      <P>Lest there should be a misconception in the minds of the general public as to remarks made from this side of the House with regard to drunken drivers, I want to state that no member of this House or no member of the Opposition would sympathise with any person convicted of driving a motor car while under the influence of drink and incompetent of using the judgment necessary in the control of such a vehicle.  What I did refer to was the statement made by the Minister.  I was in the position of not having before me the remarks of the Minister so that I could quote them but the impression made on my mind at the time was definitely that the Minister was not going to consider any case&mdash;in other words that all appeals were closed.  I am glad to hear <Col N="756" /> that the Minister has given examination to a number of cases on appeal. I think that is in conformity with the legislation which we passed in this House.  If that is so, I am not suggesting for a moment that on examination of the appeal the Minister should reduce either the sentence or the loss of licence.  I am glad to hear that the Minister has been examining these appeals.  The impression created was that the Minister had closed his mind, once the decision of the court had been given.</P>

      <P>As the Minister has dealt with drunken driving, I may perhaps play the part of devil's advocate and say that the drunken driver is not almost the most dangerous.  The lack of courtesy and concern for others is a greater cause of all the damage that is being caused on the roads.  I would like the Minister to draw the Guards' attention to the speeding motor cyclist. At the present moment the Clontarf road is full of cyclists and children on their way to the seaside and every night I have seen speeding motor cyclists going along there at the rate of 60 miles an hour and nothing being done about it.  I think it is most dangerous.</P>

Deputy Beegan referred to the dismissal of a man and the appointment of somebody whose name he gave.  I gave the date on which I had appointed the man previously and I was coming up to a very important point when the House adjourned&mdash;the point as to why this man was not appointed as paymaster under the Office of Public Works.  Deputy Beegan and other Deputies on that side read quotations from the minutes of meetings of certain individuals in which it was stated that people called to my house and that I made a promise.

When I did get <Col N="760" /> back to the office, I set about finding what the position was and made inquiries about the man.  A certain file was handed to me and I am quite sure that Deputy Beegan, in the three years that he was there, saw it and read it. When I inquired about this man, that file from the Special Employment Schemes Office was handed to me.  As I said last night, I have now to do something which I dislike doing because a man's name has been mentioned here when he is not here to defend himself.  What was in that file? Did Deputy Beegan read it?  I ask the House to listen while I quote from the file:</P>

His predecessor, the present Attorney-General, was very helpful, and so is the present man.  This year, he has allocated more money for drainage than ever was spent in this country before.  He happened to be in my county, right beside that scheme on which he is expending £2,200,000 on one job and where this year alone the sum of £150,000 has been allocated for the work.  Next year, please God, there will be twice as much and the year after, four times as much.</P>

      <P>When the Minister was in the area, it was my duty to invite him to come to see this work. Thousands of people who pass up by Turloughmore from any part of Ireland always pull up to see the work, and what was wrong in my inviting the Minister to come there and see it for himself, so that he would know the <Col N="762" /> work of his officials, and, when more money is required next year, be in a position to say: &ldquo;I saw this good work going on&mdash;it is well worth it&rdquo;?</P>
      <P>Deputy Beegan talks about the Rye. Surely he must know that it is not yesterday or the day before that something cropped up about the Rye river. He must know that the survey of the Rye was ordered under the Land Rehabilitation Act on 2nd March, 1950, by Deputy Dillon, Minister for Agriculture. That work was agreed on by the present Minister for Finance in his oft-advocated policy of useful work. That is what the Rye scheme is.  It can now be treated as an independent catchment area, as the Liffey need not be required for drainage work on account of the drainage work on Leixlip and Poulaphouca reservoirs. When Deputy Beegan was going over the priority list, he could not find out anything about the Rye.  He said: &ldquo;Why spend £40,000 on 600 acres?&rdquo; It is not 600, it is 800&mdash;200 more.</P>

After all, we do not want everything for Galway.  Of course, Deputy Beegan is the Simon Pure in the Party.  I am the wrecker of the Fianna Fáil Party; I am the admiral of the navy, out to do the damage and no matter what I do it is wrong, always wrong, including any appointment I make.  As I pointed out when I went to that side of the House and the Deputy was over here as Parliamentary Secretary, damn little thanks anyone got.

      <P>There are a few more to be made.  During his humming and hawing and his display of a certain type of rowdyism last night, Deputy Killilea raised a matter very near to my heart.  I looked then at Deputy Beegan to see was there a blush left in him.  There was not very much&mdash;he was as calm as could be.  He said, as far as I recollect, that the drainage of the Corrib is not going to relieve the flooding in the Belclare-Caherlistrane area.  That is where the people were flooded out last year, when I went to the Archbishop and asked that a fund should be raised there voluntarily to help those people, when I considered the few pounds I could afford to do so, and on public platforms it was said that Deputy Donnellan stood by and contributed nothing.  Then the Deputy came along and said it was the other portion of the scheme, the Black River, that must be done&mdash;and Deputy Beegan never blushed.  It is a wonder Deputy Beegan did not tell him that I started on a survey of the Corrib catchment area in the year 1948 and it was then one scheme.  There was a portion known as the Clare-Dalgan and a portion known as the Mask that Deputy Killilea pretends to be interested in.</P>

I was not going to carry on the Fianna Fáil business of the plotting and the planning that we heard about recently.  They said: &ldquo;If you want to rush this scheme, our advice is to take the few engineers you have on the far end, known as the Black River, and put them on this side known as the Corrib and when that is done put the survey party across and the engineers can go across.&rdquo;</P>

The people there are wondering about it, but in order to do the damage, what has happened? Certain Fianna Fáil &ldquo;spouters&rdquo; are going around to the people and saying: &ldquo;You will pay for this yet, your valuation is going to be raised. You will have to pay for it.

      <P>Of course, Deputy Beegan, when speaking, referred to the visit to the Corrib scheme and said we had a Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Donnellan, crouching behind the big rock to hoist the Clann na Talmhan flag to its mast.  Work of that description occupies No. 1 place in the programme of the Party to which I belong.  It forced the Party across the way to bring in the Act.

      <P>Here is something I cannot understand.

      <P>As regards the provision for schools, in 1954-55 £1,350,000 was provided but, as I explained in my opening statement, we were able to expend only £1,000,050.  That was due mainly to unfavourable weather conditions for building.  There is no intention, as suggested by Deputy Beegan, of anchoring the provision to the £1,000,000 mark.  The grants sanctioned by the Department for school buildings have outrun the building capacity of the Office of Public Works.  There has been much difficulty in recruiting and getting architectural staff for schools.  Efforts are being made to remedy that situation. We do expect this year, weather permitting, to spend much more money.</P>
      <P>Many other points were raised, including a shelter for children as mentioned by Deputy Alfred Byrne.  That reminds me of another Deputy Alfred Byrne, a member of this House&mdash;God rest his soul&mdash;who approached me in connection with shelters in the Phoenix Park.

Many other points were raised by Deputies but, owing to time running out, I cannot answer them but I will get the office to communicate with Deputies in connection with any points they raised.</P>
      <P>As regards drainage generally, the position is that we have a certain number of rivers, such as the Maine and the Moy, and others which were under survey.

This year more money is being spent on arterial drainage than was ever spent before and any man who votes against this Estimate is voting against arterial drainage in this country.  The Galway Deputies are voting to prevent me from spending £150,000 this year.  They are voting to prevent me from going on with the job that was promised for generations upon generations and from going on with the job in respect of which thanks are due to the inter-Party Government, the Attorney-General and the Taoiseach. They stand behind me but, of course, across the way it is not progress they want.  They are green with jealousy and envy.  They are smiling.  They give the kiss of Judas&mdash;the kiss of a traitor.

      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will state the quantities in tons, the average f.o.b. price per ton, and the country of origin, of maize, feeding barley, bran and pollard imported since 1st October, 1954.</P>

      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to circulate in the Official Report a statement showing the quantities in tons, the average c.i.f. price per ton and the countries of origin of maize, barley, bran and pollard imported from 1st October, 1954, to 31st May, 1955.  The values shown include insurance and freight because imports are brought to account only on a c.i.f. basis.  Separate statistics are not collected for feeding barley as such and accordingly the figures shown relate to all types of barley except seed barley.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement:</P>
      <P>IMPORTS of certain Cereals and Feeding Stuffs for the period October, 1954&mdash; May, 1955.</P>

      <P>Details of the arrangements for the payment of rebate on flour used in exports are still the subject of consultation with the exporters concerned.  Broadly, however, the intention is that rebate will be paid on certified claims by exporters as to the flour content of exports duly authenticated by the customs authorities.  The effective price of this flour to exporters will be the price at which a comparable flour is available to manufacturers in a country of destination of the exports.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will take steps to ensure that a supply of turf <Col N="774" /> will be made available for sale to poor people in Galway City next winter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no official control over the distribution of available supplies of turf.  The securing of supplies for any particular area is, accordingly, a matter for arrangement by the fuel merchants concerned through the usual trade channels.</P>
      <P>If the Deputy has in mind the provision for eligible persons in Galway City of cheap turf such as is provided in certain other centres, I would inform him that this matter is one for consideration by the local authority in conjunction with the Department of Social Welfare.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this matter is one which should be dealt with between those who are in the business of selling fuel and those to whom they have to sell the fuel.  The turf which Bord na Móna has for sale in the nearest area is not the kind of turf usually sold in Galway City.  The Galway City trade is usually supplied with handwon turf and merchants in Galway should now take steps to ensure that they will get sufficient supplies for their customers later in the year.  If they do not the fault will be their own.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

    <P>I regret I am unable to give the Deputy the information which he asks for at (a) of his question, as a separate record is not kept.  Since, however, a grant for the erection of a new school cannot be sanctioned without the managers having made an application, the figures which I have given as to the number of grants sanctioned indicate the rate at which such applications are being effectively made.</P>
    <P>I may add that, apart from the provision of entirely new buildings, a heavy programme of enlargement and improvement of existing school buildings is being covered.  In the five years <Col N="779" /> referred to grants to a total of almost £1,300,000 were sanctioned for schemes of extension and improvement at 1,527 schools.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Do the figures given by the Minister not show that there is something wrong as between the actual number of grants sanctioned and the number of schools erected? Can the Minister say if the cause of the delay in having the schools built after the grants are sanctioned is the fact that the managers are having difficulty in raising the necessary money locally?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not aware that the money was available before the sanction had been sought because I know of one particular case where the manager is having extreme difficulty in raising the money.  As a result, the school, whose erection was sanctioned almost 12 months ago, has not been built and it is urgently needed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>When a grant is sanctioned there is a firm undertaking on the part of the manager that the local contribution would be £x, £y or £z as the case may be, and we have enough things to trouble us in dealing with these matters without wondering whether the manager has the last shilling or the last pound in his hand. However, we do not usually have difficulty in getting the grant paid up when there is agreement that the grant will be paid up.  Any delays that occur for a manager in reaching a point at which the grant can be sanctioned arise out of finding a site, having a site approved and having the title to the site established.</P>

      <P>When the grant is sanctioned plans have to be prepared, quantities must be taken out; the architect and the other people concerned have to do their work generally. I have mentioned in dealing with my Estimate that there has been a substantial lag between the total amount of the grants sanctioned, say, in the last seven years and the amount of money actually spent on the building of schools by reason of the fact that the technical staff in the Office of Public Works was not sufficient to deal with the volume of work that was involved due to the increasing number of grants the Department of Education was able to sanction.  Every effort has been made during the last six months, at any rate, to improve that situation and such difficulties as arise through going the long way round and finding architects, and so on, have been cleared out of the way, and I hope to close the gap between the total amount sanctioned and the total amount actually spent in the shape of built schools.</P>

      <P>The Defence Forces (Pensions) Schemes 1937-1953 provide for the payment of short service gratuities to soldiers discharged or transferred to the Reserve Defence Force on completion of three or more years' service in the Permanent Defence Force.  The rates of gratuities payable are based on rank and number of years' service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Defence Force Regulations provide <Col N="784" /> for the granting of leave of absence not exceeding the last 21 days prior to discharge or transfer to the Reserve Defence Force to soldiers who have rendered at least two years' and six months' continuous service in the Permanent Defence Force and leave of absence not exceeding the last 14 days prior to discharge or transfer to the Reserve Defence Force to soldiers who have rendered continuous service for not less than one year and six months in the Permanent Defence Force.  Pay and ration allowance are issuable in respect of such leave prior to its commencement.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he is aware that, two years ago, during operations on the Feale drainage scheme, the well at Killacrim, Listowel, was removed and a pump erected in its place; that since its erection it has failed to work, with the result that the 50 families who obtained their water supply from the well have to travel over three miles to obtain a supply; and, if so, if he will ensure that normal water facilities are provided immediately for these people; further, if he will state the cost of erecting the inoperative pump.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Donnellan)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I explained to the Deputy when he called to my office last week, a well at Killacrim was necessarily removed in the course of operations under the Feale catchment drainage scheme.  A temporary alternative water supply, which later dried out, was provided for the owner of the land at a cost of approximately £15.  The provision of a public water supply is not a matter for the Commissioners of Public Works.</P>

      <P>(<i>a</i>)  The present number of unit payments per week on the Corrib Drainage Scheme is two.</P>
      <P>(<i>b</i>)  Payment of remuneration to the Pay Clerk is made quarterly and payment of expenses is made monthly.  The remuneration paid in respect of each week from the 6th January, 1955, to the end of the June, 1955 quarter and the expenses paid in respect of each week from the 6th January to the end of May, 1955, were as follows.  Payment in respect of expenses for June has not yet been made.</P>

      <P>On 1st July, 1955, there were 150 labourers, 42 supervisory staff and six engineers employed on the Glyde and Dee drainage scheme.  The figures include men&mdash;e.g., drillers, etc.&mdash;who receive a differential over the basic labourer's rate, but do not include tradesmen, vehicle drivers or office staff.  For the week ended 25th June, 1955, the average cost per man of these grades was: labourer, £5 5s. 3d.; supervisory staff, £8 6s. 2d.; engineers, £14 17s.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the Parliamentary Secretary's reply, does the case not seem similar to one which appeared in the Chinese army years ago?  It seems to be very close to it. You have 42 supervisors and six engineers over 150 labourers and those include drivers of all sorts, and technical staff.  Would the Parliamentary Secretary say whether or not it would be possible to reduce the number of supervisory staff and accordingly pay the labourers a decent wage on that job?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the reply given to the question which he addressed to the Minister for Agriculture on the subject of Graughill pier on the 8th June, 1955. It was not until the 2nd July, 1955, that the Commissioners of Public Works received from the Mayo County Council, in reply to their letter of 8th September, 1953, a statement of objections to the scheme of improvements. That statement is under consideration and there will be no avoidable delay in communicating with the county <Col N="797" /> council.  There is, however, little prospect of work beginning this year; the nature of the work requires in any case that it be started in spring or early summer.</P>

I understand that the Caherciveen generating station will not be in commission until late in 1956 and that the 1955 turf crop will not be required for the station.  The extent to which financial assistance for the improvement of the bog roads in the area will require to be made cannot be determined until details are available of locations of the bog holdings from which the station will draw supplies of the 1956 turf crop.</P>

    <P>Including salaries and all other items, the gross expenditure in 1954-55 is estimated at £1,022,000, compared with £990,000 in 1953-54.</P>
    <P>At the peak period of employment in December, 1954, employment was given to a total of 5,708 men, of whom 1,076 were employed on urban schemes and 4,632 on rural schemes.</P>
    <P>The gross Vote provision in 1954-55 was £721,400.  Added to this were £212,756, being the unexpended balance of the 1953-54 grant from the National Development Fund and £350,000 new allocation from the Fund, making a total of £1,284,156.  For the current year the gross Vote provision is £722,800.  The amount brought forward as unexpended National Development Fund grant is larger at £246,627.  It is proposed to give £300,000 from the fund, so that the gross amount available for the year will be £1,269,427.</P>
    <P>There has been a substantial drop in the number of unemployment assistance recipients in the past year. According to the census taken by the Special Employment Schemes Office, the number of male unemployment assistance recipients for the whole country in January, 1955, was 33,576 compared with 39,989 in 1954, an overall reduction of 16 per cent.  The figures for urban areas were 9,316 in January, 1955, compared with 11,936 in January, 1954, a reduction of 22 per cent.  For rural areas, including towns with a population of 200 and over, the figures were 24,260 in January, 1955, as compared with 28,053 in January, 1954, a reduction of 13.5 per cent.  The trend of reduction in the unemployment assistance recipients figures, while varying from month to month, is still evident.</P>
    <P>Sub-head F&mdash;Urban Employment Schemes&mdash;is intended to finance employment schemes in the four county borough areas of Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford, the Borough of Dún Laoghaire and such of the 55 other urban districts in which there are sufficient numbers of unemployment assistance recipients to form gangs of economic size.  These schemes are administered by the respective local authorities through the Department of Local Government and grants are made conditional on the local authority submitting suitable work schemes for approval by the Special Employment Schemes Office and making a contribution towards their cost. The contribution in the case of Dublin is 20 per cent. for the last two years.  It is about 17 per cent. in the other borough areas and varies between 5 per cent. and 17 per cent. in the other urban areas, the average for the other urban areas being about 13 per cent.  The provision for this service in the Estimates for 1955-56 is £140,000 which it is proposed to supplement by a sum of £160,000 from this year's National Development Fund grant, which gives a total State grant of £300,000 for the authorisation of new works in urban areas.  The expenditure on urban schemes from State grant last year, as already indicated, was £332,000.  Taking into account the unexpended balances of previous years' National Development Fund grants, the total amount available this year will be £458,773.  Some of this money will, of course, be carried forward to the year 1956-57 but it is expected that the actual expenditure in the current year will show a substantial increase over last year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="807" /> Some reference should perhaps be made to the situation in the Dublin Borough area last year.  A sum of £258,800 was available for new works in Dublin which included a balance of £58,800 from the National Development Fund grant of 1953-54 for which schemes were not submitted to the Special Employment Schemes Office before the 31st March, 1954.  Schemes to fully absorb this amount were submitted during the year, including about £131,000 for footpaths and road works and £128,000 for amenity schemes such as parks, recreation centres, canal walks, etc.  Many of these road and amenity schemes were not put in hands, until late in the year, so that there is a substantial volume of works, costing over £160,000, available as a carry-forward in Dublin in the current year.  The average number of men employed during the financial year ended 31st March, 1955, was 322, of whom 260 were unemployment assistance recipients. Each man gets 12 weeks' employment and as the gangs thus rotate every three months it means that over 1,000 unemployment assistance recipients in Dublin got a spell of employment in the year.  The number of unemployment assistance recipients in Dublin fell from 6,361 in January, 1954, to 4,964 in January, 1955, and on the 25th June the figure was less than 4,000.  It is proposed to make a sum of £175,000 available for Dublin in 1955-56.  With the usual 20 per cent. contribution from the corporation, this will make a total sum of approximately £219,000 available for new works in the Dublin area, and a total commitment for expenditure (including the carry-over from 1954-55) of £380,000.</P>
    <P>Employment schemes in rural areas under sub-heads G and H form a joint programme of works.  As already stated, the number of male unemployment assistance recipients in rural areas was down by 3,793 or 13.5 per cent. at January, 1955, compared with January, 1954.  The provision in sub-head G is £60,000, the same as last year.  It is proposed to supplement the Vote provision of £120,000 for sub-head H, minor employment schemes, by a grant of £20,000 from the National Development Fund, making a total sum of £140,000 in the current year.  Adding <Col N="808" /> the £60,000 under sub-head G., the gross sum for employment schemes in the rural areas is £200,000.</P>
    <P>The provision under sub-head I is for the repair and reconstruction of roads and drains to facilitate the production of hand-won turf by landholders and other persons for their domestic needs or for sale in neighbouring towns.  The cost of this service has increased in recent years.  The expenditure was £135,000 in 1951-52, £143,575 in 1952-53, £132,000 in 1953-54 and £158,000 in 1954-55.  It is proposed to repeat last year's provision, that is £100,000 in the Vote to be supplemented by a National Development Fund grant of £40,000, giving a total of £140,000.</P>
    <P>Apart from the proposed provision of £140,000 for road and drainage works for ordinary bog development schemes, a further special allocation will in due course be made from the National Development Fund to facilitate the production of hand-won turf for the four turf electricity generating stations at Milltown Malbay, County Clare; Screebe, County Galway; Cahirciveen, County Kerry, and Gweedore, County Donegal, the first two of which will be in commission and accepting delivery of turf before the end of March, 1956.</P>
    <P>Bog development schemes are ordinarily full-cost grants and contributions are required only in the case of privately owned bogs which are let annually to a substantial number of turbary tenants and where the owner's income is such that it would not be unreasonable to expect him to give some help towards providing reasonable facilities for roads and drains for his tenants.</P>
    <P>The rural improvements scheme (sub-head J) makes provision for grants towards the cost of carrying out works to benefit the lands of two or more farmers, such as small drainage schemes, bridges and the construction or repair of accommodation roads to farmhouses, lands or bogs.  State grants varying from 75 per cent. of the cost in the case of farmers with an average land valuation of £18 and over to 95 per cent. in the case of farmers with an average land valuation of below £6 are available, subject to the balance of <Col N="809" /> the cost being met by the benefiting landholders.  Where the work is of substantial benefit to the general &ldquo;outside&rdquo; public in addition to the farmers immediately concerned, the percentage of State grants can, where circumstances warrant, be increased.  These rural improvements schemes grants are available in any part of the country, irrespective of the number unemployed in the areas concerned.</P>
    <P>The Vote provision for the rural improvements scheme is the same as last year at £197,000.  A supplemental grant of £53,000 will be available from the National Development Fund.  Taking into account the unexpended balance of National Development Fund grant at the beginning of the financial year&mdash;£61,838 at 1st April, 1955&mdash;the total amount available this year will be £311,838.  It is expected that the actual expenditure in the current year will be £270,000 as compared with the estimated expenditure of £223,500 in 1954-55.  All the foregoing figures are gross figures and include local contributions by farmers, averaging from 11 per cent. to 12 per cent., which are brought in as Appropriations-in-Aid through sub-head L.</P>
    <P>Due to the popularity of this scheme since the change in the terms in 1950 in favour of the poorer farmers, there is an accumulation of applications lodged in the Special Employment Schemes Office and I think it only fair to tell the House that inevitably some of these applications must wait quite a while before being dealt with, notwithstanding the fact that, as stated already, we expect to step up the actual expenditure this year by nearly £50,000.</P>
    <P>The provision for Miscellaneous Schemes (sub-head K) is the same as last year.  It is mainly to meet expenditure on minor marine works, such as the extension and reconstruction of small piers and slips to facilitate the fishing industry and for the landing of seaweed and sand in the interests of local farmers.  The county councils concerned are required to contribute one-quarter of the cost of these marine works and to maintain them on completion. The sub-head also finances archæological excavations at Tara, <Col N="810" /> Lough Gara, Lough Gur and other centres.</P>
    <P>The Appropriations-in-Aid (sub-head L) realised £31,500 last year.  This sub-head is made up almost entirely of the contributions in respect of rural improvements schemes, but it also includes receipts in respect of bog development schemes, county council contributions to the cost of minor marine works and receipts from the sale of surplus stores.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Estimate was introduced, a motion was tabled by Deputy Childers, Deputy Carter and myself in respect of three of the main sub-heads: minor employment schemes, bog development schemes and rural improvement schemes.  The motion would have been taken, I understand, were it not for the fact that at the time the Parliamentary Secretary was not available and that the Minister for Finance had another appointment.  It went on until the Estimates were introduced and then the Budget came in.  We find no fault whatever with that, but we brought in this motion in order to strengthen the hands of the Parliamentary Secretary in securing considerable increases for these three very important schemes in rural Ireland in particular.</P>
      <P>It might be asked why was it we had any doubt in our minds as to what was going to happen, but we had in mind what happened in the two last years of the Parliamentary Secretary's previous period in office when there was a certain amount of economising&mdash;very foolish economising, in my opinion&mdash;on these three sub-heads.  In the year 1949-50, the total expenditure on all three schemes was £249,777, according to information which I got.  In the year 1950-51, the expenditure was reduced to £237,529&mdash;over £12,000 of a decrease in one year.  It was in June of 1951-52 that I took over, and the Estimates were there, but I sought Supplementary Estimates and also grants from certain other sub-heads where there were savings, in order to step up that expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1951-52, the expenditure came up to £385,327&mdash;an increase of £48,000&mdash; and in 1952-53, the expenditure again increased to £457,347.  In 1953-54, it <Col N="811" /> increased to £555,682 which was a big come-up on the figure for 1950-51.  It was an increase of more than 100 per cent.&mdash;of £318,153.  No money can be more usefully expended than money expended under these three sub-heads, sub-heads H, I and J, and I am glad that the tendency now is further to increase it.  When we put down that motion, we did not expect it would be doubled, but we did expect that, with money from the National Development Fund, plus the Vote, there would be a very considerable increase.  I am glad to see that the trend is now in the right direction, anyhow.</P>
    <P>Last year, according to figures I got, the expenditure on minor employment schemes was £160,000.  The National Development Fund contribution to that was £40,000 and from the Vote, £120,000.  The figure for bog development schemes was £100,000, with a contribution of £58,000 from the National Development Fund, a total of £158,000, and for rural improvement schemes, £197,000 from the Vote and £26,500 from the National Development Fund. When that fund was created in 1953, it was coming near the end of the year when the Office of Public Works for these three schemes got a contribution of £200,000 to be apportioned between the three schemes.  There were only four months of the financial year in which to expend that money, together with the Vote, and consequently there was a certain amount of hang-over, but nevertheless a sum of £117,621 was expended, with a carry-over of £82,379.</P>
    <P>Last year, the total from the National Development Fund was £124,500, which, with the £82,000 carried over, meant that there was only a sum of £32,103 made available from the National Development Fund for these three schemes last year.  Last year, there was a full 12 months period and the organisation was there.  It had not to be set up as rapidly or as much in the impromptu manner as in the previous year, and, while admitting that the year was not very favourable for carrying out schemes, I should imagine that more could have been expended on these schemes.  I am glad to hear from the Parliamentary Secretary <Col N="812" /> that more will be expended this year and I hope we will have favourable weather for it.</P>
    <P>I am very interested in the bog development sub-head, for very good reasons, because anywhere that you have badly drained bogs, and we have many of them, and where there are bad roads into bogs, it is a serious handicap to the farmers at the time of the year when attention to their crops is of very great consequence.  Often-times in order to secure the winter supply of fuel for the house the farmers, because of the bad roads and of drainage into the bogs, had to neglect their crops and lose a very considerable amount as a result.  Anything that can possibly be done in that way to further the development of the bogs and to make it possible for the farmer, when he has his turf cut and saved, to leave it there if necessary clamped, so that he can take it home any time of the year is in my opinion very sound national economy&mdash;in fact, I think money invested there can be regarded as capital development.</P>
    <P>As far as rural improvements schemes are concerned, a great deal of work is being done and the standard of the roads has been brought up considerably, but, of course, it takes a good deal more money now to put a road into repair than even five, six or ten years ago, and naturally enough a considerably greater sum has to be estimated for and made available for the carrying out of that work.</P>
    <P>The work in general is well carried out, but there are many places where, if it were possible, it would be very useful for the roads to get a steam-rolling. The Parliamentary Secretary would be well advised to go into that question.  Furthermore, there is a great outcry regarding the poor condition of the numerous village roads or cul-de-sac roads.  Legislation was put through this House enabling the county councils to take over roads, repair them and maintain them.  We know quite well that, the rates being so high and the amounts expended on roads by local authorities so high in addition to what comes from the central Exchequer, by way of grants, the county councils would be very reluctant <Col N="813" /> to take over the roads in the first instance and put them into repair. Every inducement and encouragement possible should be given to the people concerned to avail of the rural improvements scheme in the first instance and to bring the standard of the road up to the condition of repair whereby the county council could not very well refuse to take it over for maintenance. That, I think, is the greatest hope for roads of this kind, the mileage of which I understand is very great indeed.</P>
    <P>I have nothing to say about minor employment schemes other than that I notice there was a decrease in the amount of money expended.  That concerns the poorer districts.  The Parliamentary Secretary states that the number of unemployment recipients has been reduced considerably.  I am very glad to hear that, if that is the position; nevertheless, that should be no great reason for a decrease in the amount because, after all, there are a number of people in the congested areas all the time who are unemployed and we do know how that money is given.  It has been given over a certain period.  It might be no harm to increase the period or else to take in more of the roads for which that money has been made available in a particular electoral division or rural district and have it expended.  I think that money also is very well expended.</P>
    <P>I am sure that the Ceann Comhairle and the House will be glad that I am not going to talk at length on this.  I have made all my remarks now and I leave it in the hands of others.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary stated in the course of his speech that unemployment had decreased. He put a slant on what might have been otherwise a non-political contribution by not referring to the fact that unemployment also decreased in the previous year, and decreased very steadily.  It was down at one time by 10,000 over the previous year.  I just <Col N="814" /> merely wanted to mention that in passing and also to state that no one in this House should boast of reduced unemployment, having regard to the very high figure of emigration.</P>
      <P>If the Parliamentary Secretary reads the preliminary and provisional report on the population of the country from the Registrar General of Births and Deaths announcing that there has been a small decline in the total population of this country during the last four years, and remembers that, during his previous term of office, 121,000 persons emigrated from this country, he should agree with us on this side of the House that the less we boast about marginal reductions in unemployment the better we will be, because unemployment and emigration have to be taken together. Though I am aware that a certain degree of emigration is due to the tremendous trade boom in Britain and Europe in general, the fact remains that the problem is still with us, and we are not going to help the country in speaking of a reduction in unemployment amounting to 7,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to speak to-day in some considerable detail on the whole long-term problem of the non-public roads. The last time I had occasion to speak of this matter, when the Parliamentary Secretary was in office, he did not give me much encouragement.  His Government now have such a comfortable majority that striking innovations in policy are far more possible than they could be to a Government with a fractional majority at its command.  One of the features of the present Government is the utter and complete dullness of their programme, the absence of innovations, the absence of any challenging statement by any Minister in regard to the major problems of the day, such as the need for increasing productivity and so forth&mdash;and that after over a year in office.  The Government have an opportunity for making a far more detailed study of the whole problem of non-public roads in this country.  There are 20,000 miles of non-public roads compared to 40,000 of public roads, and, in relation to the rapidly increasing numbers of cars, tractors, and vehicles used by farmers of every type of acreage and <Col N="815" /> every type in every area of the country, the administration and methods used to repair those roads have become just like the poor relief given out by the British in the time of the British occupation of this country. The whole administration and method of repair are entirely out of date and bear no relation whatever to the modern problem of motor traffic on stone-bound roads.</P>
    <P>I am amazed at the Parliamentary Secretary and his Government.  They have been in office now since June, 1954, and they have not even announced to the House that they are prepared to study a problem which is of almost as great importance as the increase in agricultural productivity.  It is absolutely true to say that one can judge the economic state of a civilisation by the state of its communications, and if one judges this country by the state of its communications we could almost be regarded as a country on its way out.  I am aware of the fact that it was the Fianna Fáil Government which established under totally different conditions the three main methods of repairing the most important roads&mdash;minor relief schemes, rural improvements schemes&mdash;amended to a slight extent in their administration by the present Parliamentary Secretary&mdash; and bog development schemes, in so far as roads are concerned.</P>
    <P>It was the Fianna Fáil Government that established those grants under quite different circumstances when there was very little motor traffic on the roads and during the war, when there was even less motor traffic.  One only has to study the increase in the motor registrations in the different counties and the number of tractors coming on to the roads to realise that, from 1951 onwards, the problem was becoming quite a different one.  I am not saying that we in Fianna Fáil solved the problem.  We were beginning to consider what would have to be done to deal with these new problems covering the whole of the network of roads of the country.</P>
    <P>It certainly is a challenge to the Parliamentary Secretary.  The Parliamentary Secretary is aware that the <Col N="816" /> system of repairing roads based on the formula of the number of persons unemployed in any particular electoral division is a ludicrous method of repairing roads for modern traffic.  It depends too much on the economic situation of the people of the area in certain months of the year, when the unemployment statistics are taken.  It does not take account of emigration or any recognition of the fact that emigration has been so severe from many districts in the period of office of both Governments that the economic condition of the neighbourhood, both as regards unemployment figures and the technical nature of the work to be done on the road, has no relation to the amount of money available for any particular electoral area.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that there is any single country in Western Europe where roads are being repaired in that fashion&mdash;that where there are 40 men unemployed, so much money is to be expended on road repairs, and where there are 80 unemployed, twice that amount, without any regard whatever to the various conditions of traffic and the soil and the condition of the road. The whole thing is out of date.</P>
    <P>The same thing applies to the rural employment schemes&mdash;excellent schemes in themselves which have increased in volume very much since the first day they were started.  These are schemes based on the unequivocal consent of the beneficiaries of the work to be done on the road.  There are nearly always quite a number of people concerned with such roads who do not want the roads improved&mdash;who either live in so simple a way that the repair of the road is of no particular advantage to them, people whose economic situation is such that they cannot afford the cost and whose families are unable to take part in the work, and people whose social position makes it impossible for them to take part in the work and so recoup themselves for some of the cost.</P>
    <P>A situation of this sort is quite fantastic, as the Parliamentary Secretary knows.  We have in some cases the big farmer who refuses to pay an increased contribution for a particular road.  We have others who live near <Col N="817" /> the end of the road and who will not contribute and, as a result, you have that scheme regarded as insufficiently important to be taken up as a minor relief scheme.</P>
    <P>Then you may have areas in the country where there is a small number of unemployed in the electoral division and where all the people are hoping that a grant for their particular road will come at the end of a long queue. There are a certain number of cases where the people feel that if they wait for another few years to have the road repaired they will sooner or later receive a grant.  There are areas of that kind in my constituency where the number of unemployed is very small and where this feeling has a retarding effect on the development of rural improvements schemes.</P>
    <P>Then you have the arrangement under a recent Act whereby the local authority may acquire cul-de-sac roads. Local authorities are deterred from acquiring those roads at the rate at which they should be acquired if there is to be a practicable attempt made towards bringing up the mileage of such roads that are fit for motor car and tractor traffic.  County councils are afraid of increasing the maintenance rate for these roads and, in addition, the definition of the public interests of the road is still in doubt.  County councils are sometimes in doubt as to whether a particular cul-de-sac road could be regarded as of sufficient utility to be sanctioned by the Department of Local Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The county councils may have the last say but the rate of acquisition is appallingly slow having regard to the seriousness of the problem.  The urgency of this problem is due to the vastly increased motor and tractor traffic.  I do not want to make any political capital about this except to say that when the Government has an overall majority of 13, at least some effort should be made to deal with this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="818" /> The problem is related also to a social change that is taking place and about which there is on both sides of the House far too little discussion. That problem is the decline in the value of farm residences which are situated at the end of cul-de-sac roads which are not likely to be improved to bear tractor or motor car traffic. We lack continuous statistical information with regard to the number of such residences.  We have very complete statistics furnished to us in this House each year but one of the big gaps is the fact that, while each year the number of holdings of different areas is given by the Land Commission, there is never a continuous table showing the number of farm holdings and the number of holdings such as I have mentioned.  We are lacking that information which is information of a nature which should be the subject of continuous study by members of this House.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary should study the actual increase in the size of the average farm, an increase that is steadily taking place at a rate that nothing the Land Commission does in the near future is likely to modify.  He will find that thousands of holdings are being consolidated as a result of emigration and of poor communications. The Population Commission estimates that if the Land Commission continues along its present lines&mdash;and I see great difficulty in its altering its methods&mdash;in the course of the next 20 years, the average farm is likely to be one of 46 acres.  It would be impossible for anyone here to estimate how much the consolidation of holdings is due to economic causes beyond our control, to the minimum standard of income demanded by the agricultural community, to the comparison of the standard of living here with that in Britain and the tremendous inducements offered in a prosperous Great Britain to workers from this country.</P>
    <P>It would be very hard to ascribe the particular proportion of cause to poor communications, but they certainly form part of the cause.  People who live down a cul-de-sac road, which cannot bear motor car and tractor traffic, find that the younger generation do <Col N="819" /> not want to live there.  This total Vote of under £2,000,000 to cover the repairs along 20,000 miles of non-public roads is absurd; it is a mere flea-bite; it does not represent any real contribution to the modern traffic road problem which is being created by the colossal increase in the number of cars &mdash;second-hand small cars owned by farmers of very modest means who find it essential to have a car to do their business&mdash;and by the colossal increase in the number of tractors.</P>
    <P>The poor communications also affect agricultural production.  The present Minister has agreed with this side of the House that some increase in co-operative methods is essential if small farmers are to adopt the scientific standards of farming which it is possible to have and which would double production.  Thousands of miles of non-public roads are utterly unsuitable for drawing modern machinery, if it were used co-operatively by small farmers. Thousands of miles of roads would break-up now if the farmers had facilities for the co-operative use of machinery.  Thousands of miles are becoming unfit to carry anything but the very lightest of tractors and would not carry a combine.</P>
    <P>The same thing applies to comparatively simple operations like spreading limestone.  There is extra cost along a cul-de-sac road, and if there does not happen to be the right kind of spreader in the area, a small spreader, the work cannot be done.  There are many miles where modern machinery could not turn into a farm gate without the removal of the gate or the pillars supporting it.  These are problems that have to be faced.  In spite of the efforts made under successive Ministers, the work of developing hillside reclamation, where there is a small proportion of stones, is hopelessly behindhand.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The repair of non-public roads which would enable limestone to be spread more easily is a matter for him.  The question of hillside reclamation has not been stated in a big way.  If hillside reclamation is to be effective, far better communication will be needed along the minor roads.</P>
      <P>We have all noted that, whatever progress we have made, there has tended to be a tremendous stagnancy in our administrative system.  Successive Governments have been scared stiff of altering ways and means of administering schemes.  With the exception of the promotion of the Department of Social Welfare and the Department of Health, the same Government Departments are administering the same schemes for the last 20 years. There has been no concentration of a particular Government activity under a special Minister.  For example, this is one of the very few countries in Europe which has not got a Minister for Communications.  Sometimes the Ministry of Communications is merged with the Ministry of Posts and Telegraphs; sometimes there is a special Minister.  So far as roads are concerned, there is a variety of authorities and there has never been any over-all consideration as to whether we could not repair all our roads more efficiently through some greater co-ordination or through a change in the method of administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has the opportunity to study this problem.  I suggest to him that he appoint an inter-departmental committee of those Departments concerned with roads. He should add to it some first-class engineers who are experts in road repair problems.  They should make a survey of the problem, taking examples of various counties&mdash;an eastern county, a western county, a congested county, a non-congested county, an area where the mileage of non-public roads is high, an area where it is very low compared with public roads.  He should get a report on the different <Col N="821" /> classes of roads, the number of persons living per mile, stated in different grades for each class of road, so that he may know what the problem is, so that he can find out, for example, how much it would cost to repair thoroughly, for modern traffic, roads used by more than a given number of persons.  He could find out how much more it would cost if he lowered the standard and took a number of persons per mile of road that was less than in his first calculation&mdash;and so on.</P>
    <P>He could have an examination undertaken of the standards to be adopted in repairing non-public roads. He could find out how much it would cost to make these roads fit for traffic as it may be in ten years from now. This plan should cover a long period. He should examine the possibility of improving these roads by pass-ways, by means of which vehicles could pass each other, by widening the road at various points while maintaining the narrow width for a considerable distance.</P>
    <P>He could examine in far greater detail than has been found possible up to now the use of the American method, of making a primitive type of concrete road by spreading cement powder, emulsing it with the soil, spraying it afterwards and rolling it. That is a method adopted throughout the United States in a good-class road, not to bear heavy traffic but to bear the kind of traffic that would go along non-public roads&mdash;tractors and so on. So far as I know, the Department of Local Government never brought in one of those machines to experiment with, yet they are widely used in the United States.</P>
    <P>He should survey the cost of doing this work.  He should try to make up his mind that beyond a certain standard the State cannot afford to go, but that it would be necessary to spend a very considerable capital sum, something of the same kind that we had to spend when dealing with other national problems.  Governments never hesitated to replace the huge number of slum houses in this country.  Governments never hesitated to spend the money to get over the appalling past history we had in regard to housing. <Col N="822" /> We seem to be terrified of dealing with a problem that is facing us.  Over one-third of the total mileage of roads consists of non-public roads about which no one is doing anything of a scientific or realistic character.  We are simply spending inconceivably small amounts tinkering with the problem.</P>
    <P>Having estimated the various alternative courses according to whatever standard is adopted, the Parliamentary Secretary could then decide what he was going to do about maintenance, whether the county council could ever afford to maintain the roads if they were repaired, whether some increased grant from the Central Fund would be required, and whether the method of financing should be from the National Development Fund or from capital grants.  He will have to examine the question of the rates structure of county councils with very great realism. It would appear that on both sides of the House it is admitted that rates have grown to a maximum limit. Something better will have to be done in the earlier stages in order to overcome this problem.</P>
    <P>To spend any money on minor roads solely with a view to giving employment is, in my own opinion, ludicrous under modern circumstances.  One has only to examine the comparative migration from the land of those people who are only employed on the land for part of the year and those workers who are employed on the land all the year round to see that, however invaluable it may be, the provision of anything from six to 12 weeks' work for a man who is unemployed in the winter at the rate of wages offered on these schemes is not of itself going to cure the migration problem.  It may relieve it.  It is no doubt a very valuable social contribution at the present time but it is not a fundamental cure.</P>
    <P>The only fundamental cure is the doubling of agricultural production in the areas and the building up of far greater purchasing power which would indirectly or directly employ these people.  I am not saying that I am opposed to the minor relief schemes.  I am simply saying that they are only a stop-gap in so far as migration is <Col N="823" /> concerned.  If the Parliamentary Secretary were to survey this problem adequately and put into operation a realistic scheme, he would not only give employment but it would still be possible for him, if he so wished, where there was a large number of unemployed, to add particular contributions to those areas without preventing the inauguration of a thoroughly modern up-to-date scheme for the repair of these roads with modern machinery where it is available and do the job in a really scientific way.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has all the experts at his command to examine this problem.  I should like him to examine it fundamentally.  It is surely possible to have an inter-departmental committee where the whole of this question can be examined.  I might add that I know the difficulties he is going to face.  There is quite a number of people, not necessarily conservative-minded, who say it is beyond the bounds of possibility that this huge mileage of road can be put in proper order, that the social pattern of life must be allowed to change; that there are far too many miles of roads; that, in the course of the next 20 years, people will change their residences until they line the county roads and the main roads; that, in the long run, that will be the best solution to the difficulty and that, therefore, the present road grants, the minor relief grants and the rural improvements schemes are the best that can be done. The social pattern is bound to change.</P>
    <P>There were always too many miles of roads in this country arising from historical conditions and in the circumstances they tend to wear very rapidly. There were provisions in the 1890 Act which continued to 1932.  It is up to the Parliamentary Secretary to examine that problem and to fix the standard he is to adopt.  A special grant for the repair of non-public roads must be made and there should be a very large number of houses built near those roads.  If he changes the system, he will be able to do it only in respect of a small mileage of these roads.  We could even point to the precedents in other countries where the social pattern has changed and where people <Col N="824" /> came down from the hills to live or migrate.  I am trying to speak as far as I can in a non-political way because I know that no Government has as yet solved this problem.  I may be going too far by saying that the present Parliamentary Secretary could by now have produced a solution of it but at least he can announce that he will inaugurate a survey of the problem so that we may know where we stand.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>The very able and informative contribution of Deputy Childers in this debate will be lost as far as the Special Employment Schemes Office and the Parliamentary Secretary are concerned, not through any lack of interest on the part of those people but because they are not charged with responsibility for most of the matters mentioned by Deputy Childers.  I have no doubt whatever that the Parliamentary Secretary is anxious to see all those rural roads repaired and brought into proper condition.</P>
      <P>To my mind the problem is so great that it is rather unfair to frighten the Special Employment Schemes Office by suggesting that they should tackle this problem.  I am convinced that, on this Vote, we can deal only with the question of getting larger grants to carry out the work that is already planned for this particular office.  The major points mentioned by Deputy Childers are a matter of Government policy and are, or should be, directly the responsibility of the Department of Local Government which deals with roads in general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a motion here which I understand is being discussed with this Vote.  I must say that the movers of this motion seem to have anticipated my views in this matter because it was my intention to put down a motion on similar lines, perhaps not as wide as this.  My motion was prepared to cover the position as I know it in my own constituency of Roscommon.  I intended to make a special case to the Parliamentary Secretary and ask him at least to double the amount of money made available from the Special Employment Schemes Office towards the drainage of bogs, the improvement of <Col N="825" /> bog roads, roads under construction and cul-de-sac roads generally within the county.</P>
    <P>The motion, as outlined, is a more embracing one than mine and, consequently, I am whole-heartedly in favour of the motion in its present form. There are other Deputies who are more familiar than I am with the conditions in other counties.  I can assure the Parliamentary Secretary and the House that I happen to know intimately the conditions that obtain in my own constituency of Roscommon. Deputy Childers made a very interesting point when he stated that all Governments seemed to be petrified and afraid to make innovations.  I think that is a very fair comment and I like to hear it coming from Deputy Childers who has never been tied up with red tape.</P>
    <P>The man who is afraid to take action is, to my mind, no use but the man who is prepared to make a mistake should at least be given credit for trying to do something.  The man who is afraid to alter regulations and conditions within his Department, who sits back and takes the conservative advice tendered to him by officials is a man, whether Minister or Parliamentary Secretary, who is a sheer waste of time in any Government and is of no advantage to any Government.  As far as the present Parliamentary Secretary is concerned he was one of the first men in this set-up who made an innovation &mdash;it was a minor one I grant you&mdash;in so far as the working of the rural improvements scheme was concerned.</P>
    <P>I support the regulation or the system whereby the contribution from the local people was low and that in itself proved very beneficial in so far as families living on by-roads are concerned because more areas began to look for the Government grant as a result of the reduction in the local contribution.  I am in complete support of this motion and I understand from the remarks made by Deputy Beegan that he is quite satisfied with the amount of money made available by the Government this year under this Vote. I want to say I, personally, am not satisfied or anything like it.  The last <Col N="826" /> 12 months have been catastrophic, so far as rural areas are concerned.</P>
    <P>We have heard people here talking of the Commission on Emigration which is sitting to try to ascertain the reasons why Irish people leave rural Ireland.  I would only like to take some members of this commission down to a townland in the West of Ireland, take them in a by-road to a small village and ask them to stay in that village for two or three days.  I think if they did that, they would have no doubt whatever as to some of the reasons why young people, and old people, are fleeing from these areas at the present time.</P>
    <P>I can assure the House that there are villages in rural Ireland to-day where all the members of families have to wear Wellingtons for ten months of the year and that the only opportunity they get to wear normal footwear, shoes or boots, is while this period of fine weather lasts.  Going to Mass on Sunday morning means Wellingtons from the father to the smallest child; going to schools on week mornings, it is a well-known fact that fathers in many families have to carry their children on their backs out through a half mile of boreen to put the children on the main road before they can go to school.  And then we ask&mdash;why do people leave rural Ireland?</P>
    <P>The effect of this Vote reaches into the very heart and depths of rural Ireland.  It could be one of the most important Votes to come before this House if sufficient money were made available so that the effects in the rural areas would be far-reaching.  At the present time in rural Ireland, the benefit of rural electrification has been conferred on most of the people there.  That is about the most progressive step taken in years. While that is being done, people are beginning to appreciate a different type of living because the contrast is so awful&mdash;I might say&mdash;between the advantages of rural electrification and the conditions of the roads serving these villages.  It only spotlights the problem far more than before rural electrification came along.</P>
    <P>I do not disagree with Deputy Childers at all where small farms are <Col N="827" /> being consolidated and where once more the system of usurpation is coming into operation and a landlord class is being established.  One of the prime causes of that is bad communications. The position, as far as I knew it, became so serious that I tabled a Private Members' Bill in this House which would enable local authorities to declare as public roads all roads which in the opinion of a particular local authority should be taken over. I want to express my appreciation of the action of the then Minister for Local Government in accepting that Private Bill because, in time to come, the benefits of that Bill will show in no uncertain fashion in the rural areas.</P>
    <P>In my constituency, where we have &mdash;at least where we had&mdash;a fairly enlightened council, that council took full advantage of the powers conferred on it under this Private Members' Bill and last year they spent&mdash;it may sound small to this House&mdash;over £8,500 on the repair of cul-de-sac roads alone.  That may not sound a large sum to this House, but that sum of £8,500 meant all the difference in the world to many villages which up to that had been completely neglected.  I think it is very unfair that, because a county like Roscommon is prepared to accept its responsibilities under that Private Bill and take over and declare as public roads these roads serving villages, it should have to bear the full cost of repairing these roads.</P>
    <P>Due to the fact that that county council is spending £8,500, it is saving the Special Employment Schemes Office the sum of £8,500 on the repair of these roads and I consider, in view of that, that the grant to County Roscommon from the Special Employment Schemes Office should be increased by at least the same amount of money as the county council is spending on the improvement of culs-de-sac. I think that is not an unfair request to make to the Parliamentary Secretary at the present time.</P>
    <P>What applies to my constituency applies as well to every other one in the West of Ireland, I am sure.  I want to say that while you have a number of authorities responsible for <Col N="828" /> the construction, improvement and maintenance of roads, you will not have satisfaction.  There must be co-ordination, so far as the road programme is concerned, and, if there is to be co-ordination, we must first get the main body to accept its responsibilities. The main body in this regard &mdash;if the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will forgive me for mentioning it&mdash;is the Department of Local Government.  All we can do on this Estimate is to ask the Parliamentary Secretary, so far as he is concerned, to consult with the Department of Local Government for the purpose of setting up a special inter-departmental committee which will examine thoroughly this matter of the maintenance and repair of by-roads throughout rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>The question of main roads at the present time is not as urgent as it has been over previous years.  In recent years tremendous steps have been taken in the steam-rolling of our county and trunk roads.  Both Governments deserve congratulations for making the money available for this desirable purpose but the very fact that these main roads and county roads are being repaired again shows up the terrible conditions of the roads which lead off these county roads and which, in many cases, serve villages where, perhaps, anything from five to 18 or 20 families live.  Deputy Childers wants to see these roads in such a condition that they will be able to bear tractors.  That is only a sensible and a reasonable suggestion.  The awful position at the moment is that it is impossible to walk on some of these roads not to mind driving a tractor or a motor car on them.</P>
    <P>If in the immediate stages, before there is any Government survey carried out, the Special Employment Schemes Office are prepared to co-operate with local authorities like Roscommon by making grants available for the construction of these roads, then I can assure the Parliamentary Secretary&mdash; and I am sure Deputy Beirne who is here will agree with me&mdash;that the county council in Roscommon will be prepared, if these roads are constructed by the Special Employment Schemes Office, to take over these roads, declare them as public roads and <Col N="829" /> maintain them, that the responsibility of the Special Employment Schemes Office will cease there, and that we will go to the Department of Local Government, as the responsible authority, to give us the extra money if the maintenance problem proves burdensome to the local authority itself.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Special Employment Schemes Office not to shelve their responsibility in this respect because we in the county council have relieved them of expending, at the minimum, £8,500 last year and the same or more this year by doing the work that normally the Special Employment Schemes Office should do. Of course, if the Special Employment Schemes Office had carried out these schemes there would have been no need for my Private Member's Bill in this House.  Conditions were so bad in the county that the Roscommon County Council, a body that is anxious, like every other local authority, to keep rates down, had to get the necessary funds to do the job which up to this the Special Employment Schemes Office was charged with carrying out.</P>
    <P>I wish to make another point as far as the special case for Roscommon is concerned.  Last year, as I said, was one of the worst years we ever experienced from the weather point of view.  Every Deputy knows what bad weather can do to main roads, to say nothing of what it will do to by-roads. For some reason beyond my comprehension, Roscommon suffered more than any other county in Ireland as a result of the bad weather of the last 12 months.  Perhaps I can explain in this way.  It is a county that is surrounded by rivers.  On the eastern side of the county we have the Shannon flowing down the full length and on the western side between Roscommon and Galway the River Suck parallels the Shannon as a boundary line almost completely over the length of the county.  In the north-western portion you have the Lung River and in the north-eastern area you have the Feorish River.  These four rivers between them flooded 45 per cent. to 50 per cent. of the county in the last 12 months.  No other county in Ireland got as bad a crack as Roscommon.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="830" /> There are Deputies here who are well aware, as is the Minister, of the considerable hardships imposed on people who live within three or four miles of the River Shannon because of the flooding in this area which made the roads practically impassable.  The same applies to the Suck and the other two rivers.  I am making the case, without apology to anybody from any other constituency, that special consideration should be given to Roscommon in view of the flooding that was caused last year.</P>
    <P>There is no departmental body in a better position to meet our requirements than the Special Employment Schemes Office because it is in connection with roads and drains that this body functions.  Deputy Beegan and others have mentioned at length the condition of bog roads, and I will refer to them briefly.  In connection with bog roads and drains the position is very serious.  There are many people in rural areas who could not cut turf this year for two reasons, firstly because the roads to the bogs were impassable and, secondly, and more important, because the drains were all choked.</P>
    <P>What will these people do for fuel during the coming winter?  Is it not only reasonable to suggest that, having put up with this kind of hardship and inconvenience for a couple of years, the people will lose hope and say: &ldquo;To Jericho with the whole business&rdquo; and get out of the country? I have seen applications made for bog development schemes.  Maybe an application was made two years ago and there is a blue card delivered to the applicant.  If I make representations in order to see what the cause of the delay is or to see if this scheme can be speeded up, I get a blue card.  I have a bagful of blue cards, but I have seen very few schemes carried out.  I am not blaming the officials.  If there were money available the people who get these blue cards would be satisfied because the sight of a blue card would mean hope.  Instead of that all it conveys is despair, because they know that blue card will be coming annually to them, perhaps for four or five years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="831" /> These are some of the reasons why I think the motion in the names of Deputy Beegan and others is one of the most important motions to come before this House for a long time.  However, I am rather disappointed that Deputy Beegan is not prepared to press this motion to the limit because, as far as rural areas are concerned, no other Department reaches so closely into conditions there.  More can be done in the way of relief by giving extra money under this Vote than can be done under arterial drainage or any other grandiose scheme.  We are all in favour of these schemes of arterial drainage but it will be a long time before arterial drainage will show its effects along the Shannon and the Suck. Surely in the immediate stages it is the duty of the Government and the Parliamentary Secretary to alleviate the distress that exists amongst people in those areas.</P>
    <P>I urge now that the motion in its present form be accepted by the Government and that the necessary funds be made available to the Special Employment Schemes Office so that they can, in some small measure, alleviate the distress that was caused last year by the very bad weather.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In the beginning let me say that Fianna Fáil has given all the good <Col N="832" /> ideas to the inter-Party Government; and one of the good ideas so given was the rural improvements scheme. Deputy McQuillan paid a tribute to the Parliamentary Secretary because he increased the grants and lowered the contributions in his last term of office.  Now we will give him another idea, free, gratis and for nothing and we will appeal to him to put the idea into operation.</P>
    <P>I remember being at a Fianna Fáil Cumann meeting&mdash;it is at these meetings that one gets the best brains in the country&mdash;and they said to me at that meeting: &ldquo;We have put up the money for rural improvements schemes. We have put it up in one case twice. But what about the maintenance?  If we had a sufficient cadre of unemployed in our area we would get a grant under the minor employment schemes.  We would have to put up no contribution. Here we have to put up a contribution, and what about maintenance?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In our local election appeal to the electorate, to which they responded not badly at all, we said that in future Fianna Fáil, on returning to office after the next election, would when the people put up a contribution under the rural improvements scheme maintain these roads.  We said it would be the policy of the Fianna Fáil Government to maintain these roads.  Now we make a present of that idea to the present Government.  Let them anticipate our return and do this now and we will get some other schemes when we come back for improving conditions in rural Ireland and dealing with this very vexed question to which Deputy McQuillan has referred and which is of national concern, namely, the maintenance of the rural population in the rural areas.  I wholeheartedly agree with Deputy McQuillan in that.  This is not the first time on which I have agreed with him on this specific problem in which we are both interested and in which my Party is interested, namely, the alleviation of the terrible conditions under which the people live in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>A Dubliner will say to one: &ldquo;It is well for you in the country.  You have everything in it.&rdquo;  But there is no <Col N="833" /> sign of that Dubliner going back to the country to live in it.  Not a bit of it. When a child steps out to school in Dublin it steps on to the equivalent of a billiards table.  When a child steps out to school in County Galway, Roscommon or Westmeath, it steps into a pool of water in a pothole.  Those are the equivalent conditions.</P>
    <P>There was a time when one could maintain these roads co-operatively. This is the age of motoring and we have not yet reached saturation point where motoring is concerned.  County Westmeath is not by any means the biggest county.  It is not as big a county as the county the Deputy who has just spoken represents.  I remember a friend of mine getting a registration number for a car in the beginning of the year&mdash;LI7000.  &ldquo;Good gracious,&rdquo; I asked, &ldquo;are we gone to that?&rdquo;  The other day I was looking at a vehicle going into a certain place and the number on it was LI7600.  In six months there were 600 mechanically propelled vehicles purchased and registered in County Westmeath.</P>
    <P>Everything&mdash;the egg produced on the farm, the chicken, the sod of turf, the calf&mdash;is brought by motor now.  It does not matter whether or not one has a car of one's own; the man who conveys what one produces charges for its conveyance and indirectly one is therefore a contributor to motor taxation.</P>
    <P>We support this motion because we say that this matter is rapidly becoming a national problem, namely, the maintenance of the by-roads, the boreens and the culs-de-sac.  Would anyone in Scotland or Wales tolerate the way into a coalpit if it were full of ruts and holes and impassable for motor vehicles and, indeed, for the miners using these roads irrespective of whether they go on foot, on bicycles or on lorries?  He would not, even if high time, that action were taken.  I know what I am talking about because I have been in Scotland and I have been in Wales and I have studied this matter.  Here the roads leading to the source of our national fuel are in a shocking condition.  It is time, and high time, that action was taken.  I live beside one of these places.  The road into Coolnagun is a cul-de-sac and <Col N="834" /> 600 tons of turf are carried over that road every day even though it is not fit to take these lorries.</P>
    <P>Deputy McQuillan spoke about the Shannon floods.  I agree with him that County Roscommon got the worst belt.  We in County Westmeath got the next.  The blow in County Westmeath was not as severe, but it was severe enough and the roads around Clonboney near Athlone are practically impassable.  They were months under water.  Some of these were well surfaced roads prior to the flooding.  Since the floods one would think they had never been rolled.  A deputation went to the Minister for Local Government on this matter.  It is still under consideration.  In the interim we were told we might take money from the grant under the Local Authorities (Works) Act for the whole county and devote it to these roads. We did that because the work was urgently necessary.  But I was present in this House sitting close to the Deputy who spoke last when the debate on the Shannon floods took place.  He asked the Minister for Agriculture would special grants be provided for these roads which had deteriorated and which had become practically impassable owing to the Shannon floods and the Minister categorically stated in everybody's hearing here in this House that funds would be provided.  Months have passed and I have seen no funds either from the Office of Public Works or anywhere else earmarked for these roads.</P>
    <P>Surely, this resolution, in connection with this Vote, is pertinent to this very important national problem&mdash;the roads that adjoin the Shannon?  We have got experts from America to examine the Shannon and all that kind of thing but, pending the issue of their report and pending whatever is done to ease the flooding, the people living on the Clonbunny Road and on every other road in County Roscommon, will have to use these roads; these people will still have to go to church, Mass and meeting and the children will have to go to school. The summer is passing and when the Parliamentary Secretary is replying to this debate he should indicate what <Col N="835" /> will be done in connection with the roads in the Shannon basin.</P>
    <P>This is the right time, while the weather is good, to have work done on these roads.  We should not forget them, and the Parliamentary Secretary, when he is replying on this resolution standing in the names of Deputies Beegan, Carter and Childers, should give us some indication of what is proposed.  In my own county&mdash;and I am sure the figures are proportionately bigger in certain other counties&mdash;some years ago when the county council tackled the problem of the county roads, we found there were 900 miles of county roads to be done.  We were doing them at the rate of ten miles per year&mdash;it may have gone up to 12 or 14 miles now&mdash;and at that progress it would take 90 years to complete the programme.  We have information from the Statistics Branch that there is approximately half that mileage of cul-de-sac and accommodation roads, and so I find it safe to assume that in County Westmeath we have to tackle a problem of 450 miles of cul-de-sac, accommodation and link roads, and even if we put the Act sponsored by Deputy McQuillan into operation in full in the county, how could the rates bear it all?</P>
    <P>Surely, this is a national problem. We are now in the motoring age, and we have not yet reached saturation point as regards the number of cars or as regards motor taxation.  This is a national problem which requires immediate attention, and we ask the Parliamentary Secretary to give us an answer, when replying to the debate, particularly dealing with bog roads and with minor employment scheme roads and rural improvements scheme roads.  I would urge that, where people contribute under the rural improvements scheme, the Government and the county councils&mdash;principally the Government&mdash;should take the roads over and maintain them.  I would emphasise the necessity that the beneficiaries of such action keep their hedges breasted and pruned as they do along the main and county roads.</P>
    <P>I have stressed again and again, and I think it is important to do so, that we would not have so much expenditure <Col N="836" /> on the construction of these roads if we did not have these canopies over the roads which destroy the surface and which catch the hay going in and pull the sheafs of corn off the farmer's cart and which create the drip that makes pot-holes appear sooner than on roads where hedges are kept down. That is my contribution to this debate, beyond saying what I have often said here before&mdash;that 74 per cent. of our farming community live on holdings of £30 valuation and under.  These people make the biggest percentage of our rural population.  They are selling their farms because the way into them is impassable.  The conditions under which they live are becoming unbearable because when you improve the conditions around them along the county and main roads, no matter how much poets in Dublin write about the grandeur of the country and of the sunsets, the people would still leave the farms to which they cannot gain proper entry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>As one of the signatories to this motion, I wish to endorse what my colleagues, Deputies Beegan and Childers, have stated.  The problem facing us at the moment, not to mention the long-term problem of a survey or going into details regarding the upkeep and maintenance of those accommodation roads, is an urgent one in the Shannon valley.  Other Deputies have emphasised that and I think there is no need for me to dwell on that particular aspect of the problem at any length.  But I should say this, that following the heavy rains of 1954 the problem in the Shannon valley regarding accommodation roads has become acute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I noticed that the Parliamentary Secretary, when dealing with the subhead regarding bog development schemes, referred to the fact that if a road accommodated others over and above those who lived on it special consideration would be given to it by his office.  At the moment, we have roads of that description in Westmeath and Longford bordering the Shannon which, as I say, as a result of the heavy floods and the lack of drainage resemble nothing better than dried up river beds.  That was the reason for <Col N="837" /> our tabling this motion&mdash;to bring to the Government's notice the immediate problem we are confronted with in connection with the gathering of this year's harvest and the drawing home of turf, provided we are able to win the turf at all.</P>
    <P>In dealing with sub-heads H.I. and J., I do not think that out of the total budgetary expenditure such as the size of ours this year we are asking too much when we seek the repair of those roads.  I do not think we are asking anything out of the ordinary.  We are not asking for too much when we ask that the grants should at least be doubled in view of the deterioration. One can visualise an accommodation road leading into a farm residence in an isolated townland following the floods of last year; one could visualise a man trying to draw hay or turf over that type of road.  No amount of talking here on our part will improve that man's predicament and so this motion was put down to get immediate results, if possible, while considering the long-term implications of the matter as well.</P>
    <P>Deputy Childers outlined some of these points very clearly.  One of the points he made was that we should be made aware of the mileage of roads of this description that we have in the country.  It is generally assumed that we have about 20,000 miles of this type of road.  We should be able to get information either from the Department of Local Government or the Special Employment Schemes Office as to the exact mileage involved.  If we are ever to get an over-all plan, seeing that housing and the extension of electricity to the rural areas are now so well advanced, I think this is the moment to begin to grapple with that question.</P>
    <P>I am not blaming the Parliamentary Secretary or finding fault with the Special Employment Schemes Office. I can well understand that they are perhaps crowded out at the moment with applications under all the sub-heads to this Vote, but I think it would be desirable if they had some system of priorities for areas affected by severe flooding.  I make that merely as a suggestion to relieve immediately <Col N="838" /> cases of very bad road accommodation.</P>
    <P>It is not news to members of this House to be told that we were left with a bad legacy in regard to roads and drainage and other things following the occupation of our country by an alien Government.  During the last 25 or 30 years a native Government has functioned here.  I think it will be agreed on all sides that it was not for the purpose of political play-acting that we put down this motion.  In connection with the working of rural improvements schemes, we are always up against the problem that where a number of people are asked to contribute a sum of money, whether it be large or small, and where one individual holds out and refuses to pay his contribution, he, by his action can hold up and wreck a contributory scheme. It is assumed by farmers in general, and by the people who benefit by these grants, that a rural improvement scheme can be very beneficial.</P>
    <P>These schemes are being availed of to an increasing extent as the years go by.  It is also agreed that we are getting better value for the money spent on them than we get from money expended in other directions.  Somehow or other the money seems to go farther when employed on the making of a road.  It would be a good idea, I think, if the Parliamentary Secretary would consider what action can be taken either by the general body of contributors concerned or the Special Employment Schemes Office to bring to book those people who live on a road and refuse to pay their share of the contribution necessary to improve it.  I know that is not an easy matter. I am not asking the Parliamentary Secretary to coerce those people.  It is a legal question.  The method at present is that you begin immediately above and immediately below the land belonging to the man who refuses to contribute to the improvement to a road. The result is that his action, very often, results in nullifying the beneficial results that would otherwise accrue from a rural improvement scheme.</P>
    <P>On the wider issue that arises under the three sub-heads&mdash;minor relief and minor employment, bog development and rural improvement&mdash;the report of the Commission on Emigration has <Col N="839" /> been mentioned.  That report is a very good one.  I have read some of it.  One paragraph, in particular, deals with unemployment, especially in rural areas.  It suggests that, instead of providing unemployment assistance, there should be a scheme involving the expenditure of £5,000,000 or £6,000,000, the return to be that for roughly £100 one worker in each household would be put into employment.  I think the suggestion a good one.  It would enable us to grapple with schemes such as we were discussing.  Once the harvest is gathered in, there is usually a slack period during the winter months until the following spring.  During that period, provided the weather is favourable, a good deal of work could be put in on schemes such as the commission has suggested.</P>
    <P>All the experts seem to have arrived at the conclusion that the small farmer, or the farmer under £10 valuation, is on the way out.  I am not inclined to agree with that and I hope it will never come about.  I hope that, no matter what Government is in office, they will always resist a suggestion of that type.  The might of the British Government over a long period was not able to drive the small farmer out of production and I hope that the mass production methods of the future will not be able to do it either.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>I do want to say, however, that the small farmer himself must grapple with the problem.  He must not rely on the Government of the day to create conditions for him. He can do much, I believe, under proper leadership, and he will do it. It will, however, be up to whatever Government is in power to give him all the help at their disposal.  One help above all others which a Government can give to the small farmer is good road accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As my colleagues have spoken on this Vote, I do not propose to detain the House any longer.  I would urge on the Parliamentary Secretary to make representations to the man who holds the purse to loosen the strings of <Col N="840" /> it this year and step up the moneys to be made available under the three sub-heads H, I, J in order that something may be done to check the deterioration that has taken place on all these types of roads following the floods of 1954.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will start off by saying that, like Deputy Beegan, my predecessor, who spoke on the Estimate, I am not very satisfied, and never was, as regards the roads that we do, whether under bog development schemes, minor employment schemes or rural improvements schemes, with the idea of giving a little here and a little there and a little somewhere else, probably giving £100 where we should give £500, in an effort to please people for the time being.</P>
      <P>It is my intention to consider the suggestion of Deputy Childers.  I intend to do it in the coming year.  I also want to say&mdash;I do not know what Deputy referred to it&mdash;that a certain amount of rolling should be carried out on the road that we do. Under many rural improvements schemes, the office did a very good job, a perfect job, so to speak, but if a little extra were spent, so that pieces of road would be rolled, the road would last at least three times as long as it would under present circumstances.</P>
      <P>When that Bill was brought in here some time ago, I wonder would I be right in saying that Deputy McQuillan said that the Bill was all they wanted &mdash;power to do it&mdash;and the county councils would be satisfied?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Deputy was saying that, I was on the other side of the House and Deputy Beegan, then Parliamentary Secretary, was here.  I laughed and I know Deputy Beegan did also, for the simple reason that, old experienced campaigners as we are, we knew very well that, when <Col N="841" /> members of the Galway County Council or members of the Roscommon County Council or of other councils would go to their county engineers, the statement would be&mdash;&ldquo;adding to the mileage of roads&mdash;we cannot afford it&rdquo;.</P>

Now he says the Special Employment Schemes Office should allocate that amount.  We have not that amount to allocate to County Roscommon and we cannot do it.</P>
      <P>I was listening to Deputy Carter.  I want to congratulate Deputy Beegan, strange at it may appear, for one thing &mdash;the way he stood fast for three years against his Minister to prevent him from changing the rural improvements scheme.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Lord save us! Many a strange hare they started and never caught, but I caught the strange hare of the rural improvements scheme. The rural improvements scheme, as started by Fianna Fáil, what did it mean?  I was present on a platform when Deputy Paddy Beegan condemned it, and rightly so.  What sort of scheme was it at the start?  I will tell you what it was.  It was a scheme where any two farmers who made application and qualified under the scheme, although they might live a mile from the public road, although they might be two gentry, although they might be two of the landlord element with a big mansion each, according to the Act were entitled to 75 per cent. of the cost.  If they contributed 25 per cent. they were entitled to 75 per cent. of the cost of making an avenue to their doors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I came in, in 1948, I found that to be the position, as Deputy Beegan knows very well.  Many of the people in the poorer areas, such as the areas represented by Deputy Beegan, Deputy McQuillan, Deputy Palmer, Deputy John Flynn and myself, for whom the scheme was really intended, were asked to contribute 25 per cent. of the cost. There might be nine or ten families huddled together and they might be unable to contribute.  After the scheme was examined by the engineers and an estimate made out for it, it was found that they were unable to contribute.  The result was that 90 per cent. of the money went to the richer areas, went to the people <Col N="843" /> who were able to contribute.  That was Fianna Fáil's rural improvements scheme.</P>

The money went into the poorer areas. There was a doing away with a certain bias that was there.  I will tell the House what it was.  On one side of the fence, you found in our poorer areas&mdash; no poorer than are to be found in South Kerry&mdash;that the number of registered unemployed was sufficient to qualify the people there for a full cost grant and on the other side of the fence, where there were not enough registered unemployed, the people did not qualify for the full cost grant.

    <P>The inter-Party Government and, indeed, myself&mdash;not that I want to boast about it&mdash;were responsible for a situation in which, by contributing, for instance, £5, in many cases they got £95.  I think it was a great change from the hare Fianna Fáil started and that Deputy Kennedy talks about. I congratulate my predecessor in office for standing solidly against the then Minister, Deputy MacEntee, who <Col N="844" /> wanted to change it and bring it back to its former position.  It is time for rural Ireland, through its representatives, to assert itself.  There are more places than Dublin City.  Dublin City would not last long were it not for rural Ireland, were it not for many of those people who have to go into the bog roads, were it not for many of those people who can barely afford to pay the contribution of £5 towards the £95. I think Deputy Carter was more or less on the same lines that I am on now.</P>
    <P>The Special Employment Schemes Office is a very despised place: at one time it was said that it was used for politics, or something like that.  God knows that is not true.  I want to pay a tribute to the hard-working officials of that office.  Even though it is only a small office, remember that at one time it was called a &ldquo;slush&rdquo; office. At one time people felt that it should not be there at all.  Coming, as he does, from rural Ireland, I am sure Deputy Beegan will agree that it is a very important office for the people of rural Ireland.  It does a lot of good work.  We hear talk of other Departments spending so many millions on, for instance, roads.  What about the people who live two miles away from a public road but who contribute their share for the maintenance of the steamrolled tarred road?  Only one office can help them and that is the office on whose behalf, I am proud to say, I speak here to-day and that Deputy Beegan was proud to speak on behalf of.  It does valuable work.</P>

I ask for the close co-operation of rural Deputies so far as this office is concerned.  Do not have it belittled&mdash;I am glad Deputy <Col N="846" /> Bartley is listening to me&mdash;and let us have no such questions as: who appointed the ganger here, who appointed the ganger there and who appointed the ganger elsewhere?

      <P>When I first came into office I saw letters from Deputies to the effect that a ganger in one place, for instance, was a Clann na Talmhan man, a ganger in another place was a Fine Gael man, and so forth, and should, therefore, be immediately dismissed. When I came into office for the second time I found that the same type of thing kept coming in.  Again, as far as the office was concerned&mdash; from the director down&mdash;as Deputy Beegan will agree with me, the best men are employed and every man employed does his work: if he does not, he is dismissed and that is all about it.</P>
      <P>As I have already said, any points which were raised in the course of this debate will be answered from the office and once more I ask for the close co-operation of all rural Deputies for this office in particular.  It is an office that works well and conscientiously whether it be a bog road, a bog drain, a road into a village or any one of the thousand things that affect the people of rural Ireland and the majority of the Deputies of this House no matter what Party they may belong to.  I appeal for that close co-operation and Deputies will always find that that office will serve well and loyally.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>That a sum not exceeding £77,760 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Chage which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st <Col N="847" /> day of March, 1956, for Salaries and Expenses in connection with Sea and Inland Fisheries including sundry Grants-in-Aid.</P>

      <P>The Estimate for Fisheries for 1955-56 is for a net sum of £116,640, of which £38,880 has been granted by way of Vote on Account, leaving £77,760 to be moved for as the Vote.</P>
      <P>As shown in the printed Estimates, the amount required for 1955-56 represents a net increase of £9,040 as compared with 1954-55.  This increase comes about by a gross increase of £19,090 on some sub-heads, plus a decrease in Appropriations-in-Aid, £7,330, which are set against decreases on other sub-heads amounting to a total of £17,380.  To help the House in considering the Estimate, I will refer especially to the significant increases and decreases under the various sub-heads compared with last year.</P>
      <P>Sub-head F (1)&mdash;Grants to Boards of Conservators, etc.&mdash;is more by £14,490 than the sum provided last year.  The increase is made up of an additional £2,500 provided to meet the State's liability under statute to local authorities in respect of reduced income arising from the exemption of fisheries from local rates pursuant to the Fisheries Act, 1925.  The upward trend in rates levied by local authorities automatically means an increase in the payments to be made to them and it is considered that £20,000 will be required this year.  Grants to boards of conservators to supplement their incomes from local sources, i.e. rates and licence duties, so that they may be in a position to afford the best protection possible to salmon and trout fisheries, are also provided under this sub-head.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year, only a token sum of £10 was included for this service in the Estimates as the assistance needed to help the boards was then available from the Salmon Conservancy Fund. As the House is already aware, the Order imposing the levy was revoked in December last because it was considered <Col N="848" /> that it imposed too heavy a burden on the fishermen, particularly netsmen, who relied upon their earnings from salmon fishing to provide an important part of their livelihood.  The total available for distribution to boards from the levy was £9,050 and of this sum £6,400 has already been distributed to boards of conservators leaving a balance of £2,650.</P>
    <P>With the winding-up of the Conservancy Fund the moneys required to help boards of conservators will be provided from the national Exchequer and we have included under sub-head F (1) the sum of £12,000 for that purpose.  This sum, with the balance remaining in the Conservancy Fund, should be adequate to meet all cases in which grants to boards of conservators will be necessary, and I might add that it is by far the largest sum ever provided in the Vote to help boards of conservators in the maintenance of proper protection services.  For the five years prior to 1953 when the levy came into force the sums provided ranged between £1,395 and £4,000.</P>
    <P>Sub-head F (8)&mdash;Contribution to Salmon Research Trust&mdash;is a new sub-head. It provides a sum of £1,000 as State assistance towards the functioning of this new body which has been set up as an incorporated company and registered under the Companies Acts. This development is under the joint auspices of the Minister and Messrs. Arthur Guinness, Son &amp; Co., Ltd., with the object of furthering scientific research into the life history of the salmon.  It is hoped that the trust will be able to acquire a salmon fishery where its purposes may be pursued.</P>
    <P>So that there may not be any misunderstanding as to the scope of the scheme, I would like to say that there is no intention that the trust should acquire and administer salmon fisheries as such.  Its sole purpose is to further scientific research in this country in the hope that its activities will result eventually in the collection of scientific data which can be applied with advantage to our salmon fisheries at large. I take this opportunity, as the fishery authority, to express my sincere appreciation, and I am sure I express in <Col N="849" /> this matter the feelings of everyone interested in the development of our salmon fisheries, of the generous and public-spirited action on the part of Messrs.  Guinness &amp; Co. in applying quite a considerable sum of money from their resources for this purpose.</P>
    <P>The other increases compared with last year which with the increases already referred to make up a gross increase of £19,090, arise under sub-head F (2), Artificial Propagation of Fish, £50, and Grants-in-Aid of Administration and Development to An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, £710.  The increase under sub-head F (2) is of a casual nature and calls for no explanation. The increase under sub-head (G), £710, is a net figure.  The provision for administrative expenses of the board is £2,145 greater than the corresponding provision last year, while the figure in respect of development works is £1,435 less than that provided in 1954-55.</P>
    <P>The sum £42,385 appearing under sub-head G in the Estimates is made up of Grants-in-Aid towards the administrative expenses of the board, £28,025, and towards development works proposed to be undertaken by them, £14,360.  The administrative expenses of the board, as of all similar bodies, continue to increase with the improvement of staff salaries and the employment of additional personnel.  This cannot be avoided if the work of the board is to proceed satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>The sum provided as Grants-in-Aid for development work covers five main projects.  In connection with these grants, I wish to point out that each is being supplemented by repayable advances from the Central Fund.  The projects are financed in this way because of the element of pioneering work which is involved and in respect of which it is considered reasonable that grants should be made.  Each of the projects, of course, will or can be expected to return an income to the board and for this reason the board can be expected to meet a commitment to the State in respect of a repayable advance for part of the cost in each case.</P>
    <P>As already stated, the total Grants-in-Aid <Col N="850" /> for development purposes entered in the Estimates come to £14,360 and these are supplemented by repayable advances amounting to £14,315, making in all £28,675.  The main projects in mind for execution are: The completion of the fish meal plant and the provision of a laboratory at Killybegs at a total cost of £4,610; the completion of an up-to-date fish handling premises at Caherciveen at a total cost of £1,800; the establishment of an up-to-date fish handling premises and the installation of an ice plant at Schull at a total cost of £8,000; the provision of an ice plant at Ballycotton at a total cost of £4,000; the establishment of a fish sales depot at Limerick at a total cost of £5,000 and the provision of a general store at Dublin costing £3,665.</P>
    <P>These projects will add considerably to the facilities at the places mentioned for the proper handling of fish and to the services provided for the fishermen.  I might say that An Bord Iascaigh Mhara have, at my request, submitted an outline of their proposals for the next few years for the provision of better facilities for the handling and marketing of fish around our coasts.  The proposals envisage setting up at suitable centres a number of manufacturing and processing plants which will be capable of absorbing for one purpose or another all fish landed by the fishermen.  The programme submitted is well designed to achieve conditions of reasonable security and opportunities for the fishermen which are fundamental to the present welfare of the industry and to the policy of its continuing expansion in the future to the dimensions of which it should be capable.</P>
    <P>In addition to the projects mentioned, the board also intends during the current financial year to commence the establishment at Galway of a comprehensive fish handling premises to include an ice plant, cold store and quick-freezing installation.  The necessary funds for the purpose will be provided by grant from the National Development Fund to the extent of 50 per cent. of the cost, the balance to be by way of repayable advance from the Central Fund.  The site has <Col N="851" /> already been acquired and tenders invited from building contractors.</P>
    <P>The work comprises the erection of buildings and the installation of machinery and it is not expected that more than half the estimated cost will have to be met in the current financial year.  The total cost is expected to be about £56,000.  As I have referred to the National Development Fund, I might add that the scheme for the supply of modern general purpose fishing boats to Irish speakers resident in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht will also be financed from the fund.  An Bord Iascaigh Mhara have made arrangements for the construction of the first boats to be issued under the scheme and during the present financial year it is expected that £32,000 will be issued from the fund in that connection.</P>
    <P>The principal function of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara as regards development work is the provision of boats and gear for fishermen on hire purchase basis.  This is most important work, and the results are self-evident all around our coasts in the numbers of well-equipped fishing boats of modern design and appointments which can be seen.  These boats have brought about a very welcome upward trend in our landings of white fish, and where the necessary skill and industry exists they provide a satisfactory living for the fishermen.  In the current financial year it is estimated that boats and gear to the total value of £123,000 will be issued by the board, but as these issues can, it is expected, be financed to the extent of £37,000 from moneys received by the board for cash sales and from hire purchase appropriations surplus to the board's commitments to the Exchequer in respect of repayable advances, the amount required by way of repayable advances from the Central Fund will be £86,000. In addition, it is also intended to make available to the board a repayable advance of £44,000 in respect of outlay on the provision of boats and gear in previous years from moneys available to the board other than repayable advances.</P>
    <P>The total provision being made for <Col N="852" /> the board's work in the current financial year is therefore £42,385 in the Estimates before the House, repayable advances from the Central Fund for the supply of boats, gear £130,000, advances for general development purposes £28,315 and grants from National Development Fund £46,000, making a total of £246,700.</P>
    <P>While I am on the topic of the issue of boats and gear by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, I am sure that the House will be interested in what has been achieved by the board in that regard during the year ended 31st March, 1955.  In the year, ten new 50 ft. boats were built in the board's own yards, and one 60 ft. boat was built in another yard in the country.  In addition, the board reconditioned six boats, one boat was engined and two secondhand boats were purchased and issued to fishermen.  At the 31st March, 1955, the board had under construction in their yards seven 50 ft. boats while other yards in the country had in hands to the order of the board one 45 ft., one 50 ft., two 55 ft. and one 60 ft. boats.  In addition to boats, the board issued in the year fishing gear and equipment to the value of £40,000.</P>
    <P>While dealing with the functions of the board, I might add that on the fish sales side of their business a considerable increase was achieved compared with the previous year.  The auctioning and wholesale sales in the past year came to just over £500,000.  The board is paying particular attention to the processing and distribution of fish and I am glad to say that private concerns are also actively engaged in the same field.  As I have already indicated, the board, as our landings increase, are making arrangements for the opening of more distribution depots, and I have every hope that in course of time the difficulties which are experienced in obtaining fish in many places throughout the country will be resolved.</P>
    <P>There is another activity on the part of the board to which I would like to refer, and that is the operations of the three high sea fishing vessels which they have in use.  These vessels were acquired with the two-fold purpose <Col N="853" /> of filling the gap between landings of inshore fishermen and domestic consumption, and providing experience both in the management and operation of such vessels.  Since they commenced operations about two years ago they have made landings up to the 31st March last to the value of £72,856.  At this figure these activities have resulted in a loss to the board, but as against that it must be said that during the period they have each been withdrawn from service for a considerable period for classification survey and complete overhaul.  Apart from the fishing time lost, this work in itself was very costly and prolonged in view of the inadequate facilities existing here for the overhaul of diesel engines. With the experience gained by operatives and maintenance personnel and arrangements made by the board, the general standard of machinery maintenance on the vessels has been raised to a satisfactory level and much less expense in that connection may be hoped for in the future.</P>
    <P>Another difficulty that has been experienced in the management of these vessels is the question of certificated skippers and second hands. Such personnel was not available as far as could be ascertained in this country for more than one vessel.  It is hoped that, with the experience provided, members of the crews of these vessels will eventually be able to qualify on the practical side for certificated posts. Furthermore, to try and improve the position the board instituted a trainee course on the vessels.  So far the number of young men prepared to persevere with the course has been disappointing, but the course will be continued. At the end of a further 12 months the boats' activities will be again reviewed.</P>
    <P>So far I have dealt in some detail with the sub-heads which provide for considerable increase in expenditure over the provision in the Estimates for last year.  There are decreases totalling in all £17,380 on other sub-heads. The principal reduction is in the case of F (5), compensation, etc., which covers an item of £20,000 compared with £36,000 last year.  This provision covers compensation to fishery owners <Col N="854" /> and others who suffered loss as a result of the abolition of fresh water netting under Section 35 of the Fisheries Act, 1939.  Compensation paid to 31st March, 1955, amounted to slightly under £100,000, and it is estimated that at least another £50,000 remains to be paid.  It has been found rather difficult in some cases to complete the legal procedure necessary before sufficient proof of title is produced to enable payments to be made, and it is not expected that more than £20,000 will be needed to meet claims which will be finally cleared by the law officers during the year ending 31st March, 1956.</P>
    <P>As to the general position of the sea-fishing industry, I am glad to be able to report to the House that landings for 1954 showed a considerable increase over those for 1953.  The landings of demersal fish&mdash;that is, generally speaking, deep swimming fish&mdash;at just 170,000 cwt. showed an increase of 22,000 cwt.; and the landings for pelagic fish&mdash;those that are generally found near the surface&mdash;increased by 10,000 cwt.  The returns to the fishermen from both classes of fish were in 1954 £636,000 compared with £545,000 in 1953.  The landings of demersal fish in 1954 were, I may add, the highest landed here by our own boats in living memory.</P>
    <P>The varieties which showed the most significant increases in landings in 1954 compared with 1953 were haddock, ray, whiting and herring.  The most notable decrease took place in the case of plaice.</P>
    <P>As to shellfish, it is not possible to give global comparative figures as some species are marketed by count and others by weight, but the overall returns to the fishermen at £155,000 compared with £143,000 in 1953 indicate the improvement which took place.  Crabs and periwinkles showed increased takings while escallops, lobsters and oysters were taken in reduced quantities.  The weather conditions generally during the shellfish season in 1954 were not favourable, and it is satisfactory to note that despite this handicap the monetary returns to the fishermen showed a fair increase. This can be attributed, I think, to the steady and increasing demand that exists on the Continent, particularly in <Col N="855" /> France, for some kinds of our shellfish, particularly crawfish, lobsters, periwinkles and escallops.  There is keen competition to supply that market, and the prices paid to our fishermen were steady throughout the year at a good level.</P>
    <P>In this connection I am glad to be able to say that during recent trade discussions in Paris we secured increased outlets in France for those varieties, lobsters and crawfish, which are still subject to quota restrictions. The other varieties of shellfish which we send to France are free from quantitative restrictions.  The position now is that provided we get reasonably good fishing weather there is every encouragement for a much increased output of shellfish and I have every confidence that in 1955 our fishermen will rise to the opportunity.</P>
    <P>Within the past year or two considerable development has taken place in the processing of fish in this country and a regular feature of the retail trade now is the availability of quick-frozen fish of various kinds deep frozen in consumer packs.  This is a welcome development as it helps to use up excess supplies on the fresh market thereby giving our fishermen further security in the marketing of their landings. Progress has also been made in the use of the most modern technique in the smoking of fish and it is hoped that, as has already been achieved as regards fresh fish, the curing side of the industry will, in course of time, be able to supply the needs of our home market and thereby render imports of smoked fish, which are at present considerable, unnecessary.</P>
    <P>Up to about 25 years ago the herring and mackerel fisheries were the principal interest of our fishermen and the mainstay of these fisheries was the salt curing trade.  The product was exported but the overseas demand disappeared due to changing conditions in the importing countries.  There has been a revival of interest recently in cured herring from this country and there is some hope that curing on an increased scale may develop in the next few years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="856" /> This fortunately coincides with evidence of the return of the herring in heavy shoals to our coasts.  New methods of fishing herring, such as the use of the ring net, are being introduced among our fishermen, and it may be expected that if a steady demand for landings can be created and maintained our fishermen will take advantage of the situation and devote themselves to herring fishing as the seasons come around.  Everyone recognises the value which a successful herring fishing, as part of their annual fishing programme, can be to our fishermen and everything possible will be done to encourage the curing trade. As recently announced, there would be no objection from the fishery viewpoint to the return of British curers to our ports.  As to mackerel, the same hopeful prospects, as in the case of herring, for the revival of the curing trade, do not exist as the old-time export market in the United States does not show any sign of returning.</P>
    <P>Whenever the disposal of heavy landings of fish of any kind comes under discussion, the establishment of fish meal plants is always mentioned as the obvious solution of the problem. The conversion of surplus fish supplies into fish meal is, of course, a very valuable industry as it helps the fisherman to dispose of his landings in full and also provides a very valuable protein feeding stuff for the agricultural industry.  The economics of fish meal manufacture must, however, be borne in mind.  Much valuable experience and information has been obtained by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara in the working of the pilot plant operated at Killybegs and officers of my Department have collected much information as to the manufacture of fish meal in other countries.</P>
    <P>It may be taken that the smallest fish meal plant capable of being worked on a commercial basis would cost about £60,000 to erect.  In order to work such a plant on an economic basis an intake of at least 50 tons of fish per day for at least 60 days over a more or less continuous period each year would be necessary.  These figures will give some idea of the difficulties <Col N="857" /> to be met in establishing fish meal manufacture in this country on the basis of present landings.  Furthermore the prices which could be paid to the fishermen considering that it takes about five tons of raw material to produce one ton of fish meal would need to be very much lower than the prices which could be paid for fish either in the fresh or processed state used for the consumer trade.  As in other countries, the price would be about 35/- per cran for herring landed near a factory.  It follows that heavy landings would be required per boat if fishermen are to be satisfied with the results and encouraged to fish specially for the purposes of fish meal manufacture.</P>
    <P>So far I have dealt with the sea-fishing side of the industry and before I close I would like to refer to the general position of the other side of the industry, i.e., inland fisheries. This consists of the salmon, sea trout and eel fisheries which are carried on on a commercial scale as well as being, as regards salmon and sea trout, a very important sporting and tourist attraction.  We have in this country extensive brown trout and coarse fish waters.  These fisheries provide much pleasure to our own people and are an important factor in the tourist traffic. They are not, however, subject to rod licences or to any regulations as to furnishing returns of catches so I have no records as to the actual number of fish taken.</P>
    <P>As to salmon, sea trout and eels, we have such records and the following figures may be of interest.  The total catches in 1954, excluding the portion of the Foyle area on this side of the Border were: salmon, 17,500 cwt.; sea trout, 650 cwt.; eels, 1,300 cwt.; compared with 16,000 cwt.; 550 cwt. and 1,700 cwt., respectively, for 1953.  The total cash value of the catches of these fish to the fishermen as returned to the Department was £529,000 in 1954 compared with £553,000 in 1953.  The average price per cwt. for salmon fell during 1954 by about £3 per cwt. compared with 1953.  The number of salmon rod licences issued in 1954 was 6,195 compared with 6,050 for 1953, while the <Col N="858" /> number of net licences decreased slightly from 1,532 to 1,453.</P>
    <P>As to brown trout and what are generally known as coarse fish, the main developments are taking place through the efforts of the Inland Fisheries Trust in co-operation as regards some waters with Bord Fáilte. Local angling clubs and committees are also, of course, making valuable contributions to the development and I am glad to say that in some cases local waters have been turned to good account by such committees in attracting visitors and tourists.  This is very valuable work which, of course, must rely on local initiative and enterprise, and I need hardly say that both my Department and the Inland Fisheries Trust will be always ready to help with advice as to the best lines upon which the development of local fisheries should be tackled.</P>
    <P>As to the operations of the Inland Fisheries Trust, as the members may probably be aware from the annual reports so far issued, much progress has been made in restoring our brown trout fisheries.  Prior to the establishment of the trust there was grave danger that our principal brown trout fisheries, particularly in lakes, would be eventually extinguished through the uncontrolled increase in numbers of predatory fish such as pike and perch. Already the steps taken by the trust have reduced these predators in many waters to the point that stocks of brown trout are rapidly on the increase and it can only be a question of a short time until we again have brown trout fisheries in this country as attractive to the angler as the best in any other country.</P>
    <P>Having achieved so much in the reduction of predatory fish, the trust have now in hands the establishment of a fish farm to accelerate the rehabilitation of the brown trout fisheries by releasing therein young trout of the fingerling stage instead of trout fry which, being at a helpless stage of development, are preyed upon with great loss by other fish.  The fish farm will, of course, also serve other purposes as several kinds of fish can be reared to the adult stage and, as well as being available for breeding purpose <Col N="859" /> poses, provide an opportunity of having scientific observations made during the course of their development. Extensive tests have been and are being made at various sites which seem to have the characteristics desirable for the purposes of a fish farm, and it is hoped that constructional work can be put in hands at the site finally selected in the early future.</P>
    <P>There is one matter concerning the trust which is a cause of disappointment and that is the relatively low membership which it has so far secured.  In the Estimates before the House, provision is made for a contribution of £10,000 from State funds for the trust.  There are many thousands of brown trout anglers in this country, but the membership of the trust so far has only reached about 1,500.  The membership fee is only 5/- per annum and carries with it the right to fish in any of the waters under the control of the trust.  Apart from this advantage it is indeed surprising that a greater number of anglers have not given their moral support, as well as financial, to the trust by becoming members.  By doing so they help the trust in its work and show that as a body they are prepared to help in bringing the brown trout fisheries throughout the country to their highest pitch of development.</P>
    <P>I have reviewed in a general way the present position of our fishing industry, both sea and inland fisheries, and I think it may be fairly claimed that we are making progress in many directions.  If there are any points on which Deputies require further information, I will do my best to supply it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not intend to introduce anything in the nature of political contention into my few remarks on this Estimate. <Col N="862" /> The Parliamentary Secretary has read out a statement that is couched on the whole in objective tone and terms. However, I think I am entitled&mdash;after there being a year since the change of Government&mdash;to reply to statements in regard to certain actions for which I was responsible.  They are matters which are a continuing subject of fishery administration and therefore they are proper to be mentioned in this Estimate.</P>
    <P>One of these questions was the decision to buy three off-shore vessels. No later than a week or so ago, the Minister for Local Government delivered himself of this denouncement of them:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am very keen indeed to see that our fisheries are put on a much better footing and my friends on the other side of the House should have seen that was done instead of spending £60,000 on three derelict German trawlers.  A number of good boats could have been bought with that money.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This, of course, was decided on in March, 1954.  Why is it that the purchase of three boats, practically new, not for £60,000 but for £50,000, was a crime against the Irish fishing industry and the interests of the inshore fishermen when we were, in fact, importing very large quantities of fresh fish every week, the total in a year amounting to a very considerable sum?  That was not the only objection raised to the purchase.  There was also the question that we should not send money for the provision of boats out of the country when we had in this country boatyards capable of making them.</P>

If it was a crime for the fisheries administration under Fianna Fáil to spend £50,000 on these three off-shore cutters, would he not agree it was equally reprehensible for my predecessor in fisheries to spend <Col N="863" /> between £40,000 and £45,000 on boats outside the country?</P>

We did not complain in any sort of a fractious spirit but because we went out to pay £50,000 we were ballyragged for three years about it and the boats were condemned, as Deputy O'Donnell says, as three derelict trawlers.</P>

Talking about these experiments, perhaps Deputy Collins is not aware that there was another very costly experiment which had to deal with boats from outside. They came in here and we did not own them.  When they came in here they left again in the ownership under which they came after a much heavier sum of money was lost on them than on the three boats.  The three boats I refer to we own, and we are using them as training ships.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know that we have young men now being trained to qualify for their ticket.  I think Deputy Collins and every other Deputy who took an interest in this matter must know from the replies to questions given in the House that there is a complete absence of men qualified to take a boat even <Col N="865" /> of our standard 50-foot size on the sea if the Department of Industry and Commerce were to enforce the appropriate regulations.

    <P>(b)  the advance out of the Central Fund or the growing produce thereof of any moneys from time to time required by the Minister for Finance to meet sums which may become payable under any guarantee given by him under Section 5 of such Act, and the payment to the Central Fund out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas of any amounts of such advances as have not been repaid by the board to the <Col N="867" /> Central Fund within 12 months from the date of the advance, and</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>On the section.  I have not been able to work out how the Minister arrived at the figure that is in this Bill.  As I understand the position, there were on the 1st April last, approximately 400 areas left to be completed under the rural electrification scheme and the average cost of completing each area is £33,300.  On that basis the total cost of completing the scheme in the 400 areas to which it has yet to be brought will be £13,300,000 approximately.  The E.S.B. had, however, under the Act of last year on the 1st April approximately, £3,150,000 unused authorisation so that the additional authority required to enable the scheme to be completed is £10,150,000. The Minister is proposing to provide £9,000,000.  Apart from just putting down any figure that may have come into his mind I do not see how the figure in the Bill was arrived at.  It is either too little or too much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If it is intended to provide the E.S.B. now with legislative authority to expend money to the extent required to complete the scheme, then it falls short of that amount by slightly over £1,000,000.  If it is intended that the Dáil should have another opportunity of discussing the progress of the board in relation to rural electrification before the construction of the network is completed, then it is too much because only a handful&mdash;comparatively <Col N="868" /> speaking&mdash;of areas will be left by the time the additional £9,000,000 provided under this Bill is expended.</P>
    <P>In that connection I want to query a reference which the Minister made in the Second Reading debate to the E.S.B.'s commitments regarding rural electrification.  He stated that their expenditure and commitments by the autumn of this year would have exceeded the limit fixed in the Act of 1954.  I do not know what the E.S.B. commitments under the rural electrification scheme have to do with it&mdash;I do not even know what they are.  So far as the clear terms of the legislation are concerned they have nothing whatever to do with it.  They need not be taken into account.  The act of 1954 fixed a limit of £16,000,000 on the amount that could be advanced from the Exchequer to the E.S.B. for the purpose of rural electrification.  It did not say anything about the board's expenditure or the board's commitments. It merely gave authority to the Minister for Finance to advance up to that amount to the E.S.B. for the purposes of the scheme.  There is no reference in this Bill to the board's commitments.  The authority here is to expend up to £25,000,000 and when that is spent the board can have and may have commitments, but it is not prevented from having them by any wording here.</P>
    <P>I suggested on the Second Reading debate that the Minister was rushing this Bill through the Dáil in the present session for other reasons than he stated.  The Bill is not required for the purpose of enabling the rural electrification scheme to be carried on through the second half of this year. The board has unused authority to expend under existing legislation sufficient to keep it going into next year.  I think the real reason why the Bill is being rushed now is not as the Minister stated.  It is possible, of course, that the cost of construction of the rural electrification network per area will increase beyond the average figure of £33,300 of last year.  In that case the position might have to be reviewed and the board might require for the purposes of the scheme more money than I have calculated but it <Col N="869" /> seems, on the face of it, foolish to provide £9,000,000 when £10,150,000 will complete the scheme.  There can be no purpose served by that arrangement.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that he expected that the construction of the network would be completed by March, 1959. I said that 12 months ago, more than 12 months ago.  I said it when I was introducing the 1954 Bill in February of last year.  But that estimate of mine at that time was based upon the expectation that the board would be able to do what it said in its published report it would do, namely, construct the network at a rate of 100 areas per year.  The fact that it only completed 75 areas in 1954-55 instead of 100 areas that it intended to complete indicates that either my estimate was wrong or the Minister's estimate is wrong.  It certainly means, if the Minister's estimate is to be realised, if the board is to complete construction of the network by March, 1959, as I stated here 15 or 16 months ago, they will have to do very much better in the rate of construction than they did last year.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister's problem in this matter.  He is anxious to get to the position in which he can report any improvement in the rate of construction as something which he brought about and decline any responsibility for the fact that the board did not succeed last year in constructing the network at the rate which in its published report it said it would achieve.  I think the explanation for its failure to reach its target was the financial difficulties created for it by the Government's withholding of the amounts due to the E.S.B. under existing legislation by way of capital grant for the construction of the network.  I think the bad weather could also have contributed to slowing down the rate of construction. But, whatever the explanation is, we have not got it from the Minister.  He did not attempt, in any way, to explain to the House how it was that the board, which in its report for 1953 said it would construct the rural electrification network at the rate of 100 areas per annum in 1954, only did 75 per cent. of that rate in that year.  Some explanation is, I think, due to the Dáil.</P>
    <P>In that connection I want to say <Col N="870" /> something that I think should be said. This is the first time that a Bill of this kind dealing with the activities of the E.S.B. was brought to the Dáil without the circulation of a White Paper explanatory of the Bill and giving details of the board's plans and programme. I do not know why the Minister decided not to circulate with this Bill the customary report on the activities of the E.S.B.  I will raise that point again in connection with the next section because it seems to me there must be, if that section is justified at all, some failure on the part of the board to proceed with other parts of their development programme at the rate contemplated in 1953.  But, if there had been circulated the customary White Paper associated with this Bill, presumably that would have contained the explanation of the reasons why the board last year was not able to proceed with the construction of the rural network at the rate which they stated in the previously published report they hoped to achieve. Perhaps the Minister will give us the explanation now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me assure Deputy Lemass that I have no ulterior motive of any kind in getting this Bill through the House before the Adjournment.  I think, however, it is desirable that whatever discussion there is on this Bill should be cleared up before the E.S.B. goes to the country for a loan rather than that we should be asking money for the E.S.B. for a national undertaking at the same time when we here, who ought to be encouraging the E.S.B. to undertake something we want done, are engaged in what could, and what I hope will not, develop into a squabble as to whether the E.S.B. is right in this way or wrong in the other way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most vital mistake we could make is to imagine that any particular Party in this House owns the E.S.B. I would be as much gratified if the E.S.B. made progress under Fianna Fáil as I am gratified that it is making progress under the inter-Party Government. I do not want to seek any credit for the progress they make while I am Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I would be willing to share the credit <Col N="871" /> with every member of this House or with any other Party in the State.  It is immaterial from the point of view of national well-being and the people's welfare what Government is in office so long as the objective set before the E.S.B. is achieved.</P>
    <P>If Deputy Lemass wants to take credit for anything the E.S.B. did during his period of office I will not, in the slightest, begrudge any ration of credit which he claims for himself during that period, nor will I waste any time detracting from it.  What I would like to see is that the E.S.B. would be regarded as an undertaking belonging to the whole nation, not belonging to any single Party and not claimed by any single Party, and that we would all aid, whether in Government or in Opposition, in making the E.S.B. the most efficient organisation we can make it.</P>
    <P>On the question as to why the E.S.B. did not attain the development of 100 rural areas in 1954-55, I understand their position to be that the board said in its report for 1953-54 that it intended to effect a further increase in the course of the coming year, bringing the rate of construction to 100 areas per annum.  Note that: &ldquo;bringing the rate of construction to 100 areas per annum&rdquo;.  The Deputy alleges this meant the board promised to develop 100 areas in 1954-55.  Now it is a matter for the Deputy to put any interpretation he likes on this report.  It was not written by me.  It was written by a board which was functioning when he was in office.  But I do not think it bears the interpretation the Deputy has attempted to give it, namely, that it meant 100 areas would be constructed.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that what the board promised to do was to reach a position in which development would proceed at the rate of 100 areas per annum but not actually to develop 100 areas. In fact the position of developing 100 areas per annum was not attained until January, 1955.  They did not attain it in 1954 but they have attained it in January, 1955, and from inquiries which I have made the position now <Col N="872" /> is that between January and June, 1955, they have developed 52 areas.  If that rate is continued during the year they will pass the 100 areas in the current calendar year.  Whether they will fall back somewhat in the second part of the year, due to weather or other conditions, I cannot say, but this is what they are doing at the moment. Instead of putting the microscope on this matter, I think we ought to put the telescope on it and take an objective view of E.S.B. activities.  I feel satisfied that the E.S.B. are doing the work which this House has assigned to it.  Who is in office when that is happening is not an issue with which I am going to concern myself very much.  If others want to do it they are welcome to do so.  I am satisfied to see the E.S.B. doing this national work on behalf of the people generally.</P>
    <P>On the question as to why we increased the allocation for rural electrification from £16,000,000 to £25,000,000, the present position is that within the existing limit of £16,000,000 the total already advanced to the board is £13.6 million and in the year 1955-56 the board's requirements for rural electrification are expected to total £4,000,000.  At the end of May the board's total expenditure on commitments in respect of the schemes was £15,057,000.  Therefore, at the end of May the board was running towards the position at which it was likely to exhaust the £16,000,000 limit set by this House and could possibly&mdash;I do not say actually&mdash;by the autumn have reached the position at which it had come level with the £16,000,000 which the House authorised the board to expend.  Hence the Government's decision to make the board responsible for meeting rural electrification charges contained in this Bill.  At the same time it was decided to give the board increased borrowing powers, raising the amount available for its purposes from £16,000,000 to £25,000,000, and that has been done.</P>
    <P>The £25,000,000 is not claimed to be a precise mathematical figure.  By current estimates of progress we think it will carry the board to about 1958. There might be a short fall there and <Col N="873" /> there might not, but in any case this will carry the board along with funds to undertake this work until 1958.  Then the money so voted by this House will have been exhausted and, in accordance with the customary practice, a Bill will be promoted here for the purpose of giving the board what additional money it needs.  The House will then have an opportunity of surveying the work done by the board, ascertaining the stage which has been reached and, if it wishes, indicating to the Government what general direction the board ought to take for the completion of the programme. Those are the simple economics of it. There is no mystery about it.  It is a candid, plain statement of what the position is and an explanation of why £25,000,000 was set as a figure which will carry the board through in its work for the next three years.</P>

      <P>On the Minister's general observations I just want to say that the rural electrification scheme was a good scheme.  It secured the approval of all Deputies in the Dáil at the time.  But let us be clear about this.  The Minister is changing the scheme and I think he is disimproving it considerably.  It is because I do not think he is doing it voluntarily, it is because I think he was rushed into accepting that arrangement by some of his Coalition colleagues that I am critical of him&mdash;and he is the only member of the Government I could criticise in that case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I will say what I have to say on Section 4 of the Bill, which is the really relevant section.  At the moment I am merely trying to get the position clarified.  I want to know how much it is anticipated it will cost the board to complete the rural electrification network.  On my calculation, and it is based on the assumption that <Col N="874" /> there are 400 areas to be done and the average cost of an area is £33,300, it will cost £10,158,000 allowing for what the board has in the kitty unused of the £16,000,000 authorised last year.  On that basis, the additional amount required to enable the board to complete the rural electrification programme, without any further legislation, is £10,150,000.  The Minister is giving £9,000,000.  Why not give them the whole £10,500,000 they require or, alternatively, give them less in order to ensure that the Dáil will have another opportunity between this and the completion of the scheme to criticise if it wants to criticise&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If my calculation is correct, by the time the E.S.B. will be coming back for further authorisation there will only be about 30 areas left to be done out of the 400.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am merely trying to find out how this figure of £9,000,000 was arrived at.  It seems to me to be either too little or too much on any basis.  The Minister is confusing that calculation to a considerable extent by talking about the board's commitments. Commitments have nothing whatever to do with it.  What are the board's commitments?  I do not even understand the term.  I can understand the board having commitments ahead in connection with a power station which might take three years to complete. What commitments has it in connection with rural electricity development except in relation to some supplies of cable and transformers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Take those.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>They can only be of very insignificant dimensions.  But, anyway, they have nothing whatever to do with it.  Look at the wording of the 1954 Act.  That Act says that the Minister for Finance may advance to the E.S.B. up to £16,000,000 for the purpose of the rural electrification <Col N="875" /> scheme.  It does not even limit what the board may spend on the rural electrification scheme, much less what it commits itself to spend.  The Minister is not limiting the board under this Bill to keep its total expenditure and commitments within £25,000,000. It merely states in this Bill that the board must not spend more than £25,000,000 and I think that is the proper way to phrase the section. Therefore, all this reference to commitments is merely an unnecessary complication because commitments do not arise at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Commitment is interpreted in the sense that the board clearly owes certain sums of money which have to be paid and it is in process of entering into activities which, in due course, will take the form of an account furnished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>May I remind the Minister that when he became Minister the board had spent a great deal of money on the rural electrification scheme which the Government owed it and has not paid since?  Would the Minister explain how they did that? It is quite clear that the board is not limited by any legislation in the amount it spends on rural electrification it is limited in the amount it can borrow from the Exchequer for that purpose.  However, would the Minister tell us now what is the present estimate of the total cost of completing the rural electrification network as from 1st April last or as from the present date?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have told the Deputy that the board is about half-way through its schemes.  The Deputy can theorise as to about how much it will cost to do the rest.  That depends on the rate of progress.  That depends on the cost of materials.  That depends on the physical difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>By making a calculation that with the sum of money already spent, the sum of money the board will have to pay this year and the anticipated progress in the next three years, a round sum of about £25,000,000 will be necessary.  Of course, if the board does not need the £25,000,000 it will not spend £25,000,000.  If the board finds that before 1958 it has spent the £25,000,000 it will so indicate to the Department of Industry and Commerce and steps will be taken to put it in funds again.  In any case one may be sure, since the accounts of the board are audited, that moneys will not be paid away where they are not due and, from that standpoint, all these questions have merely an academic meaning and have no real value in a sense. If the Deputy wants on the next Stage of the Bill, if we defer the Bill until to-morrow, to get a calculation made for his personal satisfaction as to what the anticipated expenditure will be for the completion of the scheme, and he can then fill in all the gaps he likes between 1959 and the date on which the scheme will be completed, if that satisfies the Deputy's thirst I will get him all the information he wants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>As a matter of principle I want to assert right now that this is not an academic question.  The implication of the Minister's remarks is that if the E.S.B. comes and asks the Dáil to sanction an expenditure of £9,000,000 on rural electrification our job is to give them that money without asking any questions.  But surely we are entitled to know how much they think it will cost per area. Surely we are entitled to ask if they have considered fully the efficiency of their construction methods.  Surely we are entitled to ask whether it is possible to get the job done better or more cheaply.  Are we not entitled to ask them at this stage to calculate how much it will take them to complete the job?  These are all perfectly legitimate questions which the members of a company would ask the board of directors if they approached the shareholders for more money.  We stand <Col N="877" /> in the position of directors of a company, the board of which is coming to ask for authority to spend more money. These questions, therefore, arise and they should be answered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely that is an absurd attitude.  Surely, if the Minister himself is responsible for coming to the House and asking the House to spend more money than the Dáil has already authorised the board to spend, he ought to have satisfied himself as to the basis upon which this request is put forward.  This is the first time I have heard of a public corporation, a statutory undertaking, being able to come to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the Minister responsible to the Dáil for the finances of that undertaking&mdash;let there be no mistake about that!&mdash;and say to him: &ldquo;We want £25,000,000&rdquo; and he does not even ask them: &ldquo;What do you want it for?&rdquo;  Or, perhaps, they say they want it for rural electrification and he does not take the trouble to ask the board: &ldquo;How are you going to spend the £25,000,000?  How many areas are you going to do for that sum? How much will each area cost?&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Lemass has said, that is what any person with a sense of responsibility on being asked to finance a project would at once want to know. He would want to know a certain amount; he would want to have at least some facts put before him. Apparently the Minister has not got those facts.  Apparently he is so contemptuous of the Dáil, so confident that he will be supported in the Lobby by the dumb troops in the Coalition, that he has not even got the information that he ought to have in his brief. There never was a Minister who came to the Dáil and said: &ldquo;If you give me the Committee Stage of the Bill to-night I will try to give you the information you asked for, and which I ought to have had, to-morrow.&rdquo;  I <Col N="878" /> think that is treating the Dáil and the general public with contempt.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that one of the reasons why he was introducing the Bill before the Dáil adjourns is to facilitate the E.S.B. in raising money from the public.  Does anyone think the sort of exhibition which the Minister has made of himself here this evening will help the E.S.B. to get money from the lending public? Evidently the Minister thinks it will because otherwise he would not be introducing this Bill telling us that the E.S.B. has asked him for £25,000,000: &ldquo;They have told me they are going to spend £25,000,000 on rural electrification but I do not know what the basis of their calculation is.  All I am telling them is to go and get the money from the public and they can spend up to £25,000,000 on this particular project.&rdquo; I think that is really treating the Dáil with contempt.  It is treating the public with contempt also.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the most inexplicable section of all.  In the Act brought to the Dáil last year by me the E.S.B. was authorised to borrow from the public by the issue of stock up to £25,000,000 for the purpose of its development other than rural electrification. When I brought that Bill into the Dáil I explained that the board would in fact enter into commitments considerably in excess of that sum, but that its actual expenditure on development work up to March next would be £25,000,000, and that that would be covered by the money borrowed through the issue of stock.  I want the House to understand first of all that the estimate submitted by the board to me was that its development other than rural electrification would involve it in expenditure of £25,000,000 up to <Col N="879" /> March, 1956, and that the total development which it would begin during that period would involve a great deal more expenditure&mdash;that the £25,000,000 was only enough to meet its actual outgoings to March, 1956. Now the Minister brings a Bill in here which says that the E.S.B. may, within that limit of £25,000,000, borrow money for rural electrification.</P>
      <P>Under the 1954 Act rural electrification was specifically excluded from the purposes for which the board could borrow, the reason being that rural electrification was a subsidised service and that it was thought to be inappropriate that the public should be asked to subscribe to a subsidised service. The Minister now has no objection to letting the public be asked to subscribe capital for a losing service, which rural electrification will now be. This Bill has nothing whatever to do with the forthcoming E.S.B. loan; the authority of the 1954 Act was ample for that.  The Act gave the board the right to borrow from the public £25,000,000 for purposes other than rural electrification.  No legislation relating to rural electrification has any bearing upon the board's power to issue that loan.  It now becomes necessary to ask the Minister how it is expected that there will be available within that £25,000,000 limit a margin which can be used to finance the rural electrification scheme.  Does it mean the board's general development programme is proceeding more slowly than was contemplated in 1953?</P>
      <P>Mind you, there are some indications that that is so and I think the House should be given particulars of any alteration in the dates of commissioning of new stations which were mentioned in the board's report for 1952-53.  In that report the board set out a programme for the generating stations to be constructed up to 1958 and gave, in respect of each of these stations, the probable commissioning year.  Has there been any alteration in that construction programme, and, if not, how is it that it is expected the board will not spend on that work what it estimated in 1953 it would require to spend before March, 1956?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="880" /> There is the alternative that the Minister is contemplating that the board will again draw upon the Exchequer for its capital needs&mdash;that it will not rely entirely upon moneys borrowed from the public under the authority of the 1954 Act.  If that is so, the House should be informed. Certainly when the 1954 Act was submitted to the Dáil the House was left under the impression that the financing of the board's development other than the rural electrification scheme would not again be a matter for the Exchequer&mdash;that the board would have authority to get the money it required for that purpose by the issue of stock subject to limits laid down by the Dáil.</P>
    <P>I want to draw attention to the failure of the Minister to circulate the customary White Paper with this Bill. We should have got this information by White Paper as was done on every previous occasion.  Had we got that information many of these questions could have been avoided but let us assume that this section is not meant only as a gesture; let us assume that it is intended that the board's rural electrification work will continue to be financed from the Exchequer and that the full £25,000,000 which the board was authorised to raise under the 1954 Act will be expended, as was intended, on general development before March next.</P>
    <P>Does that mean we are going to have another E.S.B. Amendment Bill in the autumn session?  Unless the board is very far behind in its generation programme then there must be need for new legislation before March next. Why was not this Bill availed of to increase the authority of the board to borrow?  There are matters on which the House needs information because there is the implication in this Bill that the board's generation programme is not working according to plan and that some of the money intended to be used for that programme can be diverted to rural electrification.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know where the Deputy got the material on which he built up that kind of a case.  Section 4 of the 1954 Act provides:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="881" />&ldquo;The Board may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance and the Minister, borrow money by means of the creation of stock or other forms of security to be issued, transferred, dealt with and redeemed in such manner and on such terms and conditions as the Board, with the consents aforesaid, may determine.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>But the moneys required for rural electrification were specifically excluded from the right to borrow for the reason that the service was a subsidised one and that it was considered inappropriate that money should be sought from investors for such a service.  The moneys required for that service, therefore, could be acquired only from the Central Fund or from the board's own resources&mdash;from whatever reserves they have for superannuation and such like provisions.  But with the abolition of the subsidy for rural electrification the distinction between rural and non-rural capital requirements now completely disappears and it is clearly desirable that the board should obtain as many as possible of its capital requirements from sources other than the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>In view of that, it is proposed to allow the board to get its capital requirements for its rural and non-rural activities from the general capital, and the limits of prohibition for doing that are renewed by this particular section. Subsidisation of rural electrification has gone.  There is no difference between rural and non-rural electrification and therefore there is no need for the discrimination shown in the 1954 Act.  The board may now go out and borrow its capital requirement. Its ability to finance its rural programme was clearly demonstrated when we discussed that matter on the Second Reading of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has missed the point altogether.  The 1954 Act fixed a limit of £25,000,000 as the amount which the board could borrow by the issue of its own stock.  The Minister does not propose to alter that limit in the Bill.  Therefore, the board is still in the position that the maximum amount which it can raise by the issue of stock is £25,000,000. <Col N="882" /> When the figure was put into the 1954 Act it was estimated that it would be enough, but no more than enough, to meet the actual outgoings of the board on its generation programme up to March, 1956.</P>
      <P>I had explained to the Dáil that, by March, 1956, its commitments under that programme would be substantially greater and that the £25,000,000 was intended to cover only the actual expenditure which it would be forced to undertake before that date.  If that is so, where is the margin for the financing of rural electrification out of that £25,000,000?  The Minister is saying that the rural electrification finances will also be drawn from that source, and that, when the board issues its stock, the proceeds of that issue will be available for the generation programme and the rural electrification programme.  But there is not enough unless the generation programme is behind schedule.  Is that so?</P>

      <P>Is it, in fact, intended that no part of the £25,000,000 which the board is authorised to raise will in fact be used on rural electrification? Unless the generation programme has fallen behind, the board will still have to go back to the Exchequer for the whole of the amount required for rural electrification.  Then the section is unnecessary and will continue to be unnecessary until legislation is introduced as it must be before March&mdash; unless the generation programme is not up to date&mdash;to raise the limit of the £25,000,000 fixed in the 1954 Act for the issue of stock by the board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The board can get it. The board's position has been somewhat changed by new sources of borrowing and new sources by which <Col N="883" /> money is available to it.  That is explained by the fact that depreciation reserves and borrowings from the Superannuation Fund are available to the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That was calculated in the Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the explanation which reduced borrowings by the board for the year 1953-54.  In addition to that, the board is empowered by Section 3 of the 1954 Act to make temporary borrowings, and under this the board is authorised to borrow to a limit of £5,000,000 up to December next.  I understand that this authorisation has been availed of to the extent of £3,000,000.  In addition to that, there is the buoyant revenue position of the board, together with general savings on fuel costs during the year.  These have enabled the board to reduce its demand on the sources normally used for capital expenditure.  With these sources of money available to it, the board has not been drawing as it might be drawing were these moneys not available to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of what the Minister says is that the board overestimated its cash needs for its generation programme.  What the board said to me was that, taking into account all the resources that would be available to it, it would need in cash to meet actual outgoings in cash before March, 1956, £25,000,000, and consequently the 1954 Act empowered them to borrow up to £25,000,000.  The board fully recognised that its commitments under the generation programme would be substantially larger.  It was estimated that its actual cash outgoings by March would be £25,000,000. Unless the board has fallen behind with its generation programme it will still need £25,000,000 in cash for that programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only other explanation is that its estimate was wrong.  I do not think that the trend of prices for electrical equipment has been downward since the estimate was prepared.  The board may have been able to buy advantageously, but, nevertheless, the general trend has been at least <Col N="884" /> stationary, certainly not downwards. If its estimate of February, 1954, is correct, there is no margin there available to it for rural electrification.  Does the Minister contemplate that the board will have to go to the Exchequer for finance for rural electrification in excess of the £25,000,000 which it is authorised to borrow on the issue of its own stock?</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did attempt to justify the introduction of this Bill without the usual explanatory memorandum by saying that his reason for bringing it in late in the session was that he was anxious to facilitate the board in raising from the public the finances which it required.  I should like the Minister to read his speech to-morrow and see if he thinks his statement is likely to conduce to that degree of public confidence in the operations of the board which would enable it to raise this money.</P>
      <P>What has the Minister told us this evening?&mdash;that the board is being compelled by this Bill to borrow from the public and to finance <i>in toto</i> a service which is entirely uneconomic, which can never pay its way, a fact which was recognised by the Fianna Fáil Government when they started the rural electrification scheme and decided that, in order to undertake it, it would be necessary to subsidise the capital cost to the extent of 50 per cent.</P>
      <P>The Minister has told the lending public this evening that among the purposes for which they would be asked to lend money to the board is in order that the board may undertake an activity which, as I have said, will never be economic, an activity which will lose money at such a rate that the economists and the engineers of the board and the Minister who was primarily concerned with the activities of the board, the Minister for Finance, decided that they would have to subsidise it as I have said to the extent of 50 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart altogether from the question as to whether the board is going to get <Col N="885" /> money from the public for that purpose, what is going to happen on the figures that have been given to the House?  We have been told by Deputy Lemass that the figure of £25,000,000, which appeared in the 1954 Act, was very narrowly calculated, that, in fact, it was the bare amount which would finance the operations of the board's capital programme up to 1956.  The Minister has told us that, so far as the generation programme of the board is concerned and so far as expenditure upon what may be described as the normal activities of the board is concerned, these are not being curbed or restricted in any way.  Accordingly, money is allowed to flow out from the board to meet commitments which it had entered into under contract.</P>
    <P>I cannot see that any one of the outside sources of finance to which the Minister has referred could provide any really significant sum for the purpose of defraying the continuing and, as I think it will be, the increasing cost of the rural electrification programme. The Minister has said that the board has been fortunate in so far as it has been enabled to make very substantial economies in regard to the use of fuel. Well, that was due entirely to the exceptional conditions which prevailed last year and which, to some extent, prevailed up to recently.  But have we any assurance that the abnormal rainfall of last year will be continued from this until the end of the year?  Even if we had such an assurance, would it be sufficient to offset the certain rise which will take place in the price of fuel?</P>
    <P>The Minister has referred to the fact that the board was able to save on fuel costs during 1954 and perhaps during part of 1955.  Does he say, in face of the statement which has been made elsewhere, in face of the fact that the cost of coal, even to the British user, is going up by, I think, 18½ per cent., that the board will secure that economy next year?  Therefore, how much money will be set free to the board to spend on its capital programme and to meet the inevitable deficiency which, I think, will arise in regard to the finance required, not merely to complete, but to carry on the rural electrification scheme?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="886" /> It would seem to me that the real purpose of this section is to enable the Minister to put a brake on the carrying-out of the original rural electrification programme, because he can quite easily say to the board&mdash;in fact he is going to put the board in this situation &mdash;&ldquo;You have entered into commitments with the suppliers for generating plant.  You have entered into commitments with building contractors for building your stations.  You have entered into commitments for additional transmission lines.  You have entered into commitments with contractors for switch gear.  All of these are contracts which you will have to honour and pay the moment the contractor says: &lsquo;I have the plants ready or part of the plant ready for shipment. I have part of the plant ready and part has already been delivered.&rsquo;  You have to pay for the materials almost on the nail.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Therefore, the board is being put in this situation that, having entered into these contracts which it has no way of getting out of, if the money is not forthcoming from some other source than the borrowing public, then it has got to close down on some one of its activities.  The only one to which it is not committed up to the hilt is the rural electrification programme because it, by comparison with the other activities of the board, is a minor activity.  It does not require anything like the same capital expenditure so far as the network is concerned and they can slow down progress on the erection of the rural electrification network to that extent which will enable them just to carry on without having to fail in meeting their commitments under contract to the suppliers of plant and equipment.</P>
    <P>I think that is one of the reasons why this section is being introduced here.  I cannot see any other reason for it except, as I have said, to put the board in the situation that it can always say and it will say to the Minister and the Minister will come here and say to the House: &ldquo;Well, the board is very sorry but it is just not able to finance the rural electrification scheme in the circumstances in which it finds itself.  It has now got to pay more for fuel than <Col N="887" /> it paid in 1954.  Other costs have gone up correspondingly and the £25,000,000 that we originally voted in 1954 will be barely enough to enable the board to meet its obligations under contract to those who are at the moment manufacturing and will ultimately erect the machinery which the board requires.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact of the matte is that the E.S.B. has a substantial surplus, has had a substantial surplus had in the current year a surplus or its rural account for the first time and under this Bill, it can now finance the rural electrification scheme out of it funds and it will not need any subsidy from the taxpayer.  Here is an under taking, an excellent undertaking nationally, an excellent undertaking economically, an excellent undertaking financially, able to pay its way treatec as a unit and yet, in spite of the fact that it can pay its way treated as a unit, that it will have a surplus, Deputy MacEntee still wants to pay a subsidy to an organisation which, treated as a unit, has a very substantial surplus.  I think that is the economics of a lunatic asylum&mdash; nothing else&mdash;to give a subsidy to a body which is already yielding a substantial surplus.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <P>I did not start this discussion on Section 3.  It was widened by what was said before I spoke and, of course, Deputy MacEntee could not be controlled in any reference he is making on any section of this Bill and probably will not be controlled even on the Title.</P>
      <P>The fact of the matter is that that is the reason for dropping the rural subsidy.  Why should the taxpayer&mdash; why should Deputy MacEntee's wealthy constituents in Ballsbridge, in whom the Deputy takes such an interest in election time&mdash;be asked to pay a subsidy to the E.S.B. when the E.S.B. in its published accounts shows that it does not need a subsidy?  In this Bill we are making sure that the E.S.B. will pay for rural electrification and non-rural electrification and, taking both of them together, this excellent organisation will pay on the nail, as Deputy MacEntee says, for all it orders, for all it gets and for all the work it carries out.  It can do it easily under this Bill.  I am sorry if that annoys Deputy MacEntee, but the facts of history cannot be changed merely to please Deputy MacEntee. The facts show it can do that and we are asking that it should be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We will discuss what the Minister is doing with the surplus on the rural electrification account when we come to the next section.  He seems to have made a shocking mess of it.  We are dealing here with the capital needs of the board.  He has not clarified the point I raised but one remark of his offers explanation.  The Act of 1954 empowered the board to borrow on a temporary basis pending the issue of its stock up to a limit sanctioned by the Minister for Finance.  The Minister now says that, over and above meeting its requirements for generation development up to March next, £25,000,000 will also meet the capital requirements of the board for rural electrification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="890" /> The Minister reminded me that the Act of 1954 empowered the board to borrow temporarily up to whatever limit was agreed with the Minister for Finance.  He mentioned £3,000,000 as representing temporary borrowings to date.  That is the first time the House has got that information that the board &mdash;through its bankers or otherwise&mdash; was authorised to borrow £5,000,000 on a temporary basis pending the issue of its stock.</P>
    <P>I think the board will be in a real difficulty in financing its requirements up to March next.  It has authority for the borrowing of £25,000,000 by the issue of its stock.  It was contemplated that a substantial part of that sum would be raised last year but the E.S.B. were warned off the market by the Minister for Finance who wanted all the money that was available for investment in trustee securities for his own loan.  The Government would not allow the board to issue stock last year. It now has nine months left in which to raise that amount of money by the issue of stock.  I do not think any Deputy in the House feels that circumstances in this country will permit of the subscription of £25,000,000 for trustee stock in a single year.  The board is very unlikely to get its full requirements by the issue of stock unless that stock is underwritten by the Exchequer or by the banks and the underwriters are prepared to hold a substantial part of it.</P>
    <P>Experience over a number of years has suggested that £25,000,000 is more than is available one year after another for investment in trustee securities In that case, the board presumably will be authorised to borrow temporarily even more than the £5,000,000 that it has borrowed up to date.  To what extent is it contemplated that the board should avail of that power of temporary borrowing? I have no objection whatever to the board's using that power quite extensively. When framing that Act I contemplated it would be the normal practice of the board to build up temporary debt pending the issue of stock but it seems that the board will now have to carry a substantial burden of short-term debt for a considerable <Col N="891" /> time ahead.  Remember that the £25,000,000 was estimated to be barely enough to meet requirements until next March.  Before that, we shall have to have fresh legislation and authorisation to borrow a larger sum.</P>
    <P>If the board is again warned off the capital market by the Minister for Finance next year, there will be many difficulties.  The fulfilment of the board's commitments is important to every aspect of our economic life.  The Minister is gravely mistaken if he contemplates that the board&mdash;in addition to financing, by borrowing from the public, the erection of new generating stations&mdash;will also finance the rural electrification scheme.  It cannot be done.  The Exchequer will just have to carry the burden whether it does so by way of loan or grant. Otherwise, we shall have to go on the assumption that the board's activities will be slowed down.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am accepting the ruling of the Chair that my amendments to this section are out of order.  I have no option.  However, I want to protest against the very bad drafting of this Bill.  The main purpose of this Bill was to withdraw the rural electrification subsidy.  The Bill should have been framed in such a way that the Dáil could take a vote upon that single issue.  By putting sub-section (1) into Section 4&mdash;it is really just a provision consequential on Section 2 and should have been incorporated in Section 2 &mdash;the draftsman or the Minister has effectively precluded an Opposition Deputy from dividing the House on the single issue of the withdrawal of the rural electrification subsidy.  I propose to divide the House on the section, but I want to make it quite clear that my objection to the section is confined to sub-sections (2) and (3), the effect of <Col N="892" /> which, if passed, will be to withdraw retrospectively the subsidy given for the rural electrification scheme&mdash;the capital grant payable under the 1945 Act.</P>
      <P>Let us now turn to the surplus in the rural revenue account.  The Minister told us&mdash;we have not yet seen the accounts of the board for 1954-55&mdash;that the rural revenue account of the board showed a surplus in that year of some £40,000.  First of all, may I point out that that surplus was due to the fact that only half of the capital invested in the construction of the network was a charge on the board?  It only had to pay interest and provide for sinking fund on half the capital invested.  The effect of this retrospective legislation is to add, according to the Minister for Finance, £245,000 to the debit side of that account.  That wipes out the surplus and leaves the board starting off the second half of the rural electrification programme with a deficit of some £200,000 per year in its rural revenue account.  What will happen after that?  It is a simple matter of mathematics.  I think that, on the Second Reading, the Minister tried to confuse the Dáil as to the consequences of what the Bill proposes to do.  Any Deputy who can add can work this out for himself.  On the average, it costs £33,300 to erect the network in each area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to avoid loss on that expenditure, the board must get back, as the Minister has stated, in fixed charge revenue 12 per cent. of the outlay. Apart altogether from what the consumer pays per unit for current, he has to pay a fixed charge based upon his valuation and the sum total of the fixed charges from each area must equal 12 per cent. of the cost of constructing the network in the area if the board is to avoid loss.  Again, it is only a simple question of mathematics but, if my calcuations are correct, 12 per cent. of £33,300 is £3,996. That is the sum which the board has to get on the average in each area in fixed charge revenue if it is not to lose money on the construction of the network.  In fact, the board got last year from 75 areas that were completed in that year an average fixed charge revenue of £2,070.  The average fixed <Col N="893" /> charge revenue per area fell short of the amount required by £1,926.  There are 400 areas yet to be completed and if the board is going to lose £1,926 per area, its total deficiency, when these 400 areas are completed, will be £770,000.  To that has to be added the £245,000 additional charge placed upon the board by reason of the Government's decision not merely to withdraw the subsidy but to withdraw it retrospectively, so that the total deficiency on the rural electrification account in respect of fixed charge revenue will be £1,015,000 a year.</P>
    <P>The surplus of £40,000 on the rural revenue account looks very insignificant now.  By the time this rural electrification scheme is completed, the rural revenue account will, because of the Government's decision to withdraw the capital grants and because the board has been unable to get in fixed charge revenue the 12 per cent. of capital cost required, show per year a deficiency of £1,015,000, if my calculation is correct. The Minister says we do not have to worry about that, that the board had a surplus on its general revenue in 1954-55 of £928,000.</P>
    <P>Let us see how real that surplus is and to what extent it is available to meet this anticipated deficiency on the completion of the scheme of £1,000,000 per year in the rural revenue account.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Anybody who can do simple arithmetic will have to accept these calculations.  That sum of £920,000 is not available in full to meet losses and it is a complete distortion of the picture to suggest that it is.  The Minister said that there had to be deducted from it in respect of income-tax payable on the previous year's surplus, £100,000.  The previous year's surplus was £242,000 and, on the surplus for 1954-55, the income-tax charge to be deducted will be very much greater than the deduction in the present year. <Col N="894" /> Income-tax is paid one year in arrear. I do not profess to be an expert on income-tax, but a rough and ready calculation suggests that next year the income-tax but a rough and ready surplus revenue will be about £300,000. That already reduces the amount of the surplus very substantially&mdash;by one-third.</P>
      <P>Let us find out why the board thinks this surplus has emerged at all.  The board pointed out in its 1952-53 report that weather conditions from its point of view were exceedingly favourable and we know from bitter experience that they were, from the board's point of view, equally favourable in 1954. 1954 was one of the wettest years on record and the board even had difficulty in utilising all the water power available to it as it had in 1953.  The board estimated its saving on fuel costs in 1953, because of the wet weather, to amount to £537,000.  If this year is a normal year so far as weather conditions are concerned, the higher cost of fuel alone will wipe out the whole of that surplus after the income-tax charge has been met.</P>
      <P>The board used in 1952-53, which was a wet year, £3,000,000 worth of fuel.  I do not know if Deputies have appreciated the significance of the fuel charge in the board's accounts.  If it has now to go back to normal fuel usage and can still buy coal and turf in 1955 at the price at which it was able to buy in 1953, the surplus which we are told will be shown in the 1954-55 accounts will disappear.  But can the board buy in this year coal and turf at the price at which it was able to buy in 1953?  I do not know what the Bord na Móna accounts are going to show but I shall be very much surprised if its production to date is not very far short of its normal standard production in previous years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know that the weather was completely unsuitable for turf winning, until quite recently, and the scope of Bord na Móna production of machine turf in any year is settled before 1st July.  It can make some addition to its production after 1st July, but not much, and if it has not been able to take all necessary steps to ensure its harvest before 1st July, there is not much it can do after, and unless <Col N="895" /> the loss is to be transferred from the E.S.B. accounts to the Bord na Móna accounts, it is likely that Bord na Móna will be seeking a higher price for turf in this year than it sought in 1953.</P>
    <P>We know that the price of coal has gone up and there is nothing which the E.S.B. can do about that, except pay, so that, apart altogether from the expectation that at some time we will have a normal weather year, there is a certainty that, when the board has to resume its purchase of fuel on the old scale, it will have to pay more for it and that the additional charge for fuel in the board's accounts will exceed even the £530,000 which it estimated to save because of the weather conditions of 1953.</P>
    <P>I said before that I was not an income-tax expert.  I am not a meteorological expert either, but I used to believe at one time in the 11 years' cycle theory.  It looked up to now as if this year was going to upset it.  1922 was an abnormally dry year. Those of us who were campaigning in one form or another during that year will remember it.  1933 was also an abnormally dry year, so dry that we at one stage in that year had to face up to the possibility of cutting off power from many of the country's industries. I remember that we were negotiating with a shipping company to bring some Atlantic liners into Dublin, with the intention of using their generators to add to our meagre output of electricity. The weather broke before the end of the year and made that course unnecessary.</P>
    <P>Nineteen hundred and forty-four was also a very dry year, a year in which the E.S.B. was unable, in the conditions which applied in regard to fuel at the time, to maintain anything like an adequate output and during which we had indeed to shut down the cement factories for a period and other heavy industrial users of electric power.  How 1955 is going to work out is anybody's guess but, if the weather in 1955 is anything like the weather which operated in those years, not merely will the surplus in the board's accounts be wiped out but the whole of its fuel reserve to <Col N="896" /> which the Minister referred will disappear also.  A 15 per cent. increase in the board's usage of fuel over 1953 or a 15 per cent. increase in the price of fuel over 1953 would more than account for the whole of the fuel reserve to which the board attributed its surplus revenue of this year.  Is the Minister, therefore, justified, because the board threw up this accidental surplus of £900,000 in one year, in saying that for every year henceforth it has got to carry £1,000,000 additional loss on rural electrification?  Does he think it is going to be possible for the board to carry that loss without increasing its charges for current?</P>
    <P>The board has no money except that which it gets from the consumers of current, and, if the board's accounts work out as I have calculated, the board will be facing a deficiency of a substantial size in its general revenue and will have no option under the law but to increase its charges.  The law puts on the board the obligation to so regulate its charges for current that they will be sufficient to meet the whole of its outgoings&mdash;the wages it pays, the materials it buys, and the interest and sinking fund charges for which it is liable.  The Minister is not proposing to alter that law.  It is still an obligation on the board, and while that is so the Minister cannot prevent the board fulfilling its statutory obligation by increasing its charges if that situation should arise.  He is not proposing to take power to prevent that. Therefore, all the assurances given to members of the Dáil that there will be no increase in charges because of his withdrawal of the capital grant for rural electrification are valueless.  They are completely dependent on the weather.  If the weather remains bad the forecast may prove accurate.  If it returns to normal it must prove wrong.</P>
    <P>I have seen a number of local newspapers protesting against the utilisation of this surplus for the relief of the Exchequer through the withdrawal of the capital grant for rural electrification rather than in the reduction of charges. I think their protest has point.  In so far as the board has a surplus revenue, if there was any prospect of that surplus continuing it was the intention of <Col N="897" /> the Oireachtas that the benefit of the surplus would be given to the public in the form of a reduction in electricity charges.  I do not think there is any certainty of the continuance of that surplus.  But if the Minister proceeds with this proposal and if the board has to carry this growing deficit on its rural revenue account, a deficit which must grow at the rate of about £250,000 per year, then it is certain that no position is likely to develop in relation to its general revenue which will prevent it facing a deficit, which will have to be offset sooner or later by an increase in charges.</P>
    <P>What does the Government gain from all this?  The disappearance of one item of £85,000 from the Book of Estimates.  And it was merely for the purpose of presenting to the Dáil a Book of Estimates which appeared to show some reduction in Government expenditure that the Government adopted this proposal.  The only thing they cut it by through this manoeuvre was an item of £85,000.  In return they not merely wrecked the basis of a perfectly good scheme but the Minister is permanently raising the level of charges which the consumers of electricity will have to bear in the future. If ever there was an example of bad financial business this is it, and that is why I am asking the Dáil to vote against this particular proposal of the Government on this section of the Bill.</P>

At that rate, therefore, during this calendar year it will complete 104 areas.</P>

I have shown that in the first six months of this year the board have completed 52 rural electrification schemes and that at that rate at the end of the year they will have completed 104, and that this is the first year in which they have passed 75 areas; so that in the first place on those figures it was clearly obvious to everybody that the Deputy could not run this argument of a slowing-down of rural electrification.  That argument has been abandoned this evening for the simple reason that it is based on a fallacy and a falsehood.  There has been no curtailment of rural electrification and there will be no curtailment. Rural electrification will be accelerated and will not be in any way diminished by the passing of this Bill.  I hope that that ghost which kept groaning round here the last day has now been duly laid to rest.</P>

      <P>On the question of increased rural electrification charges I said the last day, and repeat it now, that nothing in this Bill provides any <Col N="899" /> justification for an increase in the charges for rural electrification.  Whatever other circumstances might arise at any time in the foreseeable or unforeseeable future, this Bill does not and cannot provide any justification for an increase in rural electrification charges.  That tune was not hearkened to with any great enthusiasm this evening and it is difficult to find what the argument this evening is.</P>
      <P>I could find no clear outline of the argument.  It is just a protest against this being done and a suggestion that by following this approach to the whole problem somebody believed that this will happen, somebody considered that there will be a situation of disaster and catastrophe if something else does happen.  The simple fact of the matter is that there is no need for the bleakness which has consumed some Deputies opposite over this Bill. Rural electrification will go on at an accelerated rate.  There will be no increase under this Bill in rural electrification charges.  Now that lays those two ghosts, I think.</P>

      <P>Deputy MacEntee is not a very satisfactory prophet in so far as predicting the future of the E.S.B. is concerned, and he is as likely to be wrong now as he was when he was dealing in the past with the future of the E.S.B.  The facts in this matter speak for themselves.</P>

It is a body which can now pay its way and meet all the charges which arise and which are due to be met by the board without any draw on the taxpayers' pocket or without any impairment of the high speed and efficiency which the board has set.</P>

      <P>The Minister has been very careful to try to create a smoke-screen to conceal the real purpose of this particular section.  We are dealing with Section 4.  The Minister did not read Section 4 to the House or explain what it purports to do.  Sub-section (2) of Section 4 provides that:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The total amount remaining due to the Central Fund at the passing of this Act in respect of advances already made under that section together with the total amount of moneys hereafter advanced shall be repaid by the board.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The section referred to is the section under which the rural electrification scheme is being carried out and the operative word in the sub-section I have read is &ldquo;total&rdquo;.  &ldquo;The total amount remaining due to the Central Fund after the passing of this Act shall be repaid by the board.&rdquo;  These words operate to break a public contract entered into between the Government and this House and the E.S.B. under which the E.S.B. was induced to proceed with the rural electrification scheme and the Government bound itself to pay the board one half of the capital cost of the rural electrification scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the position as it exists until this Bill is passed.  It has existed in that form from the beginning.  It is now proposed to break that covenant and to compel the E.S.B. to give back <Col N="903" /> to the Government what this House has already voted for the purpose of erecting these rural electrification networks.  That is the purpose of the Bill.  It has nothing to do with fuel costs or reserve funds in the manner in which the Minister has tried to induce the House to believe it has.  The sole purpose of this section is to break the solemn covenant entered into by legislation by Dáil Eireann on the one hand and on the other the E.S.B. and the consumers of electricity.</P>
    <P>What is going to be the financial effect of this section?  Deputy Lemass has set it out at length.  The ultimate result is that this section will impose on consumers of electricity an annual charge of not less than £1,000,000. Now, let me be meticulously correct. This section will impose on the E.S.B. an annual charge of not less than £1,000,000 a year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Lemass, by the calculations which he has put before the House&mdash;which any person with a knowledge of arithmetic can follow quite simply&mdash;has proved that. He has shown quite conclusively that that is what is going to happen if we enact this section.  I said this was going to impose a charge on the E.S.B., but the charge is not going to rest on the E.S.B.; the E.S.B. will have to pass that charge on and it will fall on the consumers of electricity. That £1,000,000 will fall on the consumers, in the ultimate result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When he was talking on the preceding section, the Minister gibingly sneered at the &ldquo;rich users of electricity&rdquo; in my constituency.  He knows that Ringsend, Beggars' Bush, Cherryfield Buildings and such places are not inhabited by the idle rich of Dublin South-East, that the number of workers, middle-class people and civil servants far outnumber those who might be described as surtax payers in Dublin South-East.  I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary, in the course of the canvass which he so sedulously conducted prior to the election of 1954, must have seen in some of those <Col N="904" /> working-class houses electric bulbs. They were not there for ornament; they were there because by far the largest portion of the consumers of electricity are people who have to earn their living, people who are workers, who live in working-class houses and local authority houses all over the country.</P>
    <P>The £1,000,000 which you are going to vote, if you pass this section, is going to fall, not on the members of the board, not on the staffs of the board&mdash; except in their capacity as consumers &mdash;but ultimately on those who live in working-class houses, who work in shops or in factories, on the general mass of the people, and not upon the 1,500 or 2,000 surtax payers to whom the Minister so sneeringly referred when he was talking on the last section. Make no mistake about it.  Those who use electricity will have to pay more, or certainly will have to forgo any hope that the charges will be reduced in anything like, as the Minister has said, the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>That is what Deputy Tully is not aware of and I am endeavouring to tell him what he is voting for in this Section 4.  Let there be no mistake about it.  Let him not go out and plead that he did not know what he was doing.</P>

      <P>Of course, the Minister did not say that.  He dare not say that; he would be afraid to say that.  He dare not tell the truth about this Bill; he dare not confess what its true purpose is.  This section will impose, first of all, a charge on the E.S.B. which they must pass on to the consumers. The E.S.B. cannot use its reserves in order to meet that charge recurring year after year, until these capital sums have been repaid.  Of course, when they have been repaid, in about 20 or 25 years from now, the borrowing will end.  At the moment, so far as the present users of electricity are concerned&mdash;at present or in the foreseeable future, as the Minister has said&mdash;this section will impose these charges upon them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy had a brain to have water on, he would not be talking.  Let us assume that that is what is going to happen, that the board will not need to use any more fuel and that the price of fuel goes down to the 1953 level.  I say, let us assume that that happens and that the surplus is continued into next year and the year after.  Then Deputies opposite would announce a reduction in the price of electricity and redeem one of their election promises.  Do they realise that the Minister is asking them to forgo the advantage of being able to say: &ldquo;Here was one little thing we did in fulfilment of our promises, even though not through any act of ours&rdquo;? <Col N="906" /> Rather than give you the satisfaction of saying that, of getting credit for that small contribution towards the fulfilment of these enormous promises, he is taking that surplus for the benefit of the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>All these assumptions are not going to happen.  The Minister for Finance is going to look for his £300,000 tax out of that £900,000 revenue.  The weather, I hope, is going to keep normal&mdash;if not consistently dry, at least dry enough to enable us to go out occasionally without an umbrella or a raincoat&mdash;in which case the saving of £500,000 which the board attributed to abnormal weather in the last two years will disappear. We know the price of coal is going up and the E.S.B. can do nothing about it.  We expect the price of machine turf produced by Bord na Móna will have to go up also.  If this happens, there will be no surplus.</P>
      <P>What happens then?  The Minister says I did not make a clear case.  In effect, he says: &ldquo;What a clever fellow I am, I saw that the board had this surplus and I am using it to save the taxpayer and take off the taxpayer's back the obligation to finance the rural electrification scheme.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>We will wait until we get the next report.  I based my case on the most recent report available. It is nonsense to talk about increasing the charges of electricity in rural areas because the percentage of acceptances is bound to fall.  The Minister need not tell me that the scheme is popular in rural areas and that consumption is going up every year.  That is what I foretold years ago when Deputies opposite did not believe it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is always trying to sneak credit for the progress made by somebody else.  I do not give a damn who gets the credit so long as Deputy McGilligan does not get it because he is the one least entitled to it.  In any event, the case I am making is that the board cannot calculate on getting surplus revenue on the scale which we are told it got it although we have not seen the account for 1954-55; that there is not available in the board's account £900,000 surplus to meet the anticipated loss of £1,000,000 on rural electrification; that the Minister was misleading the House when he gave that information.  Three hundred thousand pounds of that £900,000 will go to the Exchequer in income-tax.</P>
      <P>Of the balance of £600,000, more than £500,000 is attributed by the board to the saving of fuel due to wet weather. If the wet weather ends, and we hope it does, that surplus will disappear. It means the calculation can only be right on the assumption that the rain is going to start and continue on such a scale that the board will again meet their fuel expenditure with the same outlay as they met it last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The board, I know, has set aside out of their revenue £500,000 to equalise fuel costs.  The increase in the price of fuel alone which has taken place will more than wipe out the whole of that reserve.  That represents only 15 per <Col N="911" /> cent. of the board's annual consumption of fuel and the increases in the price of coal and turf this year alone will involve the utilisation of the whole of that reserve.  If, over and above that, we get normal weather involving higher fuel utilisation the revenue surplus will disappear or be substantially reduced. The board must aim at some revenue surplus and certainly it cannot get it unless it increases its charges.  The revenue surplus on the general account is partly offset by a growing deficit on rural revenue.  The deficit will be £250,000 this year and it will increase by £250,000 per year until it reaches £1,000,000 on the completion of the scheme.</P>
    <P>That is what the Government are proposing to do, but I would put it seriously to the Government that, while they may feel themselves entitled to make that change in the details of the rural electrification scheme in respect of the future, they are not entitled to go back on the past and make the board repay them money which they were assured they would get from the previous Government.  The board came to me in 1954 to complain about this deficiency in capital grant payments which they had experienced because of my delay, the delay in securing the enactment by the Dáil of the Act which ultimately became the Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Act of 1954.  I assured them that the Act would be passed with all speed and that when it was passed these arrears of capital grant would be made good. They have not been made good and not one penny has been paid since in respect of these and the Government now proposes to claim on the board for the whole of that amount, to make that sum repayable advances instead of capital grant.</P>
    <P>There is no legal remedy against the Government's proposals.  If they get their Bill passed by this House, it will become law and that charge will be put on the board, but I submit to the Government that they are adopting a very bad precedent indeed in retrospectively annulling the contracts of their predecessors.  That is what they are doing.  Even at this stage I ask <Col N="912" /> the Minister to make this Bill apply to the future only and pay to the board the amount due to them under the 1945 Act, an Act passed by this House unanimously and to which every member of the House was committed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Long ago we were told that if electricity was to depend on the Shannon station we were putting ourselves in a terrible predicament by building industries on that because Deputy Lemass said one air raid would leave industries in every city and town paralysed and a reign of darkness over the whole country. That was the mood in 1927 and it has not changed since.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lemass made a calculation. He stopped while making another one to correct a figure that the Minister gave because apparently the calculation did not work out.  That calculation is just as absurd a calculation as the £1,000,000 he is going to add on to the expenditure of the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us see what we are doing.  Deputy Lemass wants to leave the board to its present way of working so that as it incurs certain expenditure it will get 50 per cent. of capital moneys advanced in respect of rural electrification.  Perhaps Deputy Lemass does not know that the board wanted that 50 per cent. increased to a 90 per cent. contribution by the State.  I suppose Deputy Lemass would have given this to them.  We resisted it.  The E.S.B. came to Deputy <Col N="913" /> Lemass in 1953 and put up arguments which persuaded him that the charges must be raised.  Deputy Lemass is the man who put up the charges on the electricity consumers.  He was the only person to do it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Do you object to those charges?  If so, why do you not take them off?</P>

      <P>That sort of cheap-jack interruption does not get the Deputy much further.  Am I not entitled to say that it was the Deputy who was in some way or other convinced by the E.S.B. that they were in a perilous condition and that they got leave from Deputy Lemass to increase their charges?  We did not do it. Now Deputy Lemass says: &ldquo;Oh well, get the charges down&rdquo;.  Perhaps they will come down in the course of time, but they would not come down if Deputy Lemass were there.</P>
      <P>On the Second Reading of the Finance Bill, I prophesied that this board would have £1,000,000 of net surplus this year.  They have £928,000. It was a pretty good guess, was it not &mdash;better than anything Deputy Lemass has done with regard to the E.S.B. over 25 years?</P>

      <P>At any rate I was not responsible for raising charges.  The Deputy did help to bring it about by raising charges.  What did the E.S.B. do with that money?  They have found it, as I understand, very difficult to hide from the public the profits they did make last year.  They put part to a contingency fund.  I understand that they had it an objective to establish a contingency fund of £1,000,000.  They have it at £1,000,000 now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be consoled to know that they have a fuel equalisation reserve standing at <Col N="914" /> £500,000.  They have a variety of other contingencies for which they have made efforts to provide involving sums which amount to very big totals in the aggregate.  In their accounts they show that their capital reserves, if you do not include non-repayable receipts, are about £16,000,000 without counting this £1,000,000 of a special reserve and not counting the £500,000 for fuel equalisation reserve.</P>
      <P>We were told they were bound, under the original Act, to do certain things. They were; and they are probably the hardest-pressed board financially in the whole country because of the way in which the financial provisions of their establishment were built up.  It is said they have got to provide against wasting assets.  So they have. They have also made provision for the increased cost of those assets when they have to rebuy them at some date in the future.  Remember the position the board will find itself in if the original plan works out is that at some date which cannot be more than five or eight years from us it will have all its plant up-to-date by money taken out of annual revenue and applied to the renewal of physical assets.  In addition, they will have put enough money aside to rebuy the whole of the plant&mdash;which, of course, they will not have to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are millions in the E.S.B. They show a certain amount of those, but people do not really understand the board's position unless they can go into the accounts with a thorough understanding of the burdens that have been placed on the board.  I will repeat the facts which I gave on the Finance Bill and say that, leaving out the war years, this board has never failed to show a surplus of revenue.  If you take in the war years, I think there were two in which they were down slightly, and one&mdash;I think that was the year 1945-46&mdash;when there was an appreciable deficit.  That was when they were paying very dearly for bad coal. Outside of the war years they made a surplus every year.  The surplus over the years, according to my calculation, taking in the £1,000,000 this year, would amount to something over £2,500,000.  We are asked now to hesitate about asking this very concern, <Col N="915" /> the best board this country has ever had&mdash;it had a great opportunity because it got a great scheme&mdash;to carry on its shoulders a sector of its scheme which is not in itself directly self-supporting.</P>
    <P>What is the whole fuss about?  As far as the Estimates this year are concerned I think the saving to the taxpayer is £85,000.  In Deputy MacEntee's last year as Minister for Finance he saved in this account £820,000.  Of course, that saving was a bit of a trick because what had happened was that in the time of the first inter-Party Government we modified the system of repayments.  Instead of paying whatever the amount was all in one year we paid it on an annuity basis over a certain number of years.  In the first year when Deputy MacEntee resumed control of finance&mdash;that was the year in which he wanted to have as bad a budgetary situation as possible, and in the second year also&mdash;he resumed the system of paying all in the same year until he was squeezed in the last year and the Budget had to be made some way presentable.  He saved £820,000 by reverting to the annuity basis.  The Party that did that, as I said, went back on the annuity basis because that was the year they wanted to do the civil servants out of their rights and they wanted to show what could be explained as a loss on the revenue of the year.  They lumped in £600,000 which grew eventually into £900,000 as a single year payment and, when things went bad, the Minister for Finance returned to the annuity basis which he had repudiated when he took over from us in 1951.  What is the fuss about?  Should we let this board continue to pile up surpluses?  Deputy Lemass says: &ldquo;No.  Let them reduce their charges.&rdquo;  It is a pity he did not think of that in 1953.</P>

      <P>Take a good view of the situation. Look over the accounts and look at their accumulations and realise they are accumulating funds at such rates as will, say, five or six years hence, enable them to remake the whole of the original scheme.  They will have made enough to do that but they will not want to do that because the plant will be kept up by the replacement of wasting assets.  There is no board in this country with as good a record or can show as good a picture as the E.S.B.  If Guinness to-morrow were to look for a loan or float a prospectus they could not make as good a showing as the E.S.B.  In these circumstances, we are asked to lose our tempers and get panicky over a saving of £85,000 a year to the taxpayer through the Estimates.  That is what the whole fuss is about.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>We have heard the most extraordinary statement from the Attorney-General who is supposed to be the head of the legal profession and the law adviser to the Government.  He has said that it does not matter whether the Government gives a pledge to a public undertaking or not.  This Dáil can come in and tear up that pledge, can dishonour its contract, can dishonour its obligation to keep its word.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the rural electrification scheme was begun, when it was under discussion, it was quite clearly recognised <Col N="917" /> that it could not be in itself an economic scheme.  Therefore, because we wanted to provide our farmers with the facilities which, say, farmers enjoy in more densely populated countries, because we wanted to provide our rural dwellers with one of the amenities which urban dwellers enjoy, we said we were going to initiate the rural electrification scheme, that it was going to go ahead.  Because of the social and economic advantages which the community as a whole would derive from that scheme, we decided that the community as a whole were going to bear half the cost of this scheme to make it economic so far as the E.S.B. were concerned and our anticipations, according to the Minister's own statement, have been found to be correct.  He told us that since 1947, within seven years from the inauguration of the scheme upon the capital basis which I have described, there is already a small surplus upon the rural electrification account. Deputy Lemass pointed out that if it were not for the special arrangement in regard to the capital cost of the rural electrification network that surplus would not exist, that instead there would be a deficiency which would be an accumulating and a growing one of some hundreds of thousands of pounds, a growing one which would ultimately involve a capital charge of £700,000.</P>
    <P>That is the basis upon which the rural electrification programme was embarked upon, on the basis of a contract, a pledge, a bargain entered into between the Government and the E.S.B., a contract which was subsequently ratified by the legislation of this House.  The Attorney-General, the principal law adviser to the Government, the head of the Bar of this country, comes in and, in effect, tells this House: &ldquo;It does not matter what you pledged yourselves to do in relation to the E.S.B.  We are entitled to come in here and dishonour that pledge and, in fact, to dishonour it retrospectively, to say that from the very day we gave the pledge we did not intend to keep it and we are going to ask the E.S.B., in spite of that pledge, to pay us back the money which we gave it as a free gift.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="918" /> That is what the Attorney-General has said.  I am prepared to say that the Dáil is omnipotent in these matters, and it can legislate as it is legislating this evening.  It can tear up this contract and it can dishonour this pledge.  But the thing we must ask ourselves is this: is it a good thing in the public interest to do this?  Is it a good thing that the Attorney-General should come in and tell the House we can do it?  Should he not rather be concerned to ensure that a contract which has been entered into will be observed?  Surely that is the function of the legal adviser to the Government?  But the man who is the head of the Bar in this country, who is supposed to observe such a high standard of conduct in matters of this sort, comes in here and talks in a way which I think is really dishonouring to the House.  Let us see what will be the effect of this upon people outside. The Attorney-General has told us we can, we have full power; we have absolute power, uncontrolled and absolute power, to dishonour the pledge which we gave.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us see what Section 5 says.  Section 5 states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A guarantee of the Minister for Finance, given under Section 9 of the Act of 1954, for the due repayment of moneys borrowed by the board under Section 4 of that Act may extend also to the payment of interest on such moneys.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is there to prevent another Attorney-General in another Coalition <Col N="919" /> Government coming in here and making the same sort of speech as has been made here to-night by the present Attorney-General in relation to the undertaking given by the Government to the E.S.B. in 1945 and, as I said, ratified by legislation of this House in 1945?  What is to prevent another Attorney-General coming in here and saying, as he can say with truth, that the Dáil can nullify the guarantee given under any Electricity Supply Act or, indeed, under any Act of this House in relation to the repayment either of borrowed moneys or of interest upon such moneys?  Nothing whatever.  But would it be in the public interest that he should do so? Would it conduce to the economic stability of this country.  Would it conduce to the prosperity of the country or the development of the country? Of course it would not.  But on the same grounds as the Attorney-General has attempted to defend Section 4 of this Bill another Attorney-General could come in here and say that the Dáil is perfectly at liberty to nullify the guarantee and, because the exigencies of the Government are such, the Government is recommending that the Dáil should nullify its guarantees and dishonour them.</P>
    <P>The Minister, speaking on Section 2 of the Bill, said one of the reasons why he was rushing the Bill through the House was in order to facilitate the E.S.B. in raising from the public the money it needs to finance its constructional programme.  Does anyone think the speech we have just listened to from the Attorney-General will make the public more ready to invest in a loan or an issue of stock by the E.S.B.?  I would say, on the contrary, it is more likely to deter them.  But, in any event, having said what I had to say about the principle of the speech made by the Attorney-General, let us get back now and examine the pledge itself.</P>
    <P>In the beginning it seemed to me as if the Attorney-General was going to devote himself to making an attack on the E.S.B. because the E.S.B. had acted prudently in the manner in which it made its estimates as to the contingencies with which it would have <Col N="920" /> to deal.  He seemed to blame it, on the one hand, because it had built up a special reserve of £1,000,000 to cover contingencies.  I think that was an astonishing line to take.  I do not think that even £1,000,000 is sufficient to cover the contingencies which an undertaking of this sort may have to face.</P>
    <P>He then said they had built up £500,000 as a fuel reserve.  Deputy Lemass has pointed out that, if this year and next year be normal years, the increase in the price of coal and the increase in the price of turf which has taken place in recent months will wipe out or absorb the whole of that £500,000 and it will not be there. Therefore, the Attorney-General will have nothing to criticise the E.S.B. for under that head because there will not be any fuel reserve and the Attorney-General will not be able to level his darts against them on that score.</P>
    <P>A special reserve of £1,000,000 might quite readily disappear and, if I were to outline any of the contingencies for which it might be called upon to cater, I would be told I was making a gloomy speech.  I am not making a gloomy speech.  I am merely saying these men were prudent in building up that reserve.</P>
    <P>Let us come now to the other side. The Attorney-General seemed to blame the E.S.B. because, according to the statement of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the board will have a surplus this year of £900,000; I should not say a surplus in this year but rather in respect of the year 1954-55. It has already been pointed out that a large part of that surplus is hypothecated to meet the obligations of the board in relation to income-tax.  The surplus may, therefore, exist on paper but it is not in fact a disposable surplus of £900,000; it is merely a cash surplus which has accrued as a result of one year's working and against that surplus there are obligations due to a number of people&mdash;due, among others, to the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>The Attorney-General seemed to blame the board because it had a surplus arising in one year, a considerably greater surplus than arose in the preceding year.  He said the board has <Col N="921" /> had a surplus in every year except during the war years.  As a matter of fact the board had a very heavy loss three years ago and a year later it merely broke even.  I think the board's surplus for the year 1952-53 was £995. That was the surplus which the board had in that year and the Attorney-General has come in here and spoken as though the board, year in and year out and every year, had a surplus of £900,000.  It has had one exceptional year in which that surplus has accrued. We do not know whether it will have that surplus next year, or anything like it; but, in any event, what is the Minister proposing to do?</P>
    <P>Normally the board, when it had a surplus, reduced the cost of electricity to the consumer until war broke out in 1939.  It is my recollection that the cost of electricity to the consumer was going down gradually every year up to 1939.  Since the outbreak of war another trend has set in and, so far as one can see, that trend will be an upward trend for a number of years to come.  I will not say whether it will be for one year or for two years.  In the years when the board had a surplus, such surpluses were devoted to reducing the cost of electricity to the consumer.</P>
    <P>What is the House proposing to do now?  The Attorney-General has said the board has a surplus of £900,000. He wants the House to believe that that surplus is entirely disposable and can be devoted to any purpose to which the board wishes to devote it. If it had that surplus for 1954-55 and has a surplus for the current year 1955-56, then the board is inevitably bound to consider under the statute which governs it the giving of a reduction in the cost of electricity to the consumer and would, I think, if it had any reason to believe that the surplus was likely to accrue at the same date year after year, undoubtedly reduce the cost of electricity to the consumer. But it will not be able to do that if we pass Section 4 of this Bill because Section 4 will inevitably for a very considerable number of years indeed impose upon the board the obligation of finding £1,000,000 per year to meet the capital charges on rural electrification <Col N="922" /> schemes and will therefore wipe out any surpluses in the order of £1,000,000, or maybe less, because these surpluses will not exist in the future and what we are really doing here under Section 4 is stopping the board from doing what they were able to do prior to the war&mdash;to use the surpluses accrued for the purposes of reducing the charges to the consumer.</P>

According to the Attorney-General, who was blowing his own trumpet as usual, the <Col N="923" /> position is going to be in four or five years from now that the users of electricity, because of the generous depreciation allowances, will not have to pay any charges.  The lawyer said that but the engineers said that the depreciation allowances were not only not generous but that they were barely adequate and I think the board's engineers are better judges in this matter than any lawyer or any layman and they think that the depreciation allowances are just sufficient to cover the ordinary normal depreciation that occurs in any ordinary machinery.</P>
      <P>The Attorney-General said that, by reason of the very generous depreciation allowances the board puts by, consumers of electricity are going to be in the fortunate position in the next four or five years that the whole system on which the E.S.B. was originally based will have been bought and paid for so that it will cost the consumers nothing in the future.  The Attorney-General knew what he was talking about but the ordinary members of the general public do not.  He was talking about the Shannon scheme, the capital cost of which was between £4,000,000 and £6,000,000.  Go into the capital cost of the board's equipment to-day and you will see the depreciation allowances necessary to cover the depreciation of these capital assets which have increased twelvefold since the board started.  This increase is largely investment in the fuel stations, particularly in the turf-burning stations, and the development of the Erne and other such schemes which have taken place.</P>

Then Deputy MacEntee worked himself into a panic about this surplus being used for a wrong purpose.  Surely any Deputy in the House, after listening to two consecutive speeches of that character, is entitled to inquire which of the two speaks for the Opposition and on which leg either of the two proposes to stand.  Now both legs are pretty groggy, but which leg do you want to stand on in order to carry conviction to your mind?  It would be of benefit to the House if Deputies Lemass and MacEntee would get together and resolve first of all whether there is a surplus and, secondly, if there is a surplus, how best can it be employed and what is its order and magnitude.</P>

      <P>It is quite clear that the Opposition have switched from one kind of argument to another, but all the arguments which they produced last week on the Second Stage of this Bill have completely disappeared.  The argument they produced last week was whether or not this was going to slow down rural electrification.  I killed that argument by saying that from January to June of this year the E.S.B. have completed 52 areas&mdash;that is, 104 areas in 12 months.  One hundred and four areas is the highest figure ever attained, and when Deputy Lemass was in office the figure was 60 areas.  I do not care if Deputy Lemass pins the E.S.B. to an increase in 150 areas; I will be glad; but he is not entitled to bedevil a whole discussion because he is annoyed that the rate of progress is better now than when he was in office. Let us see what the facts are.  I have a report here which I got from the E.S.B. and which says that the second speed-up in the rate of construction was completed in the period under review and that, by the end of January, 40 crews were in the field as compared with 30 in the previous January and 21 in January, 1953.  All that is a clear indication of the number of crews now engaged on rural electrification schemes.  We have 40 now; we had 21 in 1953.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is good business and good progress. These figures have killed the slowing down argument.  To meet the argument that the board has not yet got above 69 per cent. of acceptances, I am saying now that when the board's report is issued this year it will show that the percentage of acceptances for the taking in of electricity under the rural electrification scheme in the 12 months ended March last will have reached 72 per cent., the highest that has ever been reached under that scheme.  One might add to all the gloom and despair in which Deputy Lemass enshrouded himself this evening the fact that he was not able to push the percentage above 69, so that taking the basis of his argument as regards the future one can see that it was built on a sandy and unsustainable foundation because the situation which he thought had not yet been achieved has already been achieved and can be <Col N="926" /> read in black and white in the board's report within the next fortnight.</P>
    <P>Let me come to depreciation.  Deputy Lemass was in office when the board published its report for the year ending 31st March, 1952.  Here is what it said in respect of depreciation:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The problem of provision for renewals of plant was the subject of special examination during the year. The inflated price of new installations demanded a careful survey of the position.  That survey satisfied the board that it is in a position to finance plant renewals as they arise partly owing to the fact that renewals do not normally synchronise and also due to good life experience with plant, resulting partly from high standards of maintenance....  The board has decided as a matter of policy to continue to make provision against renewal costs as long as plant remains in commission.  Previously, it had been intended to provide only over the period during which it had been assumed initially that the plant might be expected to be in productive use.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There you have the board making a statement which clearly indicates that it is making what in its view is an extremely generous provision for renewals. If anybody wanted to go into the accounts of the E.S.B. to make an accountant's provision, I am quite certain that he would find that the provision which had been made was more than generous, more than prudent and more than it was necessary to make on the experience of the board.</P>
    <P>That was 1952.  That is the board's statement of its policy.  That policy has been continued since.  It is because it has been continued since that the board has built up a situation in which its reserves for depreciation and renewals are high, and the lifetime of its machinery is longer than it was initially assumed to be when provision was made for it.  Therefore, the board's position is strong and is on an unassailable financial basis.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEntee this evening tried to spread as much gloom as he could about investment in the board's shares which will be offered to the public.  I am quite satisfied that anyone who can <Col N="927" /> read the two sides of a balance sheet and the board's report will have no hesitation in realising that an investment in the E.S.B. is a first-class investment in an Irish enterprise.</P>
    <P>Let us take the ability of the board to carry what has been described as the burden which we are putting on the board.  I propose to quote in round figures what the board's surpluses have been.  In 1946, the board's surplus was £152,000; in 1947, it was £265,000; in 1948, £102,000; 1949, £240,000; 1950, £262,000; 1951, £546,000; in 1952, £45,000.  In 1953, the first break in a long sequence of surpluses, there was a deficit of £451,000. In 1954, the surplus was £242,000, and in 1955 it was £928,000.  By any process of adding or averaging, is not that clear evidence of the financial stability of the board?</P>
    <P>Let us be clear on this, that we ran into a specially bad year or a specially good year&mdash;it depends on the way you look at it&mdash;through the drought in 1953, and the board lost £451,000. Deputy Lemass looked in wonderment when I suggested that the board could meet a certain deficit out of its contingencies fund.  He looked as if it could not be met in that year.  The board ran into this deficit in 1953, and it liquidated the deficit in 1954 from the contingencies reserve which had been re-established in 1948-49, thus reducing the reserve to £500,000.  When the board ran into this difficulty in 1953, it said: &ldquo;Well, we have got the contingencies reserve and why should we not meet this from it and reduce the contingencies reserve to £500,000?&rdquo; It did that and the contingencies reserve has again gone up to £1,000,000.  The board did that while Deputy Lemass was in office and by standing over the board's report to the Government he clearly indicated that that method of finance had his approval.  I think he was right, but if he was right then he was wrong in arguing the contrary to-day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The E.S.B. has reported to me that the demand for rural electrification is greater than ever.  Every Order Paper of the Dáil is tattooed with questions asking when the scheme is going to be started in this area and in that area.  The board, in a report to me, says that anxiety to obtain a supply was manifested by an increasing number of householders especially in areas where development had been completed for some time.  Many of these people, it says, were reluctant to take supplies but have since come to realise the amenities which a supply of electricity can provide.  The board says that the volume of work handled by the advisory service showed an upward trend, and to cope with a greater number of queries additional staff were recruited.  Farmers, it says, are now showing a growing interest in the use of electric power for machinery, and the board generally feels that everything is bright and cheerful.</P>
      <P>If that is the position, as the board, with their technical competence, see the future, why should the Opposition here try to inject into that halcyon economic picture all the gloom and bleakness that it is being sought to manufacture artificially here this evening? Is not everything clear now&mdash;no cutting down on the rural electrification scheme; instead, it will be accelerated; no increase under this Bill on the rural electric-energy user?</P>

      <P>The E.S.B., standing as a whole, can now carry rural and urban electricity without any demand on the taxpayer to give them a subsidy at a time when they are making a surplus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his opening speech on the Second Reading, Deputy Lemass said that he could understand the principle of regarding the E.S.B. as one unit with two types of activities, balancing these. The only doubt in his mind was what was the best way to do it.  While I can understand speeches made on this Bill for the purpose of political propaganda, <Col N="929" /> I cannot understand it being pushed to such absurd extremes.</P>
    <P>Here is a board, in respect of 80 per cent. of its activity, making a surplus, likely to continue to make a surplus; on the other 20 per cent. of its activity, making what in the past was a loss, what may continue to be a loss even in the future.  Is there anything wrong with saying, instead of going out to beg from the taxpayer to meet the losses on the 20 per cent. of its activity, they should stand up on their own feet in a spirit of self-respect and say: &ldquo;We do not want anything from the taxpayer.  Let the taxpayer keep his money.  He wants it all.  Instead of asking the taxpayer for a cheque, for alms, annually, for the purpose of financing this deficit, we will take the surplus that we have on the 80 per cent. of our activity and as much as we want out of that we will take out to balance the loss on the 20 per cent. of our activity&rdquo;?  That is what the Bill is doing.  Notwithstanding what we have heard from the Opposition Benches, I think that is good economics.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few comments that I want to make on that and it will be an end of the discussion as far as I am concerned.  So far as the rate of progress in the rural electrification network is concerned, I came back to office in 1951 very sceptical of the continuous replies I got to questions put to the then Minister for Industry and Commerce in the Dáil explaining the delay in extending the rate of construction on the ground of scarcity of materials and early after my resumption of office that question was discussed in the E.S.B. and arrangements were made for the placing of orders.  I was particularly concerned to ensure that these orders would be placed with Irish manufacturing firms and that the capacity of these firms would be built up to meet them, to ensure that the scarcity of materials would disappear at an early date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By the beginning of 1953, the board stated that scarcity of materials was no longer a problem except in regard to some minor items and that they had started the process of training the staff necessary to increase the rate of construction <Col N="930" /> of the rural electrification network and by the end of 1953 they stated that they were in a position to construct the network at the rate of 100 areas per annum.  In their published report on the year 1953-54 they stated their intention of constructing the network at that rate.</P>
    <P>The Minister tells us that they are working at that rate now.  I stated my view that their failure to achieve the target which they set themselves last year, the fact that they only completed 75 areas instead of the 100 which they had forecast in their report, was attributable to the financial disorder and strain occasioned by the Government's decision, not then sanctioned by legislation, to withhold the capital grant under legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>You must know that is not correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No other explanation, not even the weather, has been offered to the Dáil and I suggest&mdash;I tried to put in the Minister's mouth the alternative suggestion&mdash;that the bad weather of last year may have had something to do with it.</P>
      <P>However, in so far as I am concerned, the expectation that 100 areas would be completed in 1954 and 1955 was expressed in the provisions of the 1954 Act which provided the board with enough money to carry on the development work at that rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will take the Minister's word for it that in all the areas now connected under the rural electrification scheme there are 72 per cent. of the dwellings connected.  That, I think, is what the Minister said.  The faith of those who were responsible for the framing of that scheme and its submission to the Dáil was that once the benefit of electrical supply was experienced by any number of dwellers in a rural area the great majority would want to get it and the problem, indeed, in the earlier stages of the scheme was the reluctance of a number of rural dwellers to take the supply then, hoping that the board would be able to give it to them a year or two later.  Indeed, many complaints were expressed in the Dáil because the board was reluctant to go back on to areas already developed in <Col N="931" /> order to give supply to those who did not take it when they got the chance, because of the consequential delay in its general development work.</P>
    <P>I am sure that in the course of time we will get the same percentage of acceptances of electrical supply in rural areas as has been secured in other countries.</P>
    <P>I do not disagree with the Minister when he says that the board has made generous provision for the depreciation of its assets.  My argument is that the Minister, in quoting the size of their depreciation fund here in relation to possible loss on the rural electrification scheme, can have no purpose except to mislead the Dáil.  There can be no question of the depreciation fund being reserved for use to offset current deficiency in the rural electrification account.  These reserves are represented by fixed assets&mdash;turbines, generators and power houses.  They are not something equivalent to money in a bank which can be drawn upon to meet losses.</P>
    <P>As regards this alleged deficiency, it is a simple sum in arithmetic to calculate that the present average revenue on fixed charges which the board is getting from areas wired in 1954-55&mdash; the most recent areas wired&mdash;is falling by £2,000 per area, approximately, below the revenue it must get to break level and that, with 400,000 acres yet to be wired, that deficiency in the rural revenue account must amount to £800,000 by the time the scheme is completed.</P>

      <P>I mean 400 areas, at £2,000 an area, that is £800,000 deficiency and, on top of that deficiency, the Minister is putting on the board an obligation to carry a charge of £245,000 per year in respect of interest and sinking fund on moneys that were given to the board as capital grant, which are now being turned into loan liability.  That brings the deficiency on the board's rural revenue account over £1,000,000.  It cannot do anything else.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been no suggestion by the Minister that the board's rural revenue account will not show a deficiency of that dimension.  It must show that deficiency.  But the Minister's argument is that the board has a surplus of £900,000 this year to set against that deficiency.  I can tell you, the board has no such surplus available for that purpose.  Of the £900,000, £300,000 will go in income-tax to start with and of the balance&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that they have no surplus capable of meeting the deficiency which is going to emerge in the rural revenue account.  Of the £900,000 this year, assuming that is continued next year, assuming that next year the board's proceedings are just as profitable, against the £900,000 for next year there will be a £300,000 income-tax liability because of this year's surplus and I pointed out to the Minister, from the most recent board's report available, the board itself attributed the emergence of a surplus of that scale to savings on fuel costs due to bad weather.  Assume normal weather and there must be some reduction in the saving in fuel costs even if there is no increase in the price of fuel.</P>
      <P>It is misleading, therefore, to suggest that there are available anywhere in the E.S.B. resources which will offset the losses which will accrue upon rural electrification&mdash;losses which will be at the £200,000 level this year, double that the following year and which will ultimately amount to £1,000,000 a year.  Under the law as it stands&mdash;the law which the Minister is not proposing to change&mdash;the board have no option but to adjust their scale of charges so as to get revenue which will offset that deficiency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will agree that there would be no justification for an increase in charges this year.  I would have argued, if I had seen the board's report for 1954-55 and if this Bill had not been produced, that the consumers of electricity were entitled to a reduction&mdash;were entitled to the reduction which the Deputies <Col N="933" /> opposite promised them.  It is quite obvious, however, that at some stage the board must get in revenue to offset the growing losses on the rural electrification account and the only place where they can get it is from the consumers. I will admit that there is force in the argument that nowadays <Col N="934" /> the consumer of electricity is almost inseparable from the taxpayer but it is a queer way of benefiting the taxpayer by avoiding an imposition on him and, instead, putting it on the same individual as a consumer of electricity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>When I moved to report progress, I had been making a comparison between the attitudes of both sides of the House to experiments in the development of fisheries and I instanced the persistent barrage of attack that lasted for the three years I was Parliamentary Secretary against the proposal to add three offshore fishing vessels to our fleet.  I remember being told that 100 questions had been prepared for reply by me in the Dáil. I did get a number of them and the answers I gave to them apparently produced a different counsel, in respect of that particular batch of 100 questions, in any event; but the point I really want to make is that there should be a more accommodating attitude particularly in relation to an industry which has had the vicissitudes of the fishing industry for a number of generations.</P>
      <P>I pointed out the attitude of the Fianna Fáil Party to one very large scale and costly experiment which produced a heavy loss.  It began in 1931 and it lasted for about two years and the loss&mdash;on the chartering of these eight cross-Channel vessels&mdash;was £59,000 in round figures.  There was a further chartering of Irish boats which produced a further loss of £21,000, making in all about £80,000.  That experiment was stopped by the Fianna Fáil Government but they stopped it as a result of an examination of its finances, and there was no barrage of opposition or obstruction here in Dáil Éireann in regard to the matter.  That is where I want to join issue on the matter of these three boats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After all, the present Minister for Agriculture indicated that he, too, was going to have an experimental boat of 80 ft. length and there was no one on <Col N="936" /> this side of the House to say him nay. We would have wished him well. He was to operate the boat from Costelloe Bay for the training of potential fishermen in Connemara.  He said here a little more than that, as reported in Volume 151, No. 12, on the 22nd of June:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We formulated a scheme to revive the fishing industry along the Connemara coast, to provide special harbour facilities, to provide boats and, if necessary, to get boats manned by foreign sailors to train young fellows who wanted to equip themselves to go to sea on their own in due course along the Connemara coast.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Where is the essential difference between the idea behind that and what we did?  The only part of this programme outlined here in respect of which I could find any evidence in the Department of Fisheries was the one to get an experimental boat.  There was no question at all about harbours, providing boats, or anything of that sort.  I take it that the boats would come, anyway, in the ordinary course when men were trained.</P>
    <P>On the question of harbours, apparently there are divided counsels on the Government side.  The Minister for Agriculture said he was in favour of them.  In the same volume, in column 1731, the Minister for Finance is reported:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In regard to fisheries, I think that one of the troubles in regard to our fisheries&mdash;and I am not making this as a Party point at all&mdash;is that we have been inclined to dwell on the harbour facilities too much and to dwell too little on the fishery end of the industry.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In the same strain we had the Minister for Local Government, at column 1782 of the same volume:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Harbours have been mentioned in this debate.  I think that far too much time and money was spent on harbours in this country.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He must know that in Donegal there is a considerable interest in harbours, which are a vital necessity now for the type of boat that is being used.  They must remain afloat at all times.  We <Col N="937" /> have now what we did not have in the past, continuous fishing, and even if it were possible to draw up the boats it would not be in the interest of the fishermen to do so.  Whether we like it or not, the provision of harbours will have to go hand in hand with the provision of boats.</P>
    <P>I was referring to the criticism of the off-shore boats and I was also referring, by way of comparison, to experiments of a similar kind.  It is not true to say that the taxpayer has not been willing to provide money for the fishing industry.  We know that under the Revision of Loans Act, 1931, a sum of £70,000 was wiped out.  These were loans due on boats that had been issued over a considerable period and the Government of the day decided that this money could not be recovered and they wiped it out.  That was in 1931.  From that period up to 1938 a round sum of £30,000 of further loans was wiped out.  During that period the British fishing industry was down on its uppers and if they could not make theirs pay at that period I take it that ours was bound to experience somewhat similar adverse circumstances. It is worth noting that between 1939 and 1952 a sum of only £2,000 was wiped out.</P>
    <P>That brings us to a very important consideration in relation to the development of fisheries.  Experience during the 1914-18 war was that any sort of a boat earned money.  The reason was quite obvious: the British fishing fleets had to retire from fishing.  The result was that the reduced fishing made fish more available along our coasts and boats that would not be regarded as seaworthy in the ordinary course were found to be quite profitable.  After that war, the slump set in and by 1927 whatever was in it had disappeared. In 1928 the slump was on and as a result in 1931 a new Act was passed, a new association was set up and a new system of financing the issue of boats was evolved.  That started off with high hopes.  Everyone wished it well, the fishermen were organised, their catches were taken and marketed and appropriations were made against the cost of the boats.</P>
    <P>The period up to the beginning of <Col N="938" /> the Second World War proved somewhat similar to the previous period and the sum that I have mentioned had to be wiped out.  I consider that the wiping out of these loans was fair evidence enough that the Irish taxpayer was prepared to be generous. What I want to say to the Irish taxpayer is that we have evidence now that these slumps will not recur&mdash;there were a few setbacks when the war ended&mdash;in so far as one may form an opinion on it from the returns of the fishing.  When one is trying to assess the value of the fishing, I think it is well to eliminate herrings and mackerel, which are not reliable pointers in any sense.  The class of fishing to study, in my opinion, is that which is called demersal, that is, the ordinary kind of fish which one meets with every day on the market, exclusive of herrings and mackerel. We find that we had something of a peak figure in 1945, 164,000 cwts.  Then there was a tendency to drop, which continued for a number of years.</P>
    <P>It is pleasing to note that the upward trend has set in again.  The drop I have referred to was not anything to worry about; it was a trend, all right, which was a steady downward trend, but it was not great.  The position has righted itself and the takings are on the upward grade again.  That is due, in my opinion, to two causes.  I would say the principal cause is the Control of Imports (No. 2) Order, 1938, which was a major factor, the second one being the provision of larger boats and better equipment.  On that point, I think it is well that these 50 ft. boats which they have now are becoming standard.  I, personally, had a long fight during my membership of the committee of the Sea Fisheries Association to try to bring about a change of counsel in regard to the size of the boats.  I move to report progress.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; the Committee to sit again.</P>

      <P>Deputy Allen gave notice that on the motion for the Adjournment he would raise the subject-matter <Col N="939" /> of Question No. 32 on today's Order Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>To-day I asked the Minister whether a grant from the National Development Fund has been allocated towards the provision of protective works at Rosslare village, County Wexford, and whether the work will commence at an early date.  Some few months ago I put down a somewhat similar question.  On that occasion I addressed it to the Taoiseach but it was answered by the Minister for Local Government.  The Minister for Local Government in his answer a couple of months ago said that when it was determined what State Department might take responsibility for doing this, some progress might be made. The Minister's answer to-day was that a grant out of the National Development Fund was not being allocated towards the provision of protective works at Rosslare village.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether I ought to weary the House and the Minister and, perhaps, I ought to apologise for raising this matter on the Adjournment after such a long day's work.  Nevertheless, I raise the matter because it is an urgent and a serious one for the people who live in Rosslare.  It might also be, in time, very serious for the 13,000 or 14,000 people who live in the town of Wexford.  All the records in regard to coastal erosion during the past 40 or 50 years have indicated that Rosslare is one of the places where there has been considerable erosion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The history of this erosion in Rosslare would seem to indicate that from the time Rosslare pier was erected&mdash;I think it was in 1901 or 1902&mdash;there has been gradual erosion.  Authorities on coastal erosion who have examined this matter are all agreed on that.  There has been gradual erosion over the past 50 years or so.  That was very evident about 1927 or 1928.  Representation was made at that time to the Wexford County Council and they, being good citizens, concerned with the welfare of the people living in their neighbourhood, although having no legal responsibility whatever in respect of coastal erosion, selected some eminent authority <Col N="940" /> from across the water to report to them.</P>
    <P>This eminent authority, Mr. Mobbs, reported that erosion was there and it was a rather serious matter.  He suggested certain protective works that would cost at that time a very considerable amount of money.  The county council at that time, being wise men, asked the Government of the day to deal with the matter and put up the protective works as suggested by Mr. Mobbs.  Subsequently, other engineers, Mr. Waller and Mr. Delap, while they did not actually disagree with Mr. Mobbs in the matter of the protective works, nevertheless, made other suggestions. That was about the year 1930 or 1931.</P>
    <P>The Government of the day did not seem to take any action in the matter then either.  Things drifted on over the years.  The notice of the Government and of the local authority was brought to this progressive erosion, and it was pointed out that in time the village of Rosslare, Rosslare golf links, Rosslare Hotel, a number of churches, halls and private residences housing about 1,000 people, would be endangered.</P>
    <P>We have reached that stage, unfortunately, in the year 1954&mdash;50 years after the start of the erosion, and some authority must now take serious note of the situation.  That is why I am raising this question.  Some months ago, Wexford County Council, as a result of representations made to them, sent urgent messages to the Taoiseach and other Government Ministers and asked them to take some steps to have protective works erected.  As an earnest of goodwill, although we have no legal responsibility&mdash;we are advised by our legal advisers over the past 30 years to that effect, and I thoroughly agree&mdash;we contributed a small sum, about £3,000 a year, over four years, to bring the matter to the urgent attention of the Government.  That is a mere bagatelle in so far as the cost of protective works is concerned.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, we were informed that we had actually no legal authority to spend that money or even to raise it from the ratepayers of Wexford.  I suppose sanction might be got in some other form later on if the Government <Col N="941" /> decided to make a grant out of the National Development Fund or such other funds at their disposal.  The Minister may say: &ldquo;The Fianna Fáil Government were so many years in office and did nothing about it,&rdquo; but I could say to him that the Government which preceded Fianna Fáil did nothing about it.  I believe that the present Government must do something about it.  The situation has reached that stage.</P>
    <P>I spoke to the Minister for Local Government on a number of occasions. A deputation of Wexford Deputies waited on the Taoiseach last February or March in connection with the matter.  The Taoiseach kindly undertook to have it investigated.  He did not commit himself to anything.  He promised an investigation would take place to see if anything could be done. There is no doubt that it is the responsibility of the Government. While successive Governments and State Departments have shirked the issue of taking responsibility for coastal erosion, nevertheless, grants have been made from State funds on a number of occasions for particular works, <i>ex-gratia</i> grants under some head, and employment grants.</P>
    <P>Rosslare is probably the most important place to be affected.  It is a very important tourist centre and it provides a livelihood from tourism, in the main, for, I suppose, 1,000 people. There is a very valuable golf links there and in addition there is a railway that links Rosslare Harbour with Wexford and with Cork and it is in great danger of being cut off.  I think C.I.E. has the main ownership of the railway portion of it and C.I.E. must therefore be seriously concerned with this erosion.  I think I indicated to the Dáil before that the sea was within a few yards of the principal hotel, with nothing between it and the hotel except a loose sandbank.  There are other points at which the sea took away portion of the golf links and three or four storms in the late winter or early spring did more damage than had been done for the last ten years. That is why it became recently urgent that protective works should be erected this summer before the storms of next winter.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="942" /> Under the State Property Act, the Foreshores Act, and, I suppose, under Article 49 of the Constitution, there is not any doubt that the State owns the foreshores along the whole coast.  No one questions that and the State, therefore, has responsibility to the citizens of the nation.  There is not any doubt about that nor is there any doubt that it is the duty of the State to preserve the land from encroachment of the sea by suitable defences. Every citizen has the right to have that protection where his interests are affected by erosion.  I think they have the right actually to demand from the Government of the day that protective works be provided where their interests are affected.</P>
    <P>I raise this question to-night so as to emphasise the urgency of the problem and to ask the Minister to take immediate steps to deal with this situation. The Government are not unaware of this problem because it has been brought to their notice and to the notice of individual Ministers on many occasions.  I want to emphasise that the local authority, that is the County Council of Wexford, are not legally bound in any way and it is quite clear that their resources, financially speaking, do not allow them to deal with this matter.  I think it would be most unfair for the Government to try to put responsibility on the local authority who have only one source of revenue and that is the ratepayers, already overburdened with rates.  The council must give first consideration to their commitments for water schemes and new bridges and so on and these represent substantial commitments inside the next couple of years.</P>
    <P>There is no law which compels local authorities to take responsibility for erosion and I want to say this in all fairness: it has been my experience over the years that every Department of Finance consistently maintained it is the duty of the local authorities to put up protective works where there is erosion.  Why that is so, I do not know, nor do I know why legislation is not passed through this House, by some Minister for Finance, perhaps, putting the responsibility on some particular Department of State.  Each of them <Col N="943" /> will engineer you from one to the other and will tell you that they have no responsibility whatever for it.  It is about time that some Government Department were made responsible for the provision of protective works.</P>
    <P>Local authorities are most unsuitable for this purpose.  Even if they had money or if the State provided money for them I think they would be wrong to undertake the provision of engineering works.  Our engineering staff has no experience of marine works and there are on record many instances of where small efforts were made by inexperienced persons to provide protective works against the sea.  These were washed away almost as soon as they were erected.  It requires experienced engineers to design and plan and know the reactions of any particular works to be erected.</P>
    <P>I do not raise this matter for any publicity purposes, but because of the serious nature of the existing situation and to impress on him that the best engineering advice available to us locally is that if something is not done before the coming winter we may have something happening like what happened on the Shannon last year and the Government, the nation and the Dáil would then be confronted with the serious problem of many of its citizens suffering unduly because, I suppose, of someone's neglect.  I want to ask the Minister to get going on this.</P>
    <P>I believe the National Development Fund is available for such purposes as this, if the Government want to allocate certain moneys.  I do not know why the Minister to-day brought in the county council and the circular sent to them three years ago pointing out that there was money available for certain works that they were responsible for.  The county council has no responsibility for such work as erosion and Wexford County Council, in fact, successive county councils, have decided that they are not prepared to finance or undertake the work at Rosslare.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Sweetman) Gerard Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Sweetman)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Allen, having started off with <Col N="944" /> an apology, turned aside some of the wrath I was about to vent on him because I really think it is a little bit unfair that it should have been dealt with in the way it was dealt with by Deputy Allen at Question Time.  My reply to him then was that this is a very thorny problem which has been considered over a long number of years and is still being considered at the moment.  It is a very thorny problem. It is a problem not merely very thorny in regard to finance, but it is also a problem of such a nature that the technical people are not satisfied about what is the right way of dealing with the matter.</P>
      <P>Let us deal with finances first of all. The Deputy and the House can realise the extent of the financial problem when I say that the Mobbs Report showed that the cost would be somewhere in the region of £340,000 at the then prices, which would be equivalent, approximately, to £1,000,000 now.  In other words, the solution of this problem on the lines of the Mobbs Report would be in or around a total cost of £1,000,000.  That is the roughest estimate, taking a comparative figure for the £340,000 that was the then estimated cost.  That figure of £340,000 was, I think, a fairly firm one at that time.  It was doubtful even whether the scheme that they suggested at that cost was going to be successful technically. I understand that in certain places it has been found that the sowing of bent grass on sandbanks has been far more successful than more solid obstructions to the sea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>That has been done on many occasions by the residents there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>There were other suggestions made of a moving groin and a fixed groin.  A fixed groin was put up there by the golf club in a small way but that was washed away completely, as the Deputy may perhaps be aware.  I only mention all these things to show clearly that not merely is it a difficult question as regards responsibility, a difficult question as regards money, but also a difficult question as regards the best technical method of doing it.  However, I think we would <Col N="945" /> all agree, no matter what method we adopt technically, that perhaps more important than even the execution of the works would be their proper maintenance thereafter.  If works are going to be set up to meet a problem like this and they are not maintained properly afterwards then we will merely have another problem similar to the problem we have in respect of embankments, and, as Deputy Allen, Deputy Esmonde and Deputy O'Leary know, the problem of embankments in Wexford is a very real one.</P>
      <P>I do not think Deputy Allen was quite correct in his summary of the interview that took place between the Taoiseach and the five Deputies from Wexford.  What the Taoiseach agreed to do at that stage&mdash;I have the report of the conference before me&mdash;was to make available any technical advice that the Board of Works might have for the purpose of consultation or otherwise with the county engineer and the Wexford County Council.  The Deputies were quite satisfied with that and that advice was made available.  It was following that that the Wexford County Council suggested that they would be able to put forward a sum of £3,000 a year for a period of four years.  Of course, having regard to the figures I have mentioned already, Deputy Allen correctly describes that amount as a &ldquo;bagatelle&rdquo;.  I must confess that I am not quite clear as to the basis on which Deputy Allen dealt with the question of responsibility.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>

      <P>It might under certain circumstances be bad business. It might be a question of being penny wise and pound foolish.  However, all I wanted to make clear when I quoted the National Development Fund earlier this afternoon was that there are in certain areas foreshore protection works for which the local authority is <Col N="946" /> responsible.  The National Development Fund in 1953 clearly only visualised that type of work.  It did not visualise this type of work as an appropriate commitment for the fund. If this type of work is, therefore, to be considered for the fund, I think I am entitled to say to the Deputy and to the other Wexford Deputies that we do require a little more time to consider the matter than we have been given since the Wexford County Council came back with their reply following the deputation to the Taoiseach.  After all, what that deputation asked was that the Wexford county engineer would come up to the Office of Public Works and get any advice or information that was available there.</P>

      <P>This problem has been there for an extremely long time. I think Deputy Allen was right when he said it started about the beginning of this century.  That is my information, too.  There was a Royal Commission on Coast Erosion in 1911 and an inter-Departmental Committee in 1931.  The inter-Departmental Committee reported to the Government then and the report was considered by the Government over the years.</P>

      <P>I must confess that the Deputy has more knowledge in that respect than I have.  The reports of 1911 and 1931 are the only ones I have before me.  Those reports were there for the Deputy's Party all along the years and again and again the matter was brought up.  The Deputy's Party did nothing about it.  It was even brought up in 1954 and the Deputy's Minister, Deputy Aiken, after the National Development Fund had been set up, made it quite clear he was not prepared at present to make funds available out of the National Development <Col N="948" /> Fund towards the cost of the work in regard to coast erosion.  Not merely before the war, but after that and even since the National Development Fund was instituted, Deputy Allen's Party had the opportunity of dealing with this matter.  I intended to deal with it quite calmly until the Deputy interjected rudely: &ldquo;What are you going to do about it?&rdquo;  I can tell the Deputy that we are going to do a great deal more about this and many other similar problems before we are in office half as long as Deputy Allen's Party was there.</P>
