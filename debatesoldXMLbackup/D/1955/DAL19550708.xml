      <P>In the few minutes I had last night I indicated, in reply to a query made by Deputy Moylan as to whether I was an educationist or not, that I did not know and that from my point of view the question, in fact, did not arise because I was not intruding my ideas or personality into anything&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I hope I know when I see one working.  I am dealing <Col N="460" /> with the position in which we find education, teachers' organisations, the various bodies and the running of them.  From the point of view of being served by outside educationists, I have endeavoured to select a group to act as a centre for suggestion and discussion, out of which I hope to be able to provide an arena inside which educationists can exchange ideas and experiences and in that ordered way I hope to get the full fruit of what the educationists have to give the country.</P>
      <P>I am not intruding any of my purely personal ideas on education into that particular class of work.  I would like to have certain things understood in regard to the Council of Education and what I expect to flow therefrom. Some of the points raised yesterday in regard to the Council of Education questioned why I had not done this or done that or why I had done something else.  I would like to give some idea of what the work of the Council of Education is leading to for the purpose of helping the various people who contributed to the debate yesterday in view of the spirit in which they contributed to it.</P>
      <P>I would like to recall that when the Council of Education was set up and I asked them at their first meeting to report on what the function of the primary school was and what the curriculum in the school ought to be up to the age of 12, I had to draw attention to the fact that a certain survey of the situation had taken place and that there were certain general ideas in the atmosphere with regard to primary education and with regard to the age at which pupils' primary education was finished and that in particular a departmental committee had been set up in March, 1945, and had reported in June, 1947.  As a result, certain suggestions were made, and the report had implications, coming as it did from a departmental committee of the Department of Education, it had implications that anybody examining into the situation should have in their own mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I pointed out in pages 14 and 15 of the publication&mdash;it has not an official number but it is a Stationery Office <Col N="461" /> publication: <i>Terms of Reference and General Regulations</i>, with regard to the Council of Education&mdash;that:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The implications of this report are that</P>
    <P>(1)  particularly in the small schools satisfactory primary instruction is difficult to assure to children beyond the age of 12 years;</P>
    <P>(2)  the curriculum up to 12 requires to be revised with possible differentiation in the case of girls;</P>
    <P>(3)  a completely fresh approach is required to the curriculum from 12 to 14 or 15 or 16 years of age, with a very definite differentiation here between boys and girls;</P>
    <P>(4)  special attention requires to be given to the question as to whether the post-12 instruction considered advisable can normally be given in primary schools; and</P>
    <P>(5)  if so, what steps have to be taken for the provision and/or training of teachers.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Also in the background was the Interim Report received by the Minister for Industry and Commerce from the Commission on Youth Unemployment which was presided over by His Grace The Most Reverend Dr. McQuaid, Archbishop of Dublin.  This report was to the effect that the commission had decided unanimously to recommend that the school leaving age should ultimately be raised to 16 years of age; that as soon as conditions permitted education up to the age of 16 years should be full-time education, in a sense later to be defined by this commission for urban and rural areas; and that immediate steps should be taken, especially in the County Borough of Dublin, to provide accommodation, equipment and teaching staff required to give effect to the foregoing recommendations. In the light of that situation I thought it desirable that the function of the primary school should be stated and that as a start the curriculum to be pursued in primary schools up to the age of 12 should be definitely examined, not with any suggestion that primary education should <Col N="462" /> stop at 12, but so that at any rate up to 12 years of age we would know what was recommended in the primary schools.  We have now got that, and, as indicated in my statement to the Council of Education on the 12th November last, that is being examined. It is only in order to see what they would recommend should happen in the primary schools after 12, or in any other educational institution after 12, and because people would want to know how much was being accomplished, what was being done to meet the suggestions made in this report up to 12&mdash;it is only for that reason that the council is not being asked to pursue its consideration of the position after 12.  There is a separate branch of education, the secondary education arena, which may be regarded as a thing in itself, and while the council is waiting for our examination and our decision as to what would be done with regard to primary schools up to the age of 12, they could effectively and usefully examine this.</P>
    <P>I think it would be useful for all concerned if I read what I said to the Council of Education on that point on the 12th November, 1954, because the fact that I decided to remit to the Council of Education a matter dealing with secondary education was not intended in any way to suggest that secondary education had a priority or a special privilege or was in any way a branch of education that was getting special attention and was being specially recommended by me or the Department.  It is a very vital and very valuable branch of our education and when we look back and see how many of the people who helped to create this State and helped to fill the highest positions in the State as secretaries of Departments, assistant-secretaries of Departments, as the higher officers in the Gardaí, or as higher officers in the Army, derived entirely from the secondary schools of this country, we realise it has an important position in the life of the country. But the real reason that we ask the Council of Education to look into that matter now was that it was somewhat detached from the basis of this report here. <Col N="463" /> I said to the Council of Education in relation to that matter on 12th November, 1954:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;You will not expect me at this early date to be in a position to indicate to you decisions that may be taken on the numerous recommendations you have made.  They cover a very wide field.  They cannot be divorced from other considerations not in themselves essentially of an educational nature. Many matters, including finance, will have to be taken into consideration. I have already made arrangements for the official examination of your recommendations with a view to assessing in every detail the consequences that derive from your report.  I have also submitted your report and the minority recommendations to all the bodies directly concerned with education, ranging from those concerned with our primary schools to those concerned with the universities.  The examination in the Department itself will proceed apace, and those others to whom the report has been submitted have been asked to let me have the result of their examination and their recommendations not later than the 1st April, 1955.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Incidentally, I would like to say that quite a number of reports have been received, but I have been approached by certain important bodies to say that their examination of the report and the recommendations will not be completed in time to let me have the recommendations and their comments on the matter for another two months or so.  I consider that it is not unreasonable, in view of all that is involved in this, that the various bodies outside would have the fullest possible time to examine them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely, when a commission is set up and is sitting to hear evidence, one would expect that normally all interested bodies would avail themselves of the opportunity to give their views and that the implementation of the report would not be held up for another year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="464" />
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is one thing to give views and suggestions to a committee examining a matter so that in that examination they will have every aspect that the various interested parties wish to put in front of them. When the body has had these views presented to them, has fully examined them and has co-ordinated its own mind in regard to them and made its report, in a matter so fundamentally important as education I consider that those who are vitally interested in every process of education and its control should then have a chance of taking the report and its recommendations and sitting down over these as actual positive proposals.  I think the Deputy will agree on consideration that that is a perfectly sound procedure.</P>
      <P>After all, the committee is set up to examine every aspect of the question and gives any person properly concerned with it a chance of representing his views.  When all these views have been considered and when the report is formulated fully and clearly it is desirable and prudent and it is a competent way of approaching the examination of it that when the Department has to proceed to examine the report the Minister and the Department would have the opinion of the various bodies concerned who had submitted important recommendations, and know what they thought of the report.  This would ensure that in the taking of final decisions at Government level it could not be said that any opinion given either before or after the report was published had not been fully considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In matters that affect our educational foundations or educational practices I think that is very important and is an excellent thing to do.  When proposals from the Minister, from the Department or from the Government come up then to be considered every Deputy&mdash; it has been shown how vitally interested Deputies are and how close together in mind and in spirit they are with regard to education&mdash;will have the satisfaction of knowing that anything that is proposed here has been very fully and carefully thought out.  At the <Col N="465" /> same time as we are waiting for these reports the examination of the matter in the Department is fully and systematically going on and there will not be any serious delay in dealing with them, when they come in, in relation to the consideration we are already giving to the matter.</P>
    <P>I then said to the council:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;None of you, having been concerned with the examination that has taken place prior to the formation of your recommendations and the assembly of your report, will consider that this is in any way a long-finger process.  I know that you will appreciate that such a process as this is necessary if we are to get the fullest understanding and therefore the fullest support for doing in every practical way the things that you consider should be done.</P>
    <P>Again, we cannot provide the necessary finances for additional educational services at a more rapid rate than public opinion allows, no matter how meritorious in itself the particular objective for which the expenditure is required.  Nor in gathering the enthusiasm and the effort of all those engaged in education and in encouraging those who benefit by it can we afford to ignore the existence of other viewpoints when confronted with suggestions or proposals for major changes in the curricula.  I am satisfied that the continuing work of the council, however, will have a strong effect on a moulding of favourable public opinion.</P>
    <P>I mentioned to you at your first meeting that your work would in time call for a review in some detail of three main branches of education &mdash;primary, secondary and vocational, and I indicated that a corollary of the remit I then placed before you would be to invite your advice as to the courses to be pursued between 12 and 14 and up to 16, and as to the type of school in which the education should be given.  You yourselves in dealing with the function of the primary school and the curriculum up to 12 felt that it was necessary to look beyond those limits to a further <Col N="466" /> horizon, and you supplied in Chapter XIII a valuable contribution to the examination of the post-12 problem.  You made it clear, however, that your submission in a tentative and non-committal way was intended merely to indicate that the council later on would find it necessary to deal definitely with the subject. The time for such more detailed examination has not yet arrived, since it would clearly be unfair to ask the council to proceed with the planning of the superstructure until it was aware whether the edifice was to be erected on the foundations it had recommended, or otherwise.  We must, therefore, postpone the important question of the pattern of our system beyond the age of 12 until we have reached conclusions on the proposals you have already submitted to us.</P>
    <P>There is, however, one particular area of the educational field, that of secondary education, of which it will probably be generally admitted the limits are largely predetermined irrespective of the pattern which other post-primary education may take.  It is conducted entirely by private enterprise, but there is a close connection between it and the State, in that extensive grants are paid from public funds to secondary schools and teachers, and that for the purpose of earning these grants certain conditions and curricula are specified.  In so far as non-grant-earning students are concerned, secondary schools are, of course, entirely free as to what they shall teach, or how they shall teach it. But in relation to grant-earning students I believe that it would be advisable to examine the existing official programme requirements with a view to ascertaining what modifications, if any, might be desirable.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In the light of those remarks, I then said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I feel, therefore, that I may ask the council to advise as to whether the secondary curriculum as it stands is fully satisfactory in the world of to-day, and whether the State can give an assistance by way of regulation <Col N="467" /> in this regard, while still securing for the schools and their authorities that independence in which they were born and in which they have so successfully and fruitfully worked.</P>
    <P>I hope you will, therefore, appreciate my asking you to consider the following request:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&lsquo;That the Council of Education would advise without prejudice to the consideration of the general pattern for primary and post-primary education as to the curriculum which should be followed in recognised secondary schools as a condition for the payment of grants from State funds to these schools.&rsquo;</P>
    <P>And I feel that you will agree that this is an examination that can usefully and effectively be carried out at the present time while waiting for the examination which must follow the presentation of your recent report.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputies can be assured, therefore, that the examination by the Council of Education into the curriculum of secondary schools that is taking place, is one that can properly and effectively take place while they are waiting for our examination which will be carried out in the light of the representations that have to be made on this report by all the important bodies connected with education in this country.  I hope to have work on that finished by the end of this year.  There are certain financial implications which will arise out of it which may not be entirely resolved by that particular time.  I hope that Deputies understand that we are really proceeding on systematic and effective lines and, when recommendations come to be made with regard to any change in the curriculum or any additions to it, that body will be in a position to consider whether or not they approve of these recommendations in the light of all the facts.</P>
    <P>On the financial side, I agree that education will require the expenditure of still further sums even if only in relation to the provision of extra <Col N="468" /> teachers.  That has been referred to here.  In considering proposals in relation to educational changes which affect finances, if Deputies will look at the statement which is inserted as a preface to the Estimate and compare the figures for 1946-47 with the current year they will see that primary education has gone up from £4,200,000 to £8,100,000; secondary education has gone up from £691,000 to £1,748,000; technical education has gone up from £454,000 to £1,100,000.  These are substantial increases and they will have to be borne out of current revenue; and those figures show clearly that there has been a considerable increase in expenditure from current revenue on educational services within the last eight years.  I am quite sure that further additions will fall to be met and it is, therefore, most desirable that we should know where we are going instead of merely, as it were, blueprinting in such a way that we shall have to retrace our steps again at some future date.</P>
    <P>In connection with secondary education, the question was raised by some Deputies yesterday as to why there were so many failures in English in relation to the pupils presenting themselves for the intermediate and leaving certificate examinations.  There is a complete misunderstanding in regard to that.  If Deputies take the report of the Departmen of Education for 1951-52 and look at pages 98 and 99 they will get the figures there for both boys and girls in connection with the intermediate certificate English papers.  The total percentage of boys that passed in English literature was 95.3 and of girls 95.8; the total percentage that passed in the English language was, boys 100 per cent. and 99.5 per cent. of the girls.  So much for English at the intermediate certificate level.</P>
    <P>If Deputies look at the figures for the leaving certificate examination they will see that of 2,943 boys examined, a total of 1,917 passed on the honours paper.  Obviously then it is the weaker people who take the pass certificate. Deputies will see there that 86.8 passed on the honours paper and 67.8 passed on the pass paper.  Out of 2,358 girls <Col N="469" /> examined the percentage passed was 88.1; 1,800 passed with honours.  Again, therefore, it is the weaker students who take the pass paper and that explains why the percentage on the pass paper, 5.7, is so small; in fact, the percentage of failures out of a total of 2,944 examined was 13.4 in relation to boys and the percentage of failures out of a total of 2,358 girls was 11.9.  As I have said, the percentage that passed on the pass paper represents the weakest of those going forward for examination.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of that which must be taken into consideration; that is, the number of pupils going forward every year for these examinations is increasing.  It is increasing largely because of the practice that has arisen of sending forward children for examination before they have completed the proper period of preparation either for the intermediate or the leaving certificate examination.  The complaint made, therefore, about the failures in English and the treatment of English in the schools arises out of a misreading of the figures shown there.</P>
    <P>In connection with primary education, a number of Deputies raised the question of punishment in the schools. Now I am surprised at Irish journalism opening its pages so freely to the verbal expectorations in relation to certain subjects.  All this agitation is deliberately and maliciously stirred up. I myself have not paid any kind of public attention to this publication that has recently been issued.  I asked the Department to have a look at the stuff that was in it to see if they could identify any of the cases.  It may be possible to identify some of them. When I consider the publication itself and the way in which it has been treated by the only individual who raised this matter in any kind of formal way, namely, one of our Senators, my only feeling is that it is a disgusting proceeding, deliberately and maliciously entered into by people who are not of this country or of its traditions.</P>
    <P>There is an element behind this, an element that derives from our nextdoor neighbour where its parent has endeavoured to trample on certain <Col N="470" /> educational institutions in that country. Happily we have been able to preserve the roots upon which our educational thoughts and inspirations are founded and we have preserved the fabric of the Irish schools system that has arisen as a result of that inspiration. This was just a deliberate attack on the very spirit and foundation of the Irish educational institution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister explain to the House what action is taken by the Department of Education on a report of the beating of children?  I think that would clear up the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall go into that.  I have gone into the matter fully and Deputies will find that very fully stated but I want to say that as far as that publication is concerned it shows on its face to be an attack by people reared in an alien and in a completely un-Irish atmosphere and it is carried on here with the help of the pages of our Irish newspapers. It is an attack on the whole spirit of our educational system and it is an endeavour to attack our educational roots.  I would point out to people who will not see this&mdash;to Deputies who will not see this and who do not want to see it&mdash;one sentence on page 6 of this publication, which says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The dossier of complaints in this booklet, and the numerous other complaints we have received, prove without any doubt that it is the little girl&mdash;the Irish mother of to-morrow &mdash;who is bearing the brunt of our inhuman methods of instilling Christian ideals into our children of to-day.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are asked to believe that the mind or minds who put this stuff together are concerned with Christian ideals and with the instilling of them into our children of to-day.  If the Irish people had not been able to lay the roots of the Irish institutions of to-day which flourish, and the spirit of their primary schools and the spirit of our secondary schools, nobody need be worrying about the Christian ideals that were needed here in Ireland to-day.  We have an educational system that fosters these completely and well, and <Col N="471" /> the roots and the foundation and the spirit of which will not be shifted by any force that may come against it.</P>
    <P>But we find a Senator taking this up and saying he will prove case No. 16 and that there are 33 cases and when that Senator is challenged by the Minister for Education to produce the facts of case No. 16, to produce the facts of the 33 cases he said he had examined, he runs away from it and goes to an Irish newspaper or Irish newspapers and asks the parents to send him in the information.</P>
    <P>He says he has certain information and he walks into an Irish Seanad to make a charge against teachers, managers, and the Ministry on information he says he has and which he does not give.  In the light of the full explanation given there by the Minister for Education as to what takes place, and in the light of a challenge to the Press that it should keep people right with regard to these complaints &mdash;that it tell the people who make the complaints to proceed in the way I have indicated&mdash;the Department of Education suggest that instead of people writing to the papers to make these charges they be told there is a way in which these things can be submitted in a reasonable kind of way, and that they should be submitted in that way first.</P>
    <P>If parents cannot get satisfaction from either the manager or the teacher, the Department or anybody else do not want to cloak any disorders there may be or to stifle any complaints of parents in relation to children.  But why the whole system should be challenged and the atmosphere of our educational life dirtied and befouled with suspicion by a crowd who want to drive out the control of our education, to take the primary schools out of the hands of our clerical managers, both Catholic and Protestant, and why the Press should not tell the people that they should proceed in a normal way instead of allowing the Press to be spattered with such expostulations I do not know.</P>
    <P>I said in the Seanad that if the child is not properly treated in a school the <Col N="472" /> normal natural thing you would expect in ordinary parish life is that the parent would first of all remonstrate with the teacher and if no satisfaction can be achieved that he would go to the manager.  If complaints come to the Department of Education&mdash;and they have come from time to time but certainly not more than one a month&mdash;the procedure of the Department is to tell the parents they should first remonstrate with the teacher and if they do not get satisfaction there go to the manager.  That does not mean that we in the Department wash our hands of it.  The matter would be handed to our inspectors and, if a minor case, the inspector would examine it&mdash;he would discuss the matter with the manager&mdash; and if he found it was a serious matter after consultation with the manager and examination of the teacher, the matter would be inquired into in a formal way; a formal inquiry would be held.</P>
    <P>There would not be more than two of these a year.  The teacher would, in a formal way, have to answer the complaint made against him.  He would have any representation in his defence he wanted and the I.N.T.O. would take a serious interest both on behalf of the teacher and in the interest of the organisation itself.  But there is a systematic and clear way in which these complaints can be dealt with.</P>

      <P>The parent is told what the proper procedure is.  On the general question of punishment I know it is necessary to go fully into this matter as far as the Department of Education is concerned but I should like to draw the attention of the Deputies to a memorandum issued in December, 1946, to all managers and all teachers with regard to the infliction of corporal punishment in national schools.  It read as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Minister for Education desires to bring specially to the notice of managers and teachers the provisions of Rule 96 of the code&mdash;&mdash;quoted below&mdash;including additions, printed in italics, recently made to Sections (1) and (3).</P>
      <P>It has been found necessary to make these additions to the rule in view of cases which have occurred in which pupils have been punished for failure to answer questions correctly or in which punishment has been inflicted on parts of the body other than the open hand.</P>
      <P>Teachers must remember that no member of the staff of a school, other than the principal teacher, should inflict corporal punishment, unless duly authorised by the manager to do so, and all principal teachers and teachers so authorised should constantly bear in mind, and strictly comply with, all the provisions of this rule.</P>
      <P>Teachers are expected to try to understand the pupil's character and temperament, and to ascertain his general circumstances with a view to deciding what is the best curative action to take in a particular case of default or misconduct.  They should always remember that punishment, especially corporal punishment, may have the opposite effect to that which it was intended to produce. Remarks, calculated to lessen the pupil's hope of progress and improvement, should not be made.</P>

    <P>The Minister takes a grave view of cases in which excessive punishment, or punishment in violation of any of the provisions of this rule, is administered, and hopes that teachers by a strict adherence to the letter and spirit of the rule will obviate the <Col N="474" /> necessity for official action of a disciplinary or penal character.</P>
    <P>The principal teacher of a school, with a staff of two or more teachers, shall give this circular to the other member or members of the staff to read in order that they make themselves acquainted with its terms, and fully appreciate the requirements of the rule.  The circular should then be preserved for official use with the school records.</P>
    <P Just="Right">Micheál Breathnach,</P>
    <P Just="Right">Rúnaí.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was issued in December, 1946, and the Rule 96 that is referred to there says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(1)  Corporal punishment should be administered only for grave transgression. In no circumstances should corporal punishment be administered for mere failure at lessons.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Failure at lessons is one of the two things mentioned in the circular of 1946.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(2)  Only the principal teacher, or such other member of the staff as may be duly authorised by the manager for the purpose, should inflict corporal punishment.</P>
    <P>(3)  Only a light cane or rod may be used for the purpose of corporal punishment, which should be inflicted only on the open hand.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It should be inflicted only on the open hand&mdash;that is the second thing that was in the revised circular of 1946.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The boxing of children's ears, the pulling of their hair or similar ill-treatment is absolutely forbidden and will be visited with severe penalties.</P>
    <P>(4)  No teacher should carry about a cane or other instrument of punishment.</P>
    <P>(5)  Frequent recourse to corporal punishment will be considered by the Minister as indicating bad tone and ineffective discipline.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As I say, the two things that were specially put in at that particular time were the reference to the fact that corporal punishment should not be administered for mere failure at lessons <Col N="475" /> and that corporal punishment should be inflicted only on the open hand.</P>
    <P>Again, I want to say how all this particular class of thing could be going on without any particular member of the Seanad or any particular member of the Dáil drawing attention to any serious case, I do not know.  I would ask the members of the Dáil, as I have asked members of the Seanad, if any cases come to their notice of the inordinate infliction of punishment on school children, will they encourage the parents to remonstrate with the teacher or to report the matter to the manager and, if the matter is not satisfactorily settled at that parochial level, then the Department of Education will investigate the matter fully.</P>
    <P>But we do not accept it that we have to be pushed from outside to look after the spirit in which Irish education is administered and I would ask Deputies, as I have asked Senators, to turn in a couple of times a year to a school here or a school there and absorb the atmosphere of our Irish primary schools.  They will find there something to encourage them.  They will find there something even to exercise their minds of some of the complaints they have with regard to the alleged ill-treatment of children by teaching them Irish or pushing Irish down their throats.  They will learn something of what truth there is in the complaint that Irish has been used as a language of instruction to the detriment of children where the children are not able to absorb that instruction.</P>
    <P>I was particularly glad to hear how effectively and simply Deputy Cunningham dealt with that aspect of the ill-treatment of children or even the advancement of Irish, yesterday, because there are people who will pick up the suggestions and the criticism about Irish in the school and the effect of Irish in the school which are distributed by people who are somewhat akin to the people who make complaints about punishment in the schools, who pick up these things and pass on their complaints and create a kind of general feeling with regard to schools.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="476" /> It is very, very important that, where there is any aspect of our school life that is affecting injuriously either education itself or the well-being and happiness of the children and the attitude of the children to their school and their school work, that any person who has any feeling like that in his mind, would pay an odd visit to a school and get the atmosphere there, get the spirit of the children, get the understanding of the way in which the children are doing their work and get the spirit of the teachers also.  An odd visit to an Irish school&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I am able to hear an official of the Department of Education attending an international conference in Europe say that in one of these conferences, that are intended to uplift and improve the whole world, an Englishman is able to say, having been through some of our country: &ldquo;If Ireland was an important country, you would be filling the headlines of the world for your schools, but, of course, you are not.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>They have not been built because the machinery for building the schools has not been set in operation and I have done something within the last few months to try to improve that machinery.  I have made arrangements that, if architects are available, at any rate, the Civil Service Commission and the machinery for appointing architects through the Civil Service Commission will not stand between the architects that are available and the work of building schools and that the Board of Works will be able, through its own direct machinery, to advertise for architects and to accept and appoint architects that are available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A very considerable amount of time has been lost by going a very long way around in the appointment of architects to deal with the school side of things.  On the Department of Education side of things, within the last two or three years, there has been a considerable improvement in the organisation for dealing with school matters.  Unfortunately, while the desire was as great in the Office of Public Works and the money was made <Col N="478" /> available there, through the Department of Finance, the architects were not got because, in one way or another, they were going the long way around for them and, having spotted a man here and telling him about nine months afterwards that he was appointed, you would be told: &ldquo;I am on another job now.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>There may be cases in which there is neglect and there are cases in which you would like to see things done more quickly. However, when I see the amount of money which is provided from the Department of Education for the actual building and then when I see the delay that has taken place because of lack of architects I do not think I should be asked to blame any manager.  While there may be managers who deserve to be blamed, we must bear in mind the fact that managers have their own responsibilities and their own difficulties. They are going through a period in which costs have risen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel that, just as the State is in a difficult financial position in respect of the cost of schools and the cost of buildings and has to do a lot of work now while money is very dear, when we see the expansion that has taken place in some of our cities and the amount of money that has been put <Col N="479" /> into churches and other ecclesiastical establishments, the ecclesiastical authorities are in a very difficult position in regard to money.  I agree with Deputy Desmond in that I should like to see a little more local effort, a little more local cohesion and local interest. I think we can be much more effective at this stage by fostering and encouraging people to get over their difficulties than by blaming them, whether they be teachers or managers or anybody else. I appreciate the spirit in which Deputy Moylan is pushing this matter.  We are all travelling in the same spirit and on the same road.  I think that, gradually, it is being better appreciated what a bad school means to an area and what a good school, on the contrary, means.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what the Deputy is getting at.  The fact is that the money is being provided. Undoubtedly a very considerable amount of work remains to be done.  I am not lying down under arrears.  I am doing the best I can to provide machinery to enable these schools to be built and I am doing the best I can to prevent arrears arising in the way in which they have arisen in relation to allocations of previous years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="480" /> Questions have arisen with regard to the supply of teachers.  Arrangements have recently been made which will provide ten additional men teachers a year and 100 additional women teachers a year.  Some Deputies may regard that as a small contribution.  It is.  It is not as large as I should like to see it.  However, it is a means of getting 100 additional women teachers per annum in the future and an additional ten men teachers per annum.  Certain proposals are under consideration whereby it may be possible to add to these numbers but if anything substantial is to be done with regard to the recommendations of the Council of Education on the subject of the size of classes it will have a radical effect on the number of additional teachers that may be required every year.  However, anything that may require to be done in the way of additions to the present arrangement of 100 women teachers per annum and ten men teachers per annum will have to be deferred until the end of the year when we can see what we can recommend and what we can do financially in respect of that aspect of the recommendations of the Council of Education on the subject of smaller classes.</P>
    <P>The size of the classes in Dublin City has been a source of anxiety over a long period.  Many complaints have been made to me in the matter.  I looked into the question from the ministerial side.  I found that, to some extent, this is a question of buildings as well as of teachers.  I appreciate the difficulty in Dublin with regard to large classes and I am very anxious about it.  We shall only have to see what we can do about it.  Until we reach the end of the year and see where our decisions on the Report of the Council of Education are leading us, as far as the actual provision for the additional output of teachers is concerned, there is nothing I can say.</P>
    <P>On the matter of heating and cleaning, I appreciate what Deputy Desmond had to say in this connection. Undoubtedly, there are certain things with regard to schools which can only be done locally.  I have had representations from the Catholic managers: I understand some of the other managers are concerned in the matter too.  However, <Col N="481" /> I had a communication from the Catholic Managers' Association and the I.N.T.O. on the subject of cleaning and certain aspects of maintenance. These matters are having my attention.</P>
    <P>I come now to the question of scholarships.  I appreciate the necessity for additional scholarships which would enable brilliant pupils at primary schools to advance to secondary school education or continuation school education. That is a matter which, as it stands at present, must continue to be left to the local authority.  The cost of education rests comparatively lightly on local authorities as the greater part of the cost is borne by the State.  When it comes to the provision of scholarships for primary pupils to the secondary or vocational schools, it is a matter the cost of which falls on the local authorities.  With the growing interest in education, I would hope that some of the county councils would show an active interest in the matter and would examine the situation, with a view to seeing whether or not they would be prepared to make a greater contribution to assisting children to advance from the primary school to post-primary education.  It is a matter, however, which, I would strongly urge, must be left a local matter.</P>
    <P>The question of Irish generally has been raised in the Council of Education report and the question of oral Irish particularly.  I think everybody is agreed that, in the extension of the Irish language, in the use of it in the schools and in getting a greater grip on the language, it is the oral, language you want, and you are not going to have any highly developed appreciation of the language as a living or a developed language, unless you get the oral foundation, where the language piles itself up in the person himself, not only as a dictionary matter but as a literature, and if the language is retained to us, with the musical perfection and linguistic delight which it has, it has been preserved without books and in the out of the way places by ordinary people.  It was not the look of the language in books or the stories in books that captivated the Pearses, the MacSwineys and the Ashes of the past.  It was the <Col N="482" /> language as spoken in the lives of people in the out of the way places, so that there is no conflict anywhere with regard to insistence on the oral language.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond raised a question with regard to some girl who got 72nd place in the examination for a preparatory college, where there were 72 places, and he objected to somebody from an Irish speaking district being given a place over her.  The position with regard to preparatory colleges is that those who reach the stage of 85 per cent. in their oral Irish, whether they come from the Gaeltacht or elsewhere, get a preference to this extent, that they must qualify in the general examination and then 50 per cent. of the places are given to those who have got 85 per cent. in oral Irish, and 25 per cent. of those places must go to girls coming from the Gaeltacht and 25 per cent. to those coming from elsewhere. It may happen that a girl may get 72nd place in the general order of merit, but if No. 75, having been fully qualified, gets 85 per cent. in oral Irish, whether she comes from an Irish speaking district or not, if the 50 per cent. for people with 85 per cent. oral Irish have not been used up, No. 75 is called on the qualification of oral Irish as against No. 72.  There could be a comparatively small difference between the general qualifications of a person so called and the person who fails to be called, but that preference given to oral Irish, whether the people come from the Gaeltacht or not, is a preference that has, after very careful consideration, been enshrined in the procedure for filling vacancies in the preparatory colleges.</P>
    <P>The preparatory colleges were complained of and the system under which children are brought in at an early age and undertake to be teachers, even though they are only going through their secondary education programme. I admit that there may be a certain amount of narrowing in that, but until there is some other way of giving children in the primary schools in Irish-speaking districts some chance of a secondary education, we are serving two purposes by catering for them through the preparatory colleges.  We <Col N="483" /> are securing that we will have a certain number of our teachers coming from the class that have retained the living Irish language, with all its speaking tradition, directly connected back with the past, on the one hand, and we are giving some of these children the chance of a secondary education, and entrance into a profession which they would not otherwise have, on the other.</P>
    <P>If there were some other way of securing a secondary education for children in primary schools in the Irish-speaking districts, an education that would open for them the road to other professions, I would be prepared carefully to consider what the effect on the teaching profession would be of reducing the preference given in the preparatory colleges to people from the Irish-speaking districts, and I would be prepared to consider whether the objection taken to the narrowness of the society in the preparatory colleges could not be obviated in some way or another; but the fact is that, outside the secondary school in Spiddal, which caters for a small area in the West and which caters, so far as day pupils are concerned, only for the immediate neighbourhood and outside Dingle, which caters only for the Corca Dhuibhne area&mdash;with no place in the Gaeltacht in Donegal &mdash; the children from these areas are without the normal opportunity which we might expect they would be given to get a secondary school education, and I should be very grateful if, among those who normally provide secondary education in the country, there would be a move to co-operate with the Department to see that some facilities were given in the purely Irish-speaking districts.</P>
    <P>The question of the backward child has been raised and while there are a number of institutions dealing with the special cases of defective children, of children who are defective in many ways, and while there are additions being gradually made to those institutions, it is true that no special preparation is made for the backward child.  The matter was being considered a few years ago and there was <Col N="484" /> a very definite difference of opinion in certain circles as to whether the backward child ought to be divorced, except in special circumstances, from the normal children with whom that child would associate at home and whether removing the backward child from contact with ordinary school life and the children of ordinary school life would not be a greater set-back to him than any special benefit that might flow from it.  It is a matter, however, which, like others, is continually in the front of the minds of the authorities in the Department and the fact that nothing has been done does not mean that it is being neglected.  The matter is being very carefully thought over.</P>
    <P>There are quite a number of plans for the building of additional vocational schools throughout the country. There is a very definite capital commitment with regard to these schools and every possible care and consideration is being given to ensure that the work is allowed to go ahead in a normal and reasonable way.  There is no question of there being a regulation that the Department of Finance allows only one vocational school to be built in any particular county in one year.  The vocational committees are alive enough to enter into discussions at the highest levels if they feel there is any unnecessary hold-up in their work.</P>

      <P>On the question of individual schools, the scheme is quite open for parliamentary question in regard to any particular area.  We might get rid of obscurity better by means of parliamentary question in regard to any particular area than by this kind of discussion here.  I want to assure Deputies that beyond the congenital difficulty that a Minister for Education finds with the Department of Finance with regard to money for all kinds of purposes, there is no special regulation interfering with our giving sanction for proceeding with vocational schools.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we are getting away from that.  I hope we will be able to get away from that particular type of irritation on the part of individual Ministers and individual Departments and the people who are depending on them.  I hope we will get away from the petty supervision and interference on detailed financial matters.  I am full of hope with regard to that.  In the meantime, I would not like Deputies to tie themselves up in their minds and feel that either they themselves or committees throughout the country were tied up by more straps than they are tied up. The general facts of nature and of finance will delay things sufficiently, without misunderstanding and ill-feeling creating greater difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of the building of vocational schools, like the question of doing other things on the capital side, must be fitted in to the general capital programme.  You have a general sum and you know you may not go beyond this in making an allocation for primary schools, or in making an allocation for vocational schools, and so on.  It is not a hard and fast line, but certain limits have to be drawn and we have to work inside those limits.  I would like to approach this on the basis that our limits were not <Col N="487" /> fixed with regard to one particular year, that you have a programme extending over four or five years and you knew you were going to keep inside a certain reasonable capital programme for a limited number of years in regard to either primary or vocational schools.</P>
    <P>I would be a lot happier and I think other people might be more satisfied if the individual cases were dealt with rather than discuss a general principle, but all I can say on general principle is that the capital allocations for vocational schools have to fit in with the capital allocation for lots of other things in the programme and there is no special tie up on vocational schools.</P>
    <P>On the general question of capital expenditure, I know that there have been ideas for the extension of the National Library and the National Gallery.  While these are of considerable importance, we have not been able to get down to seeing what should be done regarding them, having regard to the interest they represent and our general capital programme.</P>

      <P>The Minister says that the question of maintenance is being discussed at present.  I asked a question&mdash;it may not be convenient to answer it in full&mdash;with regard to the obligation which rests on managers for the maintenance of the schools.  Is he satisfied that the position is sufficiently clear and definite and that managers understand and that in the legal documents which have to be filled regarding trusteeship for new <Col N="488" /> schools it is set out clearly and definitely what the obligations of managers are in regard to maintenance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister say if any effort could be made to make somebody responsible for the maintenance of schools, particularly in rural districts?  As I said last night, some of those built quite recently are in a shocking condition, the furniture has been badly broken, the windows smashed and the paintwork is in a disgraceful condition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had no representations made to me on that particular matter.  If there were any representations made, I would be very glad to go into them.  But the responsibility for the maintenance of schools is a responsibility that must rest on the local manager.  As I am questioned in regard to that, I should like to refer to the point that was raised about the insanitary condition of some of the schools and of water supplies to them.  In every case, where it is possible to get a water supply by means of a well or a pump, the Department has arranged that a water supply will be available for the schools so that there can be flush lavatories.  Where a well is not available, it has been suggested that roof water should be collected in a way that would serve for flushing purposes. There are limitations as to what roof water can do in that regard so that where you have not a supply of water effectively to deal with that problem you are only looking for worse trouble than you have at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Except, as has been pointed out, that it is extraordinary, when we have grants for farmhouses and the extension of water supplies in rural areas on such a large scale, if more cannot be done by the local authorities to help the manager.  Perhaps the Minister could use his good offices with the Minister for Local Government to get the manager to assist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="489" />
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I know managers who have to send a water-barrel three or four miles away to a pump every week in order to get their own drinking supplies.  I know that the county council in the neighbourhood is in very serious difficulties with the Minister for Local Government, and I am sure with its bankers, with regard to the very extensive water schemes that have been planned for the whole county.  Hence, there is no necessity, as far as I can see, why the Minister for Education should be flitting around to the local authorities in regard to this, in view of the fact that there are so many members of county councils actively interested in local affairs.  If there is any way in which, by advice or exhortation in any particular case, the Minister for Education can assist in that particular matter, he will be glad to do it.</P>
      <P>But, again, just like putting the complete responsibility for the maintenance of the school fabric on the manager, I think that if we put a little more complete responsibility on the local representatives and on the local bodies, and were to keep out of their way, we might get a little more done, because there is a very general desire amongst local people to see that their schools are kept in proper condition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government have given very careful consideration to the representations made in regard to the granting of further payments in respect of lump sum to teachers who retired prior to the 1st January, 1950. The principle has not been conceded, and cannot be conceded, that revisions in superannuation conditions introduced for serving teachers should be applicable to those who had already retired.  In these circumstances the Government are satisfied that the provision in the National Teachers' Superannuation (Amendment) Scheme, 1953, for the payment of an <i>ex-gratia</i> lump sum to teachers who had retired before 1st January, 1950, must be regarded as the maximum concession which they <Col N="490" /> are prepared to make.  It is regretted that no further extension can, in the circumstances, be given.</P>
      <P>When, in 1950, I succeeded in planning the present superannuation and gratuity scheme, that question necessarily arose, and it was not possible for the Government of that time to concede the principle that revisions, which were going to affect the future, could be projected into the past.  The last Government was able to go a little further than that and to give a gratuity of a fair kind.  The matter has been fully considered by the present Government and they are not able to concede a principle which, if it were conceded, would have to be conceded in many more cases than the present one.  It might also have, with regard to precedents, repercussions that might prevent things being done for the future.  At any rate when the present-day conditions were introduced that question was fully discussed as to whether the new conditions could be applied to people who had already gone on pension, and it was decided that it could not.  That has been reviewed in the light of present conditions and the position is still the same.</P>

      <P>In the course of the debate, I raised a question about a number of craftsmen who received a two years' training as special teachers of woodwork.  I have no certainty of this, but I have heard that these teachers are now not to be employed. I think that would be a breach of contract and a bad thing, educationally, if they were not to be employed after they had been taken from their work as skilled craftsmen to be trained for teaching.  I think there was a contract established there between the Minister and the Department and these men.</P>

      <P>The Deputy has heard something about these men, but I have not.  I explained last night that in 1953, 19 students were taken for training in Adhmadóireacht and 20 for a course of training in Fairgneolaíocht Tuaithe.  They were to finish in 1955. Last year, 20 were taken on for a course in Adhmadóireacht and 20 others for a course in Fairgneolaíocht Tuaithe.  It is proposed, in the current <Col N="491" /> year, that 20 will be taken for a course in Adhmadóireacht to finish in 1957. There has been a very considerable lack of woodwork teachers.  The Deputy, when Minister for Education, and myself continued to try and make up the deficiency that was there.  There are ample demands from throughout the country for these teachers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Donnellan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to follow the practice of previous years by taking Votes 8 and 9 together. Vote 8 bears the salaries and expenses of the administrative executive and technical staffs of the Office of Public Works which is the office responsible for the administration of Vote 9.  Vote 9 provides the necessary funds for the purchase of sites and buildings for State purposes, for the erection, maintenance and furnishing of Government offices and other State-owned premises; for the erection and improvement of national schools; for the erection of major military buildings; for arterial drainage and other engineering works; for the maintenance of State-owned parks and State harbours and for a number of other activities. <Col N="495" /> The net Estimate for Vote 8 shows an increase of £14,200 on the Estimate for 1954-55.  This is practically all accounted for by an increase of £7,800 in salaries and a decrease of £6,500 in receipts.</P>
      <P>The increase under salaries, wages and allowances is attributable, partly to normal incremental increases and partly to new staff.  A total of 67 additional heads of staff is provided for in the present Estimate.  Of these about half are for the architectural branch and the remainder is for the secretary's branch and messenger staff.  The increased architectural staff is required in order to cope with additional school and other building and improvement works.  The need for additional staff in the secretary's branch arises from a general expansion of the activities of the office.  The total numerical strength of the engineering branch remains unchanged at 179 heads.  There is a net decrease in receipts of £6,500 chiefly in respect of diminished recoupment from the Vote for Agriculture.</P>
      <P>The Estimate of £3,893,410 for Public Works and Buildings for this year shows a net decrease of £753,590 on the previous year.</P>
      <P>Turning to the principal sub-heads, proposals under sub-head A for anticipated property purchases are substantially less than those of last year which included the purchase of Aras Brugha and the acquisition of new premises for the Paris Embassy.  The net reduction is £410,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Details of sub-head B&mdash;New Works, Alterations and Additions&mdash;are contained in the statement which has been circulated to Deputies.  The provisions proposed are the estimated requirements for the current year for works actually in progress or in immediate prospect and the total provision shows a reduction of £270,000 on the amount voted last year.  The largest item in the sub-head, viz., £1,350,000 for grants for the building and improvement of national schools is the same as last year.  Owing mainly to weather conditions, which were unfavourable for building operations over a considerable period during the financial year 1954-55, <Col N="496" /> we did not succeed in spending our full allocation for schools; we expended only £1,050,000.  I hope conditions will be better this year and that our anticipated expenditure will be realised.</P>
    <P>Sub-head C&mdash;Maintenance and Supplies&mdash;will require an additional £4,000 this year.  Sub-head D (1)&mdash;Furniture, Fittings and Utensils&mdash;shows a decrease of £3,000 on last year's provision, which included some exceptional requirements.  Sub-head D (2)&mdash;Central Furniture Stores&mdash;is unchanged. An increase of £2,000 on sub-head E &mdash;Rents, Rates, etc.&mdash;is due mainly to adjustments in rental terms or accommodation.</P>
    <P>The supplying of machine-won in lieu of hand-won turf for certain areas in the provinces where hand-won turf is difficult to obtain, requires an increase of £5,000 under sub-head F&mdash;Fuel, Light, Water, Cleaning, etc.&mdash;while its use for establishments in Dublin will effect a reduction in sub-head F (2)&mdash; Reserve Fuel Stocks&mdash;by obviating, in large part, the need for keeping a reserve stock.</P>
    <P>Expenditure in connection with arterial drainage work is provided for under sub-heads J (1) to J (5).  Survey work, which comes under sub-head J (1), is the subject of a reduced provision this year by reason of the diversion of staff to design and construction work.  The field work on the rivers Moy, Inny and Maine, which has been in progress for some time now, gives place to design work for those catchments.</P>
    <P>Expenditure on arterial drainage construction work, which is chargeable to sub-head J (2), will be greater than last year.  The Brosna scheme is just finished and the Glyde and Dee scheme will have reached an advanced stage in 1955-56.  Reductions in the provisions for both of these schemes will partly offset the increased provisions required for the Corrib-Clare catchment and the Feale drainage scheme, which will be in full progress, and for the Nenagh scheme, which is in its early stage. The Corrib-Clare scheme will employ labour and machinery on a larger scale than has been required to date.  The net increase in the sub-head as a whole is £39,000.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="497" /> Work on the River Fergus drainage scheme is completed and the provision under sub-head J (4) for 1955-56 is intended to meet any unsettled claims for compensation and also to defray the balance of the contribution towards the cost of acquisition of lands.</P>
    <P>The maintenance of arterial drainage works which is provided for under sub-head J (5) is increased by the amount shown, £9,500, in anticipation of maintenance charges in respect of the Brosna catchment drainage scheme arising early in 1955-56.  A provision was made last year under this head in the expectation that maintenance charges on the Brosna might arise towards the end of that year.  The construction works were not, however, completed as early as was estimated at the time, and as maintenance charges do not commence until the statutory requirements in regard to the issue by the Minister for Finance of a formal certificate of completion have been fulfilled, no part of the sum voted last year was in fact required.</P>
    <P>The decrease of £90,000 under sub-head K&mdash;Purchase and Maintenance of Engineering Plant and Machinery, and Stores&mdash;is mainly in the provisions for the purchase of engineering plant and machinery and workshop plant and equipment, and is possible because the immediate needs of the two latter categories have been largely met.</P>
    <P>The services rendered to other Departments from sub-head K now include services for the Forestry Division of the Department of Lands. This is reflected in the increase in estimated receipts under sub-head L&mdash; Appropriations-in-Aid.</P>

      <P>Votes 8 and 9 are being discussed together and at the end of the discussion if Deputy Beegan wishes he may move to refer back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no comments to make on Vote 8 as it relates entirely to staff and salaries.  I am moving that Vote 9 be referred back in order to focus the attention of the Dáil on the importance of the Office of Public Works and Buildings in respect of its functions and responsibilities.  The Estimate that has been presented under <Col N="498" /> the heading of Vote 9 is almost £4,000,000 and the spending of a big share of that money and its apportionment is the direct responsibility of the Office of Public Works.  The expenditure of the remainder is carried out by the Office of Public Works as agents for various other Departments of State.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance is, to all intents and purposes, the political head of that section of the Department of Finance known as public works, and his duties and responsibilities are generally regarded as being almost equal in importance to many of the Minister's in the particular Government of the day.  It is his business, his duty and obligation, to see that the administration of the work assigned to him in that sphere is conducted in a most impartial manner.  I regret very much that I cannot compliment the Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;and this is not anything personal to him, because I would prefer to have him there than any other member of the Coalition&mdash;on that score, because the administration of the Office of Public Works was never intended, in my opinion, to be an instrument of political propaganda for any Government.</P>
      <P>The late Mr. Hugo Flinn took over the Office of Public Works in 1932 when he was appointed Parliamentary Secretary by the then Government, and I think it has to be conceded by all Parties in this House that he transformed that office from a bed of recumbency to one of live activity in the interests of this nation and that he saw to it that the activities of that office were utilised to the fullest extent for the reconstruction of this country on a national basis and without any political bias whatever. During his period in office, it continued in the main on non-political lines.  He did very useful work in the reorganisation of that office.  He gave credit where credit was due.  Where he found that there were people who had reached, perhaps, an age where their usefulness was no longer up to the standard required, he dealt with them fairly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret that the present occupant of the post has not continued on similar <Col N="499" /> lines.  Since he took office in 1948 and from then until 1951 the Office of Public Works was used almost exclusively as a propaganda agency for the Coalition Government.  It has resumed similar activities since he came back to office in 1954.  I hope to be able to adduce proof of every statement I am making here now.  I make and build my statements on fact and on fact only.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has mentioned arterial drainage.  Arterial drainage was a big national problem, and is a big national problem to be dealt with in a broadminded national way.  Arterial drainage was selected by the Parliamentary Secretary and by the Coalition Government as the flagship of the Coalition propaganda navy and has been used as such since 1948.  The Parliamentary Secretary was given a free hand as first admiral of that navy to lead a campaign of piracy against Fianna Fáil and Fianna Fáil policy.  What did we have in 1948?  One of the first feats of activity of the Coalition Government was to have a big ceremonial display down at a place known as Moystown on the Brosna where we had, in the light of full publicity in the newspapers, the spectacle of no less a person than the Taoiseach himself coming down to blow a whistle to start the operations on the Brosna.</P>
    <P>The drainage of the Brosna was brought about by virtue of an Act passed in this House, the 1945 Arterial Drainage Act.  In my opinion there was no need for an opening ceremony on any such occasion.  What I would prefer would be a closing ceremony when the work would have been completed rather than have that kind of a ceremony.  In 1950 we had a similar performance on the Glyde and Dee, another drainage catchment area where all the preliminary work had been carried out during the term of office of Fianna Fáil and was being started by virtue of law enacted here and agreed to almost unanimously by every Party.  Then in May, 1951, a few days before a general election, machinery was sent down to the Feale.</P>
    <P>There was no official opening ceremony <Col N="500" /> there but the machinery was sent down several months before that scheme was due to start in the normal way.  No provision had been made for the recruitment of labour.  The labour exchange was not availed of in order to get labour in a proper manner.  Certain persons in Listowel and around there were asked whom they would recommend as suitable people for employment on that scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a change from the Fianna Fáil clubs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will talk about the Fianna Fáil clubs a lot if Deputy Tully draws me out on it.  That was the position, a departure altogether from the normal procedure.  Why all this ceremonial buffoonery?  What purpose did it serve?  What purpose was it intended to serve?  It had one purpose and one only and that was to try to impress the people that nobody save Clann na Talmhan and some of the other elements in the Coalition was interested in the national drainage problem of this country.</P>
      <P>What are the facts relating to the whole problem of arterial drainage? In 1938, as is well known, the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Seán MacEntee, set up a commission to inquire into the whole drainage problem. Drainage had been a live issue for a very long period of years, I could almost say centuries.  It had been dealt with in a piecemeal fashion.  A Bill was introduced in this House in 1924 which was known as the Drainage Restoration Act.  Another Bill was introduced in 1925 to deal with the problem of arterial drainage.  The 1924 Act dealt only with existing drainage districts and the central Government was prepared to give a certain grant towards the carrying out of that work.  The county councils and the riparian owners on the rivers within the drainage districts were also called upon to make their contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Both Acts were found to be a failure. They did not work and as a result of that experience and knowing that it was a very complex problem, the Minister for Finance in the Fianna Fáil Government set up a commission to inquire into the whole problem, to hear <Col N="501" /> evidence from all interested people, whether they were members of the agricultural community, the county councils or people with fishing and various other rights.  I have here the report of that commission and I also have the terms of reference which I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to place on record in this House to refresh the memories of Deputies and all others interested in this problem.</P>
    <P>Here is the warrant of appointment with the terms of reference:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I, Seán MacEntee, Minister for Finance, hereby appoint a commission to consider the whole question of land drainage excluding field drainage with special reference to the technical, administrative, financial and legal aspects of the problem and to submit recommendations as to:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  How an efficient system of drainage reasonably consonant with requirements and calculated to facilitate future land reclamation can best be secured.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>From that term of reference I think it is clearly demonstrated that Fianna Fáil had land reclamation in mind, land reclamation carried out in a proper way.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(2)  The provision which should be made for the proper maintenance of existing and future drainage works.</P>
    <P>That is a term of reference to which I would like to draw the attention of the House.  Under the 1924 and 1925 Acts, it was incumbent on the county councils to maintain the rivers.  It was up to them to include in their annual estimate a sufficient sum for maintenance, but in addition to that the county council had the right to collect from the farmers who benefited the amount of the maintenance charge.</P>
    <P>In my county, County Galway, a number of schemes was carried out, both under the 1924 and under the 1925 Acts.  We found that as a result of the assessment placed on many of the benefiting landholders, an agitation started&mdash;and, I believe, an agitation that was justified in the circumstances <Col N="502" /> of the time&mdash;protesting against the huge increase in their rates in respect of the land that was claimed to be benefiting.  We in County Galway did what was a very illegal thing.  We collected the money all right and we sent it to the Board of Works in respect of the Turlough Mor, Dunkellin, Cappagh and a few other drainage schemes. But we did not collect it from the riparian owners.  We collected it&mdash;and we got away with it, I am glad to say &mdash;from the general ratepayers of County Galway, and were it not for that fact, and in the circumstances existing at that time, if we had carried out in the letter and in the spirit the legislation enacted by this House we would have put at least 150 families on the roadside.</P>
    <P>In the light of all that, the Drainage Commission reported that drainage in the first instance was to be a national charge; that, as far as maintenance was concerned, it was to be a county-at-large charge but that the work of maintenance was to be carried out by the Office of Public Works, by the central drainage authority; and that body, in turn, after expending the necessary money, was to be recouped from the funds of the county council or the local authority; or, if there were two, three or four county councils involved the respective liability of each was to be apportioned in a proper way.</P>
    <P>No. 3 of the terms of reference deals with how the cost of drainage works and their maintenance could most equitably be apportioned amongst the various interests concerned; and No. 4 deals with the changes, if any, in the existing law and administrative system which would be necessary to give effect to the recommendations.</P>
    <P>The commission consisted of the following members: D.J. Browne, Esq., chairman&mdash;I understand that he is in the Land Commission and would have a good experience of these matters; C.S. Andrews, Esq., who is managing director, I understand, of Bord na Móna, and Bord na Móna would largely come into the drainage problem; F.B. Barton, Esq.; Wilfred Browne, Esq&mdash;I think he was in the Department of Local Government; J.P. Candy, Esq., who is now, and I do not know but that he was also at that time, the <Col N="503" /> chief engineer of the Office of Public Works; Dennis Coey, Esq.; Seán Collins, Esq.&mdash;he is not the Deputy Seán Collins here but he is the father of Deputy Seán Collins, and had a vast amount of experience and held a very high and reputable position in the Land Commission; Joseph Connolly, Esq.&mdash;he was in this House and was, in fact, a Minister; later he was chairman of the Board of Works; J.E. Hanna, Esq.&mdash;I understand he was from the Department of Finance; Michael Kilroy, Esq.&mdash;he would be from Newport, County Mayo; Ian Bloomer, Esq.; John McCarthy, Esq.; A.H. McClean, Esq.; W.F. Prendergast, Esq.&mdash;I think he was from the Department of Agriculture; Professor F.S. Rishworth, from Galway University; I think he had given a considerable amount of time to the study of drainage and to the engineering problems involved in drainage; Miss Nelly Ryan of Wexford; J.M.B. Stewart, Esq., and Professor H.N. Walsh.</P>
    <P>It might be possible to pick out a few people in that list who were known to be quondam supporters of Fianna Fáil, but I think they would represent a very small percentage of the total number. In the main these people were picked out because of their technical qualifications, their technical experience and their interest in the whole drainage problem.  I do not think there was anything wrong in that.</P>
    <P>That commission notified the general public that they were holding sittings to inquire into the problem of drainage and they invited evidence from any source which would enable them to deal with the problem in a constructive and impartial manner and frame a report on the evidence they received. As a result of that various county councils&mdash;I think nearly all of them&mdash; numerous fishery associations, millers and many other interested parties came before the commission and gave evidence.  But the commission were not content with that.  They travelled all over the country and they visited the various rivers&mdash;the Shannon, the Nore, the Corrib, the Moy and many others and found out for themselves at first hand what the likely cost would be to the National Exchequer, basing their <Col N="504" /> calculations, of course, on the monetary values of the time.  They submitted their report.</P>
    <P>There were two reports&mdash;a majority report and a minority report.  It was on the basis of the majority report that the Bill was drafted and piloted through this House by Deputy Smith, who was then Parliamentary Secretary in charge of the Office of Public Works. That Bill was a pretty comprehensive document.  Deputy Smith piloted it through the House with great skill and gave consideration to every point that was put before him by both sides of the House.  Both sides, in fact, appreciated the skilful and non-partisan manner in which he piloted that measure through here.  As a result of that Bill becoming law, and even before it became law, just to show how interested Fianna Fáil were in the problem of arterial drainage, they set about having surveys made.  It has been alleged all over the country that we did nothing about arterial drainage, and I can produce proof that such allegations were made; I can produce cuttings from newspapers containing statements that we did nothing about arterial drainage but, in anticipation of the passage of that Bill into law, the survey of the Brosna was commenced in 1942.  A survey on the Glyde and Dee was commenced in 1944.  A survey of the Feale was commenced in 1945, Fianna Fáil still in office.</P>

I always thought it would be a wonderful thing if I got a degree but when I listen to and read so many foolish statements made by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Government I thank heaven that I never went that far anyway because what use is a degree if God has not endowed you with brains as well?  I have talked about the surveys, the designs and the plotting.  I want to remind this House and all concerned that the designing and the plotting of a scheme for arterial drainage takes almost as long as the actual survey and that has been proved even in the case of the Corrib.  The actual survey was finished in 1951, the design and plotting had to be undertaken in 1951 and I expect a number of the engineers had to be diverted to undertake that work. Still, despite the fact that the actual survey was finished in 1951, the design and plotting had not been completed until about July, 1953.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then there is the other question of exhibition which deals very closely with what it is proposed to do&mdash;the various interests that are to be affected, the various bridges that are to be either raised or lowered and the interference with waterworks and sewage schemes&mdash;and when it comes to that stage the local authority in the catchment area concerned are notified and are asked to make observations and when you have a meticulous county manager and a meticulous county engineering staff who take cognisance of the various factors that go into that, you will see that it gets very great attention.  The local authorities make their observations and the Commissioners of Public Works take cognisance of these and, as happened in the case of the Corrib, there were numerous conferences between the county manager and the county engineer and the Commissioners of Public Works and the engineers had to iron out the problems and difficulties regarding two existing waterworks and sewage systems. That took a considerable time, with the result that the Corrib scheme could not be started until April of 1954. However, I shall come back to the <Col N="507" /> Corrib again and again in the course of my contribution to this debate.</P>

I know the Minister for Finance said <Col N="508" /> that of course it was easy to make a promise, that it was easy to give an instruction but that it remained for him to confirm them.

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is reported as having mentioned the Rye, of having made statements down in some of the principal towns in Kildare that the Rye river was to be drained and that a sum of £45,000 was to be expended on it. The Rye river is neither a major catchment nor a minor catchment area and the sole purpose of draining the Rye river was to further the political interests of Fine Gael in Meath and Kildare and the political future of the Minister for Finance in County Kildare. There was no other reason for deciding to spend £45,000 on the Rye to benefit something like 600 acres of land and no more.  That is the amount of money. If there is staff and money available in the Board of Works, there are many other rivers in Ireland which, in my opinion, demand priority over the little drain, the River Rye, and it might be much more to the advantage of the Minister for Lands to insist that that £45,000 and a bit more along with it would be spent on the Breedogue and the Lung in the Boyle catchment area.</P>

We had that expedition to the Corrib on the 15th June.  The expeditionary force comprised no less a person than the Minister for Finance himself, the Minister for Lands, the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Hession and Deputy Coogan.</P>

Heavenly Father, if that is what an Arterial Drainage Act was passed for in this House, and if that is the purpose it is intended to serve, then we are wasting our time in this House.  We had all <Col N="511" /> that.  Let the Parliamentary Secretary now, in his reply, tell me that that expedition to the Corrib on the 15th June, 1955, will halve the period for the completion of the Corrib, that instead of it being ten years, as a result of the money expended by way of State cars, State drivers and other things, it will be five years?  What did it do?  What purpose did it serve?  As I said, it served no other purpose than the purpose of propaganda, to gull the electors in the County of Galway, on the eve of a local government election. We have something more than that. In the very same issue of the <i>Connacht Tribune</i> there is a report headed: &ldquo;Work on Corrib Scheme for All Who Want It.&rdquo;  I will not read it all.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;There is employment for 500 men on the Corrib drainage scheme and if the people did not take that work he could not help them, said Mr. Michael Donnellan, T.D., Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, addressing a Clann na Talmhan meeting in support of candidates for the local authority elections, on Saturday.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not mind that. We are not a bit annoyed.  If we lost it, we lost it honourably.  We did not gain it by making deceptive promises and by misrepresentation.  The statement continues:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. Donnellan was replying to criticisms of the method of recruitment of labour for the Corrib scheme at a recent meeting of the Tuam Town Commissioners.  He added that all he could do was to <Col N="512" /> offer men work.  The scheme had been described as a &ldquo;white elephant&rdquo; at a meeting of the Tuam Town Commissioners because it was alleged it was only a scheme on paper.  But for him it would have been on paper indefinitely.  At the present time there were 300 men employed on the scheme and 46 excavators. Employment was available for 200 extra men and the scheme was costing £2,200,000.  It could be described as the greatest scheme that ever came to the province. When the cards were sent out from the exchange offering men work the cry went out that Donnellan wanted to deprive men of work.  The men were not deprived of one penny. There was not a man employed on the Corrib scheme who did not come through the Labour Exchange.  The work was there for the unemployed. It was coming nearer to Tuam and any man who wanted work could come and get it.  If they did not do so he would not hold up the scheme.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I come now to the point which I wanted to raise on this article&mdash;the point which I was about to make without boring the House by reading out the whole of the article.  It continues:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The flooding at Belclare was caused last winter when the river burst its banks.  If Fianna Fáil had gone on with the scheme which he had drawn up when he was in power that flooding would never have occurred.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is in this House now.  He is here and he has the protection of the House, and so have I. He has all the privileges of the House, and so have I.  I want him now to prove from his official files and from the documents in his Department in what way Fianna Fáil omitted to proceed with this scheme or held up the drainage of the Corrib from the time I took office in 1951 until 1954.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a pertinent question.  It is probable that Deputy Beegan has misunderstood that statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The statement which I quoted is as it was printed in the <Col N="513" /><i>Connacht Tribune</i> of the 18th June last.  It says: &ldquo;If Fianna Fáil had gone on with the scheme which he had drawn up when he was in power that flooding would never have occurred.&rdquo;  What was the implication of that statement? Surely the implication was that Fianna Fáil deliberately retarded that scheme and held it up?  I challenge the Parliamentary Secretary to prove from the files of his Department that Fianna Fáil or I held up the Corrib scheme.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance knows that I put an additional engineer on the Corrib immediately after taking office in 1951.  He knows that the survey could not be completed before October or December, 1951.  I was told they would probably be able to complete it in October.  However, many difficulties and problems arose with the result that it was not completed until December, 1951.  He knows that the designing and plotting was a most complex problem as far as the Corrib was concerned because of the many interests involved&mdash;and there are many interests involved.  You had the county council and the fishing interests; you had what are known as gully holes, and so forth.  The Parliamentary Secretary knows that all that made it more difficult.  The Parliamentary Secretary knows that, on the advice of the Commissioners, I engaged a firm of highly experienced consultants from across the water to plan and design a new bridge over what is known as &ldquo;the Salmon Weir&rdquo; in Galway.  Is that not correct?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly, it all took time.  The Parliamentary Secretary also knows that, as I have already said, the county manager made several observations at the exhibition.  He knows that there were a number of <Col N="515" /> conferences between the Commissioners of Public Works, the national drainage authority as I will term them, their chief engineer and the county manager and his engineering staff and that they ironed out their difficulties.  The Parliamentary Secretary knows that there was no delay in starting the scheme. He knows that it was started as soon as it was physically or reasonably possible to do so on the 14th April.  What is more, the Parliamentary Secretary knows that, even though a general election was only one month distant, there was no ceremonial display at the opening of the Corrib scheme on the 14th April.  No whistle was blown.  No fideóg was inserted into my mouth to try to gull or deceive the voters of County Galway.</P>

I had just as much right to go there and I would have been well justified in going there and carrying out that ceremonial, that bombastic buffoonery, as they had when they went to the Brosna, the Glyde and the Dee.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is why I did not go there.  It humiliates me to see this type of bombastic ceremonial carried out to try and humbug and deceive the people for petty Party propaganda.  I expected, at least, that the Parliamentary Secretary would live up to the characteristics of the people of County <Col N="516" /> Galway.  After all, no matter what our faults or failings may be, we are noted for the characteristics of truth, fair play and candour.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary talks about a priority list.  He made a statement about the priority list.  I have the cutting here.  Amongst other things, he said on the 31st May, 1951, he had a discussion with the Board of Works and that at that time the scheme was sixteenth on the priority list and that, as each scheme would take at least six years, it meant that the Corrib scheme would have to wait 80 years.  I never intended to use this but I am now forced to do so.  I dealt very generously with the Parliamentary Secretary when he was a Deputy during my term of office.  I stood up to the Kerry people and the Kerry deputations when they came up to criticise and censure him for depriving them of the Maine and for giving the Corrib preference.  They talked of the priority list.</P>
      <P>They talk about a priority list.  There was a provisional priority list drawn up and I always held that any Parliamentary Secretary could recommend to the commissioners and the Government that it should be departed from in the altered circumstances of the times. What was the original priority list? No. 1 was the Brosna; No. 2, the Glyde and Dee; No. 3, the Feale; No. 4, the Maine; No. 5, the Moy; No. 6, the Inny; and No. 7, the Corrib. Was that sixteenth on the list?  Was it sixteenth on the list then?  Can the Parliamentary Secretary say that? No. 8 was the Boyne; No. 9, the Erne; No. 10, the Little Brosna; No. 11, the Deale; No. 12, the Boyle; and No. 13, the Suck.  It will be alleged that I brought the Suck up from thirteenth to seventh place.  I did&mdash;for survey and also to have it carried out.  The Parliamentary Secretary will find in the files of his office letters I received from the general manager of Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann and also from the manager of Bord na Móna asking me to give it priority, because of the activities they were about to undertake and because it would enable them to carry out these operations which would be very beneficial for the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For that reason, I did bring the Suck <Col N="517" /> up from thirteenth to seventh place and I brought it up also in view of a motion put down by Deputy McQuillan who made a most impressive speech when he dealt with the matter, more from the social angle than from the utility angle. I pass no apology to anybody for doing so, but I did not tell the people down on the Suck that I conferred a great favour or that it was because I was there that it was brought from thirteenth to seventh or eighth place. I told them the candid truth and I am telling it to them now, that I would treat them in the same way as the people on any other river in Ireland, whether the Nore, the Barrow, the Suir, the Deale, the Maigue or the rest of them, were it not for the pressure brought to bear on me and the case made by Deputy McQuillan.</P>
    <P>No. 14 was the Maigue; No. 15, the Suir; No. 16, the Owenmore in Sligo; No. 17, the Mulcaire; No. 18, the Nore; No. 19, the Blackwater, Monaghan; No. 20, the Fergus; No. 21, the Liffey; No. 22, the Blackwater, Cork; No. 23, the Barrow; No. 24, the Lee, Cork; No. 25, the Bandon; No. 26, the Finn; No. 27, the Laune; and No. 28 the Slaney.  These are the 28 major catchment areas as decided upon and there is no talk and no mention of the lordly Shannon amongst them.  We would like to know what is being done now about the Shannon, or when we are going to have these experts from the Mississippi Valley to tell us how the flooding can be controlled there, in view of the fact that the Shannon can never be drained in the normal way.</P>
    <P>We have then the minor priority list, No. 1 on which was the the Nenagh River.  That was not held back.  We have No. 2, the Ballyteigue in Wexford; No. 3, the Cahore in Wexford; No. 4, the Broadmeadow, somewhere near Dublin; No. 5, the Killimor, in my own country; No. 6, the Quinn; No. 7, the Owenkeagh; No. 8, Eslin; No. 9, the Strokestown; No. 10, the Dunkellin; No. 11, the Inagh; No. 12, the Scariff; No. 13, the Rinn and Black River; No. 14, the Nanny; No. 15, the Longford; No. 16, the Sow; No. 17, the Ballinahasig; No. 18, the Lavally; No. 19, the River Lee, Kerry; No. 20, the Fane; No. 21, the Sixmilebridge; <Col N="518" /> No. 22, the Elphin; No. 23, the Bonet; No. 24, the Foyle; No. 25, the Leannan; No. 26, the Erriff; No. 27, the Tolka; No. 28, the Owenea; No. 29, Owenmore; and No. 30, the Swilly.  The Rye is not even mentioned among the minor catchments because it comes in with No. 21 in the major catchment, the Liffey.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary says he brought the Corrib from sixteenth to fourth place.  He brought it to fourth place all right&mdash;and I am not finding any fault with him&mdash;but he did not bring it from sixteenth place.  He brought it from seventh place, and, in doing so, naturally enough, he put back the Maine and the Moy, as well as the Inny.  I will make this statement candidly here now, that had I been in the Office of Public Works in 1945 when the provisional list was made out, I would have had a terrible fight with the commissioners if I did not give the Moy first place on that priority list.  I would give it to the Moy for social reasons because of the population there and because of the conditions and circumstances of the people there. I believe it should have been placed first on the priority list.</P>
    <P>When I came in in 1951 I had no hesitation&mdash;the Moy was under consideration admittedly and unquestionably in the Parliamentary Secretary's time from 1948 to 1951, but there was no move to put it under survey and no sanction was given&mdash;I approached the Minister for Finance in the Fianna Fáil Government to give the necessary sanction and I went down to Foxford in the course of a by-election in June of 1952 and I did not hoodwink the people of North Mayo on that occasion by holding out lavish, reckless promises to them about its being under survey and that work would start on it next year.  I told them straight that it was under survey, but that between survey and design and plotting, the soonest they could expect any work to be started on the Moy was 1956, four years ahead at that time, and that they would be very lucky if it could be even started as early as that.</P>
    <P>I have given the provisional priority list, and it will be on the records of the House.  I do not wish to suggest, <Col N="519" /> nor am I suggesting, that any Parliamentary Secretary has not got the right to ask the national drainage authority, the Commissioners of Public Works, to revise that list and to give priority to schemes which perhaps are 20th or 25th on it now, to bring them up because of the altered circumstances. We all know that there are greatly altered circumstances since 1945.  We know, in the first place, that it was possible to get in modern machinery and it was possible also to recruit highly technical staff since then, but there are many other factors as well that come into it.</P>
    <P>We know the advances in agriculture in recent years; we know the advances made by Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann and the experiment being carried out in Gowla in County Galway; and we know the big advances made by Bord na Móna and of the bogs that have been taken over for development and use in connection with generating stations and so on, to improve the conditions of the people and to render us more independent of outside sources of supply.  All these things have to be considered by the Parliamentary Secretary, the Government and the commissioners. When they put their heads together, there is no reason why they should not be free to alter that provisional list if they believe that it is in the best national interest to do so. I am not the one who will stand up here and castigate them and criticise them if they make an alteration in the provisional list and give good, sound reasons for doing so.</P>
    <P>In reference to sub-head K, the purchase and maintenance of engineering plant, machinery and stores, this sub-head shows a decrease of £90,000.  I want the Parliamentary Secretary to inform the House under which of the categories of sub-head K this reduction is being made, or if something is being taken off each of them.  There are four categories: (a) purchase of engineering plant and machinery, (b) purchase of workshop plant, equipment, etc., (c) wages of workshop staff, and (d) purchase of materials, spare parts, stores, etc.  I want to know what the position is regarding category (b). <Col N="520" /> Some questions were directed regarding this and the servicing of the machines to the Minister for Finance by Deputy Sheldon.  I am sure he will have something to say on this Vote and I am not going to cut across him. He is a very capable and experienced Deputy and he will elicit, as far as possible, all the information he requires.</P>
    <P>When I was Parliamentary Secretary, the Public Accounts Committee decided, in its wisdom&mdash;and I would also say that, having that privilege, they thought it advisable&mdash;to visit the engineering workshop at Inchicore. They made an exhaustive tour and examination of the depot and the system of servicing and checking. Deputy Sheldon was then Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, I think, and there was also on the committee a highly experienced businessman, Deputy Dockrell, and another man very interested in economising, in an efficient way and without doing any harm to any section of a Department but to ensure that everything was conducted in a highly efficient and economical manner, and that was the then Deputy Hickey, now Senator Hickey.</P>
    <P>The depot was visited and I felt that, as a result of their visit, taking all the circumstances into account, they were satisfied that it was a good system, that it was well organised as far as the resources would permit and that there was an experienced staff working there.  They were given an indication of how the accounting was done, how the spare parts were being checked, how the spare parts were distributed, how the machines were being taken off, how they were being serviced, and so on.  One of the Deputies, speaking to me afterwards, said: &ldquo;Well, really, I was surprised at the fine type of men you have out there; in fact, I do not think they are being paid at all sufficient when they are so well qualified; I am in private business and I would be prepared to give some of them more than they are getting, but I just would not make that offer, as I would not wish to divorce them from a State concern.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I was very pleased with that visit and had I remained in office I would have invited the Public Accounts Committee <Col N="521" /> to visit and inspect another very important section of the Office of Public Works, that is, the furniture branch.  I would very much like that they would do so.  Perhaps they think that everything is all right now because it is not a Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Secretary that is there any more, but I think they are intelligent enough to know and they will come to the viewpoint that, even though there is someone there to the heart's desire of the majority of them, it might be well for them to carry out this little tour of inspection.  I certainly was never satisfied with it during my term of office and I expect the present Parliamentary Secretary is hardly satisfied either.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know very well that he has a big difficulty to overcome.  No matter what Government is in operation, the Department of Finance very often has the penny wise pound foolish outlook.  There are other reasons why Governments are hesitant.  A considerable amount of political capital might be made if the Commissioners of Public Works embarked on the building of a good central store.  If the Public Accounts Committee visited the various centres of this city where furniture, both antique and modern, is being stored, they would come back very dissatisfied and would say that things should be improved.  I believe they would go to the point of recommending a central depot, within the city or some distance outside it, where there could be central supervision.  As far as I remember, there is the central office in Hume Street and various stores all over the city, in the Castle, in Victoria Barracks, in Coleraine House and various other places.  Furniture is stored there under conditions that, in my opinion, are not at all suitable for the storage of costly furniture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the repair of furniture, if you have not a good central workshop, if it has to be carried out in dingy little places here and there, the tradesmen entrusted with that work cannot do it as they would like to do it and they are not satisfied that they are doing the job as they could do it if they had proper accommodation.  The question <Col N="522" /> of supervision is a big one.  If there were a proper central depot, where there could be supervision from the top down, it would be much more satisfactory.</P>
    <P>I would be delighted if the Public Accounts Committee would examine the whole position, if they would examine the storage, collection, distribution and repair systems as well as the purchasing system.  It is a most important matter, in my opinion, and it would be well if the Committee would go into it and investigate it thoroughly.  When I was Parliamentary Secretary I was not satisfied about any of these things.  We talked about them.  As I have said, it is a difficult thing for a Parliamentary Secretary to force his way against the opinions of the Department of Finance. Naturally enough, the Minister for Finance would like to set a good headline as far as economy is concerned, and he is not going to break his neck helping, in many ways perhaps, the Parliamentary Secretary's suggestions or the suggestions of the Commissioners of Public Works to have money expended in this kind of way.  He likes to set a good economy headline in his own Department for the other Departments to follow.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which is not the direct concern of the Parliamentary Secretary or the Commissioners of Public Works, but the point is that they act as agents for the Department of Education in the erection and reconstruction of a big number of schools. There is no big increase in the Estimate for the coming year.  Perhaps it is based on the amount that was expended during the financial year 1954-55.  During my three years in office as Parliamentary Secretary, I think I can claim that with the assistance of the commissioners, their architects and engineers we stepped up expenditure very considerably, from about £600,000 to well over £1,000,000.</P>
    <P>I should like to know if the Estimate for school buildings and reconstruction is going to be anchored at £1,000,000.  Perhaps that is not a strictly relevant question to put to the Parliamentary Secretary, and that really should be addressed to the Minister for Education.  All I know is <Col N="523" /> that during my time I had school managers in with me almost daily pointing out to me the terrible condition of their schools and telling me that if something was not done the next thing would be a strike and all the rest of it.  I do not know if that has been the experience of the present Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is just the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many occasions on which the Office of Public Works is blamed for delays that occur in the carrying out of work on school buildings.  The blame does not attach to that office at all, but rather to the people concerned who are the people really to blame.  I found, very often, that when managers appointed architects, highly qualified men, undoubtedly, and men of experience, yet they were very careless and dilatory in the submission of plans and specifications and very often several reminders had to be sent to them.  I found, too, that when they did submit their plans and specifications that, if defects or flaws were pointed out to them, it took them a long time to remedy them or do what they were requested to do.</P>
      <P>When I was responsible, there was a suggestion that the Department of Education and the Commissioners of Public Works should come together and agree on a list of qualified architects, and that from it the managers would be free to pick the man they thought best suited for the work they were undertaking.  I think that if such a list were compiled it would be very useful.  I feel certain that the representatives of the Department of Education and the Commissioners of Public Works and their architects would be very careful in compiling such a list.  They would see that only the very best architects were placed on the list, and that the managers could not have any grouse as far as the list was concerned.  They could feel certain that they would always have available to them highly qualified men to prepare plans and specifications, as well as for the supervision of the work in the erection of the schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="524" /> I want to say, also, that during my time managers often pointed out to me that they were not satisfied with the work done on new schools which had been completed.  Their complaint was that the work was not properly finished and that the material used was, in many instances, not of the best, and left a lot to be desired.  That happened even in my own county during my time as Parliamentary Secretary. I made representations to the people in authority in the Board of Works about it.</P>
    <P>My own belief is that it is the clerks of works who are mainly responsible for that, not that they are not qualified to do the job but that very often they are a little bit too soft-hearted when dealing with contractors.  That is something that should be pointed out to them.  They are getting good money and the contractors are getting good money, and the least that might be expected from them is that they would give a decent return for the money they receive, so that the managers and all concerned can be satisfied with the work when completed.  I visited some of those schools myself and one did not need to be an architect, an engineer or a clerk of works, or indeed to be experienced in any way in the building line to be able easily to detect a number of defects in the schools that I was called on to examine.</P>
    <P>I know, of course, that it is sometimes very hard to please people as regards how a job should be finished. If a job is fairly well finished and if people complain, well then one can say that nothing would satisfy some people.  But when one sees with one's own eyes that a job was not properly carried out, that it was really only a gobán job, one has to admit that that was not a proper way to do work.  My complaint about clerks of works is not that they are not well qualified and experienced, but that they are too soft-hearted. They are not sufficiently stern in dealing with contractors who try to put it across them.</P>
    <P>One of the big questions on this Estimate is drainage.  I want the Parliamentary Secretary, when he is replying, to give us a clear and comprehensive statement as to what the position is in regard to this whole <Col N="525" /> matter.  Would the Parliamentary Secretary tell us the position in regard to the various rivers under survey, any of them on which the survey has been completed?  Would he tell us what distance his office has gone in respect of design and plotting and when it is likely that works can commence?  I think we are entitled to get that and the order in which he proposes&mdash;if he does propose&mdash;to have surveys carried out on the other rivers.</P>
    <P>I come now to another matter which I am rather reluctant to introduce, but as it bears on administration, I feel I am entitled to show up in this House what to my mind is nothing short of conduct that is reprehensible.  I did not enter into this at any time previously. I was very hesitant to do so.  The question I am coming to now concerns the appointment of the paymaster on the River Corrib.  The whole of that matter has a very unedifying and undignified history.  In my opinion the Parliamentary Secretary should have proved himself a man and have been quite candid in the first instance instead of having all this fiendish playacting that has been carried on for several months in regard to it and without having all this evasive answering of questions in the House as regards the remuneration and all the rest of it.</P>
    <P>I have nothing whatsoever against the particular man appointed, but why was he not decently appointed?  Why was this make-believe, deception and humbug carried on and all the huggermugger that we have had brought to our notice?  The paymaster system was initiated in the Special Employments Branch by the Parliamentary Secretary himself as far as I know.  That was when the Special Employments Branch undertook to carry out the work previously carried out by the local authorities or by the engineering staffs of the local authorities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was on the advice of the office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will accept that it was on the advice of the office.  Anyhow, he appointed a number of paymasters, all of them reputable men.  I find no fault with that.  They are men with <Col N="526" /> whom I could trust the Bank of Ireland.  I will say that.  It was a system I disagreed with.  I did not believe in it because there were many factors in it which were not, I think, for the benefit of the workers concerned or at least for the household from which the worker came.  I decided to dispense with that system and that decision was brought into effect, if my memory serves me right, about October, 1953. There were seven or eight such men. You had them in Galway, Roscommon, Clare and Kerry.</P>
      <P>There were two men amongst them who were not political friends of mine. One of them was a man who was candidate opposing me in the 1948 General Election and who was never friendly with Fianna Fáil for I would say about 21 years.  I knew the family circumstances of that man.  I knew very well that he was one of the seven or eight to whom that little business was of some use.  There was another man whom I also knew and he foolishly gave up a good job with a local authority. When the decision was made, I said to the director of the Special Employments Schemes Office: &ldquo;We will dispense with five or six of them now for a start and with all of them later but there are two I am going to retain until we find suitable alternative employment for them&rdquo;.  He said: &ldquo;All right, we will extend the time for three months in the first instance&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The time was extended for three months and in the month of January I had a phone call from the director of the Special Employments Schemes Office who said: &ldquo;We came to a decision, Parliamentary Secretary, as you know, to dispense with the paymaster system and you have retained two men.  How do you think I am going to justify that before the Committee of Public Accounts as accounting officer?&rdquo;. I said to him: &ldquo;Place the responsibility on me&rdquo; and in order to confirm that I wrote him a memo that very evening instructing him to hold on both men until the 30th June, 1954.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the men&mdash;the younger man&mdash; I had asked to have interviewed and he was interviewed for the position of marine works foreman because from what I heard about the man&mdash;I did not <Col N="527" /> know him nor do I know him now personally&mdash;I knew he was the type of man capable of undertaking almost any kind of work.  I understand he was interviewed, that he was passed and that he was held on awaiting a vacancy as a marine works foreman.  The other man I knew very well had been efficient in the discharge of his duties as paymaster for the Special Employments Schemes Office.  This particular man was a married man&mdash;a certified 1916 man and a certified I.R.A. man from 1919 to 1923.  He held his certificates and his medals and was in receipt of a small pension.</P>
    <P>I said to the Commissioners of Public Works that this man was in my opinion <Col N="528" /> the man who should be appointed paymaster of the Corrib.  If I was there there would be a desperate row and I would leave the Fianna Fáil Party if he had not been appointed not because I was under any political obligation to him.  He was a Clann na Poblachta candidate and a bitter pill.  There is no doubt about it but, nevertheless, in the interests of justice and fair play and in the interests of his young family I was going to insist that that man would be appointed paymaster on the River Corrib.  I move to report progress.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 2 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Tuesday, 12th July, 1955.</P>
