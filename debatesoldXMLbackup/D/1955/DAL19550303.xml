      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will state each item contained in the cost-of-living index together with the prices charged to consumers in each case on 2nd June, 1954, and as at the nearest date to mid-February, 1955.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="J. Lynch J. Lynch  McGrath McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Messrs. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>J. Lynch</b> asked the Taoiseach if he will indicate the essential household commodities, food, etc., which have increased in price since 2nd June, 1954, and the amount of the increase in each case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. O'Sullivan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 1 <Col N="1154" /> and 2 together and, in reply, to circulate in the Official Report a statement showing the national average retail prices at mid-May, 1954, and mid-November, 1954, of foodstuffs included in the consumer price index.  The data for mid-February, 1955, are not yet available.</P>
      <P>As regards the complete list of items included in the compilation of the consumer price index number I would refer the Deputy to pages 227-228 of the December, 1953, issue of the <i>Irish Trade Journal</i> and <i>Statistical Bulletin</i> or to my written reply to Deputy Ó Briain's question, yesterday.</P>
      <P>In the case of items other than foodstuffs, the national average retail prices have little significance as they are based on the prices of articles (e.g. men's suits) of often widely varying quality&mdash;though, of course, the same qualities are priced at successive inquiries.</P>
      <P>For this reason such prices are not quoted in the case of non-food items. For a comparison of the ratios of such prices at mid-May, 1954, and mid-November, 1954, to the corresponding prices at mid-August, 1953, I would refer the Deputy to the already-mentioned written reply to Deputy Ó Briain's question.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement:&mdash;</P>
      <P>NATIONAL Average Retail Prices of Foodstuffs included in the Consumer Price Index, mid-May and mid-November, 1954.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he is aware that cases which can be dealt with by the District Courts having regard to the increased jurisdiction provided by the Courts of Justice Act, 1953, are still being heard <Col N="1166" /> in the Circuit Court due to the fact that no scale of costs has been fixed for the District Court, and, if so, whether he will have the matter attended to as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is in the affirmative.  Question of costs fall to be regulated by the rule-making authority, which, in this case, consists of the District Court Rules Committee with the concurrence of the Minister for Justice. The delay in making rules as to the costs to be allowed to solicitors for business coming within the extended jurisdiction of the District Court is due to the fact that neither my predecessor nor I have been able to see our way to concur in the committee's specific proposals.  These proposals, apart from other considerations, would have the effect of increasing the existing costs, that is to say, the costs allowed to solicitors for business within the former jurisdiction of the District Court&mdash;an increase for which I find it hard to see the justification. I should add that the rules committee and I are trying to resolve our differences in a spirit of mutual goodwill and I hope a decision may soon be reached.</P>

    <P>As regards the second part in so far as the applications enumerated above come within the purview of the Athlone relief committee their claims have been investigated by that committee which I appointed last January to assist me in alleviating actual dire <Col N="1168" /> distress in the abnormally flooded areas of the Shannon valley.  The committee have in fact surveyed, and reported on, some 2,200 holdings in that area.  A general survey had previously been made of all affected areas without reference to any particular holdings.  Applications for interest free loans have been referred for consideration to the Agricultural Credit Corporation.</P>
    <P>As regards the third part, the relief committee expect to complete their work within the next few weeks.  The applications for loans are being dealt with as expeditiously as possible by the Agricultural Credit Corporation.</P>

In view of considerations of cost, however, certain economies are being provided for in the final documents which are being prepared locally.  These documents have not yet been submitted for approval, but it is understood that the acquisition of the necessary land and water rights is being proceeded with.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to criticise the administration of the National <Col N="1190" /> Development Fund since the change of Government, with special reference to a particular proposal which had been examined and approved by the Taoiseach.  As the Minister himself explained, part of the money was set aside for projects for the well-being of the Gaeltacht.  As the Act sets out, this National Development Fund is applicable only to works which could not in the ordinary process of things be dealt with before the year 1957. The experience has been, in relation to marine works, that the prospect of getting anything worthwhile done by any county council in any part of the country, not to speak of the poorer counties in the West, before 1957 was very thin indeed.  The western councils have stated time and time again that their finances were unequal to the task of meeting the urgent problems of the west coast and particularly the west coast islands.</P>
      <P>I think it was particularly shabby, as I said last night, that because of a slight error made by the technical officers in relation to a proposal for one of the Aran Islands, Inis Thiar, the sanction which had been given on the original report of those technical officers and which subsequently had to be withdrawn in favour of an alternative proposal&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>There were three proposals for Inis Thiar.  The three of <Col N="1191" /> them were submitted by myself, both as a Deputy and subsequently as a Parliamentary Secretary.  One of them was for the improvement of the main landing place, the pier; another one was for the provision of a slip for currach fishermen; and the third one was for the improvement of a place on the eastern side of the island to facilitate the landing of turf in the summer weather, where about a quarter of the island's supply is landed when the weather is suitable.  By some mischance, these technical officers reported on the wrong place.  The report came in and was duly approved, because the Taoiseach could not be expected to know all the details of a proposal of this sort and he took it that the matter had been dealt with, that the people appointed and qualified for the purpose had done their job well; and without hesitation he sanctioned the expenditure of a sum of £8,000.</P>
      <P>As I say, it was discovered a short time afterwards that the recommendation had been in respect of the wrong place.  That mistake was corrected as quickly as possible, but the substitute proposal could not be approved by the Taoiseach, for the reason that in the meantime a general election had taken place and the Taoiseach felt that it would not be proper for him to sanction expenditure of money, seeing that his term of office was coming to a close. I understand that the etiquette of such situations is that you leave these matters for the attention of the succeeding Government.  That etiquette need not have been applied, in my opinion.  Were it not that the Taoiseach paid particular attention to it and was particularly observant of the etiquette in the matter, he might very easily, in the circumstances, have given his approval to this proposal, without having committed any serious breach of this practice which has come into vogue in situations subsequent to elections when it is obvious that a change of Government is pending.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say without any hesitation, and with all the more vehemence because of the Minister's interruption, that the <Col N="1192" /> treatment of this particular proposal was particularly shabby.  The island of Inis Thiar is a very remote place. It is a Fíor-Ghaeltacht island.  Surely if there was any doubt about it both the Minister for that Party as well as anybody on this side of the House would be expected to have no hesitation in giving the benefit of any doubt that might have existed in favour of a remote place like Inis Thiar.</P>

      <P>What is the use of quibbling about a piece of paper that was put under the Taoiseach's nose? These people had decided to improve the facility.  It could not be done by the ordinary process in vogue all down <Col N="1193" /> the years.  The National Development Fund was brought in for just such purposes as these.  I say it is treating these people in a very shabby fashion to delay for a period of nine months a decision on something of vital importance to them.  I think, having said that much about it, I have said enough to pin-point the matter and stress its importance small and all as the sum is in relation to the total figure of £6,000,000.  I have said enough to stress and emphasise its importance in a discussion on this subject.</P>
      <P>The Fíor-Ghaeltacht in this particular case is the place in question.  The Fíor-Ghaeltacht has got a great deal of lip service all round this House.  I want to ensure that the efforts that were made to transfer some of that lip service into solid, substantial service will not now be jettisoned on any footy and technical point.

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Government criticised the expenditure of the money in relation to roads.  He <Col N="1195" /> made a comparison between the allocation for main roads and that for county roads.  He pointed over to this side of the House and said that was the sort of thing the Fianna Fáil Government did.  He will get a whole lot of people on this side of the House who will agree with him that a change in that particular respect might very usefully be made but what I want to say to him is that, when this Party formed the Government, they did not go into these technical details which the Parliamentary Secretary is now so perturbed about.  They did, in fact, leave the selection of these roads to the technical officers both local and in the Department of Local Government to work out these details themselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>I was speaking about the expenditure of some of these funds on county council roads.  I thought we had left Inis Thiar in the category to which it had been allocated when the fund was first set up.  Will we leave it so?  Can the Minister be persuaded to leave it rest for the remainder of my participation in the debate?  I am agreeable if he is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of the main roads versus the county roads, the local engineers have nothing at all to do with these Gaeltacht schemes.  On the question of main roads versus county roads, a good case could be made for what the Parliamentary Secretary said that, in fact, possibly not too high a proportion of money in respect of individual jobs but too high a quality of work was probably decided on by the local engineers and the engineers in the Department of Local Government. On that he is going to get a whole lot of people to agree with him.  At all events, it was a technical matter <Col N="1196" /> which was left by the previous Government to be decided by the technicians.  If the last Government made a mistake in that respect, then the Government to which the Parliamentary Secretary belongs can correct it.  It is not a case of taking a global sum for main roads and of comparing it with the bulk sum on county roads. The nature of the complaint is the quality of the work which was been decided on by the local engineers in respect of a given job.</P>
    <P>In my own constituency, I could point to jobs that have been carried out in which, in my opinion, the quality of the work is too high.  I think that a lesser standard of performance would have met the problem quite well enough, and that more of this money might be freed for the benefit of the county roads.  I do not think that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Government had much of a peg on which to hang any substantial complaint.</P>

      <P>Deputy Briscoe read quotations from speeches which were made by Deputy Dillon, the present Minister for Agriculture, when the debate on this fund was taking place in December of 1953.  One of the ugly appellations which Deputy Dillon applied to the fund was that it was a slush fund: in other words, that we were going to use it to bolster up a bad case in the by-elections.  There is one thing that I can say, and it is that whatever slush one finds attached to it in the mind of the present Minister for Agriculture, we have not seen much of it in practice.  Here is one thing that was not done in relation to it.  The political administrators of this fund when Fianna Fáil were in office did not communicate privately with particular T.D.s and Senators down <Col N="1197" /> the country about individual decisions on expenditure.  They did not write to T.D.s and Senators&mdash;&mdash;</P>

They did not write to T.D.s and Senators and tell them, early on, what was going to be spent in such a district out of, say, the Tourist Roads Development Fund. According to the news which we have been given in the West of Ireland, the present Minister for Finance wrote to one of his Party politicians some time in the month of January and gave him a list of roads to be improved in the year 1955-56 out of the tourist roads development programme, and he gave him that information before it was given to the Galway County Council. I am telling the Minister that this news appeared in print.  We all read it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the county council verified that when I inquired.  They said that they knew nothing about it. There were no slush tactics of that sort used when Fianna Fáil were in office.  They did not give, in advance, information for the purpose of building up their own political fortunes whether or not a county council election was pending.  I think it comes badly to make these attacks of slush tactics in relation to the administration of this fund when, in fact, these doubtful tactics apparently have been employed by the present Administration only.  I possibly would not have spent quite so long addressing the House on this matter if the Minister for Finance was prepared to show a more considerate attitude towards the places which really should get first consideration and attention from this national Parliament.  We should be more solicitous to see that the remote places which have not got the same daily contact with the current of Irish life as other places were in particular catered for out of a fund which was set up for the purpose of doing things that had no prospect of being done from any other source.  I can quite accept that some delay in order to comply with formalities might have taken place, but I would not have spoken so long or so vigorously on it if I could get any sort of promising reply from the Minister for Local Government, who is responsible to this House for the administration of Oifig na Gaeltachta agus na gCeantar gCúng, which is the funnel through which, in the main, these proposals for the welfare of the Gaeltacht come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It does not augur well for the early completion of the formalities in respect of this proposal to find the Minister for Finance adopting the same evasive attitude as has been adopted by the Minister for Local Government in regard to parliamentary questions.  I hope that what I have said in relation to this matter will produce a change of heart, because it seems to me it is a change of heart that is wanted and that whatever deficiency in the <Col N="1200" /> mechanics of putting the proposal forward existed, it must have been remedied long since, and that really it is a decision that is required, if the Minister would be big enough to approve of a decision, even if it were made, or even if it were formulated or even if it were advanced almost to the final point of conclusion by his predecessor.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Even though I interrupted Deputy Bartley, I am inclined to agree strongly with his suggestion that such places as Inis Thiar should get special treatment under this fund.  I appreciate with him the difficulties of people living in remote islands such as the Aran islands and I feel sure the problems which apply there are typical of those which affect islands around the coast of the constituency of Cork West, which I represent. Of course, it is rather peculiar that Deputy Bartley should be so critical about the treatment meted out by the present Minister for Finance, having regard to the fact that since this fund was made available Deputy Bartley enjoyed a post as junior Minister in the former Government, and I believe if he displayed the same interest on behalf of the people of Inis Thiar when he was Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture as he now displays when he represents West Galway as an ordinary Deputy that the necessary improvements in Inis Thiar would have been effected long ago and that he would not have occasion to trouble the House with them to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every Deputy in this House welcomes the Supplementary Estimate of £3,000,000 for national development but even though the term national development is used I am afraid it is not very national in the true sense of the word. The tendency, so far as I can gather, is that all such moneys made available for development in this country are usually utilised in very few centres, such as Dublin, Cork, Waterford and the bigger cities.  The main problem we have to face up to is that no matter what Government is in power&mdash;the present Government just as much as the last&mdash;rural Ireland and, particularly, remote areas are forgotten. Reading the Minister's statement we <Col N="1201" /> find that more than £500,000 of this money is to be put into harbour development in the City of Dublin. We find that an almost similar sum is to be put into harbour improvements in the City of Cork, so that taking these two works alone, harbour improvements in Cork and Dublin are going to eat up over £1,000,000 of this money.</P>
    <P>While I believe that these improvements may be necessary, at the same time I am of opinion that if we looked at this measure from a national viewpoint much more essential works could be carried out with that £1,000,000 in other parts of this country.  The big question that we have to face up to is the fact that in rural Ireland we have people leaving every day, particularly for England, in order to eke out a livelihood denied to them at home.  The great dread of every young person in this country at the present time in rural districts is that he or she will have to emigrate in order to earn a livelihood.  That is the position, and I had hoped that when this National Development Fund was first inaugurated money would be made available in a much more substantial way for carrying out effective improvements in the rural districts, but now we find, as indicated in the case of the bulk sum of £1,000,000, that the bulk of the money is to be spent in Dublin and other large centres.</P>
    <P>I think it is about time that this Government got it into its head that decentralisation of industry and decentralisation of all public works are essential.  That was the policy carried out by Fianna Fáil, and it seems the present Minister's attitude has not changed too much from that policy.  I, as a Deputy representing a rural constituency, want to impress that fact on the Minister very clearly here to-day.  The main question I think which confronts this House is: are we utilising the £8,000,000 already made available under this fund to the best advantage of this nation?  I am rather doubtful if we are.  So far as I can see, no benefits whatsoever have yet accrued to the constituency of <Col N="1202" /> West Cork from this measure and judging by what I have read about it very little benefit is likely to accrue unless there is to be a change of policy.  It is my duty here representing that area, as it is the duty of other rural Deputies representing other rural areas, to impress on the Government and on the Minister that rural Ireland will no longer stand for being forgotten. They are entitled to a fair share of whatever is going.</P>
    <P>If we examine the position that obtains to-day we find that there are more than 70,000 people unemployed. We find that the main problem confronting parents in Ireland, particularly in the rural parts of the country, is how they are going to provide a livelihood for their growing families, for their sons and daughters, seeking and hoping for any chance they can get of securing that livelihood at home without having to emigrate. It may be said that it is a rather difficult question, but what strikes me forcibly is this fact: if we take the number of unemployed people in any particular district in Ireland at the present time we find that we may have 100 men unemployed in a particular area and we will take it they are getting unemployment assistance or benefit, and taking those in receipt of unemployment benefit, in the case of a married man with a wife and two children, he is receiving 50/- a week paid out by the State, and I know no man in my constituency who would prefer unemployment benefit to work.</P>
    <P>On that basis, the Government cannot find money to provide productive employment, but the Department of Social Welfare, apparently, must provide money to pay unemployment benefits and assistance allowances, which the people dislike.  It is a very peculiar position.  In West Cork at present, people are drawing unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance in areas where plenty of useful work could be provided.</P>
    <P>I believe there is no co-ordination whatsoever between the different Departments. If we examine the matter from this viewpoint, we find that the present rate of wages paid in Cork is £4 9s. 0d. per week.  The State pays <Col N="1203" /> 50/- per week to a man as unemployment benefit.  That money is dead. There is no production whatsoever so far as that 50/- is concerned.  If the State added 39/- more, then we would have a return for that amount.  Which of the two is the better?  I believe some scheme could be devised in the Departments to supplement what the Minister for Social Welfare pays to these people, and bring it up to a figure which will enable them to give a week's work instead of drawing money for nothing.  That is my viewpoint.</P>
    <P>I am not against social welfare benefits.  I realise that they are essential, but at the same time in a small country like this with less than 3,000,000 people, I think it is scandalous that more than 70,000 people draw that benefit at the present day. As a result of drawing it, they are debarred from taking up employment under penalty of being brought before the courts.  That is the forceful point I want to make.</P>
    <P>I want to add that the most degrading thing, in my opinion, for any man in this country, is to go into an exchange, sign on the register, trot around to the guards' barracks in order to get unemployment assistance and unemployment benefit.  Of course, so far as the benefit is concerned, he and his employers have made contributions towards that.  Would it not be much better if something were done to offset that happening?  I am a complete believer in doing something to end that system.  I cannot find words adequate enough to condemn a system of paying money to able-bodied people for nothing.  It is a bad and rotten system which should not obtain in this country if a proper approach were made to the problem of providing employment by some Government, inter-Party, Fianna Fáil or any other.</P>
    <P>I made my position clear in this House a few years ago on this question of paying money by the Department of Social Welfare.  I asked could any effort be made by the Department of Finance at that time, and the Department of Social Welfare, with a view to getting this money which is paid out <Col N="1204" /> in unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance as a fund to subsidise employment.  It would be better to start some industries even though at first they might not be economic, but subsequently they would be economic, and give general benefit.  I think it would be better to utilise all this dole and assistance money in that direction. I believe the principal problem which confronts the Minister, and not only the Minister, but the Government, is the solving of the unemployment question. The Minister could probably ask where could the money be got.  I can tell him: it is by getting back part of the money paid out to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like then to close with a few remarks on this particular point.  I had in mind a suggestion that if the money made available&mdash;£8,000,000&mdash;under this National Development Fund was used with the money paid by the Department of Social Welfare, plus a little more, I think it would provide full employment, and thereby eliminate unemployment <Col N="1205" /> assistance and unemployment benefit for which no return comes.  I will leave it at that.  I think I am right in making myself clear that I am not against the payment of benefits to deserving applicants, but I believe that the Minister should take steps to see that the need for those benefits should cease.</P>
      <P>To provide employment, I believe there are many fields to which we can turn our attention.  Again and again, I have agitated here for a survey of the mineral resources in West Cork, and I believe Deputies of other constituencies have made similar agitation, unfortunately without result.  In my constituency there are men idle, drawing benefit, while nearby there are extensive deposits of slate and barytes. Such useful minerals could be made available if a little extra money were granted to these districts towards development.  I am sure when the development work would be completed that these industries, small though they may be, would stand on their own feet.  We are sick and tired of agitating for such development.  Again and again I mentioned that so far as the slate deposits in West Cork are concerned, in the Roscarbery-Leap area, there is a wide field.  I hope that the present Minister for Finance will take more cognisance of that than his predecessor did.</P>
      <P>Another important field for development is the fishing industry.  Deputy Bartley referred to the hardships of the people all around the coast, and I heartily agree with his remarks.  I have stated in this House before that unless these people get some attention from the Government life in these districts will fade out altogether in the not so far distant future.  I wonder how much of the £3,000,000 which we are asked to vote will go towards the development of this industry.  I saw little or no mention in the Minister's statement to the effect that the fishing industry was getting any money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another useful means of providing employment which would be of benefit to farmers and give productive employment, would be the improvement of by-roads and county roads, especially roads leading to farmhouses.  Funds <Col N="1206" /> were made available by the first inter-Party Government in a rather liberal way under the Local Authority (Works) Act.  They were reduced by Fianna Fáil, almost completely wiped out.  Now they have been increased by £100,000 and I hope we will see in the Minister's Budget statement that they will be increased by at least £1,000,000 because that type of money serves a dual purpose in helping farmers to get their water-logged land drained and in helping workers to get productive employment.</P>
    <P>I wonder what has the Minister for Finance in mind so far as helping the small uneconomic holders in this country is concerned.  Is any help from this £3,000,000 going towards these people?  One of the most hard-pressed sections of the community, their position has been mentioned by me and other Deputies time and again, so there is no need to repeat the question but I ask the Minister to take cognisance of the plight of these people and to give them some aid to develop their holdings and to live in reasonable comfort.</P>
    <P>Let me come to one of the major problems of all, the position of provincial towns.  Industry is completely centralised in Dublin and in the other big cities.  The towns are fading away and business is receding, due to a number of factors.  One of the principal factors is that around every town, particularly in the South of Ireland, you have a number of creameries selling all commodities, which hinders the business in the towns and reacts adversely on them.  I am not going into the question whether it is right or wrong because people's views differ on the matter, but when business is taken away from the town by creameries and so on, I believe some other help should be given to them.  The only help that can be given &mdash;and I have mentioned it again and again&mdash;is by the establishment of some useful industries in the provincial towns and doing away with this business of centralising everything in Dublin. In passing I might say that if suitable land were available contiguous to Dublin City I am sure the oil refinery would be here, too.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1207" /> It is rather surprising now that we will have £8,000,000 in this fund that only £1,500,000 has already been spent. I am not too conversant with the position, but I have a feeling that a larger proportion of this money is being expended on administrative costs than should be.  Take a small project such as the improvement of a small pier down the country.  It will have to be surveyed by several engineers before the work is finally approved by the Department.  I cannot see why all these journeys and all this type of expenditure is necessary.  I take it for granted that a contributory factor in holding up schemes which have already been sanctioned is this fact of having too many surveys and too many reports.</P>

      <P>The Minister in his opening statement indicated to the House that although schemes totalling £5,750,000 had been provisionally approved, not more than £1,500,000 of that money was expended and I believe my remarks are quite relevant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>What I do not like to see happening is that rather too big a percentage of this money should go in administrative costs.  I am telling the Minister that at least some of this money will probably be ultilised in harbour works and such other types of work and that there should be some reduction in the number of surveys made.  I know of a few little schemes in my own constituency and they are being surveyed again and again.  The surveying usually lasts about two years and I am doubtful as to what it costs. In conclusion, I strongly appeal to the Minister to give more attention to the provincial towns and to the rural districts. I feel sure that if he gives them attention he will have the blessing of <Col N="1208" /> the people as a whole and he will go a long way towards removing this unemployment which exists, particularly in the towns and in rural districts, and go a long way in making life much brighter than it is for the people of this country.</P>

      <P>Ar an gceist seo, Forbairt Náisiúnta, caithfidh mé cur síos a dheánamh ar cheist na dtithe, go mór mhór tithe na bhfeirmeoirí beaga faoin dtuaith. Freisin, ba mhaith liom cúpla rud do rá mar gheall ar cheist na muirighne. Baineann an cheist seo leis an bhfadhbh a bhí á plé ag an dTeachta atá tar éis labhairt ar shaol mhuintir na tuaithe.</P>
      <P>One of the important problems we are up against in examining the question of the flight from the land and rural depopulation is the question of the houses for the small farmers, particularly those under £20 valuation. The State has been very liberal in the grants it has offered to small holders for the erection of houses and I would like to point out there are a number of small farmers who never can avail of these grants.  Conditional on the grants or loan is the fact that half the house must be completed before a grant or loan is given.  The walls must be up, the roof must be on; then when the inspection is reported half the grant or loan will be paid.  Take the position of a small farmer in my own constituency on a £5 or £6 valuation. Where is he going to get the credit to get the cement even if he is doing the job himself with a few artisans?  Where is he going to get the timber, the slates, the wood and the various other things to get to that point at which half the very generous grant is given?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This, to my mind, is a national problem.  Seventy-three per cent. of our farmers live on valuations of £20 and under and they have been untouched, and their housing problems have been untouched, by all the legislation that has been passed through this House.  Deputy Murphy dealt with two things&mdash;he dealt with the repairing of the boreens and with the flight from the land.  A man living at the end of a boreen does not maintain <Col N="1209" /> a cul-de-sac.  Though his land may be of greater fertility than that of a man living at the mouth of the boreen, if it is put up for sale it will not realise half the price of the land at the mouth of the boreen for the very obvious reason that access to his land is very difficult and because the man living beside the main road has every facility.</P>
    <P>It is no wonder then that he does sell his land and that he does fly from it.  He has no way of getting into his farm and he has no way of erecting a new house.  Another fact which we must consider is that farms are getting bigger and bigger.  That applies in every county; it applies in the maritime counties in the West of Ireland as well as to Leinster and we want to ask ourselves, when examining the rural economy of Europe and the position of the small farmers in Spain, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Germany, should something not be done for the small farmers of this country from the moneys available under the National Development Fund.  We should see what can be done in a country like ours where we have no heavy industries, and we must pay particular attention to this matter of the erection of houses for that class of small farmer.  I strongly advocate a positive programme along these lines.  I strongly advocate an examination of this problem, and with it an examination of what can be done about the repair and the maintenance of the boreens.</P>
    <P>In Leinster, leaving out for the time being the other provinces, there are 44,607 holdings of £20 valuation and under, according to the <i>Statistical Abstract</i> of 1938.  Many of these may have disappeared since.  Recently I asked a colleague of mine from County Mayo if they had disappeared to any great extent in his county and he said they had not.  That problem remains and it will remain until we tackle it and until we give financial aid to the man at the end of the boreen.  If we do not give this man financial assistance to erect his new house his old one will topple and the rural population will continue to disappear.</P>
    <P>On this question of emigration I think our approach should be as realistic <Col N="1210" /> as possible, It has been pointed out to me that emigration has had its good effect as well as its evil for the nation.  In certain parts of the Midlands it was the habit for the whole family to grow up into bachelors and old maids.  Eventually there was none left and the farm was given to charity, or sold, or something like that.  Now there is a new approach to things in the Midlands.  The young people have discovered that they all cannot inherit the farm, that the farm will eventually go to the eldest.  So the others make way for the eldest son to get married and in that way, in that particular area, emigration is not such an evil thing as some people make out. Accordingly, there are more marriages as a result; there are more young marriages than there were from the turn of the century to 20 years ago.</P>
    <P>But returning to the problem of the erection of houses for the small farmer I should like to repeat that this is a problem that should be tackled and examined.  To the problem of the boreen there are two approaches&mdash;the one of repair and the other of maintenance. Year after year hundreds of thousands of pounds had been devoted to minor improvement schemes and to rural improvement schemes.  To the latter there is a contribution by the beneficiary and to my mind the money spent in this way has been money poured down the drain pipe.  The money spent there is being spent on the main roads and the farmer living along these roads has to fence his ditches and to breast his hedges in order to let the sun in on the road so that there will not be future uneconomic expenditure on the maintenance of the roads.  On the other hand, when we throw anything from £200 to £500 into a boreen we make no condition whatever about the ditches and the hedges so that the boreens eventually become closed in like the jungle in Africa and if you bring a motor-car through the boreens it is scratched on either side.</P>

I understand from statements made here that the Minister is prepared to give a substantial sum towards the cutting and the breasting of hedges along main roads and I now want to advocate further that a sum should be transferred to the county roads so that money could be provided by the county councils for this work.  These roads would first have been declared public roads.  The boreens could, in that way, be properly maintained.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Right.  There is another point I should like to make in connection with the main highways. Many of our towns are very, very old and want their streets widened in the worst way, and I think that the State should come in here and help out the local authorities in the provision of compensation to people affected by street widening programmes.  To give an example, I shall explain the position in Athlone.  Athlone is a very old town and its main street, Church Street, is very narrow.  Thanks, however, to the Church of Ireland authorities in the town, a big area of graveyard has been given in order that the street might be widened.  A local house occupier has also decided to give premises up for the same purpose, but the sum involved is very big and I think the State should come in here and help out the local authorities in the payment of compensation, because what applies to Athlone applies to various other towns up and down the country.</P>
      <P>The Minister should consider the point of view I am putting forward in relation to the giving of some State compensation to help out the local authority where street widening is concerned. I did not see this morning's papers, but I think the Minister will agree that the destruction to roads from the 8th December last onwards has been unprecedented.  In the Midlands we have suffered very severe snow storms and the roads have deteriorated much more than they usually deteriorate in a normal year. Not only should this grant be increased but increased grants should be given towards rehabilitation in regard to roads, and where the grants remain unexpended at the end of the financial year, it should be permissible for the local authority to carry those grants over into the next financial year instead of returning them to the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Murphy talked about the wonderful work that was done under the Local Authorities (Works) Act and he criticised the Fianna Fáil Government for cutting down the grants under that Act.  I do not agree with Deputy Murphy that wonderful work was done. <Col N="1213" /> I think there were some shocking abuses under that Act.  There was certainly grave abuse in the Midlands at any rate.  The works carried out were not of a lasting nature.  There was no contribution towards future maintenance. Indeed, it was money down the drain.</P>

      <P>I shall not pursue it any further.

      <P>I heard Deputy Briscoe and Deputy Bartley quote here something that Deputy Dillon, now Minister for Agriculture, said when this National Fund Bill was first introduced; he was quoted as describing the fund as a &ldquo;slush&rdquo; fund.  I do not think he was far wrong.  I and several other Deputies at that time, then in opposition, stated that the Bill was mere camouflage because two by-elections were pending.  It is obvious from the course pursued in this debate that it was a ridiculous and unnecessary piece of legislation because we are discussing here in a sense generally&mdash;possibly some Deputies may be discussing in a particular way &mdash; the Estimates for the various Departments.  However, since it has become an Act and has been accepted by the present Government and the present Minister for Finance we must only continue to make whatever use we can of it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickWPalmer" hpid="Mr. Palmer Mr. Palmer">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the £2,500,000 put into this fund from the Road Fund could quite properly be left to the Department of Local Government. In actual fact it really is left there.  I cannot understand where this fund exists at all.  Money is put into it <Col N="1214" /> from various Departments.  Why not leave the moneys in the various Departments and let the Departments do the work?  Is it not the Departments which will do the actual work?  It is the Department of Local Government which will spend the £2,500,000 put into this fund from the Road Fund.  A sum of £250,000 will be devoted to projects for the Gaeltacht.  Is it not the Gaeltacht services branch and the Department of Lands which will carry out that work?  The Board of Works would be responsible for the special employment schemes and so forth.</P>
      <P>It was ridiculous, in the first instance, to set up such a fund.  Now that the fund is there, however, we can only consider the best means of expending the money.  Deputy M.P. Murphy took exception to the fact that £500,000 is being spent on the development of Dublin harbour and £400,000 on Cork harbour.  That represents practically £1,000,000.  All these works may be necessary.  It is, however, a good thing that there was a change of Government or we would have had another £2,500,000 or possibly £4,000,000 spent on the renovation of Dublin Castle, and another £600,000 on the Bray road.  I hope these schemes will not be proceeded with and that the money that was set aside for these projects by the Fianna Fáil Government will be spent in the area in which I consider the greater portion of it should be spent, namely, the Gaeltacht or, as some would describe it, the undeveloped areas.  To enable that to be done a minute survey of the Gaeltacht areas should be carried out at the earliest possible moment in order to find out the requirements of the particular areas involved, such as drainage, land improvement, the rearrangement of uneconomic holdings and the transfer of uneconomic holders to other areas, the improvement of the fishing industry, and the improvement of the roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to roads, Deputies, members of local authorities and the people in general were glad to discover in this morning's Press that a sum of practically £1,000,000 extra was to be devoted to the further improvement of roads.  I understand it is the rule that the engineer attached to the local <Col N="1215" /> authority requires that a road must be a certain width in order to be steamrolled. I think it is 16 feet to 20 feet wide.  I would suggest in relation to the further improvement of county roads that, irrespective of width, they should be steamrolled.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickWPalmer" hpid="Mr. Palmer Mr. Palmer">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>In the carrying out of improvements my suggestion would save a lot of money and a greater portion of the roads could be steamrolled if a width of 16 to 20 feet were not insisted upon.  In years to come, when there would be further money available, the roads could be extended and widened.</P>
      <P>Quite recently, £80,000 was devoted from the National Development Fund for the purchase of boats, free of deposit, in Gaeltacht areas.  That would purchase only about ten 50-feet boats and I hope that provision will be made from the fund in the coming year for a further £80,000 or more, if possible, because it is necessary to develop the fishing industry in the Gaeltacht areas.  As another means of improving fishing, money should be devoted to the greater protection of our territorial waters.</P>
      <P>In order to brighten the lives of people in undeveloped areas it is necessary to extend rural electrification, even to the remotest glens.  In order to do that, it may be necessary further to subsidise the E.S.B.</P>
      <P>More money should be devoted to forestry because in the Gaeltacht, mountain and remote areas, forestry gives the greatest employment, not only temporary employment but almost permanent employment.  It has the further advantage that it will confer future benefit on the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1216" /> As turf generating stations are being erected in some areas along the western seaboard it is absolutely essential that at the earliest moment there should be full bog development. New roads should be built to the bogs and old roads should be repaired. In making the survey that I have suggested, consideration should be given to the question of what local industries it would be possible to establish in such areas.  If such industries were supported locally they would be entitled to grants under the Undeveloped Areas Act.</P>
    <P>It is in the way that I have suggested that real development can take place in the areas that require to be looked after in a special way, the Gaeltacht areas, if we are to keep our people in these areas and if the language is to be saved.  It is only by brightening their lives and enticing the people in these areas to stay at home that such areas can be made prosperous.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The importance of this Estimate demands that every Deputy should express his views on it, however briefly.  At this stage of the debate practically every point has been covered and one must necessarily be brief.  I remember speaking in this House when the National Development Fund was first introduced.  The debate took place on the last occasion the House sat before the Christmas Adjournment, 1953.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believed then, as I do now, that the establishment of the fund was a step in the right direction to provide for work, productive and otherwise, that could not be provided for out of ordinary expenditure as accounted for in the annual Book of Estimates.  It is not necessary to refer to the scorn and ridicule that was poured on the scheme at the time by people who now occupy the Government side of the House.  I thought it was a pity that that was the approach at that time because I do not believe that any member of the then Opposition believed that the fund would be used otherwise than honestly in the development of work and the provision of employment which was then very necessary and <Col N="1217" /> which is still, unfortunately, very urgently needed.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A slush fund&rdquo; was the common description applied to the fund.  I hope the last Deputy who spoke did not really mean what he said.  If he rereads his statement in the Official Report he will find that he said that he believes still it was a slush fund that was introduced, that the present Minister intends to carry it on.  I do not think he believes any such thing and I know the present Minister, while he may have said otherwise, did not believe it was slush money then. It was an unfair attempt to malign an important scheme which will always remain, no matter what Government is in the House, and will grow in importance from year to year.  The speech of every Deputy, no matter how much he condemned it, goes to prove how much the fund was necessary to carry out, even in a small way, the many projects enumerated by the last speaker.  If only £1,000 were given to each of the projects mentioned here, millions would not finance all the useful schemes mentioned, for most of which no provision is made in the Book of Estimates.</P>
    <P>I can visualise hundreds of schemes on which this fund can be used and in respect of which no other provision is made.  I suppose every Deputy could supply the Minister with a list of works which would consume the entire fund. Naturally, we do not want to see it all spent in Dublin or Cork, but I am sure the unemployed in both cities would be glad to get a share of it now. Unfortunately, along the western seaboard there is another outlet for the unemployed.  When their names disappear from the register at the employment exchange it usually means that they have bought a single ticket to cross the Channel.</P>
    <P>I do not want to mention again all the various things to which I would like to see money devoted out of the National Development Fund, but I would like to impress upon the Minister that in the allocation of this money he should keep uppermost in his mind the fact that the congested areas are becoming depopulated and <Col N="1218" /> the cities, like a magnet, are attracting the population into them, to nonproductive employment or the dole, while one by one the cabins on the hillside cease to send up smoke as year by year they become derelict and vacant.  This does not tend to an improvement in rural conditions.</P>
    <P>While the provision of money for harbours and landing places is essential, the Minister in the first place should take steps with regard to the lack of technical advisers in the marine section of the Board of Works.  There seems to be little or no technical staff available in that particular section, the fisheries section of the Board of Works, to undertake the huge amount of work which is lying there, which is crying out for attention and which would provide employment in two ways, first, in the actual carrying out of the work and, secondly, in the giving of better facilities to the inshore fishermen using them or to fishermen in other ports where there are craft large enough to go out into deeper water.</P>
    <P>One would think, listening to some of the speakers on the opposite side, that Fianna Fáil had only marked time, but Fianna Fáil in their time used money to develop areas where it was found useful and they did not spare it when it was found that it gave a good return.  I have only to cite a place like Killybegs in my own area as an example of a place where we have built one of the best harbours in Ireland, where we have the best fishing fleet in Ireland, as a result of development, where we have a quick-freeze plant, a fish meal industry, a boat-building industry and a kippering station&mdash;and the development has only been scratched yet.  If the Minister will extend a generous hand, there is no telling where development in that direction may end.  I hope there will be no curtailment or easing off of the assistance for the development of projects so useful in so many ways in relation to giving employment in the undeveloped areas such as the area I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>We have the tweed industry in Donegal, and while we would like to <Col N="1219" /> see money spent on capital development, everybody will applaud the spending of money on something which is productive.  In the world-famous Donegal tweed industry, we have an industry that is going from success to success and the Minister's predecessor did not spare money when it was found that its expenditure would improve the facilities for, employment in and development of that world-important industry, and we think it would be a crime at this stage not to give the necessary impetus to the development of that industry to the point to which it could develop and consequently put the Gaeltacht and undeveloped areas of Donegal in a position in which there would not be a single person on the unemployed roll.</P>
    <P>These are only some of the many things one can easily visualise on which money can be expended out of the National Development Fund.  It is wrong to say that the fund is unnecessary, that provision could be made in the ordinary Estimates, because, from examination during the year, many projects can be mooted which will require assistance and the usual red tape which is entangled in the Estimates which are voted annually would not attach in the same way to grants from the National Development Fund. In fact, that is or should be one of the features of the fund&mdash;that little or no red tape should impede progress on any project financed out of that fund. When we were on the other side of the House, the members of the present Government were always loud in condemnation of any effort we made to provide extra money, because it was a very nice thing for their constituents to read next day how they had opposed the raising of extra money by any means whatever, but when it comes to a question of spending, they are quite glad to have this money in their coffers, and they will not fail to try to take all the credit they possibly can out of the expenditure of that money.</P>

      <P>Deputies opposite voted against the provision of the money which they are now boasting they provided for roads.  They went into the lobby and opposed it, but that is where it comes from.  It was a very popular thing to oppose it, because it was with no great enthusiasm that we introduced the increased road tax.  It was a lovely thing to oppose it, but it is an even lovelier thing now for them to boast about the spending of it.  They cannot have it both ways.  They cannot oppose the raising of money and, at the same time, boast about how they can spend it, and that is what is taking place now.  When the Minister says that we left nothing, he forgets that he, too, voted against the provision of that money in the form of the increased road tax, although he is now cutting in on the debate to boast about the extra money available.  A Government can do many things if it has the money, but it can do very little without it.</P>

      <P>Now the Minister who was loudest in his condemnation of any effort to increase these funds while on this side realises what he can do with the extra money and he has definitely made no effort to curtail the revenue derived from the things he then opposed and which now bring in these moneys.  But that is not the point about which we should be concerned in <Col N="1221" /> this Estimate.  We are interested in the fact that we have the National Development Fund which can be used in many ways to develop the country in order that more people can have a better standard of living in it and find employment here, and so to frame national policy that eventually the maximum number of people will live in the maximum degree of comfort in their own country.  Anybody who says this is not a useful means towards that end is either speaking against his mind or does not know what he is speaking about.</P>
      <P>I see in the National Development Fund the forerunner of a great effort that will, or should eventually, lead towards the development of many projects in this country which otherwise would never be undertaken.  I think every Deputy who has spoken in this debate has already enumerated quite a few of them.  I hope the Minister has taken cognisance of the fact that practically every Deputy who has spoken so far on this fund has agreed that something should be done with regard to the particular road which is neither a county road nor a main road, which is nobody's child, and which is neglected except for an occasional special employment scheme or rural improvements scheme grant.</P>
      <P>Everybody concerned must now fully appreciate that the accommodation road which is not in any way the responsibility of the county council or of the local authority has become an important factor in our national economy and that something must be done to provide continuity in respect of the maintenance of such roads.  Up to the present, we have been making the best of a bad job.  Money was allocated annually for these roads in proportion to the unemployment figures in the electoral area concerned.  The money had to be expended within a particular period and the unemployment figures were taken in relation to a particular period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That system is outmoded.  These roads are no longer rights of way for carts, donkeys, or anything else.  They are now used for tractors and heavy lorries and they are used the whole <Col N="1222" /> year round.  Many of the people who are using the bogs or other lands to which such roads lead are depending almost entirely on their being able to bring their transport over these roads. Something must be done immediately if these roads are to be kept in a state in which they can be used continually by this new mode of transport which has come along in this mechanical age.  If the present Government do not do it, then, as soon as we become the Government again, we shall have to do it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;until we shall have to take responsibility for adopting means whereby these roads will be accepted as a national liability.  I believe that the present Minister is politically wise.  I hope he will heed the general appeal that has been made by Deputies to do something for such roads and to provide for their repair and maintenance.  I hope that either the Minister or his counterpart in the Cabinet will formulate a plan whereby these roads will be maintained.  I hope more money will be diverted to them thus ensuring&mdash;irrespective of the number of unemployed in the area&mdash; that, at any time of the year when the work requires to be done, a grant will be made available for the carrying out of the work forthwith.  It will be agreed by all that that is essential. Sometimes, during the turf haulage season, roads completely collapse.  The position then is that the local people must wait for a special employment scheme grant&mdash;and sometimes that is not given.  As a matter of fact, they might opt for a rural improvements scheme grant under which the people will contribute a portion of the money. Sometimes the difficulty arises that, because of some petty grievance, some of the people will not collaborate and then the whole scheme is held up. That system will have to be departed <Col N="1223" /> from, and the sooner the better.  I congratulate the Minister on his complete confession&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Every rural Deputy feels that he should make a contribution to this debate.  In my view, one of the reasons for unemployment is the high rate of interest, because it restricts the ability to provide money to handle the terrible scourge of unemployment. In the first place, I should like to congratulate the Minister on the steps he has taken at least to peg down the level of the rate of interest being charged in respect of moneys for capital development.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to Deputies trying to make political capital out of the very serious unemployment situation.  We are all only too <Col N="1224" /> familiar with the type of speech in which other Deputies are reminded of what they said five years ago, three years ago or last year.  It is the present that counts and we must all make a determined effort to help to solve the outrageous evil of unemployment. If we fail in our efforts then we should make way for other men who are prepared to break new ground and to take a chance in trying to solve the problem.  It may be that there are men in the country who are unconnected with politics but who can make a better fist of the solution of the unemployment problem than can the members of this House, as it is at present constituted.</P>
      <P>I should like to give the House an instance of the difficulties which face local authorities with regard to their estimates.  I am a member of the Kerry County Council.  Last Monday, at a preliminary estimates meeting, the deputy county manager said a rate of 57/10 in the £ would be necessary to provide the services required. This represents a jump from 41/9 to 57/10 in the £.  That is a serious situation. Naturally, we have to consider our very limited resources.  The rate has not yet been struck but, on hearing the proposal, every member of the county council felt that something would have to be done about the matter.</P>
      <P>The point I want to make is that we are also notified from different areas&mdash; particularly Gaeltacht areas&mdash;of the state of the roads there.  Next Monday a monthly meeting will be held and we shall receive a deputation on the subject of the condition of the roads in the backward areas.  I feel that moneys from the National Development Fund could be used for such purposes.  I admit that it would only be a temporary measure to stem unemployment and undoubtedly if we cannot find a more permanent remedy for unemployment our Gaeltacht will go and more than our Gaeltacht will go.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards temporary stop-gaps, such as the Local Authorities (Works) Act, I heard some Deputies put forward the opinion that it was money badly spent, <Col N="1225" /> but in my opinion it was money well spent.  Minor employment schemes, as far as I am aware, are next to impossible to get at the moment.  Rural improvements schemes, because the unfortunate people concerned are compelled to make a contribution, are given more favourable consideration; but as far as I am concerned it is next to impossible to get sanction for minor employment schemes.  I would ask the Minister to consider that as a stop-gap only.</P>
    <P>I have no solution for the problem, or any permanent solution, other than &mdash;as far as my experience goes and my knowledge of the local area goes&mdash;that afforestation is one of the permanent remedies for unemployment which will give a return at a future date.  It will give permanent employment, it will bring untold benefits.  I am sorry to say that that problem has not been tackled.  I am probably speaking out of turn and perhaps I should not raise it, but I hope I will be excused. In my area&mdash;I intend to raise this at a later date&mdash;there are thousands of acres suitable for afforestation which have not been touched.  If portion of the National Development Fund could be devoted to that scheme it would bring great benefit to a large area, in fencing and planting and all the other things that go with afforestation.</P>
    <P>The local authority is closer to the situation than anyone else.  The opinions of the local representatives should be collected and analysed with regard to these problems, including unemployment and housing, and portion of the fund could be devoted to them.  Housing is still a big problem and the rate of interest chargeable, both to the local authority and the occupant of the house, is becoming a crushing burden.  If something cannot be done about that, housing will be brought to a standstill and other development also.  If our financial questions cannot be tackled in some other way, development will have to stop because of the crushing burden of the interest.</P>
    <P>I am very glad to hear that the grants are being substantially increased for main and county roads. <Col N="1226" /> There are still hundreds of miles of road in our county which have not been taken over by the local authority, who are prevented because of lack of finance.  When we were presented by the deputy county manager with a rate of 58/10 in the £ it was time to call a halt&mdash;and that did not include any sum for those roads and for cul-de-sac roads on which there are groups of people living&mdash;nine and ten families living isolated, with only a boreen going to their group of houses.  Portion of the fund could be devoted to that and the local authority could be taken into the confidence of the Department and asked to submit proposals for the intelligent spending of portion of the money.  There are numerous other ways and every Deputy would be failing in his duty if he did not put up the greatest possible plea from his own constituency for portion of the money.</P>
    <P>Deputy Murphy and I have something very much in common with regard to unemployment and the dole. It is a pity this question cannot be tackled in a more intelligent manner. It has gone on for a number of years. Successive Governments have pursued the policy of giving dole, but it is like asking: &ldquo;Who will bell the cat?&rdquo;, &ldquo;Who will stop the dole and provide employment?&rdquo;  The big political Parties &mdash;and the small ones, too&mdash;will not venture, they will not take a chance, because there are people passing their lives on the dole who could not stand up if told: &ldquo;We are going to provide employment and stop the dole.&rdquo;  These people are passing their lives on a paltry pittance and are satisfied to go on and to live in hunger and ease.  It is a sorry state of affairs.  Nevertheless, some Government will have to tackle the problem, someone will have to bell the cat and then we may get somewhere.</P>
    <P>That problem must be got over and sufficient money must be provided from somewhere for our people to live in a reasonable standard of comfort, especially in the rural areas.  In the big centres, Dublin, Cork and Limerick, there is a reasonable good standard of living, but outside that there is not.  There is not, because <Col N="1227" /> money is too scarce.  I hope the Government and the Minister will tackle this problem objectively and pursue it to its logical conclusion.  In conclusion, I repeat that the views of the local authorities should be taken as to the best way to deal with stop-gap expenditure which will stem emigration and unemployment at the same time.</P>

      <P>I had not intended to intervene in this debate at all and would not have done so were it not for the irresponsible and mischievous statement made by Deputy Corry here last night.  I am sorry he is not present now, as his presence might inspire me to deal with him much more effectively than I hope to do in his absence.  He referred last night to the £400,000 which the Minister indicated had been allocated from the National Development Fund for the improvement of Cork harbour and he stated that in his opinion this was a waste of public money.  He said that most of the money was going merely into tearing the bottom of an old stream.  I think it will becomes a Deputy whose constituency borders on Cork harbour to make such a statement and I hasten to assure the Minister that that opinion is certainly not shared by people who have the interest of Cork City and its hinterland at heart.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Cork Harbour Commissioners have for very many years been advocating the supply of a grant such as this to do work that is very necessary. Cork harbour, the largest and best harbour in this country and one of the best harbours in Europe, has been hampered for some years because work that was necessary in the interests of trade and commerce in Cork and its hinterland could not be carried out for want of funds.  I am not a member of the Cork Harbour Board but I am conversant with the good work the members of the board have been doing.  They are members of various political Parties, but I can truthfully say that, in true Corkonian fashion, whether they are Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or Labour, when they sit down at a meeting of the Cork Harbour Commissioners <Col N="1228" /> they do what they can as Corkmen in the interests of the port of Cork.  I am sorry that Deputy Corry's colleague, Deputy McGrath, was not here to hear him make that statement.</P>
    <P>I feel it is my duty, as a Cork City Deputy, to place on record in this House our appreciation of the earmarking by the Minister of £400,000 for the improvement of Cork harbour. Furthermore, I think it is only fair to place on record also that I feel if there had been no change of Government a Fianna Fáil Minister would have done likewise and yielded to the pressure exerted by the Cork Harbour Commissioners for very many years.  I had hoped that we might get some statement from the Opposition as to whether or not Deputy Corry was issuing the official Fianna Fáil policy on the development of Cork harbour when he spoke last night.  Apparently, we will not have an opportunity of hearing that.</P>
    <P>Let me get away from that subject to say just a few, general remarks on this Supplementary Estimate.  It appears to me that in the main the Minister for Finance has been unjustly criticised for confining to £3,000,000 the Supplementary Estimate for the National Development Fund on the grounds, apparently, that £5,000,000 was voted last year.  I think there would have been much merit in the Opposition's argument if the whole of that £5,000,000 or the greater portion of it had been utilised during the year. The Minister in his statement, however, pointed out, and rightly so, that, although sums to the extent of £5,785,400 had been earmarked for various beneficial schemes up and down the country, in fact, only £1,500,000 of that amount had been used, leaving a balance of £4,250,000 earmarked for schemes but not utilised.</P>
    <P>The Supplementary Estimate adds £3,000,000 to that.  I feel that the Minister thereby has made sufficient provision in the fund to meet the demands in the forthcoming year.  This time next year, if he feels more is required, I am quite sure he will then recognise the good use that the money has been <Col N="1229" /> put to and provide the money.  I think it is only right to say that during last year many of the schemes for which money had been allocated could only be at the planning stage.  We may expect an increase in the tempo of the utilisation of the allocated amounts during the coming year.</P>
    <P>I think the second justification by the Minister should be apparent to all. It is not disputed, I think, that one of the aims of the fund is to relieve hardship at a time of excessive unemployment. Fortunately, our unemployment figures in recent months show a downward tendency.  Apparently, the Minister took that trend into account when allocating £3,000,000 to the fund this year.  I am glad to note that by so doing the Minister has indicated that he has sufficient confidence in the ability of this Government to maintain that very encouraging trend in our unemployment figure.</P>
    <P>Lastly, as some other speakers said here last night, I hope that none of us on any side of the House will ever allow himself to slide into a groove and think that anything around the 60,000 mark or under is not excessive unemployment. I do hope we will never use the National Development Fund as a cure-all for unemployment but that we will tackle the basic problem of unemployment and emigration in the way that all genuine Deputies would wish to do.</P>
    <P>I have confidence that the present Government, one of whose points in its programme is to do all in their power to relieve unemployment, will continue to do so and that, ultimately, there will be no need for us to introduce a Supplementary Estimate for such a fund as this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFlynn" hpid="Mr. J. Flynn Mr. J. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>As a member of Kerry County Council, I agree with my friend, Deputy O'Connor, in appreciating the Government's increase in regard to moneys for road development and road grants.  There is a point in the Minister's statement to which I should like to refer.  It is this question of money for farm buildings and water supplies. In that connection, I should like to remind the Minister that the grant allowed in respect of farm buildings <Col N="1230" /> is not at all adequate.  I am informed that the grants are based on 1940 prices.  There is no increase in respect of grants for farm buildings, the amenities required in farm yards and other things required by farmers. The amount given is not at all sufficient.  In fact, it is estimated that the grant should be twice or two and a half times the amount to meet present day requirements.  That is an important factor in so far as the farming community are concerned.  There is an allocation of £200,000 in respect of farm buildings and water supplies. If relevant, I should like to have that question examined.</P>
      <P>The other point concerns the survey of roads and road works in regard to turf-generating stations.  I also appreciate what the Government have done in that respect but the amounts fall far short of requirements.  I think the amount that will be allocated to our county is £18,000.  I appreciate that is a great advance but in view of the great development that we expect to take place and the number of roads which the producers will require to be developed, I think that amount could be very much increased.  If that is done the areas concerned will produce on a considerable scale; the unemployment position will be eased and the maximum production assured.</P>
      <P>The last paragraph of the Minister's statement concerns the question of other projects being considered and the matter of a decision.  We have, for example, some long standing proposals in South Kerry.  There is the question of the erection of a bridge to Valentia Island and the carrying out of a hydro electric scheme on the Commerah River at Waterville.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, in the course of his statement, referred to the fact that he had provided moneys for schemes submitted to his Department by the Minister for Industry and Commerce. I am wondering if he got any proposal from the Minister for Industry and Commerce in respect to this hydroelectric scheme which has been under consideration for a number of years. It is held up at the moment because local people have raised objections in <Col N="1231" /> regard to the fisheries and fishery development.  I think that no Government should allow any vested interest, or anybody else, to hinder or obstruct the carrying out of a scheme of national importance such as that scheme is, one which would, in fact, give a considerable amount of employment in the initial stages of its execution and also in the future.  I am anxious to know from the Minister if it will come into the category of schemes referred to in the last paragraph of his statement.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred to schemes of national development.  There is the question of unemployment.  It goes without saying that schemes, such as the one I have mentioned as well as afforestation and other works, are of very great importance because of the big amount of employment they give. I want to refer to the question of afforestation.  I have already mentioned it to the Minister for Lands.  Great play and, if you like, propaganda has been made on this question by every Government that we have had.  We have been speaking about it for a long number of years.  Ministers in every Government have referred to it and rightly so as a question of national importance.  I would like to point out that over a number of years a good deal of money has been spent in acquiring land in three different areas in my county for the purpose.  While that is so, what do we find?  That half a dozen men have been employed in each area. Fancy having such a small number of men employed in areas where from 600 to 1,000 acres of land have been acquired for afforestation.  So far there is no prospect of any big scheme, which would give employment on a large scale, being carried out.  I had a question down to the Minister for Lands some time ago, and was told, six months ago, that, when certain development had taken place, the number of men employed would be increased. I have discussed the matter since with the local forester who told me that there is no immediate hope of an extra number of men being employed.</P>
    <P>I suggest that this is a very important matter for the Minister for Finance <Col N="1232" /> and the Government to consider because when we were speaking about afforestation schemes recently, and some years ago, mention was made of providing employment for 50 and 100 men on some of them.  At least we thought so, but the position in South Kerry at the moment is as I have just mentioned.  The position in Glencar, Glenbeigh and in the Milltown district at the moment is that only half a dozen men are employed in each place, a total of 18 men. One would have gathered from the Minister for Lands that up to 1,800 acres were to be developed in these three areas.</P>
    <P>The Minister, as I said earlier, referred in his statement to schemes still under consideration.  In that respect, I hope that he will take into consideration the question of the construction of the bridge to Valentia Island.  A considerable number of men could be employed in that work which, I submit, is one of national importance. It would mean the linking up of the island with the mainland.  We have 1,200 or 1,500 people on the island at the moment who are, so to speak, isolated.  I hope the Minister will consider having that work put into operation. I suggest that it could be financed out of moneys from this fund. With Deputy O'Connor I, as a member of the Kerry County Council, appreciate the advance that is being made in respect of some other schemes.  We also appreciate the difficulties which any Government will find itself in by acceding to all the applications which come in from the different counties.  We are unanimous in our appreciation of the sums of money which have been allocated to our county, as well as to every other county, in the way of Road Fund grants.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickGiles" hpid="Captain Giles Captain Giles">
      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>I have my own opinion as regards this fund.  I have listened to the speeches which have been made on this Estimate during the past few days and the conclusion that I have been driven to is that talk is very cheap.  There has been far too much window-dressing.  Originally, when this fund came before the House, we were told that money would be made available for the establishment <Col N="1233" /> of industries in the Gaeltacht and in the West.  I should like to know what has been done in that respect during the past two years with money from this fund.  I do not know that anything has been done, and I think it is time to bring this fund to an end.  I think that Deputy Dillon, the present Minister for Agriculture, gave it its proper name when he described it at the outset as &ldquo;a slush fund.&rdquo;  There has been political play-acting with it and nothing else.  It provides a means of demoralising the people and demoralising political Parties.</P>
      <P>I thought myself that, when this Government came into office, the present Minister for Finance would abolish it, and see that if there were any surplus moneys available they would be spent by the different Departments in the normal decent way.  If that were done we would not have any of the political play-acting which there has been since this fund was established. The political play-acting was started by those on the other side of the House.  I hope that it is not now going to start on this side, because if that were to happen it could be said that one side was as bad as the other. I am satisfied that since this Government is a realist Government we should face up to our responsibilities. We always knew that this fund was a fake.  Therefore, I think when this Government came into power they should have abolished the fund and be honest about it.  I hope that we are not going to carry the fool a bit farther, now that we are in power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One thing that strikes me about expenditure out of this fund is that the schemes which have been undertaken have a very small labour content. They are not giving much employment to our people.  In my opinion, it would be much better, instead of having this fund, if more money were made available for the Land Commission.  There is plenty of work for it to do if it had the money.  It could spend up to five or ten million pounds on very useful schemes.  There is still a great need for bog development schemes.  In my opinion, millions of pounds could be spent on work of that nature as well as on afforestation.  We are not getting <Col N="1234" /> ahead half quickly enough.  Why not spend a million or two on afforestation and cut out the slush fund?  The same applies to building. Why not spend a million or two on housing and cut out the slush fund and spend the money through the ordinary Departments?</P>
    <P>Again, in the case of the fishing industry we heard a lot about it in the last 20 years but we have seen very little money being spent in the manner in which it should be spent.  Another £1,000,000 more could be spent on ports and docks and such things.  Why not spend it through the Department and cut out the slush fund?  The same applies to harbour development, the money could be spent through the harbour commissioners.  But no, it must be all political money spent for political purposes.  We are all crying out about the flight from the land, but how much of this fund is going to be spent on the land?  It is going to be spent on spectacular schemes that will take people away from the land.</P>
    <P>Take any ordinary farmer in this country with a £50 valuation and you will find that he employed one or two labourers in the past, but now he has nobody employed except, perhaps, his own family.  We talk about the age of people getting married and about old people who will not give up control. How can they give up control when there is no place for them to go and when no effort is being made to remedy this situation?  Is it not a fact that on every holding of 50 or 60 acres we need two homes, one for the old family and one for the new family coming in?  We know the old family does not want to give up control because if it did it would have no security, but if this State has a slush fund with plenty of money why not earmark some of this to build a second house on such farm holdings and give the old people a chance to retire to the new house or let the young family move into the new house and the old people stay on where they are.  Then the boy or girl getting married could take over the other house.</P>
    <P>If we have money available why not do that, and then we would have our <Col N="1235" /> aged farmers stepping out of the way with the young farmer coming in and marrying at 21 or 22 and bringing up a family in a businesslike and thrifty way.  He would then be content whereas at present he is not content. The unfortunate son who stays at home is 40 or 50 before he has the slightest chance of getting control and getting married and that is the cause of the flight from the land.  I believe there should be a second home on such farm holdings so that we can have the two families living in harmony side by side.  We do not expect a new couple coming into the house to get on with the old couple in the same kitchen. Human nature does not allow it.  Let us give them two kitchens and if we do that, we will be doing something of benefit for this country.</P>
    <P>This money should be utilised to the fullest extent on the land, for bog development, afforestation, building, fisheries and repairing of harbours. Cannot this money be spent through the ordinary Departments?  And as far as we can, we should get some of the money spent by private enterprise.  If we continue as we are going, I can see nothing but demoralisation on every side.  Private enterprise will be squeezed dry.  Why should anyone do anything when the State steps in and pushes him out of the way to do it for him?  Why not let the people spend their own money in their own way? We are taxing them to the extent of £5,000,000 to have this slush fund but why not let the people have this money and spend it themselves?</P>
    <P>I believe the make-up of this House is political and no serious, self-sacrificing effort is made by the House to do the honest thing by the people.  If such an effort were made, I think you could cut taxation by almost 50 per cent.  Instead, year by year we increase taxation and the State must spend this here and that there and let private enterprise do nothing at all.  I believe our people could carry a bigger load in their own way if they were let alone. But no, we must play-act here in a big way with public money.  I believe we are squeezing private enterprise dry <Col N="1236" /> and leaving our people soft and flabby and good for nothing.  If we allow the people to spend the money where it is needed in improving their own houses and the position of their own families, we will get better returns.</P>
    <P>Talking like that in a materialistic age, is, I suppose, just foolishness or what is called whistling against the wind.  I do not believe in any money being easily obtained; I believe it should be got the hard way.  This slush fund is only something to dangle before the people.  One always knows when an election is coming.  Roads are repaired, fishery industries are to be started and bogs are to be opened up. Then you have the election and the road repairs stop; the bogs that were opened close down and the fishery industry never starts.  Still the slush fund is there to be talked of year in and year out.  I think it is sickening to have this social security, these doles and slush funds and all these things. I think we are leading the people completely astray in this, the grandest little country on God's earth with its good, Christian people.  They are being demoralised by this House because that is what I see going on here.</P>
    <P>Why not face up to it in a big way, in a manly way, and cut down taxation where you can, and not have those funds lying there?  There was £5,000,000 in the Fund last year and I think only £1,500,000 was spent.  One thing I do know is that none of it was spent in my county.  Why have it lying there idle?  Why not leave it in the people's pockets where it would be far better?  There is too much spectacular nonsense going on.  Take my county&mdash;not one penny of this fund ever came to us, or ever will.  We were never earmarked for it.  What about Meath where, because of floods, we had 23 bridges wiped out and it will cost £30,000 to repair them?  We are putting up £30,000 to repair them and we want no slush money from anyone. I wish the people of the country elsewhere would do the same, but they will not.  I think in my area we are as poor as any others.</P>
    <P>I see migrants who are supposed to come to my country from very poor, primitive areas, and yet when they <Col N="1237" /> arrive they are found to be as well off as anyone else.  In fact, they seem to come up with big bank accounts and compete with and beat the Westmeath and Dublin men on the markets.  Still we have to subsidise them.  We in the eastern parts are getting nothing. Take my own area, in Laytown and Bettystown, where there is a grand strand and health resort, and not one penny was ever spent there or ever will be spent because vote-catching money is not needed there.  The politicians must get down to the other side of the country where vote-catching is very necessary, or to the City of Dublin where vote-catching is necessary, but along the eastern coast there are only a few votes and the attitude is: We will spend nothing there.  We never get a penny.</P>
    <P>I hope the present Minister, who appears to be realistic, will close down this fund, and let the money we have be spent through the normal channels. When you start this slush fund you start an executive of officials to work it and you must send them scurrying all over the country and you find after two years there is only £1,500,000 worth of work done.  I would like to know what executive staff is required to work this fund and what they have cost?  The same thing occurs in the county councils where you have this red-tape, civil service mentality.  The attitude seems to be that, when this money is there, you must get a big staff around about it and see what they can do about it.  When the thing is wound up there is a lot of scurrying but nothing is done.  A lot of money is wasted on pure nonsense.</P>
    <P>Is that what we got our freedom for? Are we doing the best thing by the people?  I want this slush fund cut out.  We struggled for a purpose; we struggled in order to be enabled to allow our people to remain in their own country, and rear their families; we did not struggle so that they might be for export.  We are not making the slightest effort to stem this flow from the land.  The people are flocking from it.  If this slush fund was used on it, it would stop a few gaps.  If we do not do something how can we expect <Col N="1238" /> our men to marry at 20 or 25?  If we wish them to do so, then give them a second house on the holding; at least give them a fair chance of building a second house on that holding.  Then when they marry and rear a family you will have the population increasing once more.  There is no effort being made to do anything about this problem.  If we are in earnest about changing the economy of this country, let us do our duty and cut out the slush fund.  Any money we have to spend should be spent through the Departments in the ordinary way, in the interests of the people, so that politics and play-acting may not play any part in the building up of this nation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I heartily agree with one point made by Deputy Giles.  I agree with him when he said that for months before elections many promises were made, perhaps by all Parties, and all Governments.  Apart from that I am afraid that the famous or infamous Youghal Bridge, about which we have heard so much, would not gulf the stream which lies between the views expressed by him and the views I wish to express.</P>
      <P>If this is to be a National Development Fund, I think we must consider whether it is to be based on something of a permanent or temporary nature. If it is to be based on expediency, then we know it will always be utilised by whatever Government is in power in keeping with the views that that Government may hold.  I believe it is far more important that we should try and face this problem in a sensible, realistic way, and to ensure that development schemes will be based on a programme of a permanent nature, which the over-all economy of this country deserves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies have spoken about the problems of unemployment, emigration, and emergency schemes, The problem of unemployment will only be cured if we base our programme on national development which will be directed in such a way that no matter what Government is in power the programme will give to this country economic stability, will give a fair return for the <Col N="1239" /> money spent, and will be of advantage to the people.  I believe, and members of the Labour Party believe, that unemployment must be tackled in a different way from what it has been in the past.  It is true to say, unfortunately, that emigration has been one of our biggest problems, not for the past three, four or five years, but throughout our history.  I am afraid that Governments at various times have not realised the problem as they should have.</P>
    <P>With regard to the figures given by the Minister in introducing this Estimate, I think what is of vital importance is that, of the amount of money allocated in the past, so little has been spent.  As we know, it was the last Government who introduced this scheme, which I believe was introduced in a state of panic at the time, simply and solely to meet an emergency.  It was not brought in and operated in such a way that the money allocated was spent, not leaving us an unexpended balance.  It is well known that when this scheme was introduced the Labour Party supported it.  We had no hesitation in doing so.  Our only note of warning at the time was that it was being introduced as a stop-gap, in such a limited way, to try to help the national development, and that it would not give us the benefits which we consider essential in this country.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I believe it is most important for us, when speaking on this issue of national development, to say that we cannot be satisfied, whether we are part of the Government or in opposition, to have a knowledge of the £4,000,000 or £5,000,000 introduced in one year or £3,000,000 or £4,000,000 in another year, and then ultimately find that only a fraction of that has been expended.  Undoubtedly, some of the money which has been earmarked has been spent on very good projects.  At least it is a consolation to know that even if it is on a limited scale, if the money has not already given a return, it will undoubtedly do so.  As time goes on we will see the benefit of such a policy.  There is no need for me to mention anything about roads.  So <Col N="1240" /> many members have already spoken from all sides of the House on this particular aspect of the matter that I shall not say very much on it.  But what I appreciate, and what all the members of the Labour Party appreciate, is the fact that we know that every £ provided for road works has a two-fold advantage &mdash; it gives much-needed employment to the people entitled to it in rural Ireland, and it helps to provide good roads in areas where they are badly wanted.  Both of these advantages are essential.  I think that the most important of these two questions is the providing of employment for the people who need it in the rural areas.  I feel, however, that no Government could be completely satisfied that continuous employment could be provided in this way for a certain number of men working for the various county councils.  Only a certain sum of money is being allocated to these councils.  We have had the experience in certain districts that road workers have been faced with this problem: that when the roads in their areas had been put into good condition they were faced, if not in the near future, certainly in the not too distant future, with the spectre of unemployment.</P>
    <P>In many parts of the country the only two possible avenues of employment for the rural worker are the chances of a job with the county council or with the farmer, and surely while we are providing, as we must provide, sums of money for the improvement of our county roads, we must ask ourselves the question as to what we are prepared to do in the way of providing other forms of employment for these men when the time comes when there will be no further need for such comprehensive schemes of road improvement. I think myself that the National Development Fund has been much too limited and much too restricted during the period of its operation.  Much has been said about agriculture.  We have been told that £936,000 has been allocated to agriculture.  I agree that every penny of it is being put into projects which I believe to be very essential for the betterment of the country's economy and I have no <Col N="1241" /> intention of elaborating on the question. I should like, however, to say that there should be sufficient money in the kitty, as it were, at all times to provide for any urgent expenditure on agriculture, so that there might be no necessity to draw on the National Development Fund for such expenditure. Surely it should be unnecessary, except on very odd occasions, for us to say that we have failed to provide a sufficiency of money for agricultural projects and that we had consequently to draw on the National Development Fund.</P>
    <P>Great credit is due to the Government&mdash;in fact it is due to the last Government also for having brought in this measure&mdash;for having provided £400,000, through the Department of Industry and Commerce, for work in Cork harbour.  Many other Deputies from the South have already spoken on this matter and I believe that, contrary to the views expressed by Deputy Giles &mdash; and when I mention his name I should like to say that it is a pleasure at all times to listen to the views of Deputies from every county&mdash;this money will mean a much greater revenue to one of the important ports of this country.  I am afraid that at times some of us may have failed to realise the importance of having such a port at the present moment.  I do not mind the remarks made by one Deputy when he spoke of cleaning the bed of a stream.  On that matter it is really sufficient for me to say that where ignorance is bliss it is folly to be wise.  I shall say quite clearly, as other Deputies from Cork have said, that I think every penny of this £400,000 is being well spent and I think that credit is due to the Government for the way in which it has been provided.</P>
    <P>There are very few additional remarks that I want to make because so many members have already spoken. I believe, however &mdash; and I think this opinion was expressed by one other Deputy &mdash; that we cannot afford to lose sight of the importance of possible development in other fields to which we gave such small service in the past.  In that I am leaving out agriculture because of its own particular importance and because it gets pride of <Col N="1242" /> place.  One of the problems with which we have been concerned is that of the fisheries.  Surely if we are sincere in our concern for national development we would not be speaking of providing £2,000,000 or £3,000,000 for a spread-over programme when we have the possibility of real national development there.  We are shelving the possibility of added national wealth if we fail to face a problem like the fisheries.</P>
    <P>My final remarks should, I think, be devoted to the hope that we will face properly the whole question of national development in relation to what we believe should be the right of a development committee to have powers of initiation in so many important problems in relation to national development. What is going to happen in that regard?  At the moment we are on the Government side but it must be remembered that, no matter what Government may be in office in five, ten or 15 years, we are only retarding development if we do not get away from the system under which we have to make inquiries from Department to Department, from one section of one Department to another section of another Department and eventually to the Department of Finance.  Surely we all agree that we have in this country the brains to help us to solve national problems and to build up a true system of economy here.  Why is it that, though we could have a committee capable of solving important problems, after 12 months a Minister would come along and say, as he is justified in saying under the present system, that progress has been slow?</P>
    <P>I believe the fault is ours and that until we remedy that fault we can make no progress as regards the development of the country.  Let us therefore realise that first and foremost national development must be at the top, as it were.  The brains and the ability are there but I believe that the present system is retarding our efforts.  We must always regard national development as of such importance that we are always prepared to provide sufficient money to promote it.  It is true that last year we provided more money than was required but that is so only because of the <Col N="1243" /> faulty system under which we have been operating.  I believe that if we face this problem in a truly realistic fashion we well may hear less in the years to come about emigration; we may hear less about the problems of unemployment and we may hear more about the happiness of a contented people in their own country.</P>

      <P>When this National Development Fund was initiated by Fianna Fáil the then Opposition levelled all kinds of criticism at it. Nothing was left unsaid or undone to misrepresent and belittle the purpose for which it was set up.  Even though that is so, we are very glad that the present Minister for Finance, Deputy Sweetman, and his Government have decided to continue the operation of the fund because we believe that the national economy can benefit considerably from it, and schemes of a really beneficial nature can be financed from this fund.  Before the advent of the present Administration schemes totalling £6,521,900 had been sanctioned, and I would like to hear from the present Minister when he is replying what new schemes have been added to that list and if any of the schemes approved by his predecessor have been cancelled because I feel it would be a great mistake if the Minister decided to cancel out the schemes that his predecessor had planned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the six or seven months before the change of Government the National Development Fund was responsible for enlarging the Road Fund to the extent of £2,500,000.  I do hope the Minister will find it possible to continue that policy because we Deputies on all sides of the House realise the necessity for building up the biggest possible Road Fund for the improvement of our roads generally but particularly our by-roads or our county roads.  I sincerely hope the Minister will not avail himself of the increased yield to the Road Fund from the increased motor taxation to shirk his responsibility and not give from the National Development Fund at least as much as, and if possible more than, was given in the six or seven months prior to the change of Government.  We <Col N="1244" /> all conscientiously believe that the Road Fund should be made as big as possible and used specifically for road making.  If the Minister succeeds in doing this he will be doing a very good job of work.</P>
    <P>Before the change of Government, from November, 1953, to June, 1954, the Special Employment Schemes Office was allocated £900,000 from the National Development Fund for rural improvement schemes, minor employment schemes and bog development schemes.  Many Deputies have spoken about the necessity for doing something more spectacular in connection with cul-de-sac roads and it is not necessary for me to reiterate what has already been said but I would like to make one simple suggestion to the Minister, that he would set aside a specific sum from the National Development Fund to meet the local contribution for the financing of rural improvement schemes.  We all know the difficulty in securing from the beneficiaries under a rural improvement scheme the local contribution and if the Minister could set aside a sum to meet the local contribution he would be making the rural improvements scheme much more practicable and much more acceptable to the people in rural areas who are in dire need of special consideration so far as cul-de-sac roads are concerned.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will also find it possible to continue the policy of allocating moneys from the National Development Fund for roads leading to the hand-won turf generating stations.  Again, local authorities, county councils especially, find it impossible to carry out all the repairs that are needed in our villages and small country towns.  If a specific sum could be set aside for such improvements it would be a very good thing.  The paths in many villages and country towns are in a deplorable condition and, while local authorities are very anxious to carry out this work, the financial implications of it make it impossible for county councils to come to these works as soon as we all desire.  The cleaning of derelict sites and their development for road making and the erection of halls in the <Col N="1245" /> rural areas would be other ways in which the fund could be spent beneficially. If money is devoted to these purposes I feel it will be of great benefit to the rural areas.</P>
    <P>From time to time we rural Deputies hear of mineral deposits in certain parts of the country and whether the contentions that are made are of a sound nature or not we are not in a position to say but I feel it would be a good thing for the Minister to set aside a sum to carry out geological surveys to ascertain if certain mineral deposits exist and to carry out boring operations to determine whether coal deposits exist in certain areas or not. Most of these operations will not be carried out by private enterprise but if it were clearly established that mineral deposits existed in a particular region I think the necessary capital would become freely available for the development of such mineral deposits. I, therefore, ask the Minister to consider seriously setting aside a specific sum for the carrying out of geological surveys in certain areas.</P>
    <P>Many speakers have referred to the plight of small farmers as far as housing is concerned.  I do not wish to delay the House except to join my voice with the other speakers who have referred to this particular problem. People who reside on uneconomic agricultural holdings are not able to avail themselves of the grants that are already given for the erection of a new house and until something much more generous is done for these people a lot of them will continue to live in the old mud-walled cabins which they are in at the moment.  The Minister should consider carefully and sympathetically the plight of these people and make available grants of a much more generous nature for the erection of new houses for them.</P>
    <P>If the Minister can see his way to give favourable consideration to the few suggestions I have made I feel he will earn the gratitude of a very large number of people.  He will have taken a very practical step towards solving the unemployment problem in rural areas and he will give to the people who have been neglected up to now a benefit that is long overdue to them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that the present Minister for Finance has introduced this Supplementary Estimate of £3,000,000 thereby continuing the good work which was started when the fund was established, is an indication that he is alive to the situation generally with regard to unemployment and the development of the country. Some Deputies remarked yesterday that the National Development Fund was instituted for the purpose of augmenting money which had already been put aside by local authorities and different Departments for the carrying out of certain projects.  I think that is a correct description of the purpose of this fund.</P>
      <P>Much emphasis has been laid by different speakers on the necessity for allotting as much money as possible for the upkeep and repair of side roads and culs-de-sac.  In my opinion the money could not be better spent.  It is rather pitiful, travelling around the counties, to see the condition of these county roads.  The people have had to tolerate these bad conditions but I think the time has come when something definite and something concrete must be done to help them.  Recently, somebody described these county roads as &ldquo;coffin roads&rdquo;; in many instances that description is very apt.  I hope the Minister will allocate as much as possible from this fund to the Special Employment Schemes Branch so that the present unsatisfactory position will be remedied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has stated that the fund can be drawn upon for the purpose of speeding up certain works programmes and for the initiation of new schemes with a high labour content. That is a very laudable purpose and, in connection with that, I wonder would the Minister consider regional water supply schemes and sewerage schemes.  These have a high labour content.  I trust that he will give favourable consideration to any requests made to him for financial aid for the carrying out of such schemes. Many local authorities are anxious to inaugurate such works but are debarred from doing so because they know the rates will soar.  From that <Col N="1247" /> point of view they are severely handicapped. I mention these two specific matters because Louth County Council and the Dundalk Urban Council have applied for grants from this fund for the purpose of carrying out water and sewerage schemes.</P>
    <P>The scope of this fund is, as far as one can see, limitless and I think the Minister will have a fairly difficult task in trying to please everyone.  Nevertheless, I am sure he will do a good job when it comes to allocating the actual moneys.  Different speakers have sponsored different projects.  I hope that the Minister will give favourable consideration to the requests for improving county roads and for bringing water and sewerage to the people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMGlynn" hpid="Mr. Glynn Mr. Glynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, let me say that I approve of this Development Fund as a new member to this House because the country as a whole is so under-developed that some assistance from an outside source is vitally necessary.  I have in mind, in particular, water schemes and sewerage schemes, particularly in those areas where the rates are high and the land is thinly populated.  In that connection, my own county comes to mind at once. Ballinasloe will serve as a good example of an area where the rates are exceedingly high; indeed, we have almost the highest rateable valuation in Ireland; the rates this year are over 45/- in the £.  At the same time there is a crying need for water-supply schemes and sewerage schemes.  We simply cannot undertake these unless we get assistance from a fund, such as this fund.  We can only do a very limited amount of work without putting an excessive burden on the people and, from that point of view, these schemes have to be shelved year after year.  The burden at the moment is excessive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to development, first things should come first, and these essentials should be top priority in the development of our country.  We hear a good deal about providing funds for industry.  In a sense industry should be left to private enterprise initially and should be assisted, where such <Col N="1248" /> assistance is needed, to a limited extent and in relation to the merits of the particular industry itself and the need for it.  The first essential is to see that our people have proper water facilities and adequate sewerage facilities, particularly in the small towns.</P>
    <P>As far as labour content is concerned, the desirability and the necessity for such schemes should prompt the Minister to allocate a reasonably substantial proportion of this fund for drainage in the smaller catchment areas which are not at the moment within the scope of the Board of Works programme or the arterial drainage scheme actually in hands or intended in the future.  I have in mind one river in my own constituency, the Kilimor.  I am sure there are similar rivers in other constituencies.  Now along that river there are substantial portions of land and a very large number of small farmers are seriously affected by flooding year after year.  I imagine that the labour content in a drainage scheme on that river would be high.  It would solve two problems: it would help to solve the unemployment problem in the area and it would be of tremendous benefit to the farming community because it would enable them to reclaim large portions of their holdings.  These are matters which we rural Deputies will press on the Minister very strongly and I would like him to consider them very seriously when allocating the moneys in this fund.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate has roamed over almost every aspect of our national life.  In some respects, Deputies dealt with problems as they saw them, and genuinely saw them, in their own constituencies.  In other respects, I am afraid some Deputies dealt with them in a much more irresponsible fashion.  Last night and to-day Deputy Bartley dealt with one point and it is a point that I would like to dispose of first.  He complained very bitterly of a decision that had been taken in respect of a project under consideration in relation to Inis Thiar island.  I would not mind him putting forward his point of view in respect of that island and in respect <Col N="1249" /> of the works in which he was interested there provided he had not tried to make it, in addition, an argument of general application.</P>
      <P>He suggested that, not merely were we anxious to ensure that no progress would be made in respect of the work on that island but that we were also anxious to cut down on work generally in those islands, as typifying our policy in relation to the West.  Of course, the facts, as the Deputy knows and knows very well, are entirely contrary.  Not merely have we shown that such is not our intention but during the course of last year, when an opportunity arose to expand substantially a project that had been initiated by the previous Government on the neighbouring island of Inis Meadhon, that expansion was immediately sanctioned and put in hand.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy entered into such detail of what he alleged was the position in respect of Inis Thiar, it might be as well if I repeated the facts already given to the House by the Minister for Local Government on another occasion.  The facts are that the reason for the delay in the projected work there is solely because Deputy Bartley when he was Parliamentary Secretary tried to override the technical officers who advised as to the best place at which this harbour construction work should be undertaken. I shall not in this House go into the reasons why he did so.  I am fully aware of those reasons and I do not think that they are adequate or sufficient to override the views of technical advisers as to the best siting for the works, nor do I think really that they do any great credit inasmuch as they were the cause of the work being held up for a substantial period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Bartley also seems to object to my informing the people about decisions I have taken.  Tradition, courtesy and, indeed, the duty of Ministers is, when they are asked either in this House or elsewhere, about decisions which they have already taken, to inform their inquirers of those decisions, particularly when those inquirers are public representatives.  The allegations that were made by the Deputy in respect of these matters are typical of <Col N="1250" /> the irresponsibility with which he approached the discussion of this Estimate, an irresponsibility which, for example, the last paragraph of his speech, as reported in to-day's issue of the <i>Irish Press</i>, specifically connotes. He is reported in the <i>Irish Press</i> as saying that in the latter half of last year insurable employment had decreased by 3,000 people.  His exact words were: &ldquo;Those who were in insurable employment in the latter half of last year were 3,000 less than the previous year.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Deputy is not a raw new Deputy to this House.  He is well aware of the manner in which information as regards employment can be obtained from the Central Statistics Office, the <i>Trade Journals</i> and elsewhere.  I am quite sure that the <i>Trade Journal</i> of last December was fully available to him and, if he takes the trouble to look at page 250 of that journal, he will find that, instead of there being that decrease of 3,000 people to which he referred, there is an increase in September, 1954, as against September, 1953, of 3,240 people in insurable employment. That type of irresponsible statement does not, I suggest, do this House or the Party for whom a Deputy in that position speaks any real credit.</P>

      <P>Deputy Briscoe gave us a longish dissertation yesterday on the Special Works Section of the Dublin Corporation.  The Deputy tried to make it appear that there had been an effort by me as Minister for Finance or by the Minister for Local Government or by the combination of both of us to cut down the work of that Special Works Section of the Dublin Corporation in a way that was not anticipated, that was not visualised, that was not intended by our predecessors in office.  The Deputy, <Col N="1251" /> in so doing, was very careful to avoid anything specific but, of course, the implication was there and the innuendo was there just the same as it was when he attempted to do this before on the 23rd June last.</P>
      <P>The position in respect of the allocation from the National Development Fund to the Special Employment Schemes Office or to the Vote for Employment and Emergency Schemes, as it is more technically known, is on the record and the record is perfectly clear.  On 10th April, 1954, a sum of £500,000 was suggested to my predecessor as being a suitable allocation from the National Development Fund to the Employment and Emergency Schemes Vote.  On 22nd May, my predecessor in office personally directed the issue of a minute that, not £500,000, but a decrease of £100,000 on that amount&mdash;£400,000&mdash;was to be the amount allocated from the National Development Fund to that Vote.</P>

      <P>The allocation that was requested by the then Parliamentary Secretary on the 10th April and that was ruled on by my predecessor on the 22nd May is clearly, beyond question, the additional supplement that was to go to that fund for the financial year 1954-55.  More than that, when that allocation was in fact made, there was, on 1st June, a determination by my predecessor of the manner in which that £400,000 was to be segregated and divided between employment schemes in one county borough and another and, on that date, my predecessor in office specifically determined that the sum of £140,000 was to be the amount that was to be available for Dublin County Borough.  That was done on 1st June, 1954.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am telling the Deputy the truth now.  The Deputy did not imply it before.  The reason for the differences between the allocation for 1953-54 and 1954-55 was made perfectly clear.  The figures were based on the unemployment registration figures in Dublin at the two periods for the two respective years.  When I came in I found that picture, not the picture that the Deputy tried to make us believe, that he had authority from the previous Government for huge, expanding schemes that were going to rise from an employment content of 300 people to 1,200 people, that the previous Government had said that they were going to be undertaken and that we were the bold, bad wolves, so to speak, cutting down that previous intention. The fact is that the scheme may have been one in the Deputy's mind.  I am not going to argue about <Col N="1253" /> that as only he can know what was in his mind, but I can say that the facts as to what my predecessor was going to allocate are clear and definite on the files and clearly and definitely show an entirely different picture from the picture which the Deputy has endeavoured to spread abroad.</P>
      <P>When I came in, I found that picture, but I was not prepared to accept it merely at its then face value.  My ruling was a slightly different one.  My ruling was based, not on funds but on this, that that money had been allocated by my predecessor and, so far as I was concerned, the basis of allocation that I was prepared to operate was a basis which would ensure that no lesser number of people would be employed than had been employed previously. At the time I made it, I felt that that might require additional funds, over and above those which were authorised and sanctioned by Deputy MacEntee, but it was a proviso which was not there at the time he made his decision shortly before the change of Government.  Those are the facts.  As I say, I have no knowledge as to what was in Deputy Briscoe's mind about the Dublin Corporation special works.  What I have just said is the intention shown by the previous Administration in that they reduced rather than increased the allocations that had been there before.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest to the Deputy that he should read it again carefully and he will see that it agrees exactly with what I have been saying. I do not make any secret of the fact that, if I were starting afresh to deal with a problem like this, I would <Col N="1257" /> probably tackle it in a different way from that of the National Development Fund; but I do not think it is good policy, regardless of what Government is in office, merely because a person thinks he might have a better way of tackling a problem, as soon as he comes into office, to throw overboard completely everything started and initiated by his predecessors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Even though one may have a personal predilection for a different method, it is very often better to take the method that is there and to utilise it, perhaps in a different way, and I am going to indicate a different way in respect of this as I go along&mdash; using it in a different way rather than, so to speak, stopping the machine and starting again in a separate fashion by the method that, if I had the handling of it from the beginning, I might myself have chosen at that time.  I think that to deal with the matter in that way would be somewhat irresponsible. It is in that spirit that I approach the National Development Fund.  It is in that spirit that I have been authorising the issues from that fund, and I am coming now to this House to ask for the additional funds necessary to put into it and necessary to implement it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most of the debate yesterday and, indeed, a lot of it to-day, though not quite as much to-day, turned, in respect of this fund, to its uses to deal with unemployment and with the problems that were arising in respect of unemployment from the time it was announced and the time it was inaugurated. Deputies will remember that it was announced and inaugurated by the then Taoiseach in August, 1953. There was at that time, subsequently in 1953, a serious unemployment problem. In respect of that, I want to make the case that the unemployment problem then in existence was one largely created by the then Government as a result of its then policy.  The position at the time they took up office was that we had declining unemployment and rising employment.  The previous Government, quite deliberately, by a <Col N="1258" /> policy of theirs first inaugurated in the White Paper on Trade in the autumn of 1951, and then subsequently continued, started out on a deflationary policy which had the exact effect of creating more unemployment.</P>
    <P>Yesterday, I heard Deputy Childers speak here and tell us that the reason for increasing unemployment at the end of 1951 was the fact that the stockpiling following the outbreak of the Korean war was wearing out&mdash;that the ending of stockpiling and the activity that the Korean war had engendered in the early months of 1951 was responsible for the difficulties at the end of 1951 and early in 1952.  I remember Deputy Childers quite clearly and I remember other members of the then Government telling us in that debate on the White Paper on the Balance of Trade that there was no such thing as stockpiling.  If we had to wait three and a half years to get an acknowledgment that part of the problem then was a stockpiling one, it was worth while listening to the Deputy's speech yesterday.  The fact, of course, was, as I said a minute ago, that there was a serious unemployment problem at the end of 1953&mdash;a problem that had been created by Fianna Fáil themselves.  The figures in respect of unemployment when they assumed office and when this National Development Fund was announced speak for themselves.  Even allowing for the increase on the register, because of the new Social Welfare Act, the figures would show an increase of some 17,000 persons between February, 1951, and February, 1953.</P>
    <P>I want to make perfectly clear, in respect of employment at the present time, that the figures which I quoted a second ago in contradiction of Deputy Bartley&mdash;and which showed that there was an increase of some 3,000 odd over the previous year in respect of the last available figures for insurable employment&mdash;are one facet of the situation.  The other facet is the number of people registered as unemployed. By and large, that figure shows a substantial decrease this year over last year.  There are less unemployed registered this year than there were last year even though, as Deputy <Col N="1259" /> Aiken pointed out, the number of claims current is greater because of the fact that, under the last social welfare legislation, registrations have to be effected for the purpose of contributions being deemed to have been made and, in that respect, there is a switch, so to speak, from unemployment assistance cases to unemployment benefit cases.  The trend that there is in the decrease in unemployment is a satisfactory trend.  In saying that, and in taking&mdash;as we are entitled to take&mdash;credit for that trend, I want to be equally positive that we do not feel there is any reason to be complacent about it and that we believe we shall be able to improve that trend as the weeks and the months go on.</P>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe asked me whether, in the event of there being any increase in the unemployment position in Dublin, I would vary any decision I had made.  One of the first things I did when I went to the Department of Finance was to ensure that certain figures would be made available to me forthwith so that I could watch the trend of employment and unemployment. I can assure the Deputy that, if I think the necessity for any action has arisen, this Government will have taken action on it long before it is necessary for the Deputy to come to see us and talk to us about it.</P>

We have our problems here, but they are of a different nature, and if it is possible for us to deal with them according to our own methods it is much better that we should do so rather than that the method adopted by previous Governments should be accepted as being the better one.  I believe that an increase here in advance rates would have had the effect of creating difficulties in employment, particularly in the building industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was in our anxiety to avoid those difficulties that I made the representations I did, and to which I referred earlier to-day in respect of bank advance rates.  I hope that the situation here will remain such as will ensure that we need not take action of the type that had to be taken elsewhere. In the modern world of to-day, however, we cannot be definite at any moment as to what the position may be a period ahead.  I certainly want it to be clear that any action we can take to prevent unemployment, to prevent it being more difficult for people to develop and to engage in building expansion, will be taken by this Government <Col N="1261" /> so long as the circumstances permit us so to do.  That was why we felt it desirable to take the line to which I have referred.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Local Government issued a circular last night in respect of the grants from the Road Fund.  As reference was made here to the Road Fund and to county roads as against main roads, perhaps it is proper that I should make some reference to it in this reply.  We felt as a Government that one of the things to be done was to shift the attention from some of the main roads to the county roads that more directly assist in county production.  In consequence of that, the Minister for Local Government announced that the allocations being made from the Road Fund for 1955-56 would include an additional £500,000 for county road improvements. Deputy Kennedy referred to that earlier to-day&mdash;he felt it would be a good thing if we did more county road improvements, so I am sure he will be delighted to hear of this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister, but I was referring to cul-de-sac roads as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>We will go on to cul-de-sac roads at a later stage.  I am dealing with county roads at the <Col N="1262" /> moment.  There has been&mdash;and justifiably so&mdash;criticism in various parts of the country, not merely confined to the Press but amongst people all over the country, that some of the work being done on our main roads was of such a luxury nature that we could not afford, that we were doing that luxury work at a time when many of the county roads required to be put into such a condition that they would be real roads and not a conglomeration of pot-holes.</P>
      <P>I agree with those Deputies who made it clear that they had great anxiety about the roads leading down to farmers' houses, down to land and to places where people had to live, but I would suggest to Deputy Kennedy and to those other Deputies who raised that point, that in considering what should be done, the first shift was to go from the main roads to the county roads, that it is important to tackle the county roads before we go on to the others.  No matter on what side of the House we are, we must always accept it that the resources of the State are limited; and I suggest that with those limited resources the first step to be taken is the one that was announced by my colleague, the Minister for Local Government, in respect of county roads.  I would also add in passing that, in addition, he increased by some 50 per cent. the allocation made from the Road Fund over that made last year to deal with some of the dangerous bridges about which we have heard from time to time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to Deputy Corry in a minute; there is no danger that I would forget him, after his statement about Cork.  Deputy Childers suggested that the Road Fund was owed substantial sums from the Exchequer in respect of the war years. I do not accept that argument.  I think the position is somewhat different and that Deputy Childers could not make that argument fairly, after the allocation that was made from the general Exchequer to the Road Fund last year and the allocation that I made in the same way this year.  The income of <Col N="1263" /> the Road Fund will be such this year as to provide for a substantial increase in grants and if it is necessary to augment that for capital works there is a way of dealing with the matter, as I indicated on the 18th December 1953, and as Deputy Briscoe refrained from quoting last night, but which I will give him the task of doing now.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to individual items in the fund, some Deputies asked for certain figures and I gave them at the beginning.  There is a difference between the figures that were given in June and those given now&mdash;an obvious difference, because there were certain projects then under consideration which it has now been decided will not be gone ahead with, and equally certain projects that were not then under consideration have been approved since and will be responsible for issues out of the fund at a later stage.</P>
      <P>I want to reiterate and stress what I said in opening this debate.  In so far as I was concerned I believed that the proper method of utilising funds that would be allocated from this Vote was towards productive schemes if it were not necessary to utilise them purely for employment in respect of any critical situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The best productive scheme of all to my mind is one that deals with that which I believe to be the basis of all our national development and that is agriculture.  The best scheme in respect of agriculture is the scheme that brings into use the greatest amount of our land.  It was for that reason that in the previous inter-Party Government Deputy Dillon, who is now Minister for Agriculture, and who was then <Col N="1264" /> Minister for Agriculture instituted the land project&mdash;a project which Deputy Childers had the hardihood to claim as a Fianna Fáil project when speaking quite recently in Athy.  It was because we believed, as a Party and as a Government, then, that the best thing we could do to develop our economy nationally was to bring into use every acre of land that could usefully be employed that the land project was instituted at that time.  For the purpose of expanding the land project and ensuring that further land can usefully be employed I would like to see as much as possible of the National Development Fund utilised on proposals such as those for further drainage work which could not be coped with in the ordinary way.</P>
    <P>It is for that reason that when a type of work like the Rossmanagher scheme came up I was very glad to be enabled to make an allocation from this fund for work of that sort.  I would like to be able to make further allocations from the fund for drainage work throughout the country.  I would like to be able to see that we could move ahead quicker by reason of issues from this fund in respect of arterial drainage but I am quite appalled when I see the delays and difficulties that will arise in respect of such expansion in arterial drainage.  I want to assure the House that, so far as I am concerned, any application that comes to me for the purpose of utilising portion of the funds that are included in this Vote or in any future Vote for this fund that the House may give at a later date&mdash;work such as, perhaps, the work referred to by Deputy Glynn, the Killimor small catchment area&mdash;will be treated by me most sympathetically from the point of view of money if it is possible from an engineering and technical view to carry out that work.</P>
    <P>I do so because I believe that it will be the foundation of our economy and because, in addition, it will be a method of providing further employment in the rural areas.  The desirability of that work has, I think, been accepted on all sides of the House for a considerable time.  The difficulties that are there are technical difficulties which were touched on in the report of <Col N="1265" /> the Drainage Commission.  In so far as there is money available for the purpose of doing any scheme of arterial drainage that is technically possible and is feasible from an engineering point of view and that will not create further problems down the stream, so far as I am concerned any application for an issue from this fund will be most sympathetically considered.</P>
    <P>Other Deputies referred to different aspects that affected them in their own constituencies.  I will not go into any of the things they mentioned because I think that on reconsideration they will realise that some of them, though desirable in themselves and would, perhaps, bring some benefit, would hardly come within the classification that I have said of productive schemes that would improve the economy of the nation as a whole.</P>
    <P>I think the comment made by Deputy Corry last night in respect of one of those schemes which will undoubtedly assist was, to put it mildly, reprehensible.  It seems extraordinary that of all people a Cork man, even one whose constituency is outside the City of Cork, should describe the Lee as an old stream and that it is merely going into tearing the bottom of an old stream.  I think those were the Deputy's words.</P>
    <P>I do not think the members of the Cork Harbour Board need me to defend the importance of their harbour from the irresponsible attack made by Deputy Corry.  The only thing I am sorry about is that Deputy Corry was not in the House when Deputy Casey was dealing with it as one Cork man to another.  A similar scheme in respect of Dublin will, I believe, assist port facilities there.  That is the type of thing that will bring benefit to the country as a whole.  That is the type of thing that will assist employment in the areas concerned.  They are schemes that are worthwhile as allocations from this fund.</P>
    <P>The only other allocation from the fund to which I want to make any reference is that in respect of the bovine T.B. eradication scheme.  We are very lucky in that, through the generosity of a former American <Col N="1266" /> administrator, part of the Grant Counterpart Fund will be made available to assist in eradicating bovine T.B.  It is, I think, as we on all sides of the House accept, one of the things that are vital not merely to agriculture but to our economy as a whole that we would take urgent steps to ensure that our cattle would be free from T.B. so that in that way we would be enabled to expand our outlet and market further.</P>
    <P>As far as this fund is concerned, we are utilising it for the purpose of speeding up the work that has been done, and that we hope to do, with the American Grant Counterpart Fund. The issues from this fund will be utilised to develop that scheme in the County Sligo and also in the Bansha area.  The amount that has been allocated so far on schemes directly is £423,000.  In addition to that, we decided that, as part inducement to assist that scheme and as part propaganda for the development of that scheme, we would increase the grants for farm buildings and for water supplies to people who are going in for the T.B. eradication scheme.  That will cost a sum of £230,000.  I personally can think of no way in which £650,000 from this fund could be spent to better advantage when considering the long-term development of our economy as a whole.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister would be advised to clear up what might be a misunderstanding with regard to one particular part of his speech to-night.  Earlier to-day, at Question Time, the Minister made it clear that, as a result of representations, the banks had agreed not to follow the rates of interest in England, and in reply to a supplementary question admitted that we had no legislation by which such an Order of the Government could be enforced on the banks.</P>

      <P>In the course of his speech this evening, the Minister held out the hope that apparently the reaction to his representations would be <Col N="1267" /> maintained as part of the policy of the Government.

      <P>What I said in that respect was perfectly clear.  The increase in the bank rate in England was taken to deal with the situation existent there which is not existent here at present.  Hitherto, regardless of the economic position here, the Irish bank rate has always automatically followed the British bank rate.  On this occasion, the Government made representations to the banks.  I had discussions with the banks and I indicated that, in my view, it should be the economic position here that would affect the issue.  When I was answering a question to-day, I paid tribute to the banks for their decision.  The banks accepted the view that I put forward, that the economic conditions here were entirely different from the economic conditions which justified the action taken by my counterpart on the other side.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 5, to delete lines 12 to 19 and substitute as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>7.  &mdash;Where, by an agreement or arrangement entered into under this or any other Act, a local authority exercise or perform a power, function or duty of another body&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  it shall be the duty of every officer of the local authority to perform such duties appropriate to the nature of the power, function or duty as the local authority may decide, and</P>

    <P>(b)  in case the other body is a local authority, it shall be the duty of every officer of that local authority to refrain from performing <Col N="1269" /> such duties appropriate to the nature of the power, function or duty as that local authority may decide.</P>
    <P>The proposed amendment of this section follows from the amendment of Section 57 which it is proposed to widen to enable local authorities to enter into agreements with statutory bodies for the exercise and performance of certain powers, functions and duties on behalf of the statutory bodies.  It is necessary to amend Section 7, accordingly, to ensure that where a local authority enters into such agreement it shall be the duty of the officers of the local authority to perform such duties arising out of the agreement as may be assigned to them by the local authority.  The amendment is merely consequential on the amendment of Section 57 to ensure that agreements made between local authorities and statutory bodies can be implemented.</P>

Paragraph (a) of the amendment says: &ldquo;It shall be the duty of every officer of the local authority to perform such duties appropriate to the nature of the power...&rdquo; That, to my mind, makes the word &ldquo;appropriate&rdquo; qualify the power, but it does not make the case quite clear&mdash;to take an extreme or perhaps an absurd example&mdash;of an engineer having to do a surgeon's work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister will allow me, I still feel that whereas there is an improvement there is not sufficient protection for that specific point.  I have not at the moment gone back on our deliberations in Committee&mdash;God knows they were long enough &mdash;but the specific objection to Section 7 was that it said: &ldquo;it shall be the duty of every officer of each such local authority to perform such duties... as the local authority under whom he holds office may decide.&rdquo;  That was the original draft and we objected more or less in the terms that we suggested an amendment to qualify such duties by the word &ldquo;appropriate&rdquo; to his particular functions.  In other words, the word &ldquo;appropriate&rdquo; unless I am reading the draft amendment amiss, seems to relate to the nature of the &ldquo;power, function or duty&rdquo;.  The amendment says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where, by an agreement or arrangement entered into under this or any other Act, a local authority exercise or perform a power, function or duty of another body&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  it shall be the duty of every officer of the local authority to perform such duties appropriate to the nature of the power, function or duty as the local authority may decide, and...&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Quite frankly, I do not see that that point is met there at all under this. Perhaps later on it may be qualified in another place, but within the terms of this section, while I accept this is an <Col N="1271" /> improvement and I have nothing against this draft as it stands in one respect, I would suggest you would also need a qualification there to the effect that an officer would only be required to perform duties appropriate to the nature of the office which he holds.  There are two such things there.  You see there were two gaps, perhaps, in the original draft.  There is no use in going into details on it. The Minister has met one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to Section 10 of the Local Government Act, 1941, and if I might quote the section, it is Section 10, sub-section (1) (b):&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Every officer appointed or servant employed by a local authority shall perform such duties and be paid such remuneration as such local authority may from time to time assign to him.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Now from that there is a right of appeal to the appropriate Minister and that right will still remain in existence under this Bill&mdash;the right of appeal&mdash;and I say that in view of Section 10 sub-section (1) (b) there is no necessity to have the anxiety that Deputy de Valera has on this particular point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Minister says, but let me, for the purpose of the record, make this clear. It is apparently ministerial policy not to accept the point I made for specific qualification.  You cannot get over the fact&mdash;I am not criticising&mdash;that the Minister is not prepared to give officers the protection which we have suggested.  That is a matter of policy and I can see certain difficulties.  If we went into a lengthy argument on this, the Minister would no doubt say that if you put in a fine definition you would get borderline cases that would cause endless trouble.  I can always see the possibilities of that argument. On the other hand, I see possibilities of injustice arising or difficulty arising where an officer is required to do something which is not quite appropriate to his office in respect of one of these transferred functions.  Although it is <Col N="1272" /> absurd to suggest that an engineer might be asked to do a surgeon's work, the difference is only one of degree rather than of principle.</P>
      <P>I think that there is a case here, and I feel constrained to press the Minister on this&mdash;here is a case where you are imposing extra duties on existing officers for which they did not contract.  The Minister may object to that phrase, &ldquo;for which they did not contract,&rdquo; and if he does I will correct it to this extent&mdash;which were not part of the normal duties of these officers when they were accepted and which could not be reasonably thought of as duties for which they were contracting. Here you are, therefore, extending the liability to perform duties of these officers and at the same time extending it rather widely.  I grant the Minister his argument on that Section 10 which he quoted.  I grant the Minister all he said there, but here he is extending officers' duties and I suggest that the word &ldquo;appropriate&rdquo; or some such qualification should be put in to make it read &ldquo;appropriate to the nature of the power, function or duty....&rdquo; and also &ldquo;appropriate to the nature of the office held by the officer.&rdquo;  If that were put in it would be quite tight enough.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that, but I am pointing out that we are putting in, so to speak, further liability of service.  You are putting on a further onus and although that may not in practice work out to be too heavy, you are undoubtedly putting a further burden on these officers and I would suggest that having put that further burden on, you should put in a further safeguard in addition &mdash; both of them extra to the situation under the other Acts.</P>

      <P>This is a peculiar situation. Section 7 which this amendment seeks to amend&mdash;and I hope my colleague, Deputy Major de Valera, will follow me and will watch it carefully &mdash;limits first of all the way in which a local authority may make an arrangement with another local authority to <Col N="1273" /> do certain work for that other local authority and they can do that by directing one of their employees to do it.  Section (b) of the proposed amendment goes further.  It says that if the other body for whom this officer is directed to carry out duties is a local authority&mdash;it implies, therefore, that this officer can in fact be directed to do work for a body which is not a local authority.</P>
      <P>That, to my mind, seems to be quite a new departure.  When we argued this on the Committee Stage, we argued it completely within the limit of one officer of a local authority doing work for another local authority and we were concerned to see that this officer's conditions of employment would not be worsened and the Minister pointed out that under another section he has a right to make an appeal.  But now Part (b) of the amendment here envisages that he can be asked to do work for some body not a local authority.  Surely to goodness that could be stretched too far.  He might be asked to do work for some business or some&mdash;&mdash;</P>

His whole idea of his future is based on service on a local authority and he can, by virtue of this amendment, suddenly find himself transferred to the C.I.E., the sugar company, or any other body set up by statute.  It could be this C.T.T. business for helping exports to dollar areas, and so forth.  I think this is something on which we should hesitate.  I do not know that it is right to have this new thing at this time.  I do not know what it means, to what extent it is in accordance with our ideas of local authorities.  You may have an officer.  He does not necessarily have to be an engineer, a doctor or a professional man.  He may be an administrative officer, and his whole outlook is based on his training in local government service.

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is based entirely on Section 10 of the 1941 Act.  That section does not envisage a local authority being able to take one of its servants into a local body.  We are giving way, perhaps, under Section 17, to enable local authorities to do certain acts, for instance, for An Bord Fáilte.  They are anxious to preserve ancient monuments, and are prepared to provide money for the making of approach roads to these monuments. They have no special machinery for the making of the roads, and this is merely to enable the local authority to do these jobs for An Bord Fáilte.  They will be recouped for the doing of them by funds provided by An Bord Fáilte, and this is merely to enable the local authority to assign one of their officials or officers to this particular job.  If the officer is not satisfied, he has a right to appeal to the Minister.</P>
      <P>Deputy de Valera said that we might have local authorities who would ask a doctor to go out and make roads.  I think you may find such local authorities, but surely to goodness if there is a right of appeal to the Minister, you will not find such bodies so severe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I think on a strictly legalistic interpretation of both the original section and the amendment, that there is something in what Deputy Briscoe has said.  I think it would be quite unreal to give any weight to it, having regard to the appeal to the Minister which exists. I think we are entitled to assume that every local authority in the country is not going to go mad and suddenly send doctors out to make roads, or send their law agents out to clean streets, and that sort of thing.  It is possible that that power exists if you interpret the amendment, and even the original section, absolutely strictly, but I do not think it could possibly happen.  I think the House should accept this amendment as effecting what it is <Col N="1276" /> designed to effect, that is to give local authorities power to enter into agreements with what are in effect other State bodies in order to carry out work which could be more properly carried out by the local authority.</P>
      <P>The Minister has given the example of ancient monuments.  There are probably quite a number of bodies of which Deputy Briscoe and myself could think.  There are certainly a number of functions of the Tourist Board that the personnel of local authorities would feel they could handle better.  They prefer to do it themselves by agreement with the Tourist Board.  As I see it, it is in order to enable the local authority to do that, and to use their administration and their officers for the purpose of carrying out that work that the section has now been expanded in the manner Deputy Briscoe pointed out, to include bodies other than local authorities.</P>

      <P>I agree that a rather fantastic result could be envisaged, if you have local authorities acting in a fantastic way, if you have their officers acting in a fantastic way, and if you have the Minister for Local Government acting in a fantastic way. Only by that chain of causation can you have fantastic results.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Briscoe has put his finger on it and that it is some limitation that is needed.  I quoted a ridiculous example merely to point out the principle but the trouble always arises when it is a question of the finer points.  It is arguable how far it is wise to have a local authority in the position of taking up any type of duty if it was so minded provided it was a duty authorised by statute.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Capable of doing it, I grant you that may be.  &ldquo;Are able and willing&rdquo;&mdash;the word &ldquo;able&rdquo; might give some people cause for opinions and argument afterwards but it is <Col N="1277" /> doubtful, for instance, whether it would be wise to give a local authority a power wide enough so that you might find a local authority in the position, for instance, of trading.  Apart from the questions that can arise there, there is the question of the employees. The officers are the people I would like to advert to in this.  A local authority and, say, a body like An Bord Fáilte may quite easily have a certain common interest.  Suppose there is some kind of a festival in a particular year and there are construction works to be done such as we saw done for An Tóstal on O'Connell Bridge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps there is more guarantee it will not be disfigured if the local authority have a say in it.  In any event the structure on O'Connell Bridge is not what I am concerned with here.  What I am trying to say is that the example the Minister takes is a reasonable one.  They have a common interest but, reasonable and all as it may be for a local authority and, say, An Bord Fáilte, to have a common interest, and reasonable and all as it may be&mdash;and I think we will all agree that it is reasonable that the facilities available to the local authority should be used for the purpose of that common interest&mdash;we must, on the other hand, ensure that we do not unduly overload the employees of the local authority who have other duties to do as well.  What you are saying, in effect, in these two amendments, now taken together, is that the local authority can take over such a function as I have indicated on behalf of An Bord Fáilte, the body the Minister has specified, and that having done so by way of extra duty, the officers of the local authority would be compelled to carry that extra duty and burden over and above their normal duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know I can press that point too <Col N="1278" /> far.  I think it would be unreasonable to say that you could not expect an officer to do anything more than the normal routine duties.  On the other hand you can place too heavy a burden on the officer.  It is a totally different thing to say there is a bridge over a river at a boundary.  It will be very convenient that the bridge should be the sole concern of one engineer and staff rather than of others.  That is the type of case I would have visualised initially.  It is very fair for the two authorities to make an arrangement by which the engineer for local authority A will do it and the engineer for local authority B can forget about it.  That type of arrangement is fair enough by and large; there would be a fair cancellation out over a period of time.</P>
    <P>However, it is a totally different thing if, as Deputy Briscoe points out, under Section 17, you are going to enlarge the whole scope of activities. Again let the Minister not misunderstand me.  The reasonableness is obvious up to a point but the point of reasonableness where you consider the actual officers, that is amendment No. 1, stops far short of what may be the reasonableness of amendment No. 17.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I have not, but I am a little bit apprehensive that we are being a trifle onerous in this. There are two types of safeguards I would like to see here, one I think the Minister is going to give us, that is, to limit the duty to a duty appropriate to the officer's office, and that is a very small thing to ask.  I have given the absurd and extreme case, but you can go down to fine points and there injustice <Col N="1279" /> may be worked.  However, in virtue of amendment No. 17, I think there is a little bit more in that.  Are you going to say, for instance, to an engineer of a local authority who may have his hands full with his other duties that he has to build a festival hall, a festival park or something like that, in his off-time?  Army officers have often found themselves in such a position but they have come to accept that.  I do not think local authority personnel are going to accept that principle of regimentation.</P>
      <P>There is a further difficulty here in regard to the use of the words &ldquo;local authority&rdquo;.  Notwithstanding the County Management Bill that is coming up, &ldquo;local authority&rdquo; may very well mean &ldquo;county manager&rdquo; as far as these officers are concerned and they will not have the safeguard of their own local authority in many functions.  It will be the county manager and county managers, in turn, thanks to legislation as it is developing and particularly to a section under this Bill are becoming rapidly mere servants of the Custom House.  I use the words &ldquo;mere servants&rdquo; in the sense that they are subject to detailed direction from the central organisation in the Custom House which is rapidly getting itself into a position where it is going to determine everything in detail notwithstanding the County Management Bill which is coming before us and which we will deal with later.  I do not think that is a very happy situation for the officers of local authorities.</P>

However, I would be a little worried about a statute that would leave me open to duties such as erecting a festival hall or putting up an ornamental bridge or something like that.  That may sound absolutely fantastic but it is there and it is only one of the multifarious occupations in which an officer might be asked to engage.  There is even the possibility that they might be asked to lay down a private railway for the sugar company. If the local authority agreed that it would be a good thing for them to lay down a private railway for the sugar company that might become one of an officer's duties.  That may sound a fantastic suggestion but I think the section would be wide enough.</P>

The local <Col N="1281" /> authority may undoubtedly enjoy the reserved function to enter into an agreement but the executive actions in relation to that agreement will be very much within the scope of the manager and whether it is or is not you still have that particular difficulty. I still take my stand on my objection to sub-section (1) in which I say there is nothing to protect an officer.  There is another great difficulty in this and I wonder if the Minister will enumerate what he considers to be officers within the meaning of this section.

      <P>I would go a certain part of the way with Deputy de Valera, because I think the phrase &ldquo;a body which is established by statute&rdquo; is very wide.  It is all right for the Minister to say his intentions are so and so, but the Minister can change and some future Minister might have very different ideas as to what should come in.  If the Minister has specific bodies in mind it would be much better if he named them and not to leave us with this rather wide phrase.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I have spoken only on one so far.  I want to see this body in a local authority limited.  If the Minister says that you cannot put in the Bill now something that might not be required in the future, I agree, but he could put in a phrase stating that such bodies shall be bodies in relation to which there shall be some form of agreement with the local authority in the same way as the local authority subscribes to the Tourist Board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>

      <P>Yes, it does, explicitly. Amendment No. 17 explicitly sets that out: there must be <Col N="1284" /> agreement between the two parties. They must be able and willing.  Under paragraph (b), if they are requested by one of these bodies, they must be able and willing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The second point I want to raise is in connection with the agreement.  I would like Deputies to follow my argument in this because, if you like, I may be suspicious.  Two local authorities may or can come to an agreement that one local authority will now authorise one of its officers to do certain work for the other local authority.  Now this may be a nice way of getting rid of the officer in the other local authority who has been performing these duties up to the time of the agreement, in other words, two local authorities may come together and say: &ldquo;We will ask A now to do the duties that he does for us for the neighbouring authority&rdquo; and when that is agreed the other local authority says to the officer previously doing the job for them: &ldquo;Look, we do not need you any more.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>So we are now going to get a superman who will do the job of two.  If such a state of affairs existed it would be a very good thing. If we have a superfluous man in a county we can get rid of him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Then the Minister agrees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not arise at all but, if such a thing did arise, it would be a very good thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>It might not be the case of a man being superfluous, In every walk of life, whether it is professional <Col N="1285" /> or anything else, everybody can have an opinion.  One may think that a particular professional man is better at his profession than another man in the same profession.  A local authority may feel that an engineer, or some other officer, is a more capable man than the man in the neighbouring authority.  The neighbouring authority may also think the other fellow is a nicer fellow and they would like to have him: &ldquo;We do not like our chap and this is a device by which we can cut off our fellow's job.&rdquo;  Now I want to provide against that.  I think there should be some limitation whereby such a service should only be rendered by an officer of one local authority for another if the other local authority has not got an officer capable of doing the job.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I hold that none of us could have been briefed, even if these amendments had been circulated in the middle of last week, because one has to try to interpret and understand them.  I certainly cannot understand them even yet and I see in this first amendment many pitfalls and many things which may bring injustice in their train to the officials of our local authorities.  Civil servants are treated in quite a different way from what is envisaged here. I want to prevent any doubt, first of all, if sub-section (b) includes other bodies other than local authorities, to which body a local authority may direct its official to do a particular job either permanently, part-time or for a period, that that particular body shall be one which has work of a nature suitable for that local authority official.  Secondly, I do not want this section subsequently used as a guillotine by means of which the official of one authority may be used to cut out the official of another local authority.  The Minister has admitted, by interjection, that a situation could arise where one might have a supernumerary official, and he asks is it not a good thing to get rid of that official if he is redundant?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>One can get rid of him as the law stands.  One does not have to wait for this section to become law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that cases arise where one local authority may have a particular official doing a particular type of work and someone says that he is not fully occupied and that a saving could be effected by getting rid of him, or not filling the vacancy when it arises, and making the official of <Col N="1287" /> another local authority doing similar work do this particular work plus the work of the last man in the other authority.  Now I want to direct the attention of my colleagues on the Labour Benches to the dangers inherent in such an amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I point out one instance of where it might be desirable: supposing a local authority employs a good specialist, a lung specialist or a heart specialist, or someone like that, would it not be a good thing to have this agreement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Or an inspector of weights and measures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>May I pursue my own example?  Suppose the local authority arranges with its neighbouring local authorities to share the services of that specialist, would that not be desirable?  Very often a local authority may not have a whole-time kidney specialist or a whole-time brain specialist&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>We might need him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but could with another local authority employ him whole-time; would not that be desirable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>On that point, the other local authority may have as good a specialist as it is possible to get.  I admit that.  If there is a superman, then I say he should be taken out of the local authority, brought into the central authority and made available for all local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps Deputy MacBride will agree with me in this. Every local authority has by statute to carry out inspections of weights and measures.  It is quite possible two local authorities may get together and decide that one inspector of weights and measures can do the work of the county as well as the city and they may say: &ldquo;When X retires from the county do not recruit a new man; we will make our man available for the work.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The present position is that all our officials are fully employed. I do not know how they are employed in Cork but they are certainly fully employed in Dublin.  I do not want the position to grow up where there is gradual spreading of responsibility from one set of local representatives in one particular area to another.  The local representative will have to accept responsibility for the acts of the officials of the body of which he is a member and now, in addition, he is to accept responsibility for the acts of an official who is acting in another area.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but we are talking of an official who obtains a position through a competitive examination and, as Deputy de Valera has said, with an implied contract as to his service and now, by Act of Parliament, we are going to vary his rights.  I say that is wrong, and I am trying to argue all the consequences that can flow from it.  It is on that point that I want this Dáil to recognise that it is wrong to put an unlimited claim&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The position arises now that, by statute, we will remove all doubts as to how far a local authority may direct or dictate to its employees in their work.  I say that is going too far.  We should agree that each local authority should be left on its own to try to do the best it can.  When Deputy MacBride talks about regional hospitals or mental homes and so on, that is a different thing.  They are bodies that have their own officials within them.  There may be a manager and an assistant manager representing him and the local authority in the management of the institution but that institution has also in a self-contained way its own employees.  I can see nothing but confusion arising from this.  I can see it starting with higher officials and then getting down to lower levels and no man will know where he is to be to-day, to-morrow or next week.  I beg the Labour Deputies to consider seriously the implications of this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am subject to correction on that matter.  From the practical point of view and viewing the amendment in the light of the local authorities in the County Borough of Dublin, we must realise that occasions may arise where it is necessary, in the interests of both local authorities, that a particular officer shall deal with a particular problem.  If, as is envisaged in another Bill, Dublin City separates itself by agreement from Dublin County or Dún Laoghaire separates itself by agreement from the other two, when a problem of planning arises, say, main road planning, where the junctions of the two local authorities are involved and where from a realistic point of view it would be desirable that the matter should be dealt with by one expert, it would be unwise to adopt the attitude that you must have an expert on planning for the city, an expert on planning for the county and an expert on planning for Dún Laoghaire.</P>

      <P>You might possibly reach a position where two of the experts disagree.  The same difficulty may arise in connection with water supply, sewerage and other matters, particularly in the local authority to which I refer.  I do not see anything in the amendment which will prejudice the position of the officers in the local authorities.  If I could be convinced that there was any serious danger, I would be quite prepared to support <Col N="1291" /> Deputy Briscoe on the matter but he appears to be chasing hares and the discussion of the amendment becomes a question of who will use the greatest number of words.  I feel that certain circumstances may require that certain works should be carried out by one officer acting by agreement for both local authorities, without interfering materially or in any way whatsoever with the rights of any official coming under their jurisdiction.</P>

      <P>I should like to reply to Deputy Larkin's point by saying that it is a question of degree and we are not arguing that.  We do recognise, and I think every reasonable person must recognise that, for instance, as the section was drafted originally, one local authority cooperating with another local authority, there was reason in it and on the balance, although there were objections, the original form of Section 57 was all right.  We feel that it has got to be on the balance.  As was pointed out, this is a substantive amendment. This is a totally different section in content.  It is different to the extent of being very much wider than the original section we debated on Committee.  The original section which we debated on Committee still stays there but added, over and above that, now is a similar provision, not only where one local authority is going to do work for another local authority but where a local authority is going to do any work for any other statutory body.</P>
      <P>Again, it is very difficult to draw a precise line.  We recognise that and I recognise the departmental difficulty in drafting and I recognise that all too frequently we have to trust the good judgment of the Minister and his Department but I still feel that in going to the extent to which we are going, introducing a new sub-section which makes a very material and substantive alteration and extension of the original provision, some safeguard should be provided for the officers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What was the position when we debated this here before?  The position when we debated this here before was that we accepted Section <Col N="1292" /> 57 as in the first draft, but we wanted this safeguard for the officers that they would be required to do only duties appropriate to the nature of the office they held.  I rather thought&mdash;I am not by any means accusing the Minister of breach of faith&mdash;that we would probably get that amendment from the course of the discussion.  The record will speak for itself, but we thought we were modest in asking for that. We recognised, in asking for that, that, by virtue of Section 57 and of Section 7 which we are discussing, certain additional duties were going to be imposed on the officers of local authorities and all we asked for was that the additional duties should be limited to those appropriate to the office held.</P>
    <P>Now, on the Report Stage, or on the recommittal of the Bill, we find an additional onus thrown on them.  Here we have a new sub-section, in addition to the original sub-section, making it mandatory upon the officers of local authorities to perform such duties as may devolve upon them in consequence of an agreement between their local authority and some other body, &ldquo;body&rdquo; being general enough to include any body set up by statute.  That, translated into hard facts, might mean An Bord Fáilte; it might even mean the Sugar Company, Bord na Móna or the E.S.B.  It could mean a multitude of bodies and, under this, if we allow it to go as it is now, without even the qualification of &ldquo;duties appropriate to the office&rdquo; which we ask for, every officer of a local authority is going to carry the added liability contained in sub-section (7) without any compensating protection being given to him.</P>
    <P>The Minister says he can appeal to the Minister and he referred to Section 10 of the 1941 Act.  That is nothing more than the officer has already and it is nothing more than he would have, in any event.  We are putting additional duties on them which means, in plain language, that we are getting them to do additional work.  We are putting a wide liability on them and not even safeguarding them to the extent that we first asked for, namely, &ldquo;duties appropriate to the office&rdquo;. Though I will admit to Deputy Larkin and to the Minister that it is a question <Col N="1293" /> of a degree, if everything was done according to the standards of reasonableness of those of us at present in the House, it perhaps might be all right, but that is just not good enough in legislation.  We know how the administrative machine can work sometimes.  With the best will in the world of those charged with the administration, the administrative machine can be in its workings harsh on individuals.  Is it going to be work in connection with An Tóstal; is it going to be the promotion work of An Bord Fáilte; is it going to be the development of roads for Bord na Móna; is it even going to be a siding for the Sugar Company?</P>
    <P>All these things may sound remote and fantastic, to use Deputy <Col N="1294" /> O'Higgins's words, but all these things are not too fantastic to be brought within the terms of this section, if somebody should be so minded.  If that is a possibility, then I think we are being grossly unfair to the officers of these local authorities in Section 7 and I would strongly appeal to the Minister, even at this stage, to defer this matter and introduce some safeguards. I think I am not being unreasonable when I suggest that this new amendment is going far beyond what any of us contemplated when discussing it in Committee previously.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 7, line 47, before &ldquo;including&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;for specified periods in no case exceeding one month&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I would like it to be clear that I am not fussy about the precise wording of this amendment.  The reference to one month is not something I feel myself tied to.  I put it down to try to get some clarity into paragraph (m) in Section 14.  The White Paper mentions that paragraph (m) will give local authorities power to impose short term suspensions not exceeding seven days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1297" /> In plain fact, paragraph (m) does very much more, it provides for the imposition by local authorities of suspensions from performance of duties, including short term disciplinary suspensions not exceeding seven days.  In other words, it is wider than set out in the White Paper.  The Minister will likely say that in so far as it is wider it is consequential on Section 18, which removes from Section 27 of the Act of 1941 the power to suspend by local authority and the new Section 27 of the Act of 1941 will only give the Minister power to suspend, so that by paragraph (m) the former power of the local authority to suspend is now transferred.  I think, in fairness, it does state in the White Paper that the intention is to bring together into one section all the things that a local authority can do in this matter.</P>
    <P>There was another point made by the Minister with regard to the reason for the change, that was that only the Minister had power under Section 27 of the Act of 1941 to end a suspension. The result was that local authorities were unwilling to suspend for minor offences because it took so long to end the suspension.  As far as I can find in paragraph (m) there is no power for the local authority to end a suspension made by them except a short-term disciplinary suspension not exceeding seven days.  That may be the Minister's intention, that any suspension for a period longer than seven days will still require the Minister's own act to end the suspension. If that is so it is possibly all right, but I think that the local authority might be given power to end a suspension which was for longer than seven days and I cannot see that in this provision they will have such power.</P>
    <P>The way I read it now is that because seven days is mentioned&mdash;any disciplinary suspension for less than seven days&mdash;the local authority can end the suspension because presumably they specified the number of days, but if they suspend without saying that it is less than seven days then only the Minister can end the suspension. If that is not so, I would be glad to know where provision is made <Col N="1298" /> for the local authority to end any suspension which is greater than seven days.</P>
    <P>In the amendment I mentioned one month, but I have no particular feelings about it.  In fact, I think it might even do to insert the words &ldquo;for specified periods&rdquo; as that would permit a local authority to say to an official: &ldquo;You are suspended for a month.&rdquo; One does not need to end that suspension as it is for a specified period. Unless it is the Minister's intention that only periods of seven days or less are to come within the full jurisdiction of the local authority, I think he ought to consider some amendment in the form I have suggested.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept the amendment.  We are inclined to forget that Section 14 merely replaces the powers which local authorities have at the moment.  Under Section 18, Section 27 of the Local Government Act of 1941 is being repealed and this section is merely to reintroduce legislation which exists at the moment.  It is not the intention at all to give the Minister the only power to suspend. The regulations which would be made will give the local authority full power of suspension.  Power to end such suspension will rest with the Minister or the local authority, subject to the conditions set out in the regulations.  In other words, the local authority will have practically equal power with the Minister in so far as it will be given to them under the regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to support Deputy Sheldon's amendment.  I have a distinct recollection of the discussion on the Committee Stage and I have also some knowledge of the position under the old Act.  Under the old Act the manager had power of suspension without doubt but he had no power of reinstatement without the Minister's sanction.  In many cases where a suspension should have been only of short duration, because of the regulations that existed it was impossible to get <Col N="1299" /> a man back within a reasonable time after a minor offence.  Consequently it militated against discipline, to the extent that a manager&mdash;or a local authority&mdash;might want to suspend somebody for a short period but could not do so because the power of bringing him back was out of his hands and consequently he would impose on the person greater punishment than he wished to give.  This amendment now, which deals with the new situation, seeks to give the manager or the local authority power to suspend a person but if that person is suspended only for a very minor offence, for less than seven days or seven days, the man is automatically reinstated; whereas if he is suspended for a period longer than that&mdash;then only the Minister can reinstate him, and that might take months.  We are back to the position where the manager has either to overlook some minor offence or inflict on the individual a punishment which he himself feels is unjust.</P>
      <P>I think what Deputy Sheldon asks is reasonable, that either you have in the hands of the manager of the local authority power to suspend an official for a period of three days, a week, two weeks, three weeks, or up to a month, or else you have specified periods and, after that, the big suspension, subject to the Minister considering it, reviewing it and allowing the man to be reinstated or whatever way he wishes to look at it.</P>
      <P>I think that Deputy Sheldon's amendment improves the new section. Because I understand the situation and because of what Deputy Sheldon's amendment says, too, I am in agreement with him, subject to what he suggests, that he is willing to withdraw the period of one month if we can agree on specific periods.  I take it that his view in approaching this matter is the same as mine, which is to bring about better discipline by not having a manager of a local authority either overlooking offences, because the punishment would be too harsh, or inflicting punishment which he thinks is unreasonable under the circumstances.</P>

      <P>It would cut across the general policy of the Bill.  The Deputy will appreciate that in very many cases, where it is found necessary to suspend an official, investigations may go on for considerable periods.  If we had a limit of one month it might be necessary to reinstate at the end of a month some official who has defaulted in some way or another and then suspend him again at a later date.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see a very good reply, but I have not got it from the Minister.  The Minister could say that he was satisfied that the present arrangements under the Act should be maintained and that his intention was <Col N="1301" /> only to provide for short term suspensions not exceeding seven days.  It is the way that it is in that makes me suspicious because the Minister is talking about some power to end suspension which is new to a local authority. There is no power in this paragraph for the Minister or anyone else to frame a regulation which will give power to a local authority to end the suspension.  I do not see it anywhere about ending a suspension.  If the Minister replies that the regulation which provides for the beginning of suspension can also provide for the ending of it, I do not see why he has gone into such detail about other matters, but nowhere is there a reference to the making of a regulation governing the ending of a suspension by a local authority.  If the Minister is satisfied that that power is there, then I am satisfied.</P>

      <P>But that makes it more peculiar as to why the words come in in the brackets at all.  Surely, if the wide power was there, there was no necessity to put it in.  I think the Minister has a terrible predilection for parenthetical remarks which merely make it harder to read, but that it by the way.  If the Minister is satisfied that there is power in this to make a regulation which will allow a local authority to end a suspension, then I am quite satisfied because that is all I want to secure.  If that is so, then I do not understand why it is necessary to put in brackets &ldquo;including short-term disciplinary suspensions, not exceeding seven days.&rdquo;  Surely that would fall into the ordinary general class.  I am not an official of a local authority, but if I were and the manager tried to suspend me for one month through some regulation, I would be inclined to fight it.</P>

The phraseology of the ending of this paragraph with regard to what happens the pay or emoluments of a suspended officer is taken from the Act of 1941.  In another section, very properly, of course, it was provided that it might be necessary to provide for the disposal or otherwise of any remuneration that was withheld. I presume that was in order to cover defalcations which might have affected some outside person or body. As it is, I took it that paragraph (m) as stated in the White Paper dealt with minor things.  I wanted to take this with my other argument on paragraph (m).  As far as I could see it dealt with minor things and the question of the disposal would not arise. That was a major offence and would come under Section 27 of the 1941 Act, as amended.  However, I would like to hear the Minister briefly on that point.</P>

      <P>Paragraph (m) will cover any offence.  There is no innovation at all in this particular section. As Deputy Sheldon has pointed out, by virtue of Section 27 of the Local Government Act, 1941, the appropriate Minister had power to forfeit or otherwise dispose of the remuneration of a suspended holder of an office during the period of such suspension. Prior to the enactment of the 1941 Act, there were similar powers given by Section 11 of the Local Authorities Officers and Employees Act, 1926 so that there is nothing new in this.  We feel this is very essential for the reasons I set out.  I think that in view of my reply to amendment No. 4 the Deputy will be satisfied to withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>In page 7, line 56, before &ldquo;given&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;(being directions for the purpose of giving effect to the regulations, but neither extending the regulations nor widening their scope)&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1303" /> Several Deputies spoke on the Committee Stage about this matter.  It is to meet their wishes I have now put in this amendment.  I think Deputies MacBride, de Valera and Briscoe requested me to do this on the Committee Stage and it is for that purpose I have now brought in the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister bringing in this amendment which is very close to what Deputy MacBride suggested in the course of the debate.  However, the principle involved in paragraph (m) of Section 14 is to my mind deep and fundamental. The Minister must not think I am unappreciative.  I am appreciative of his willingness to try to meet us in this.</P>
      <P>I feel that this is a matter of principle of such importance that I cannot say this amendment meets the point put forward by some of us.  I regret that, but the difficulty is this, that the provision of a statutory force for directions, whether they limit the scope of the regulations or not, is rather too wide a statutory power. The statutory force that is going to be given to such directions is, I think, something that is too wide and broad in principle.</P>
      <P>This particular matter has been debated at length in Committee. Administrative directions are one thing.  They are constantly being given by letter or otherwise, but here we are going to give, as I quoted on the Committee Stage, in the Minister's own words&mdash;I am paraphrasing&mdash;power to legislate by letter, because that is what it amounts to.  You are giving statutory force to the directions given. In other words, you are giving statutory force to a letter.  The proposal now is to limit that within the scope of the regulations.  I am not satisfied with the draft, I am sorry to say.  I do appreciate, and I want to place this on record, the Minister's attempt, but I am sorry to say that I feel the principle is a very important one and that this amendment does not meet the point.</P>

      <P>I think I was one of the Deputies who objected strongly to the provisions of Section 14 in so far as they related to directions given by the Minister.  Frankly, I must say that I detest any of these ministerial powers to legislate either by directions or Orders.  I should like, with Deputy de Valera to place on record my appreciation of the way in which the Minister yielded to the views of Deputies in the House on the Committee Stage.  I think that he has met the position extremely fairly, and that the main objection which there was to the original section has been met by his amendment.</P>
      <P>I should like also to say that the Minister has really given a headline as to the way in which a discussion in the House should be approached, and as to the way in which the views of Deputies can be met by a Minister who is prepared to try to understand their viewpoint.  I think that the Minister has tried to understand the viewpoint of the House in this amendment.</P>

      <P>I also should like to say that, in my opinion, the Minister has met the objections very fairly.  A direction which can neither extend a regulation nor widen its scope is not one that you can call legislation by a letter.  I think that Deputy de Valera is unduly apprehensive and is probably exaggerating what might happen. May I say, in view of the way in which the discussion developed in Committee, of Deputy de Valera having doubts and of Deputy MacBride having doubts and of there being a sort of rough attempt at the time to find a formula that would meet everyone's objection, I certainly expected to find on the Order Paper for Report a reasoned amendment by Deputy de Valera giving precisely the form that he thought would meet the case, in his opinion?  I suggest that merely to come along now and say that the phraseology which the Minister has adopted does not meet with his approval, and without saying in what particular way, Deputy de Valera has a very weak case indeed. I think that the Minister is to be congratulated <Col N="1305" /> on the wording of the amendment.  In my opinion, he has gone very much further than I had expected him to go.</P>

      <P>The amendment of (1) (c), by the insertion of certain words in line 47 is proposed as a result of a suggestion made by Deputy de Valera on Committee Stage that the wording of paragraph (c) might be linked with that of paragraph (b) of sub-section (1) of Section 24 of the Local Government Act, 1941.  The amendment will provide that the grounds for abolition of office will correspond to those on which the holder of an office may be called on to resign.

      <Col N="1306" /> This amendment is also introduced in response to the suggestion which I received in the House that the Minister should be more free to decide on its merits in each case whether the position of an officer had been materially altered to his detriment or not by reason of a transfer.  In the section, as it stood, the question of whether the position of an officer had been materially altered to his detriment or not by reason of a transfer to another office depended to some extent on whether the local authorities concerned could have made a more favourable offer of an alternative office or not.  It is now proposed to remove this feature so that the Minister's discretion will be less restricted.</P>

      <P>In page 9, to add to Section 20 a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(4)  A direction for the purposes of this section shall operate as follows, and not otherwise, that is to say: it shall permit a local authority, to whom it relates, if they so think fit, to assign remuneration to the relevant officers or servants within the levels of remuneration governed by the considerations indicated in the direction and, in the case of any such assignment, the sanction of the appropriate Minister shall not be necessary for giving effect to the local authority's decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is proposed to amend this section by the insertion of a new sub-section&mdash; sub-section (4)&mdash;which, it is hoped, will meet some of the objections to the section which were raised in the debate on the Committee Stage.  The new sub-section makes it clear that directions which may be given under the section will not be compulsory but merely permissive in character.  Local authorities may act on them or not as they wish.  It provides that where a local authority varies a wage rate in pursuance of a direction, it will not be necessary to obtain the sanction of the Minister.  Generally, it ensures that the directions will be merely a device by which the Minister can say to local <Col N="1307" /> authorities: &ldquo;If you wish to vary rates of wages you may do so as you please and you need not apply for any sanction to the changes, provided you keep within the limits laid down.  You are not, however, obliged to act on these directions if you do not wish to act.&rdquo;  So long as the basic scales are laid down, councils may vary the rates within the limits of those scales.  We are giving them that discretion in response to appeals made in the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I cannot congratulate the Minister on the way in which he has met the objections of the Labour Party to this section because to my mind he has, if anything, made the section worse from our point of view.  On the Committee Stage we had an amendment down which in effect was designed to keep to the minimum ministerial interference in the matter of rates of remuneration for local authority employees while at the same time giving the Minister the right of sanction.  We felt at that time and we still feel that any ministerial directions such as those envisaged under this particular section would, in effect, set down rates of pay for employees of local authorities without taking into account at all the varying circumstances as between one particular district and another, and we felt that such directions from the Custom House to the local authority would hamper&mdash; to say the least of it&mdash;negotiations between the local authority as employers and the trade unions representing the employees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister comes along now with this additional sub-section and all it does, in effect, is to say that if both trade unions and local authorities negotiate a rate of wages within the limits laid down in his direction they need not send that to the Minister for sanction. Our amendment sought greater freedom of negotiation between the representatives of the employees and the employing authority and I must say that I am very disappointed at the way the Minister has amended it in the Report Stage because I did feel we had made a better case and felt <Col N="1308" /> we had him converted.  I must say I am very disappointed.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 10:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 10, to delete lines 1 to 17, and substitute the following section:</P>
      <P>21.&mdash;(1)  No person shall hold any office of profit under or be employed for remuneration by or under any local authority while he is a member of that authority.</P>
      <P>(2)  No person shall hold any major office under a local authority while he is a member of any other local authority whose functional area is, or is situate in, the same county or county borough as that of or within which is situate the functional area of such local authority or in any county or county borough adjoining to that county or county borough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(3)  Where a person ceases to be a member of a local authority otherwise than by reason of the expiration of his term of office, he shall be regarded for the purposes of subsections (1) and (2) of this section as continuing to be such member for 12 months after such cesser or until <Col N="1309" /> his term of office would, but for such cesser, have expired, whichever is the shorter period.</P>
    <P>(4)  In this section any reference to a local authority shall be construed as not including a reference to any body whose functions are restricted to advice, consideration, report or consultation.</P>
    <P>(5)  Sub-section (1) of Section 70 of the Act of 1925 shall cease to have effect, subject to the proviso that every restriction on holding any office or profit or being employed for remuneration which resulted from the application by any other Act of that section and which was in operation immediately before the commencement of this section shall continue in operation.</P>
    <P>This amendment is one which was discussed at considerable length here on the last occasion.  The amendment now proposes to insert a new Section 21 to replace the existing Section 21 of the Bill and also sub-section (1) of Section 70 of the Local Government Act, 1925.  This deals with disqualifications of former members of local authorities who became employees, and without going into the law as it stands at the moment, it is now proposed that once a person ceases to become a member of a local authority, he is qualified to become an employee provided he ceases membership on the local authority coming to an end of its term of office.  In other words, he cannot resign, but if the particular local authority comes to the end of its term of office and he does not seek re-election, there is no bar on his obtaining employment.</P>
    <P>That is the principle behind the section. The proviso in sub-section (5) is designed to maintain the <i>status quo</i> so far as vocational education committees and county committees of agriculture are concerned.  Section 70 of the Local Government Act of 1925 has been applied to these committees by the Agriculture Act, 1931, and the Vocational Education Act, 1930, but the question of any amendment of that application is outside the scope of the present section, which deals only with <Col N="1310" /> local authorities under the jurisdiction of the Minister for Local Government.</P>

The effect is to bring in a new set of circumstances in which the erection of a sign, device, notice or light, will be an offence.  This is done by paragraph (c) of the amendment which makes it an offence if the sign, etc., obstructs the view of road users so as to render the road dangerous to them.

I searched the Second Reading debate on this Bill and I could not find any mention in it of any appeal to the Minister by anybody <Col N="1312" /> in connection with the Shannon and then, like a bolt from the blue, this amendment appeared on the paper and I am glad the Minister has called our attention to it in the manner in which he has done.  This House unanimously granted the Minister sanction for preventing the Westmeath County Council from putting a fixed bridge over the Shannon at Athlone. That is the position.  As one who believes that the waterways of this country should be free, at least in as far as they are navigable, I certainly claim here the same rights for the Blackwater as we have for the Shannon, and I do not think I am going beyond that.  Anyone who will take a look at that river will see what is the position of affairs on it.  What right have we as a legislative body to foresee the future, and to decide what use is to be made of the waterways of this country?  What right has any legislative body to say: &ldquo;Well, we are going to block this river for ever.&rdquo;  With regard to that lovely river at Cappoquin, what right has this House to say: &ldquo;We are going to prevent not alone ships going up to Cappoquin, but we are going to prevent the industrial development of that town.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>This might be considered a fairly clever move.  The case I am making is that in blocking the waterway a definite stop is being put to the industrial development of that town. I spent a considerable time in the town of Tallow on the River Bride which this bridge would also block, and anyone looking to-day at the idle mills and the dilapidated condition of it could not but feel that that town was crying out for an industry.  I am only seeking here for that town and for the town of Cappoquin what this Dáil on the 1st of December last freely granted to Athlone. I claim that we have a far bigger claim than that made for Athlone. Speaking in the Dáil on the 1st of <Col N="1313" /> December, 1954, on the Minister's amendment, in column 1400, Deputy Kennedy said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That swivel bridge has not been used for 20 years.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>But the Minister insisted that no fix would be put on the bridge.</P>
      <P>Take the River Blackwater.  I have information here from the Cork Harbour Commissioners which tells us the number of ships that passed up the river during the past four years.  In 1951 five ships passed up, in 1952 eight, in 1953 four, and in 1954 five; total 22 ships.  When I investigated the tonnage of these vessels, I found that they were ships of 300 tons, with masts of 63 feet and 65 feet, or thereabouts&mdash; schooners, in plain language.  That is the position.  I say when this House, in its wisdom, unanimously agreed with the Minister about Athlone, then I think I have a much better claim to ask the House to agree to this.  I do not think I am being unreasonable.  To my mind, this is the crux of the matter. That is why I said I believed I was pushing an open door.  I cannot see any reason on God's earth for any objection to this amendment, and therefore I confidently move it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say that I am in entire sympathy with the purpose of this amendment.  I am very appreciative of the manner in which the Minister made his decision as regards the Shannon.  I felt that any attempt to interfere with navigation on the Shannon, or indeed any other navigable highway, would be a completely retrograde step.</P>
      <P>I will not delay the House to-night repeating all the arguments in favour of non-interference with water highways. As I pointed out, water highways are as good and better than roadways, because they have the main advantage that they do not have to be annually maintained.  In addition, the history of industrial development the world over establishes the fact that industrial development always follows the main water highways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not familiar with the position of the River Blackwater I am not able to talk with any detailed knowledge <Col N="1314" /> or first-hand information of conditions there.  Deputy Corry, however, has mentioned, and I accept his assurance, that it is being used at the moment by a number of ships&mdash;I think he mentioned 22 in the last three or four years, ships of 300 tons.  Presumably these ships ply up and down the River Blackwater because they are able to transport goods more economically and more conveniently for the purposes of local industries, or for the purposes of townspeople along the river.  Why then, if that is so, should we decide to close a water highway?</P>
    <P>A waterway does not cost anything to maintain.  It is a ready-made highway with which God has provided us, and it should be used regularly for the transport of goods.  It would seem fantastic that we should not, at this stage, when we, I hope, are working towards a greater degree of national development and industrialisation, take note of the elementary factors.</P>
    <P>One of the vices of the provisions in the Bill relating to bridges has been fairly well illustrated by the instance of the Blackwater and by the controversy which has arisen in regard to the Youghal bridge.  I do not propose to review in detail the position which has arisen in this connection but it appears there are two alternative proposals, one for the reconstruction of the existing bridge with an opening span.  It is argued&mdash;and the argument is supported by a fairly responsible weight of technical opinion&mdash;that the existing bridge with the opening span can be reconstructed at a cost of something in the neighbourhood of £135,000 less than it would cost to construct a completely new bridge further up the river without an opening span.</P>
    <P>I mention that from this point of view.  As a result of some inquiry which was held&mdash;an inquiry of that nature very often is not very representative because local interests are not alive to the issues that are raised at the inquiry and very often they are not in a position to go and fight their case at the inquiry&mdash;and as a result of the departmental views, it has apparently been agreed by the Department of <Col N="1315" /> Local Government that the existing bridge is not to be rebuilt but that another bridge is to be built without any opening span and that that bridge will effectively block the navigation on the Blackwater River.  When I say &ldquo;effectively block&rdquo; I mean block it to ships of any sizable tonnage, and apparently ships of sizable tonnage at present use the Blackwater.  Even if only five ships a year use the Blackwater at the present moment, it would be nationally and economically unsound to block that river, that highway, which has been there since goodness know how long and which has, apparently, been consistently used for commerce of one kind or another.</P>
    <P>It does seem that, in the course of the inquiry which was held and in the course of the formulation of the official departmental view, those factors were left out of consideration.  The matter seems to have become entangled with all kinds of other considerations and conflict of technical views seems to have overshadowed the wider issue as to whether as a matter of policy it is sound to block any of our navigable rivers.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister has yet had an opportunity of considering definitely what is to be done in regard to navigation on the Blackwater and the Youghal bridge, but I would like to say this.  I am not a technician and I have no technical knowledge as to the possibilities of reconstructing the existing bridge with an opening span as against a proposal to construct a completely new bridge without an opening span, but I am satisfied that a strong case has been made against the proposal to build a completely new bridge.  A strong case has been made that the building of a new bridge would cost well over £100,000 more than the rebuilding of the existing bridge.  I do not know whether that is right or wrong, but certainly a case has been made which would put me on inquiry.</P>
    <P>I would urge the Minister very strongly not to take any action in regard to the Youghal bridge without having the matter fully investigated again.  I am not in a position to judge between the merits of different <Col N="1316" /> engineers or different proposals that have been put forward nor indeed is any member of this House in a position to judge these matters but I am satisfied that there is a sufficient body of technical opinion which favours the reconstruction of the existing bridge with an opening span at a cheaper cost than the construction of a completely new bridge which certainly would prevent me from supporting any proposal that might be made for the closing of the navigation on the Blackwater.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to approach this whole question of the Blackwater on the basis that it would be a completely retrograde step to close any navigable highway and particularly one which is in constant use and has been in constant use, apparently, for centuries for commerce of a sizable nature.  I hope that various towns on the Blackwater will eventually emerge from the state of depression in which they now are and if they do they will undoubtedly require to be able to use the River Blackwater.  In years to come, perhaps the next ten, 20 or 50 years, the people of that day and generation who will want to develop these towns will point their finger against the Government that allowed the navigation to be blocked on that river.</P>
    <P>There is just one other consideration which might possibly be more for the Department of Finance than for the Minister and it is this.  As I understand the legislation affecting the building of bridges which obstruct navigation, it provides that compensation has to be paid to any interests that were damaged by interference with that navigation.  I wonder if the Minister has obtained any estimate of the amount of the claims that may be made by people who utilise the Blackwater at the moment to carry goods? Possibly they may be in a position to make very substantial claims.  If the building of a completely new bridge with an opening span in itself costs more than the rebuilding of the existing bridge with an opening span, we have now to add the probable amount for compensation that would have to be paid to the users of the Blackwater, <Col N="1317" /> whose rights would be interfered with if the river is blocked.</P>
    <P>For all these reasons I would ask the Minister to accept this amendment. I think he will be doing what is nationally right and I feel that in doing that he will earn the gratitude of the people along the Blackwater, of the people whose livelihood depends on their being able to use the river, so that his action in keeping open the Blackwater will be part of a tribute to him ultimately by other generations when the towns on the river are fully developed.</P>

      <P>I am very sorry I cannot accept this amendment.  Deputy MacBride spoke here some weeks ago &mdash;on the 1st of December, I think&mdash;on this Bill and he and others made an exceptional case as to why the Shannon should be treated differently from the other waterways.  He convinced me and he convinced the House to such an extent that we accepted an amendment.  As I have said, it was pointed out to us then that the Shannon was different from any other waterway in the country.  I would not like any person to think that I propose to obstruct navigation.  I have no such intention.  If a fixed bridge is built there it will not affect navigation in the way that has been suggested here. We already have a fixed bridge over the Boyne and there never has been the suggestion that it has been an obstruction to navigation.  There is another one over the Foyle in Derry. It is one of the finest in Ireland and we have never heard any suggestion that navigation there has been affected.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister's approach to this question of the building of fixed bridges is poor consolation to anybody like Deputy MacBride or Deputy Corry who is interested in keeping our waterways open.  In regard to this amendment, I would take the viewpoint already expressed by Deputy MacBride that the test of the navigable waterway is that it is navigable for ships of a certain draft.  I consider that to be a reasonable test, in my humble opinion. In the case of Youghal bridge we will allow 30 feet for high tides instead of the 21 the Minister mentioned, but I think the Minister knows very well <Col N="1319" /> that even the 30 feet I allow would not be enough for navigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>It all depends on what size the vessel is and I do not think that even 30 feet would be sufficient to provide a clearance there for navigation.  If, on the one hand, you are to build an opening structure which would preserve the navigable rights of the people there or, on the other hand, you were to build ramps and raise the roadway to make provision for a fixed bridge, I wonder how the two sets of costs would compare? I feel quite sure they would favour the opening structure.  We are not all engineers or technicians here, so there is no use in giving technical opinions. The essential thing is that we should make every reasonable effort to keep our waterways open to the extent to which they are navigable at the moment.</P>
      <P>Frankly, I wonder if the Minister was serious in giving us the examples of bridges which he gave us here.  I suppose he does not make the point, but surely he is not even remotely suggesting the building here of any structure on the subsidiary waterways of Ireland like some of the bridges he mentioned.  I feel rather strongly that, though from the short term viewpoint the cost of an opening structure might look big, it is worth while from the point of view of preserving the waterways and of keeping them available to traffic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>None of these waterways is navigable beyond a certain length.  We are dealing specifically here with the River Blackwater, but I know one or two other rivers as well which could be covered equally in this.  The Boyne Viaduct is exceptionally high, but it is the exception because the River Boyne is blocked unduly by another bridge at Drogheda, and even though there is a canal&mdash;but I shall not go into details.  The Shannon is exceptional only in its size.  The Minister claims there was an exceptional case made for the Shannon.  What is it? Is it the size of the waterway and the <Col N="1320" /> length to which navigation is possible on it.  The Blackwater, the Barrow, the Nore, the Suir, the Slaney are others of our rivers which have considerable navigable stretches up from their mouths as well, and what has happened in the past should make us acquiesce in this amendment.</P>
    <P>I do not see a great difference in principle as between the Shannon and these other rivers.  Of course, the reverse would hold in the case of a very small river somewhere.  For instance, there is the Blackwater running through Meath which joins the Boyne and which in its upper reaches would not be navigable, so there would be no particular sense in preserving it as a navigable waterway; but in the particular instance in question here at Youghal, right at the mouth of the Blackwater, as Deputy Corry has pointed out, I think there is every case.  I would strongly urge the Minister to accept in this particular case.  I go further and say that if there are any other instances in which an exception should be made towards the mouth of a river, now is the time to make the survey.  Perhaps this would meet the Minister's point: suppose the Minister were to restrict Deputy Corry's amendment to the first fixed bridge, would that meet with his approval? I can see difficulties.  I know the Shannon has its open bridges. Suppose the Minister were to restrict the amendment to the first fixed bridge&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Offhand, I cannot remember all of them, but I know at Fermoy there is a fixed span over the River Blackwater.  That is non-openable and a definite block to navigation there.  I am sure there are ones further down than that.  Would my suggestion help the Minister; make it the first existing fixed bridge and exempt the river below that bridge to the sea.  I think everybody would be reasonably happy if that were done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>On the face of it, it seems quite sensible to ask that this amendment should be conceded.  It <Col N="1321" /> simply requests that on the River Blackwater there should be no fixed bridge.  What part of the Blackwater is involved?  Does the Deputy mean Youghal, or every part of it?  That is one point on which we should have some clarification.  Deputy de Valera raised the other point.  He mentioned Fermoy.  Now we all know that bridges do not last forever.  Deputy Corry's claim is a sensible one but, at the same time, there is another angle.  Assuming Deputy Corry is speaking merely in relation to Youghal, the point then arises as to where at Youghal the bridge should be situated.  That is the crux.  It is only natural that Cork representatives should consider the interests of Cork before anywhere else, but we cannot afford to let anyone lead us up the garden path, particularly when we do not know where that path is leading.</P>
      <P>We all know where the existing bridge is across the river at Youghal. Is it the Deputy's contention that the non-fixed bridge should be erected at that particular point?  If that is his argument, he has, of course, a case. The Minister mentioned Ardsallagh.  I do not know whether Deputy Corry will admit that he has some case behind his amendment if there is clearance to that point.  Like everyone else I have had to go through a certain purgatory in Cork County Council in relation to the bridge at Youghal.  At every meeting we have had to learn a little more about it.  I do not believe there would be a case for a bridge of the type to which Deputy Corry refers further up the Blackwater.  It is quite clear that Deputy Corry is anxious that the bridge should be constructed at a certain point and possibly we may not all agree as to that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Were we to agree to this amendment, however, it could be used against us afterwards in connection with our own local deliberations because we will be responsible for the financing of this bridge.  It is the local representatives who will be involved where the question of finance is concerned and not the members of this House.  Assuming Deputy Corry means only one bridge, as I believe he does, then our difficulty <Col N="1322" /> will be to decide where the particular bridge should be placed.  The Minister has mentioned Ardsallagh.  Deputy Corry knows every inch of that area. He may not admit it here but he realises perfectly well that at the particular point at Ardsallagh there would be clearance for the particular type of craft using the Blackwater.</P>
    <P>We all know the draft required in the various areas.  That is an angle to which we should advert because a question may arise later in relation to another river where there is sufficient depth for some of the largest boats coming into this country.  Deputy Corry referred to an old bit of a river, and he was speaking at the time of the quays at Cork City.  If the River Lee is only a stream, surely Deputy Corry cannot now try to convince us that the Blackwater is something bigger.</P>
    <P>I do not think it would be sensible at this juncture to accept what Deputy Corry is asking for without all the cards being put on the table.  That is the problem which confronts us in the existing circumstances.  It is a serious one.  It is a matter we cannot decide here and now in the very short time at our disposal.  I think it would be unfair to Deputy Corry as well as unfair to ourselves, to jump to such a hasty conclusion as Deputy Corry would have us come to in this particular instance.  In view of the fact that nobody knows at the moment where this particular bridge will be erected I consider this is the wrong time at which to ask us to decide on the particular type of bridge.  Had the Minister given his decision as to where the particular bridge should be erected on the Blackwater, then we would have that information.  I agree that if this bridge is to be erected near the existing one it should be the type required by Deputy Corry.  In that event he would have an excellent case and great credit would be due to him for tabling this amendment.  But I do not know that Deputy Corry can anticipate a decision because none of us knows what the decision will be.  We do not know at the moment where the bridge will be erected and we cannot, therefore, make up our minds whether or <Col N="1323" /> not it should be the type required by Deputy Corry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday I tabled a question seeking information regarding the prohibition on the growing of Dutch potatoes in certain areas of East Donegal.  Before I proceed I want to say that it is only an hour ago that I got a copy of the supplementary questions from the General Office and that was the first time I was aware that the Minister, in the cross-talk that took place, asked me to come to his office where I would get further information about the matter.  I was not aware of that yesterday.</P>
      <P>The position is that a decision was taken last year to convert the alcohol factory at Labbadish into a factory for the manufacture of starch.  In experiments which were carried out it was discovered that Dutch varieties of potatoes have the highest percentage of starch and, for that reason, it is desirable to grow Dutch potatoes in and around the factory area.  Due to action taken by the Minister, farmers within a radius of about 20 miles from the factory are prohibited from growing Dutch varieties of potatoes this year whereas farmers in the Inishowen area are allowed to grow such potatoes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are several problems arising out of that situation and it is no harm to have them cleared up.  On the face of it, the Minister's statement as to why he banned the growing of Dutch potatoes in the areas referred to seems reasonable but, when we consider it, difficulties arise.  First of all, the Minister stated that he was not prepared to allow these potatoes to be grown this year in the areas specified for the reason that there was the danger that disease might be brought into an area which is known throughout Ireland and parts of Europe as one of the best seed-producing areas.  That seems to be fair enough.  If there is any danger whatsoever that a disease might be brought in by the importation <Col N="1324" /> of Dutch varieties of potatoes of high starch content, it is very wise to prohibit them.  But, Holland is a bigger producer of seed potatoes than we are.</P>
    <P>I think the potato marketing companies' representatives who have gone to the Continent in the past number of years have found very keen competition in Spain and elsewhere from Dutch seed potato growers.  If that is so, do not think there is any danger to the seed potato trade in Donegal.  The Minister has allowed the potatoes to be grown in Inishowen.  Inishowen is a very fine seed potato producing area. In Inishowen there are four registered seed potato exporters.  If there is the danger that the Minister anticipates, why allow the small farmers of Inishowen who grow seed and ware potatoes for export to be exposed to the danger of disease?</P>
    <P>The Minister knows the Lagan Valley, the banned area.  He knows that the farmers there have big holdings.  He knows that if a disease occurs in their seed potato crop they will not starve, they can turn to a number of other agricultural operations, whereas, if the small farmers of Inishowen suffer loss by reason of their potato crop being infected by imported disease they have not as many resources to fall back on or have not as many alternatives as the Lagan seed potato producers have.</P>
    <P>There is another point in connection with the country of origin.  I have said that the Dutch are our keenest competitors in the seed potato trade.  I expect that the potatoes would be inspected both before exportation and after importation.  That is a double safeguard.</P>
    <P>If there is this danger to our seed export trade, will it mean that farmers in Inishowen who will be growing these potatoes which are a doubtful commodity will be prevented from exporting seed potatoes to the Continent this coming season?  It would be a bad job, of course, if any seed potatoes from Inishowen, when exported to the Continent, were found to be infected by some disease.  In view of the fact that Dutch varieties of potatoes will be grown in Inishowen this year will there <Col N="1325" /> be a ban on the export of the ordinary seed potatoes that has been carried on there?  Will home varieties of potatoes be allowed into the starch factory at Labbadish?  It is important.  There may not be a great surplus of potatoes this year but there may be next year.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I am anxious to know if farmers in the neighbourhood of Labbadish, who are not being allowed to grow Dutch potatoes, will be given an opportunity of sending their surplus of the ordinary crop to the factory for manufacture into starch and will the price which will be available for the Dutch varieties be available for the home-grown varieties?</P>
    <P>The Donegal Committee of Agriculture has over the past few years experimented with Dutch varieties around the Labbadish factory.  Several plots of Danish varieties of potatoes were grown last year in the same Lagan valley, the same area where they are now banned.  I know a number of farmers who grew these varieties &mdash;I forget the varieties at the moment&mdash; but I know that they were grown under the auspices of the Donegal Committee of Agriculture, some of them in the neighbourhood of the factory and others scattered throughout the Lagan area.  I understand that they did very well, having a high starch content and giving a high yield.  The experiments which went on last year and the year before were very successful and I think it a pity that at this stage, in view of those experiments, the farmers who were banking this year on producing a crop of these potatoes are debarred from doing so.  These points have been worrying me for quite a while.  I would like to see a more attractive price being paid for potatoes, especially if the <i>status quo</i> remains, in view of the long transport involved from Inishowen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I unfortunately missed the opening portion of Deputy Cunningham's statement, but, having listened to what he said, there is not very much I can add.  The first thing I should like to ask is: was it really <Col N="1326" /> necessary that these potatoes should have been brought in at all, and, secondly, if it was and if it has been decided to be necessary, as I take it it has, is there a risk of infection of other varieties or of infection of the soil in any area in which these potatoes are grown?  Judging from the Minister's reply to the question asked of him yesterday, it would appear that some risk does exist.  While I must agree with the Minister wholeheartedly in his and the Department's efforts to isolate that risk, I think, at the same time, that, from the point of view of the wellbeing of the small seed producer of Inishowen and other areas far removed from the Lagan valley, any risk that might arise should not have been made their responsibility, because seed growing in the districts of small farmers is a very much more serious business from the point of view of the small farmer's economy than it is in the case of the large farmer in the Lagan.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister let me finish?  We are possibly on the same track, but I am coming on a different line.  I am putting to the Minister for his due and weighty observations that if the risk is there, and I assume it is because of the action of the Department, why place the risk on the small farmers of Inishowen, because if the risk develops and something arises due to these imported potatoes, the Inishowen area may well go by the board as a seed producing area in the future.  If that should happen, it would be a much greater calamity for the small farmers of Inishowen than it would be in the case of the larger farmers of the Lagan. On the other hand, I do see that from a national point of view and from the point of view of the seed potato industry as a whole, the loss would be greater should the Lagan valley, where a bigger area is grown, become infected; but, from the point of view of the economics of the respective types of farmers in the two areas, the <Col N="1327" /> greater loss would be that of the Inishowen small farmer to whom an acre, an acre and a half or two acres of seed potatoes may well be the mainstay of his income in any particular year.  On the other hand, as has been asserted by Deputy Cunningham, Dutch varieties have been grown already in the Lagan valley which the Minister is now trying to protect by not allowing these same potatoes to be grown there and the question that arises in my mind is whether or not there is a difference in the varieties grown last year as against this year, and, if that is so, whether the varieties of last year did not carry the same risk.  That may well be the case, but I rather doubt it.</P>
      <P>Again, a very important point for the coming year in Inishowen or any of the areas in which these potatoes will be grown is: will this interfere with the export next season of our ordinary home produced certified seeds?  Will it have any ill-effect on the sending of these potatoes out of the country as heretofore?  That is something which is well worth pondering on.  The other question which I asked at the beginning, as to whether or not this is at all necessary, is one on which I should like the Minister, in the limited time at his disposal, to give us some information, because my information is that some of the varieties grown here at home, and grown for a long number of years, have been known to produce a starch content of over 16 per cent. and as high as 16.3 per cent., and I have the feeling that if these same varieties were treated with a view to producing starch, to giving a high starch content, we could even exceed the high percentage we have already got from some of our own potatoes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These items are items of great importance to the farmers of Donegal. It may well be that, from the national point of view, they are not of very world-shaking consequence, but to the small farmers of Inishowen and other parts of the country where the growing of seed potatoes has been carried on of recent years as a cash crop, it is a matter of great consequence, and it is <Col N="1328" /> definitely for that reason, so far as I am concerned, and, I am sure, so far as Deputy Cunningham is concerned that we bring this matter to the notice of the Minister in the way in which it has been brought to-night.  It is not in any sense to be taken as a mere political manoeuvre&mdash;it is raised purely in the interests of the small farmers and the large farmers of the area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>First, it is right for the House to bear in mind that our total seed potato exports now amount to 27,591 tons per annum and constitute a very important and valuable export trade, which depends for its maintenance and growth on the certainty enjoyed by those to whom we send the seed potatoes that our system of supervision is as water-tight as it is humanly possible to make it so that purchasers of Irish seed potatoes are guaranteed, with the highest standard of security, that they will bring into their country no potato disease from seed purchased in Ireland. The danger which we are resolved to take every precaution against is the possibility of introducing the virus of leaf roll into the seed growing areas of County Donegal.</P>
      <P>I am going to answer, if I may, Deputy Cunningham's specific inquiries <i>seriatim.</i>  I hope Deputy Blaney will not misunderstand me.  You cannot come in prepared to answer on the Adjournment Deputy Cunningham's inquiry only to discover that Deputy Blaney is going to raise quite another question for which you have not prepared yourself to speak in detail.</P>

      <P>I came prepared to deal with the particular inquiry by Deputy Cunningham.  He asks if the factory will take any ordinary variety of potatoes in addition to the high starch variety.  They will, but I do not think the price is such as to make it economic for farmers to grow a variety of potatoes that has not got this exceptionally high starch content and heavy yield.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>Will it be the same scale?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If a farmer has a surplus of potatoes that he wants to get rid of at the price paid per ton, the factory will take them, although I do not think it will be profitable for a farmer to grow eating type potatoes for sale to the factory at a price fixed in anticipation of high starch content heavy yield Dutch varieties being grown.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cunningham asks if there will be a ban on seed from Inishowen. No.  The way the Department administers the seed potato scheme is that every crop of potatoes grown for the production of certified seed is kept under constant supervision during the whole period of its growth by peripatetic inspectors of the Department. Any crop, then that reaches maturity and is saved by the farmer free from disease is eligible to be exported as certified seed.  But if disease turns up in a crop of potatoes, whereever grown, which is designed for the certified seed market, that crop is condemned and its produce cannot be exported as certified seed.  The crop, field by field, is inspected.  Am I clear on that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Could that not be left to apply to the Lagan as well as to Inishowen?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It applies everywhere. Let me explain.  You ask: Why should you allow the growing of any Dutch potatoes in Inishowen if you are afraid they may carry the leaf roll virus disease?  The answer is that this is one of the dilemmas with which the Minister for Agriculture perennially occupies himself.  The natural inclination of the Minister for Agriculture is to allow no live stock, fowl or plant into the country from a foreign source because we are so exceptionally fortunately situated.  Being an island, we have kept at bay a great number of veterinary and horticultural diseases which are endemic on the Continent of Europe.  One of the reasons why we are such an excellent source of seed potatoes is because we are so free from disease.  I do not want, for a moment, to suggest that certification or inspection by the Dutch Government <Col N="1330" /> authorities is inadequate or in any way defective.</P>
      <P>I am the Irish Minister for Agriculture and it is no alibi for me to say that I hold a certificate from the Dutch Minister for Agriculture.  A country that buys potatoes in Ireland depends on my certificate, as the Irish Minister for Agriculture, and it is no alibi for me to say that I depend on the Dutch Government's certificate.  I must, through my officers, inspect the crop grown in Ireland.  On the basis of what I have observed growing in Ireland, through the officers of my Department, I certify to purchasers in Spain, Israel, Portugal or anywhere else, as Minister for Agriculture of the Irish Republic, that the seed came from a healthy crop grown in Ireland under my supervision.  Therefore, it is no use for me to say that I depend on the Dutch certificate.  I depend on no certificate except the authority of the officers of my own Department who have themselves inspected the growing crop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason I propose to allow these potatoes to be grown in Inishowen is that if the unexpected or a possible catastrophe eventuated and leaf roll virus was present in this Dutch seed that came in, Inishowen is, in its own way, a little island and I could easily cut it off and segregate the disease in Inishowen.  Deputies can realise what might happen in such circumstances if I let it out.  Suppose I planted it in the middle of the Lagan valley or in North Mayo and there were an outbreak of the leaf roll virus disease.  I could not segregate it there but I can segregate it in Inishowen.  I do not anticipate any disease but I have a duty, while hoping for the best, to prepare for the worst.  Nobody will listen to alibis from me if I say I have the certificate of the Dutch Minister for Agriculture that these potatoes are disease free.  If they are not, I must answer to Dáil Éireann and the Dutch Minister for Agriculture cannot be called to account.  There is no reason to expect that there will be disease in these potatoes.  I think it is perfectly possible that everyone who grows seed potatoes in Inishowen, even though his neighbour is growing <Col N="1331" /> this Dutch variety, will be able to export his seed without the slightest difficulty and that my peripatetic inspectors will walk the fields of Inishowen and certify every crop there as being perfectly healthy and sound and that no difficulty will ensue.</P>
    <P>If we get over this year, it is my confident anticipation that there will be an abundant supply of this high starch yield variety seed available from what is going to be grown in Inishowen this year which can be grown anywhere. It is true that there have been experimental plantings of these high starch yield potatoes in the past, conducted under the supervision of the county committee of agriculture in collaboration with the officers of my Department, and the seed can be planted anywhere.  Our restriction applies to the plantings of Dutch seed which we import.  We confidently anticipate that the seed we get from Holland will be disease free but we will take no risk about it.  We do not feel we have any alibi by pleading that we accepted the Dutch Minister's certificate. Therefore, we are going to confine it to Inishowen, confidently anticipating <Col N="1332" /> that there will be no trouble but keeping our powder dry and, if serious trouble should arise, being in a position to draw a line across the neck of Inishowen and securely segregating the rest of the seed-growing area of Donegal from any possibility of contamination. Is that not a perfectly rational procedure and is that not the best way of trying to safeguard every legitimate interest involved in this business?  If Deputy Cunningham were himself the Minister for Agriculture, what else would he do?</P>
    <P>In conclusion, may I say I am sorry Deputy Cunningham did not hear my invitation to him to discuss this matter with him?  I should not have thought it necessary for me to issue a specific invitation to any Deputy of this House to come to me about any matter in which he is interested, in the assurance that every facility I can place at his disposal will be placed without reservation and without any infringement of his subsequent right to raise the matter in the House if he does not get satisfaction in the course of any private interview he may have had.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11 p.m, until 3 p.m. on Tuesday, 8th March, 1955.</P>
