      <P>Sugar is supplied to all Irish manufacturers at the controlled maximum price of £59 10s. a ton, less a rebate for quantity.  Under an arrangement already made with Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann, Teoranta, further rebates are allowed by the company in respect of the sugar content of goods shown to have been exported. These rebates are designed to ensure that an efficient Irish manufacturer will have a reasonable opportunity of competing successfully in international markets.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The current price of meat has been the subject of examination by the Prices Advisory Body. They have reported that the recent increases are attributable entirely to the increased prices payable by victuallers for live stock and can be fairly related to those prices.  In the circumstances I do not consider that there are any effective steps which I can take to secure a reduction in meat prices.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>No doubt the Minister is aware that the present high prices of meat in Dublin are based on the assumption that the butchers are paying the maximum price for cattle in the market and in view of the fact that they do not buy prime heifer beef but cow beef which is much cheaper, would the Minister not consider having the butchers grade their meat and have them certified as selling grade heifer beef or grade cow beef?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very different type of question from the one on the Order Paper.  This matter has been examined in detail by the Prices Advisory Body.  The Prices Advisory Body reported that the recent increases in the price of meat are due entirely to the fact&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that.  I said that the matter was examined by the Prices Advisory Body and they reported to me that the increase is due entirely to the fact that the butchers have to pay more for the meat.  My function is to regulate profit margins, <Col N="6" /> not to fix the price of meat in the markets.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 11 together. The late harvest and inclement weather had the effect of disrupting the normal marketing of potatoes, but the position has now improved.  I am informed that there is no reason, at this stage, to assume that there will be a shortage of potatoes, so that the need for price control is unlikely to arise.  Meanwhile, the position is being kept under active review by the Prices Advisory Body.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The possibility of erecting a turf-fired electricity generating station in the Castlerea area, County Roscommon, has already been examined.  I am advised that the quantity of turf surplus to local needs which could be produced in the area would not be sufficient to provide for the operation of a generating station on a reasonably economic basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that a survey was carried out <Col N="9" /> in that area by engineers attached to the county council, who were experienced in bog work?  They have submitted an estimate of the amount of fuel available in the bogs in that area, and it is believed by them, and others concerned, that there is sufficient fuel there to warrant the setting up of a generating station.  Would the Minister not reconsider this matter in view of the serious unemployment situation which will be created in the Castlerea area shortly?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Less than 18 months ago Bord na Móna examined this matter in detail, and reported that the quantity of turf was not such as would justify the setting up, near Castlerea, of a generating station.

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">

      <P>I am informed by the E.S.B. that the Glenbeigh area has been considered by the board for development under the rural electrification scheme, but has not so far been selected.  It will be reconsidered by the board at regular intervals of about four months.  An official canvass of the residents of Templenoe area has been completed and the area will be considered for selection in due course.  An official canvass of the Sneem area will commence shortly.  The prospects of <Col N="12" /> these areas being selected for development will depend on how their returns compare with those of other areas still awaiting development in the board's Tralee district.</P>
      <P>The development of areas in the Cahirciveen region cannot take place until the board's transmission network has been extended to Cahirciveen.  This will take place in conjunction with the commissioning of the small turf-fired generating station in that locality. The board has suggested that local committees might be formed in these areas to carry out preliminary canvasses and, if sufficient interest is shown in the scheme, official canvasses will be carried out by the board in due course with a view to having the areas considered for development.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy asked me to state whether the Government have any proposals under consideration for the immediate relief of distress in the flooded areas of North Galway, to which I have replied that I am not aware that a critical situation obtains in North Galway for which the provision of State funds is necessary for the alleviation of distress.</P>
      <P>I have made a careful survey of this area and, so far as my information goes, 39 holdings have been affected by flooding.  The total area of the holdings involved is 1,355 acres.  The total area of land flooded is 497 acres. No live stock have been lost in the area.  Eleven houses were evacuated, involving about 25 adults and 14 children. Alternative accommodation was, happily, found for them all by friends and neighbours with the exception of one family which was provided for elsewhere.  The Army removed two tons of corn from a mill and furniture from two of the houses and gave certain other help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="23" /> A local committee was established, under the chairmanship of the Archbishop of Tuam, to collect funds for the relief of the persons affected.  It is understood that, at present, the fund amounts to about £1,000.  There are only 39 holdings affected. If there is £1,000 available to the local committee, I do not think there can be any urgent need for the appropriation of public funds to relieve these 39 persons until the local fund has been disbursed.  If that should prove unequal to the urgent demands for the relief of distress in the area, then the Government would be quite prepared to consider the matter.</P>

No estimate is available of the losses in respect of oats, hay and other such crops in that area. In such circumstances, are we to take it that the Government have just sat idly by and propose to do nothing? People in this area had to leave their homes as far back as the 20th October last.

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture whether he is aware that three horses died from hardship during the voyage of the <i>S.S. City of Amsterdam,</i> which left Dublin on 26th November, 1954, and that five more had to be slaughtered immediately on arrival, and further, whether he is aware of other cases of horses dying at sea on vessels travelling from Irish ports to Belgium during the months of December, 1954, and January, 1955; and, if so, whether, in view of the deleterious effect reports of such occurrences have on our national reputation, he will make a statement in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that there were three casualties at sea among the <Col N="25" /> 191 horses shipped on this occasion.  I have no information regarding horses slaughtered at Antwerp after the arrival of the ship.</P>
      <P>There was a relatively small number of casualties among horses shipped to Belgium in December and January.</P>
      <P>I am aware that statements have been made in the Press and otherwise by some persons&mdash;mainly outside this country&mdash;who display little anxiety to weigh the true facts, and seem interested in gaining a certain notoriety by depicting this trade in fantastic and lurid colours and by abusing myself and the Government of which I am a member.  I cannot agree that sensational newspaper articles and abuse can do any damage to our national reputation when the true facts show that there is no real ground for these attacks.  As those responsible for the attacks made no prior approach to my Department to obtain the facts, it might be well if I set out the position briefly:</P>
      <P>Stringent conditions govern the shipment of horses from this country.  They include individual veterinary examination of horses before shipment to ensure that only horses which are strong, healthy, in good condition and fit for work are exported.  The type of accommodation on board ship and the foddering and watering of the animals are also provided for in detail.  I know that these conditions are effectively carried out, both from reports by veterinary officers who have travelled with consignments of horses, from the testimony of private citizens who have also travelled on these ships and from a recent Belgian report which was summarised in the newspapers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All Governments and veterinary authorities regard the transport of horses by sea as legitimate.  Horses have been for very many years and are still shipped regularly from many countries for a variety of purposes ranging from war to racing.  It is true that an absolute guarantee against the hazards of nature cannot be given either in the case of human beings (of whom many have been lost at sea this winter) or of live stock but I am satisfied that the conditions applied in this country to the transport of horses by <Col N="26" /> sea not only conform to the highest international standards but are more stringent than those applied in many other countries.  In the case of the <i>S.S. City of Amsterdam,</i> there have been references to the length of the voyage but my information is that the unusually long period between the departure of the ship from Dublin and its arrival at Antwerp was mainly due to the fact that the captain, out of consideration for the animals, sheltered off Rosslare for several days.  It is also my understanding that the decision of the captain to continue the trip to Antwerp was in no way reprehensible but was arrived at after a fair appraisal of the weather conditions and other relevant circumstances.</P>
    <P>While asserting the basic legitimacy of the transport of horses by sea, and the high standard of our regulations, I am of course, as always, prepared to look into any incident which is brought to my notice and I shall continue to see that everything practicable is done to ensure the safety and the comfort of all horses while at sea.</P>

The cost of opening the fort for a short period would be fairly heavy and as there is suitable accommodation for summer camp personnel (F.C.A.) in Kilkenny Barracks, Gormanston Camp and Cathal Brugha Barracks, it is proposed to utilise these places to their fullest extent. Only if accommodation in those locations <Col N="30" /> were overtaxed would the establishment of an additional training centre be considered.  It is most unlikely that regular or first line troops will require extra training accommodation this year but it is not possible to forecast requirements in any future year.  The military authorities have, however, indicated that the fort will be used if, and when, the exigencies of the service so demand.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Defence if he will arrange for the use of the F.C.A. hall in Tomhaggard, County Wexford, for vocational education purposes, such as domestic economy instruction, for which there is a pressing local demand.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The F.C.A. hut at Tomhaggard is a timber structure roofed with felting.  Owing to the highly inflammable nature of such structures their use by outside bodies is not permitted, and accordingly I regret that the hut at Tomhaggard cannot be made available for vocational education purposes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that this happens to be the only hall available in this district?  The vocational committee require the hall for the purpose of training a domestic economy class and they are prepared to insure it against any risk of fire.  In view of this would the Parliamentary Secretary reconsider the matter?  I know the risk of burning down the hall would be far less in the case of a domestic economy class than would arise from its use by a body of recruits training for the F.C.A.</P>

      <P>The Chief Executive Officer, County Wexford Vocational Education Committee, applied in October 1954 for permission to use the F.C.A. at Tomhaggard to hold a domestic science class and was informed that his application could not be granted.  The construction of the hut at Tomhaggard was completed on 11th January, 1950.  There is no water supply to the hut and sanitary facilities are provided by a chemical non-flush toilet in a wooden lean-to <Col N="31" /> shed at the rear of the building.  On the 14th April, 1951, a general instruction prohibiting the letting of such huts to outside bodies was issued.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Defence if he will state if he has received an application from the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union for an increase of 8/- per week for civilian chefs and waiters employed in a number of military barracks in Dublin, and, if so, whether he proposes to accede to this request, and thus bring the pay of these workers to the level of those employed in the same capacity elsewhere.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The application referred to in the first part of the question was received in my Department on the 19th November, 1954.  It was, in effect, a request to reopen a claim made by the union in 1952 for the grant of an increase of 18/- per week to the employees in question.  After the most exhaustive and sympathetic examination of that claim, including consideration of increases granted at the time to comparable outside workers, it was found that the maximum increase which could be conceded was 12/6 per week and this increase was duly paid with effect from the 1st September, 1952.  In these circumstances the union has been informed that its recent application is not one which could be favourably considered.</P>

      <P>Over 97 per cent. of subscribers connected to the telephone service have continuous (day and night) service including all subscribers connected to exchanges in rural areas with 20 or more subscribers and over half the subscribers served from smaller rural exchanges.</P>
      <P>The problem of giving continuous service at small rural exchanges is one of cost of all-night attendance being out of all proportion to revenue; in many cases the additional cost would exceed the total rentals being paid by the subscribers affected.  A solution may be found in small rural automatic exchanges of suitable type and cost for conditions here and this aspect of the matter is under investigation in my Department.</P>
      <P>I should add that most public telephones in rural post offices are now connected at night to continuous service exchanges in order to provide a means in an emergency of making calls after normal hours of post office business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the International Wavelength Plan for Europe the power permitted for transmitters is designed to provide a broadcasting service of good quality within the national territory of each country. While we are anxious that Irish people in London should get reception from Radio Éireann, we cannot provide specifically for good reception there. Apart from the commitments under the international plan referred to, which was drawn up to prevent chaotic conditions of interference between stations, it would not be practicable <Col N="34" /> on technical grounds to guarantee good reception in London from a medium wave transmitter.  I should mention that because of the large increase in the number of broadcasting stations in Europe in recent years, it is becoming increasingly difficult for us and for the other European countries to give satisfactory reception conditions within the national boundaries not to mention reception outside them.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare whether he is aware of the hardship imposed on recipients of unemployment assistance, who are compelled to travel from Cromane to Killorglin employment exchange, and, if so, if he will arrange to allow the men concerned to register at Cromane post office.</P>

      <P>The position of applicants for unemployment assistance in the Cromane area has been under consideration and I am satisfied that there are no special circumstances which would justify exceptional treatment for those persons.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that some of the recipients of unemployment assistance are just on the borderline specified by the Department &mdash;that is, six miles from the employment exchange?  If a new survey was carried out these people would be entitled to report at the local post office.  People who are further down the road and nearer to Killorglin than those to whom I am specifically referring are in receipt of their unemployment assistance through the medium of the postal services.  A difficulty exists; whether that is the result of the survey that was carried out not being up-to-date, I do not know, but we would be grateful if the Minister would have the position further examined now.</P>

The delay which was <Col N="43" /> unavoidable, was due to the volume of work involved in the examination of the employment records from April last.

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Norton) William Norton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Norton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  My object in introducing this Bill is to dissolve Fógra Fáilte which is at present responsible for tourist publicity and to transfer its functions, assets and liabilities to An Bord Fáilte.  From my examination of the working of the tourist organisations I have become convinced that there is no justification for the existence of two separate statutory bodies dealing with tourism. In my view the most effective method of promoting tourism is to have all the functions discharged by the one statutory body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Dáil will perhaps appreciate the position more clearly if I explain that at present there are three separate <Col N="47" /> organisations with responsibilities in connection with the development and publicising of the tourist industry. Two of these, An Bord Fáilte, and Fógra Fáilte, are statutory bodies; the third, the Irish Tourist Association, is a private organisation.  An Bord Fáilte was the name given by the Tourist Traffic Act, 1952, to the Irish Tourist Board, which was originally established by the Tourist Traffic Act, 1939.  The general function of An Bord Fáilte is to encourage and promote the development of tourist traffic in and to the State.  In effect this means that An Bord Fáilte discharges all functions in connection with tourism except those related to publicity. Under the Act of 1952 the board may receive a Grant-in-Aid up to £250,000 each year.</P>
    <P>Prior to 1951 publicity functions in connection with tourism had been divided between the Irish Tourist Board and the Irish Tourist Association. The Tourist Traffic Act, 1952, set up a separate statutory board, Fógra Fáilte, to deal with all publicity functions.  This board also was given an annual Grant-in-Aid of £250,000. The third organisation, the Irish Tourist Association, is a private company which has been in existence for over 25 years and since its establishment has been engaged in encouraging tourist traffic.  It consists of representatives of local authorities, the hotel industry and other organisations interested in the promotion of tourism. The association derives its revenue mainly from voluntary contributions made to it by local authorities for tourist publicity purposes.  When the legislation of 1952 was being prepared it was recognised that the Irish Tourist Association, by reason of its previous activities, occupied a special position in regard to tourism.  This special position was recognised by an administrative arrangement under which three directors of the Irish Tourist Association were appointed as directors of Fógra Fáilte.  In addition, by arrangement with Fógra Fáilte, the association was given responsibility for the operations of all the tourist bureaux within this country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="48" /> Since I took office I have undertaken a very full and detailed study of the whole position in regard to the organisations dealing with tourism I am convinced that there is no sound reason for the existence of two separate statutory bodies.  I feel that the existence of these two bodies results in unnecessary duplication of staffs and lack of central direction.  This must give rise to overlapping and must weaken the effective control and direction of staff and of functions.  Such a situation can only give rise to unhealthy rivalry between the two bodies and perhaps clashes of personality.  In this unsatisfactory state of affairs it seems to me that the grants which were made available from voted moneys for tourism could not be spent to the best advantage and that the country did not get full value for the large sums provided by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Section 10 of this Bill will give effect to my proposal for the dissolution of Fógra Fáilte.  Section 4 of the Bill repeals those parts of the Act of 1952, which deal with the establishment, functions, financing and organisation of Fógra Fáilte.  The publicity functions of Fógra Fáilte will be transferred to the new board by Section 6 of this Bill.  Section 5 provides that the new board will be known as An Bord Fáilte (Irish Tourist Board).</P>
    <P>Having regard to the important rôle of tourist receipts in the balance of international payments, I am satisfied that a substantial sum should be made available each year by the State for tourism, but I am concerned to ensure that the money so allocated will be spent to the best advantage. My anxiety is that the new board will operate efficiently and economically and I propose to take steps to ensure that prudence and realism will be the tests applied to future expenditure.</P>
    <P>At present An Bord Fáilte has a maximum memberhip of seven.  I propose that the membership of the new board will be the same and no provision is made in the Bill for any change.  I recognise the special position of the Irish Tourist Association in connection with tourism and I propose to give the association suitable <Col N="49" /> representation on the new board. This representation would be on the understanding that the present level of contributions by local authorities to the Irish Tourist Association would be maintained.  The person or persons appointed would cease to be members of the board if at any time they ceased to be directors of the association.  These are the conditions under which the Irish Tourist Association is at present represented on the board of Fógra Fáilte.  I visualise also that the present arrangement under which the association operates the tourist bureaux in Ireland will be continued when the new board is set up.</P>
    <P>Deputies will observe that Section 2 of the Bill provides that the Act shall come into operation on a date which I will appoint by Order.  When two companies are being amalgamated it is usual for purposes of convenience to effect the amalgamation on a date which will be suitable from the point of view of the financial and accounting arrangements of the companies concerned. In practice where both companies have the same financial year the date selected is either the last day of that year or alternatively the end of the first six months' accounting period.  In fixing the date for the amalgamation of An Bord Fáilte and Fógra Fáilte I will take these considerations into account but the actual date to be fixed will depend on when the Bill is finally passed through the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>In anticipation of the enactment of legislation I have already made arrangements which have now been in operation for some time under which the directors of An Bord Fáilte and Fógra Fáilte hold joint meetings for the transaction of the business of the two boards.  This arrangement is working in practice and illustrates that it is possible to have the functions of tourist development and publicity undertaken under the one direction on the basis outlined in the Bill.  I commend this Bill to the approval of the House as I believe that only by the amalgamation of the two bodies and the efficient merging of their functions <Col N="50" /> will it be possible to establish an effective and virile tourist organisation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill, as the Minister explained, is to dissolve Fógra Fáilte, which was the organisation responsible for the publicity end of the tourist development programme, and to transfer its functions to An Bord Fáilte, the organisation which is charged with other development activities including the supervision of hotels and the improvement of amenities of holiday resorts. The amalgamation of these two bodies is not in itself very important and, if the Government want to bring it about, I see no reason why we should divide the Dáil on the issue but I would like to put before the House some considerations to which the Minister did not refer.</P>
      <P>On the whole, I think the amalgamation of these two bodies will prove disadvantageous.  If there is any idea that their amalgamation will result in economies, I think it is entirely illusory.  The only possible economy could arise from a reduction in the number of directors and even that is not intended so far as I understand the position.</P>
      <P>The arrangement in the past was that the board of Fógra Fáilte consisted as to one half of nominees of An Bord Fáilte, men who were already directors of An Bord Fáilte, and, as to the other half, the representatives of the Irish Tourist Association who, I gather, are to be retained in this new scheme of organisation.  Unless there is some intention to curtail the total expenditure upon tourist development activities, there can and will be no economy resulting from this change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's statement has clarified the Government's intentions with regard to the position of the Irish Tourist Association in the new arrangement. The Irish Tourist Association was set up, as the House knows, as a voluntary body.  For many years it was the only body in existence in this country interested in tourist development. It was financed almost entirely from allocations from county council <Col N="51" /> funds.  The scale of its activities was altogether too small in relation to our needs and they had to be supplemented by Government contributions distributed through a Government appointed organisation.  When An Bord Fáilte was set up, however, I felt that there was advantage to be secured in retaining the Irish Tourist Association in existence and, if possible, by expanding its activities mainly in the direction of educating public opinion in this country in the economic and other benefits of tourist trade development.</P>
    <P>The desire to keep the Tourist Association in existence was not based solely upon the revenue which it had from county council funds.  That revenue was small in relation to the total expenditure contemplated upon tourist trade development, but the existence of the Tourist Association directors on the board of Fógra Fáilte, the keeping of the Irish Tourist Association as an integral part of our whole system, made it possible to maintain the interest of the county councils in the tourist development programme, which is essential for its success.</P>
    <P>The Irish Tourist Association, however, was concerned only with tourist publicity.  It had no other function in the past and it was not, in fact, organised to undertake any other function and, consequently, the arrangements made in 1952 for keeping the Irish Tourist Association in existence and utilising its contacts with the county councils and its interest in tourist development work involved bringing its nominees in on the publicity end of the work.  Its directors were members of Fógra Fáilte only and Fógra Fáilte, as I pointed out, was concerned only with publicity activities.</P>
    <P>The new arrangement following the amalgamation of the two boards appears to imply that nominees of the Irish Tourist Association, responsible to the Tourist Association, will sit in upon the joint board and will now have responsibility in relation to the supervision of hotels and other matters with which An Bord Fáilte was concerned. <Col N="52" /> That may prove a source of difficulty.  The extent to which it is desirable to have hotel proprietors directing the operations of An Bord Fáilte is a matter that we debated here in the past.  It is clearly undesirable that An Bord Fáilte should be overloaded with representatives of hotel owners because its duties are very largely concerned with acting as policemen on hotel keepers and to seeing that they maintain proper standards of accommodation for visitors. If the representatives of the Tourist Association on An Bord Fáilte should be mainly concerned with the interests of hotel proprietors, then the whole work of An Bord Fáilte may get a wrong direction.</P>
    <P>I do not know what arrangement the Minister has in contemplation.  I assume from what he said that he will pick out from amongst the directors of the Tourist Association those whom he is prepared to nominate as directors of An Bord Fáilte and, while that process may involve some personal difficulties for him, I am sure he will appreciate the importance of maintaining the board as a balanced unit representative of the interests that should be represented in any tourist promotion organisation.</P>
    <P>The report which we received on the development of the tourist trade in this country from the United States Mission&mdash;the Christenberry Report, as it is called&mdash;emphasised the special need there was to secure representation on the tourist trade promotion board of all the interests that have or should have a very direct interest in it.</P>
    <P>Whether this amalgamation will produce greater efficiency is another matter which I gravely doubt.  The Minister said that for some time past the two boards have been meeting jointly and that that proves they could do the business efficiently.  I do not think it has been done efficiently.  I do not think it has been done at all.  Even before this amalgamation <i>de facto</i> of the two boards, my information was that the meetings of An Bord Fáilte were very long, that they sometimes failed to finish their agenda, and that <Col N="53" /> time and again important business had to be left over to subsequent meetings. If, on top of the work they were then trying to do and not doing very well, they now have to be given all the responsibility involved in the expenditure of £250,000 per year on publicity work, it is, I think, doubtful if they will do that work efficiently at all.</P>
    <P>I hear&mdash;I do not know if it is correct or not; perhaps the Minister will inform the House&mdash;that for some time past there has also been a practice of having an officer of the Department sitting in at meetings of the joint boards and that board decisions have to be cleared with the Minister before they become effective.  If that arrangement is to be continued, no useful work will be done at all.  Apart altogether from the objections in principle that can be advanced to the arrangement, it is an inefficient method of proceeding.  The objections in principle are clear.  If the Minister or the Government selects a body of men to discharge this responsibility, then they have to be allowed to do it.  The only control which the Minister should exercise over them should arise from his power to remove them or his power to refuse to reappoint them when their period of appointment expires.</P>
    <P>No statutory organisation of this kind can function if the Minister is going to keep his finger in the machine all the time and to insist upon having day-to-day decisions submitted to him for approval.  Whatever occasioned that arrangement, if there was such an arrangement up to now, it should not be allowed to operate in the future.  It should be brought speedily to an end.  If the Minister has no confidence in the members of the board, if he does not trust them to administer their work properly, to do the things he thinks should be done, then it is up to him to get a new board; but having got a board that he has confidence in, he should let them carry on as they think fit. We have a number of these statutory boards now responsible for important economic and social activities and it would be a very undesirable precedent to establish that each of them must <Col N="54" /> work day-to-day subject to ministerial veto.</P>
    <P>I see that the name An Bord Fáilte is to be amended by inserting in brackets the words Irish Tourist Board.  I think that is a very retrograde step.  The practice has developed for some years past&mdash;I, perhaps, was very largely responsible for initiating it &mdash;of giving Irish titles to these organisations that we set up to do national work, Irish titles of a kind that are likely to be adopted and brought into common use, and to avoid attempting any English translations of these titles because if an English translation is given statutory authority it is the English translation that will be ordinarily used.  The name An Bord Fáilte has now been accepted, it has come into use, its significance is known to all people who have any contact with the tourist business and it would be wrong at this stage to replace it&mdash;as it will be replaced if this section of the Bill remains unchanged&mdash;by the old title, Irish Tourist Board.  There is no difficulty about securing recognition of the significance of the term An Bord Fáilte by foreigners.  The word &ldquo;fáilte&rdquo; is one Irish word that has become known internationally and the term An Bord Fáilte conveys what it is intended to convey even to people who are not familiar with our State organisations here.  The English term Irish Tourist Board is an unimaginative dead sort of title which will arouse no interest anywhere.  In any case, I think that as we have got over the initial stage of getting an Irish title for this organisation we should not step back from that position now.</P>
    <P>As this Bill is before us, there are a few observations I would like to make concerning tourist trade development generally.  I think it is true to say-whether it was intended or not does not matter&mdash;that the attitude of the Government to the development of our tourist business is somewhat ambiguous.  There are members of the Government who in the past have spoken critically of the whole idea of developing a tourist trade and many of them who expressed opposition to individual tourist promotion projects like An Tóstal.  The main difficulty in securing the public co-operation which <Col N="55" /> is essential to the development of this industry has been lack of understanding of its importance; and anything which tends to retard or prevent the growth of public understanding of the importance of this industry is to be deplored.  I think the position has got to be made clear by an unequivocal statement by the Minister and perhaps by some of his colleagues whose attitude in relation to this matter in the past has been doubtful.</P>
    <P>That applies particularly to An Tóstal.  The statement which the Minister made here, in the previous session of the Dáil, in reply to a parliamentary question, was very colourless. It amounted to little more than an indication that he was not prepared to stop it.  He certainly left in the minds of many of the people who were interested in the development of An Tóstal, whether as members of Tóstal councils or as people directly interested in tourist trades, that the Government was not very interested, that at best they were merely tolerating it.  All the developments since have shown the deadly effect of that impression upon the plans which should now be almost completed for An Tóstal in this year. If the Government is not interested in that particular tourist development project, they should kill it and kill it quickly if they are interested, then they have got to give it the support it requires to make it work.  It was the only major tourist development project which we have yet attempted in this country.  Its aim was to increase the profitability of the tourist trade by extending the length of the tourist season.  It was expected that by its development, by the publicity associated with it, the whole of the tourist trade of the country would benefit throughout the whole year.</P>
    <P>I stated when An Tóstal project was first publicised by An Bord Fáilte that in my view it would take a number of years to establish it.  I discussed the problems associated with its development with persons who were regarded as experts in tourist trade development in other countries, particularly in America.  I was told in America by people with whom I discussed the matter and by American experts who <Col N="56" /> came here, that during the first year the idea of An Tóstal barely penetrated through the top layer of Irish-American opinion.  Its existence, the purpose of it, was known to those leaders of Irish-American organisations who are in constant touch with this country, who get newspapers from this country and whose activities require them to know what is going on here.  In the second year, the knowledge of it and the desire to participate in it had penetrated one layer lower; but they all warned me that it would take five or six years before we got established in the minds of people in the United States, of Irish birth or Irish parentage, that this was the time of the year when they could organise their return visits to this country, that there were special facilities and attractions available for them at that time&mdash;much less sell the whole idea that once in a lifetime everybody of Irish parentage throughout the world should come for a holiday here.</P>
    <P>The growth in the number of tourists from America last year was quite significant&mdash;in fact there was a 25 per cent. increase over the previous year&mdash; and all the indications are that that growth was attributable to the publicity in connection with An Tóstal and was likely to continue.  Now, if there is to be an effort made to continue it, to avail of the prospect it offers of expanding considerably our tourist trade, then there has to be evidence of Government goodwill for it.  It is not merely enough for the Minister to tolerate it, it is not merely enough for him to say to An Bord Fáilte that they are permitted to hold it, provided they do not spend too much on it.  It is a project which can only be put over by a substantial effort.</P>
    <P>When I was Minister for Industry and Commerce I took great pains to avoid making any personal reference to An Tóstal.  I directed attention to what An Bord Fáilte was doing and repeated their statements on various occasions, but I carefully avoided anything which might convey a suggestion that it was an idea promoted by one Government for the purpose of any kudos it might bring.  I was personally very pleased when the first and <Col N="57" /> second Tóstal years had passed without anybody being able to suggest that the occasion had been used in any way whatever for Party political purposes.</P>
    <P>Whatever danger there was of some section of the Opposition at that time opposing the idea merely because the Government in office was associated with it, that danger no longer exists. It is now a tourist development project which if taken up by the present Government will be enthusiastically and actively supported by the present Opposition.  Consequently there is a clear road for those who want to use that idea for this important business of extending our tourist trade.</P>
    <P>The <i>Irish Trade Journal</i> published certain statistics in a recent issue concerning our tourist trade and these statistics emphasised its importance. They estimated that expenditure by visitors of all kinds in 1953 in this country was just £30,000,000.  Now we cannot afford to forgo an expenditure of £30,000,000 by visitors on goods sold through Irish shops or services rendered through Irish hotels.  We can, in fact, expand that business very considerably. We have had the opinion of acknowledged experts who came here under the E.C.A. arrangement and who examined our position, that we can expand our present tourist revenue four times with very little effort and the enormous growth of the national wealth which would result from that expansion can easily be appreciated by Deputies.  It is true that the great majority of visitors coming here come from Britain and for that reason a very high proportion of our tourist publicity expenditure must be directed at Britain.  The figures show that the number of visitors who came from Britain, that is, visitors as distinct from one-day trippers from the Six Counties, visitors who came for an average stay of four and a half days increased in 1953 by about 5 per cent. over 1952, and the number of American visitors in that year increased by about 25 per cent.</P>
    <P>This tourist business of ours is growing and we can help it to grow by the effort we put into it, by the resources we make available to the tourist promotional organisation and by the steps we take to maintain the efficiency of <Col N="58" /> these organisations.  A maximum allocation of £500,000 can be made under the authority of existing legislation for tourist promotion purposes.  In fact in no year have we spent that amount. Our total expenditure of all kinds on tourist development is very much less than that undertaken by many individual cities or counties in other countries. In these other countries the economic significance of the tourist trade is more widely appreciated than here.  There is a deep-rooted public realisation that if the tourist industry is to be maintained or expanded there must be investment in it in the form of improved amenities for visitors and increased publicity to direct attention to these amenities.  The amount which we are spending may be large in relation to our resources, but it is very small in relation to the expenditures which competing countries are undertaking. We can direct that expenditure&mdash;in fact we must direct that expenditure&mdash;so as to get the best results from it.  Not more than half that expenditure is available for publicity work; the other half goes to the development of our tourist amenities and I may say that I am very much disappointed by the work done by An Bord Fáilte in that regard.  There were plans for the proper signposting of roads, particularly signposting in the counties of major tourist interest, and these plans appear to have been made, but they certainly are being executed extraordinarily slowly and it is still possible for a person like myself who knows the country pretty well to go astray between two of the principal towns.  I travelled to Waterford only last week and I went astray because I came into one town which was not signposted at all.  The difficulty of the tourist is generally to find his way out of towns; there is not much difficulty in keeping to a main road because if you stick to it you will generally arrive somewhere, but you can easily take a wrong turning in a town unless you are very familiar with it.  I had hoped that by this we would have proper signposting of roads all over the country.</P>
    <P>The second major work which, apart from hotel supervision, we hoped An Bord Fáilte would do is to open up <Col N="59" /> access to places of tourist interest, of particular scenic attraction, or historic ruins and places that would be of interest to visitors.  In that regard very little work appears to have been done.  Perhaps the Minister will give us some indication of what has been done, but there is very little evidence of any substantial, any real activity by the board in that connection.</P>
    <P>I cannot speak from personal experience of the work they are doing in relation to the improvement of the standards of hotel accommodation but the absence of any complaint from the hotel keepers would suggest they are not doing very much.  If they were indeed pressing strongly for the improvement of standards of hotel accommodation I am sure we would have had an occasional reaction from the hotel trade.  In that direction I do not think we are getting value for the money we are spending.  There is a substantial staff there administered by An Bord Fáilte and they could be giving a better output.  Whether their failure to do so is the fault of the board or not I cannot say.  I suspect that that board for one reason or another has not been able to give them the right leadership.  These protracted meetings of which I have heard reports and the inability of the board to deal with its programme is having an effect on the staff in limiting efficiency.</P>
    <P>In the matter of publicity a good job was done in some directions but there are many indications that that job could be improved also.  Undoubtedly the combined efforts of Fógra Fáilte, Aer Lingus and the external transport organisations which are concerned with the carrying trade to this country give an impression of activity in most of the major centres.  Again whether that activity is being directed towards the class of people whom we can succeed in attracting to this country and on whom our tourist trade must be based is questionable.  We have scattered throughout the world millions of people of Irish birth or parentage, in England, America, Australia and New Zealand, and in all these countries it is possible to sell the idea of coming <Col N="60" /> home once in a lifetime to Ireland.  I believe the greater part of our tourist publicity should be directed towards that end.  If we could succeed in getting it established as the practice of these people of Irish origin to come home to Ireland once in a lifetime we would get an inflow of tourists that our present accommodation would be completely incapable of handling.  We have in the existence of these millions of people with sentimental attachments to this country a basis of goodwill on which to build that other countries could not create with all their expenditure on tourist trade publicity, and while I feel that the work that has been done in this direction in the past was not, perhaps, as effective as it should have been, I am very doubtful about its effectiveness in the future when the responsibility for policy and the execution of policy in regard to publicity is going to be dumped in with all the other activities which An Bord Fáilte has been trying to discharge in the past, to be done now by one board.</P>
    <P>There are a number of matters which I think might also be referred to in this connection, and on which I can perhaps speak with a little more freedom now than I could speak previously. We have every reason to be dissatisfied with the services which are made available by British Railways in relation to Ireland's tourist trade. It is only a few weeks since we had further newspaper reports of people returning to England from holidays in Ireland being unable to get accommodation on the ships at Dún Laoghaire and having to wait there all night. Local hotel proprietors had to open their lounges to prevent these people being left in the waiting room in Dún Laoghaire all night.  Travel agents in England will uniformly report that they are unable to get any co-operation from the management of British Railways in planning holiday travel to Ireland.  Uncertainty about the availability of sailing tickets and about the plans of British Railways in regard to the provision of facilities has created a situation in which the average tourist agent in England is no longer interested in booking people for holidays in <Col N="61" /> Ireland because of the difficulties associated with it.</P>
    <P>The standard of the facilities provided by British Railways for travel to this country falls very far short of the standard of facilities provided by the same organisation for travel to the continent of Europe, and, as British Railways is now a nationalised institution, controlled by directors who are appointed by the British Government, I think the time has come when the matter has to be taken up at Government level.  The Tourist Board has made many representations to the management of British Railways.  When I was Minister, I sat in personally on a number of conferences at which the representatives of the British Railways were present and at which the unsatisfactory nature of these services was discussed.  We spent a great deal of money in improving the facilities at Dún Laoghaire so as to avoid the worst of the hardships which were experienced by travellers when British Railways failed to provide adequate shipping accommodation to take the number of people seeking it.  There were many promises from the management of British Railways to improve the facilities, most of which were broken, and, generally speaking, their whole attitude towards the Irish tourist trade has been far less on-coming than it has been towards the tourist trade from Britain to other countries.  In fact, if a comparison is made between the cost of travel, and particularly the cost of conveying a motorcar, between Britain and this country and between Britain and other countries on the continent, the extent of our disadvantage will be obvious.</P>
    <P>The position at the moment is that British Railways have a virtual monopoly of surface travel between Britain and Ireland, and, if that monopoly is going to continue, we have to insist upon improved services and to make it clear to the British Government, which is ultimately responsible in this matter, that we are exceedingly dissatisfied with the existing services.  If we cannot get any better co-operation from the management of that organisation, any substantial <Col N="62" /> improvement in its services, the Government can be sure that they will get full backing from the Opposition Party in this House in any plans they may make to break in on that monopoly and to provide services under our own control.</P>
    <P>Recently, I had occasion to travel from London airport and I must say that the waiting accommodation at London airport for passengers travelling to this country was very unsuitable and inadequate.  The building looked to me more like a converted barn than part of a newly-built air terminus.  The whole place was most unattractive, and unfortunately on the occasion on which I was travelling the plane to Dublin was considerably delayed and I had to spend hours there. I hated the sight of the place before I left it.  I do not know that we are on good ground in expressing dissatisfaction on account of the unsuitability of the facilities at London airport, because the same lounge accommodation is offered to passengers on British internal services, and if the British public are prepared to put up with that treatment, I suppose we cannot very well complain, but I am quite certain that if An Bord Fáilte took the matter up with the Ministry of Civil Aviation, which administers that airport, some improvement in the comfort of the accommodation available for passengers to this country at that airport could be secured.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other matters in which I am personally very interested and to which I should like to see An Bord Fáilte giving their attention. I refer to them merely to indicate the general impression I have got, both as Minister and as an ordinary Deputy, that An Bord Fáilte is not putting into this work of tourist trade development the effort that was expected from them.  Whether that is due to the existing temporary arrangements affecting the activities of that board or not, I do not know, but I think the Minister will have to keep up pressure on them to get on with the job they were appointed to do and not to interfere with them in the doing of that job, if, by interfering, he is going to slow down the getting of results.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="63" /> So far as the Bill is concerned, it can pass without any opposition from this Party.  We do not mind very much whether An Bord Fáilte and Fógra Fáilte are amalgamated.  If I were doing the job and setting up an efficient tourist organisation again, I would still have two separate boards because there are two clearly distinct sections of activity, each of which requires the detailed attention of people who are experts in that particular field; but if the Minister wants to amalgamate them, I will not oppose it.  I understand that the proposals to have two boards in the 1952 legislation was opposed by the Parties then in opposition and they have to do something about it.  I repeat, however, that any idea that an economy is going to result is an illusion and I doubt very much if increased efficiency will result either.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Any discussion of tourism holds a certain interest for some of us because of its connection with the Irish Tourist Association, which body, as has been admitted by the Minister, is the premier body of the three bodies mentioned in the Bill. As between An Bord Fáilte, Fógra Fáilte and the Irish Tourist Association, the Irish Tourist Association is the oldest body of the three.  With many of the remarks of Deputy Lemass I agree, but there are some of his remarks with which I cannot agree. First, he has a doubt as to the wisdom of the amalgamation of Fógra Fáilte and An Bord Fáilte, but let it be clearly understood here that Deputy Lemass is aware that, when he as Minister introduced the Bill in 1952, even though the Irish Tourist Association, as it is commonly known, did survive, there was a threat held over its head.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am most anxious now that the Minister should inform the House that, when he states that the conditions are more or less to continue, the threat enshrined in the Act of 1952 will not be repeated in this legislation, that is, that the Irish Tourist Association were to continue on sufferance, as it were, on condition that the local authorities forked out the grants year after year <Col N="64" /> and that the Irish Tourist Association should be, as it were, the agents for the collecting of the money from the local authorities.  We all know&mdash;those of us who are connected with local authorities and with the Irish Tourist Association&mdash;how hard it has been for the Irish Tourist Association to get the contributions from some local authorities. Very often, those local authorities could not be blamed, because of failure to provide the service, but it is only right to say at this stage that when we are considering any tourist board&mdash;whether we are going to give it praise for success or blame its members for failure&mdash;and when we are making any comparison between the different boards, we cannot forget that there is no comparison whatever between the amount of money available to the Irish Tourist Association in all the years of its existence and the amount of money available to An Bord Fáilte and Fógra Fáilte.</P>
    <P>It is natural for us, coming from a certain county, to stress the fact that some of the leading men connected with the Irish Tourist Association came from that county.  They were men who were members of this House. They were members of both large Parties, Cumann na nGaedheal or Fine Gael as they are now and Fianna Fáil.  For that we give them credit. These men in their far-sighted way were prepared to do everything they possibly could do voluntarily for the benefit of tourism in this country. However, during the past few years we have reached the stage where voluntary effort shows very little return as against the number who are placed in paid positions.  Very many of those who have been placed in paid positions have not given the return that we hoped for.</P>
    <P>Even in the case of the Irish Tourist Association it is quite correct to say that they were allowed a certain number of nominees on the board in connection with Fógra Fáilte.  Deputy Lemass must know&mdash;according to the information available to him apparently&mdash;that the Minister is supposed to have an official at the meetings.  While Deputy Lemass was Minister, he made very sure of the number of nominees <Col N="65" /> who were going to be appointed from the Irish Tourist Association.  I will say no more on that subject because I believe this is a measure we should try to discuss in an objective manner for the benefit of tourism.</P>
    <P>I know that the Irish Tourist Association has its shortcomings.  We all have our shortcomings and any voluntary body such as this is is bound to have its shortcomings.  Nevertheless, it is essential that credit should be given for the good work that has been done by a voluntary association. Credit must be given to the local authorities who, in spite of heavy impositions on the rates, did their best to contribute in some small way towards tourism.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass mentioned some of the problems that still confront us. Naturally, he is anxious to see these overcome.  He wonders as to the results that have been achieved by Fógra Fáilte or An Bord Fáilte.  I noticed that he mentioned the importance of signs.  I fully agree.  It is quite correct to say that during the years they have operated they have failed in many instances in a most miserable fashion.  I would agree with the Deputy when he says that the biggest difficulty is encountered in the towns.  We agree wholeheartedly.  I believe that if some moneys were spent in a proper manner as regards roads in these areas we might get better results.  That would be better than some of the eyewashing things we were told about in connection with proposed grants or loans.</P>
    <P>I remember attending a meeting recently which was sponsored by the Irish Tourist Association and Fógra Fáilte.  The local people were told that if they set up a company they would get a couple of hundred pounds towards its formation.  They were told they would get a loan in connection with any activities in that area.  I myself knew &mdash;I lived there&mdash;that even though it was a seaside resort there was no possibility of forming a new company which could get into business and show a return for the money.  Therefore, even though it was made clear in the <Col N="66" /> provisions of the Bill a few years ago, it surely must have been known to those who prepared the Bill that in many of our seaside resorts, with the exception of such places as Tramore, Ballybunion and Bundoran, there is no way of forming a company for the purpose of making money from an industrial point of view.</P>
    <P>Therefore, if some of the money could be earmarked, as was done in the past and in respect of which we have given credit, for the provision of roads in Gaeltacht areas it would be a tremendous advantage.  Even though there is a certain amount of money given for tourism, if local authorities can help in that regard they should do so.  The areas affected must fight severely against inland areas to try and get the money required.  If tourists from England and elsewhere use the roads it is far more important for them to see good roads and road signs.</P>
    <P>There is one matter to which I should draw attention.  Deputy Lemass did not mention it but, perhaps, he may have meant to do so.  It concerns not only the question of accommodation in our hotels but our hotel charges.  I have often wondered what all the bodies, whether the Irish Tourist Association, Bord Fáilte or Fógra Fáilte, were doing.  We were told by many Irish people who travelled to various countries on the Continent that they can have a cheaper holiday there than here.  It is almost as expensive for people to come from the South to spend a week in Dublin as it would be for them if they went to a country on the Continent. That is one of the failures of all these bodies we have had.  The only thing the hotels had to do was to publish their price and after that, once they kept within that published price, they could charge what they liked.</P>
    <P>We agree with the activities of certain commissions inquiring into the prices of commodities and other things.  I think that one of the important matters for discussion by the new board is the question of hotel prices.  It is important that we should <Col N="67" /> get tourists from England and other countries but I think there is an obligation on us to cater for our own Irish people as well.  I can say that different organisations, social and political&mdash;this is a matter to which I drew the attention of Deputy Lemass when he was Minister&mdash;on various occasions, when interested in social outings, were unable to get hotels in various places to give them a price for catering at different periods of the year.  I believe these hotels have a duty to their own people just as well as they have to the stranger.  We often mentioned the importance of staggered holidays.  It is our duty to see that the charges here will be so regulated as to help our own people.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass was certainly correct when he mentioned the deplorable conditions with regard to shipping.  We hear of people outside this House bemoaning the conditions under which horses are supposed to go to Belgium. But these people have never complained to the British Government or a British shipping company deploring the conditions under which people have to travel in the ships coming to Ireland from England.  It is essential that these services should be improved. If the amalgamated body tackle that problem and bring about the improvement we need in that respect at least we may get some benefit.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should mention, as Deputy Lemass mentioned, the question of the name.  I am not opposed to his views that the name should be simply in Irish but when he said that it brought to mind one special consideration.  I refer to An Tóstal.  An Tóstal was known simply as An Tóstal.  It has held the Irish name.  I know, and many members in this House must know, that the programmes of the local Tóstal committees were anything but Irish.</P>
    <P>We were told that it was going to be &ldquo;Ireland at Home&rdquo;, and yet the local committees of An Tóstal offered us something that the Irish could see better over in England, that the Americans could see better in America. We were not prepared to show them <Col N="68" /> in a true sense rural Irish life.  It was not the fault of the local committee, unless they were inspired by headquarters, unless they were inspired by the ambassadors who travelled from Dublin to every county in Ireland, that their programmes were not composed of periods of Irish history, of Irish games.  If they had been, then An Tóstal would have been what we want it to be.  I do not want An Tóstal to be putting on exhibitions which foreigners could do better than we could hope to do.</P>
    <P>Finally, I hope that the heavy stick will not be held over the Irish Tourist Association, with the amalgamation of these two boards.  I hope, please God, when the members are to be appointed &mdash;I do not mind who they are, because it makes no difference to me one way or the other&mdash;that they will be appointed for their ability and integrity, not for political motives.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill in so far as it disposes of one of the three bodies controlling tourism in this country.  I have always failed to see why we should have three bodies&mdash; Fógra Fáilte, as far as I know, being responsible for the advertisement of our tourist trade, and publicising the amenities which we can offer to people outside the country.  An Bord Fáilte has been dealing with matters within the State itself.  I think it is good that the Minister is amalgamating them, but I feel it would have been better had he left An Bord Fáilte all the functions they have already, and had he transferred the powers of An Fógra Fáilte to the Irish Tourist Association.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we look back on tourism in this country, we will find that the first organised attempt at tourism was made by a private enterprise body, the Irish Tourist Association.  Tourism has been highly developed over the years.  I do not think that anybody, no matter how critical, could say that the Irish Tourist Association did not make a good job of it, in so far as they were able, with the limited funds placed at their disposal&mdash;and they were free from State interference.  They were free from the Civil Service mind <Col N="69" /> which has permeated and nauseated life in this country.  We have an Act in which we have two State bodies, one of them, as I say, controlling or advertising our tourist amenities outside this country, and the other acting within the country.  There was naturally greater duplication.  Naturally a lot of extra directors, extra officials were appointed and a considerable amount of State funds was made available. I do not deny that the work of these bodies served some function, but I do say that they did not, in any great way, add to the advancement or increase of the tourist trade, which is so valuable to this country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass mentioned An Tóstal. This event was designed and conceived for the purpose of expanding the Irish tourist season, and for welcoming many Irish people throughout the world back to their own country.  I think that the whole set-up&mdash;the arrangements, and so forth, dealing with it&mdash;proves the case that State control of tourism, such as we have, is not a success.  Every hotel keeper, to whom I spoke in many parts of the country, maintained that An Tóstal was held at the wrong time of the season.  Who designed and arranged that time except An Bord Fáilte and Fógra Fáilte between them, in the teeth of opposition from people who had known better?  That, in itself, is a good argument against State-controlling bodies in regard to tourism.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Minister has abolished Fógra Fáilte.  I do not think it was serving any useful function. Whenever I went abroad to Britain, and other countries, I never saw any real advertising of our tourist facilities. I do not say this was the case in regard to all our beauty spots, but places such as Donegal were never mentioned at all.</P>
    <P>With regard to An Bord Fáilte, as far as its function goes, I think Deputy Lemass mentioned one very important thing.  One of their functions is to put up signposts.  I have had experience with that board in trying to get a signpost up.  Last July I was asked to get a signpost erected to a tourist centre in my constituency.  What was wanted <Col N="70" /> was a signpost to say: &ldquo;to such and such a place, 3½ miles.&rdquo;  When I applied to An Bord Fáilte they applied to the local authority.  It was some time before they got the necessary permission to work there, but they did get it last November.  It is now February, and the signpost has not yet been erected.  That is the sort of inefficiency one gets from a State body.  I feel certain that, if one were dealing with a private enterprise body, one would have got some measure of efficiency. That is why I am totally opposed to this form of control of tourism.</P>
    <P>I think, when we hear of the amalgamation of these two bodies, it would have been a good idea if the Minister could have assured us that it was going to mean some reduction in expenditure.  The position heretofore was that the two separate bodies had £250,000 apiece available to them for the purpose of developing the tourist industry.  As the Bill now reads, the new board is to have up to £500,000.  We are absorbing all the officials of Fógra Fáilte and An Bord Fáilte, in fact we are carrying on as before.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Minister has made some concession, in that he has given the Irish Tourist Association. which I maintain are the founders of tourism in this country, some representation on the board.  In fact he is giving them three directors.  I would like the Minister to go further.  I would ask him to give to the Irish Tourist Association the functions heretofore held by An Fógra Fáilte, to put them in such a position that they may advertise our amenities outside the country.  After all, Irish tourism is the concern of people in the hotel trade, and it is also the concern of local bodies.  These people must know the amenities they have got to offer, and the best way to advertise them. After all, I think they would be able to do the job a great deal better than civil servants sitting in an office in Dublin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">

      <P>The Irish Tourist Association was originally started in Cork nearly 30 years ago by a number of men who had vision and saw what <Col N="71" /> benefit tourism would be to this country.  We must all admit that big advances in many ways have been made to encourage tourism despite the fact that some people who are now on the other side of the House felt that we should not be encouraging those people to come here and eat our steaks; other people thought it was better to bring the people over to eat here and spend their money than to be shipping over the meat to feed them.</P>
      <P>I had no intention of speaking on this Bill until I heard Deputy Lemass making reference to the title of the board.  I am not an Irish speaker, but I think it is much easier for anybody to say &ldquo;An Bord Fáilte&rdquo; than &ldquo;Irish Tourist Board&rdquo;.  The people have come to accept &ldquo;Córas Iompair Eireann&rdquo;, &ldquo;Bord na Móna&rdquo; and all the other titles, and none of those bodies are known by any other name.  Like him I think this is a retrograde step and there is no reason in the world for it.  As he said, &ldquo;fáilte&rdquo; is known all over the world to mean &ldquo;welcome&rdquo;.  Will this change be a precedent for changing the name of all the other boards?  Will Bord na Móna become known as &ldquo;the Turf Board&rdquo; or C.I.E. as the &ldquo;Railway of Ireland&rdquo; or something like that?  I would appeal to the Minister not to go ahead with that change.</P>
      <P>As regards An Tóstal I deplore the attitude of the board towards it.  We had to write up to the board from Cork to get guarantees and permission to run two international events which were held last year, the choral festival &mdash;which, I am sure Deputy Anthony Barry will agree, was one of the biggest successes of An Tóstal&mdash;and the international horse show.  We could not get any definite reply until we sent up a deputation to Dublin to say that if we did not get a decision within a week we were dropping out.  We got the guarantees, if you like, under duress and under the threat that we would not go ahead.  That is a bad attitude. It would not be an incentive to local people who give a lot of their time in Cork and other places to encourage people to come to this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="72" /> We know in Cork that An Tóstal has created there a civic spirit that was never there before.  Any of the Cork Deputies know that it was unthinkable that the corporation could plant flowers in the streets or that they could take down a railing that was protecting a park and shift it in to the riverside and leave the children and the old people to go in amongst those flowers, Deputy Barry, who is sitting opposite me, can say we have no report of any incident of the flowers or decorations being touched by either young or old. They responded to the idea and have shown a spirit of which we are all proud.</P>
    <P>As regards the time of the year at which the festival is held, we all know that the idea of An Tóstal was to extend the tourist season.  If all the tourists came in August we could not cater for them because there is not sufficient hotel accommodation.  All the hotels in Cork were booked up and we know that some of the biggest hotels in Cork are putting on big extensions&mdash;some of them are completed and more of them are not&mdash; which in some cases nearly double the size of the existing building.  They are getting tourists and visitors all the year round and not alone in the tourist season of July and August.</P>
    <P>Events like An Tóstal should be encouraged.  I remember during the choral festival in Cork speaking to a group of people who were taking part in the choir competitions and in the folk dancing competitions.  There were six interpreters to translate the few words I said and that, to my mind, is the best advertisement tourism could get.  When these people go back to their different countries&mdash;and there were more than six countries represented&mdash;they must have something to say about this country and the way they were received.  Most of those taking part in these competitions last year are inquiring already to get a place on this year's programme for the choral festival and the folk dancing. There was a similar position in regard to the horse-jumping event.  We admit that was handed over to a committee and that they did not realise the <Col N="73" /> proper way to advertise the show but we had some of the world's best competitors from Scotland, England and Ireland at that jumping competition and all these visitors are eager to come back.  If that is not the way to encourage tourism I do not know what other way there is.  People came to the South of Ireland who never even heard of our country until the syllabus was sent out for that choral festival and folk dancing.</P>
    <P>During An Tóstal I have had experience of meeting people from various countries; we had Irish people from Alaska, Africa, Philadelphia and other places coming in those weeks. There is plenty of evidence of that in the City Hall in Cork for anyone who wants to see it.  Those people were encouraged by every means.  As Deputy Lemass said, the thing is only an experiment for the present.  It was stated from the start that it would take years to develop this festival.  We all know those visitors will go back and tell their friends and word will be spread about.  I have no doubt it will be a very big success if it gets the proper encouragement.  It has got nearly a death blow and without the assistance of some of the local Tóstal councils there would not be any arrangements in their areas for holding An Tóstal during the coming year.</P>
    <P>The Minister should not put any amendment to the title of An Bord Fáilte.  I would say this would not meet the approval of those people who are doing their best to foster the Irish language all over the country.  There is no necessity for this change.  I have known English people who are in Ireland for a long time and they told me that when the title &ldquo;Córas Iompair Éireann&rdquo; came out first they could pronounce it as well as any Irishman. Everybody will when they do not get an English amendment.  I believe if the Minister persists in this amendment the name &ldquo;An Bord Fáilte&rdquo; will quickly drop out and will be simply &ldquo;Irish Tourist Board&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Lord Mayor of Cork has just stated that there was absolutely no reason for the Minister to take the step he has taken to make <Col N="74" /> this change in the tourist organisation of the country.  However, Deputy McGrath's colleague, Deputy Lemass, has voiced the general dissatisfaction with the progress that has been made in the development of tourism here. We are all only too well aware that for some years past we have been talking about tourism but that we have not made the headway which we should have made in that regard.  One reason for that failure is that tourism is not a thing you can force.  You just cannot print huge advertisements saying: &ldquo;Come to Ireland.  It is a grand place,&rdquo; and, by displaying such advertisements all over the world, expect that nothing else need be done.  You must do other things too.  In 1945, 1946 and 1947 we had steaks that other countries had not got and therefore we got tourists.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Lemass that easily the most valuable source of tourism is the Irish person abroad and persons of Irish descent.  It may seem a depressing kind of thought, but if they visited us even once in their lifetime it would mean a lot to us.  Certainly we should ask Irish people in the United States of America and the British Commonwealth to visit us once in five or ten years.  We should very much like to see them come here.</P>
      <P>I feel that these boards have not done well and that what we have lacked in this set-up is a strong personality. Deputies will easily call to mind a number of our organisations throughout the country that have been handled by strong and forceful people and it will readily be admitted that great progress has been made by them in their various activities.  Take, for example, Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann, Teo.  If we could get somebody with the necessary drive, I think it would be far better than having committees&mdash; better even than committees on which civil servants sit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be no harm if an examination were made of the successful tourist bureaux in other countries.  I have in mind, in particular, France. The French have been extraordinarily successful in their tourist drive and the kind of literature they issue is very <Col N="75" /> attractive.  If you write for information to the French Tourist Bureau you will receive extraordinarily good and beautifully produced literature in respect of the various districts in France.  In that connection, I think I might mention here that two periodicals are issued in this country on tourism.  Each Deputy is provided with copies of these periodicals.  In my view, they do not cut much ice.  I fear they are addressed to the wrong type of people.  I do not think they should seek circulation in this country. They should be sent to persons abroad.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Lemass about the dissatisfaction we must all feel in regard to the service we are getting from, for instance, British Railways. In particular, we feel dissatisfied with the appalling robbery indulged in by such companies in respect of the transport of motor cars.  In my view, that is a matter that should be taken up at Government level.</P>
    <P>When thinking of tourism, there are certain little things that spring to our mind and that we find irritating. However, I think, perhaps, the House should not be bothered with them. Here is an example.  In Cork City, a new tourist bureau was opened by An Bord Fáilte&mdash;but, like a bank, it closed every Saturday at 12 o'clock in the middle of the tourist season.  I submit that that bureau should be open over the whole week-end and if there were a forceful personality at the top he would ensure that that kind of ineptitude and incompetence would not obtain.</P>
    <P>All that any of us can do is give advice.  I am sure that many of us would agree on certain advice we would give in regard to the modernisation of our hotels, particularly the small hotels.  We should get away from chromium plating and cheap turnout and, instead, concentrate on keeping the premises in a spotless and comfortable condition and on giving the best of Irish food.  If we do that we cannot go wrong.</P>
    <P>I agree also with previous speakers on the undesirability of giving away <Col N="76" /> any point on the language question. The Irish language is a very valuable asset to us.  It is one of our points of difference so far as other countries are concerned&mdash;and that is what foreign people come here to see and to enjoy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>The last speaker brought something back to my mind that I had almost forgotten.  He is anxious to show the difference between this country and other countries and he suggested that the Irish language is one of these differences between us and people elsewhere.  He feels that other nationalities will be enticed to come here as a result of such differences. The point of view expressed by other Deputies, with particular reference to the remarks of Deputy Lemass, was that we should encourage our own to come back and that the idea of tourism generally is to attract back&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Lemass says we should invite back those who left the country in years past and also the descendants of those who left our shores in the last few generations.</P>
      <P>I want to deal now with the question of tourism generally.  When the last measure on this subject came before this House, I strongly opposed the idea of two separate statutory boards.  At the time, I felt that one thing that was bound to happen was that foreigners or people who have no knowledge of this country would not know which board to approach; they might approach An Bord Fáilte and find themselves referred to Fógra Fáilte.  I submit that, once you create even the slightest difficulty in the way of tourism, you will disappoint prospective tourists who make the inquiries and actually put them off coming here at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There must be the easiest approach and the greatest possible assistance and enticement for those who are likely to venture from their own country to this country.  The setting-up of two boards with Irish names did not offer any encouragement to prospective tourists who might feel there were difficulties to be surmounted in reaching <Col N="77" /> a country such as Ireland, which is not within easy contact of the mainland of Europe.  I am sure the Minister found there was overlapping between these two bodies and, as he has said himself, there was a danger of a clash of personalities.  That was bound to happen where you had the two boards functioning while the line was not clearly drawn between them with regard to their responsibilities and duties.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill in so far as one body will now be responsible for tourism.  We can now lay the blame where it should be laid if the efforts we want to see made are not being made to foster and develop tourism. Even though I welcome this measure, I must say that my welcome is rather lukewarm.  I felt that when these boards were being amalgamated there would be a certain amount of saving. I notice that one of the things provided for in the Bill is that the directors and all those concerned who got a guarantee of security of employment are safeguarded and that their rights are established.  I do not begrudge any individual security in this country.  I think it should be there for all.  However, it is extraordinary to find the grip and control the personnel of such bodies can have over different Governments to ensure that their own interests are looked after.  Down the country, if 100 men are laid off on a particular scheme, or if there is overlapping in work, all that is left for the unfortunates who lose their employment is the ship to Liverpool or some other parts of England or to Canada. I hope that the Minister will be able to ensure a saving in administration and in expenses, whatever about the question of saving in the actual publicity which is a different matter altogether.</P>
    <P>With regard to tourism generally, I make no apologies to people on either side of the House when I say that it is a greatly overrated business in this country.  I always held that view, even before I came into this House, and in spite of the very able speeches made by Deputy Lemass on this and other occasions, I have yet to be convinced that it is one of the most important <Col N="78" /> features of our economy.  I do not think it is at all fundamental to our economy here in Ireland.  We hear some parties say that it is better to bring people to eat our steaks here in Ireland.  I do not dispute that, but my view in regard to the steaks which Deputy McGrath and Deputy Barry mentioned, is that we catered for tourists of a sort at a time when steaks, and so forth, were not available in other countries.  They would travel 1,000 miles to get a nice juicy steak about an inch or an inch and a quarter thick, but that attraction is now available elsewhere.  It is available on the Continent and in England at the present time and we definitely are not getting these tourists to the same extent or in the same numbers, as during the lean years in Britain and France.</P>
    <P>The statement has been made by Deputy Lemass that there was a turnover of £30,000,000 each year from the tourist trade.  Let us consider that further to see what it really means.  How much of that £30,000,000 was spent on imports to this country so that tourists who came in here would buy in Ireland commodities produced elsewhere?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Invisible re-exports. The net total contribution to our economy from this source was £1,250,000 last year and we are going to make available up to £500,000 in order to secure a net gain of £1,250,000.  When we talk about tourism, we have to take into consideration the fact that the majority of the so-called tourists that come in here from Britain are Irish people who come home at Christmas time, at Easter or during the summer, for a week or a fortnight.  They are people who would come here without any publicity by An Bord Fáilte or any other Irish tourist organisation.  They come back to see their own people and they are the best spenders of all the people who visit this country.  I am trying to point out that a sum of £500,000 is being made available for this purpose and I hope that it will be brought home to the rural population that there is apparently no trouble in making £500,000 available <Col N="79" /> for an organisation that is going to bring back Irish people, in the main, for a few weeks' holidays.  Yet when we want to revive or establish industries in congested areas or elsewhere, all sorts of difficulties are put in the way of people who are anxious to develop such industries.  They are told that the money is not available but yet we are able to spend £500,000 to bring back mainly people who are going to come here one way or another, and give them a double invitation.</P>
      <P>I gathered from the remarks made that one of the ideas behind An Tóstal was to show foreigners what we have here in this country&mdash;or rather what we have not here, but what we pretend we have here.  The suggestion is that we should induce people of Irish descent in America to visit here, in the words of Deputy Lemass, once in a lifetime.  Have we reached the stage with An Tóstal, that to attract people of Irish descent in America we need to tell them that if they come to Dublin they will see something in Croke Park or some extraordinary display in Donegal?  Do you think that people are going to be attracted by that type of poppycock?  These people are coming here to visit their Irish friends, to renew old ties and friendships; they are coming one way or the other.  I heard Deputy Barry talk about the tourist facilities the French people have at their disposal.  Apart altogether from the efficiency of their tourist bureaux, France has one thing over us and that is its climate.  If there is one thing that will let us down here in Ireland on the question of the development of tourism, it is the weather. That is one thing about which Dáil Éireann cannot do anything apart from all the other advantages which these countries possess.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was merely trying to emphasise that we have not the weather here to attract tourists.  We have only a short period of summer. For instance, last year, we had no summer worth talking about.  We have not what I may call an extraordinarily warm climate.  We have only to look for proof of that at the interest taken by Irish people in foreign cruises and in visits to countries like France, Germany, Spain, Italy and North Africa.  Look at the tremendous list of queries the tourist bureaux and other outfits have got in the last month from Irish people who wish to follow the sun and to get a little sunshine while we are trying to bring our people to see An Tóstal.  We have got to realise that there is that spirit of travel amongst our people.  I think it is a very welcome development because the more people leave this country for the purpose of visiting other countries, the better it will be in the long run because they will see what is happening in other countries and they will come back to shake us out of the condition of complacency into which we have allowed ourselves to fall in regard to tourism in recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In case there is any misunderstanding of my remarks, I want to say that we should concentrate on inducing the type of tourist who would be really interested in the attractions we have to offer in this country from the point of view of fishing and shooting.  That type of tourist will come to this country, no matter what the weather may be and that type of tourist is a great spender.  I do not think I need develop that point for any sportsman here who is fond of shooting and fishing. We have in Ireland in our moors, bogs and mountains an undeveloped and an untapped source of wealth, <Col N="81" /> from the point of view of game.  We have the rivers here which if they were properly developed and stocked with salmon and trout would provide a tremendous attraction for the type of tourist who goes nowadays to Scotland. We know what the value of that type of tourism has been to Scotland. Immediate attention must be paid to the development of that type of tourism in this country and to the development of the natural attractions which we possess.</P>
    <P>They are of greater importance than seaside attractions.  The seaside attractions will be there anyway during the holiday season and local committees can, through co-operative means, improve the amenities of these centres. If our tourist organisations are sincere they will have to get down to making a complete and thorough investigation of what is available in the sporting line, on our mountains and bogs, in regard to shooting, and in our lakes and rivers, in regard to fishing.  A certain amount has been done&mdash;and I want to give credit where credit is due &mdash;in recent years in regard to restocking certain rivers in the country. Apart from all that, most of the good shooting and fishing rights in the country are not available for ordinary individuals like myself to take advantage of them.  Many of these facilities are owned to-day by people who have very little interest in the country, people who will pull one up and prosecute one if one crosses the boundary line of their river or the mearing into their bogland where they hold the fishing and shooting rights respectively. Strong action will have to be taken in connection with these people.  I mention that because I am very anxious that the tourist industry should be developed.  The Minister showed his own interest recently by touring the Shannon valley in order to investigate the possibility of having a ferry or steamer service for tourism.  That would provide one attraction, but the fishing and shooting along the Shannon and along the other rivers and mountains throughout the country are of equal importance and I hope the Minister will bear that in mind.</P>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe referred to this £30,000,000 taken every year on tourism <Col N="82" /> as money circulating in the country.  I do not dispute that.  It must give employment.  If cars are engaged on the hire system drivers will be employed and petrol will have to be purchased and all that money will circulate within the country.  But it must be remembered that the parts for these cars and the petrol had to be imported. I would prefer to see all that money now being turned over to tourism turned over to the 250,000 people we drove out of the country in the last 30 years.  Let us put first things first. If we go down to Westland Row to-morrow we will see some of the attractions for tourists&mdash;little souvenirs that they can take back with them, souvenirs made in Japan and made in Germany with an Irish title on the outside of the box.  What do we think we are doing?  Whom are we bluffing? It made me sick one evening down at that station to see souvenirs of An Tóstal made in Japan and made in Germany.  We talk about the drive that is being put into industries connected with the manufacture of souvenirs and so forth here.  Quite a large proportion of those commodities is imported.  Perhaps there are some people who think that is the best way to do it, but I hold most of those products should be produced here.  In that eventuality I would be all in favour of tourism on the ground that what is being produced by Irish labour must benefit the Irish people and help us to balance our imports.</P>
    <P>I do not want to say too much about An Tóstal.  Any Deputy who likes can have a look at our provincial newspapers in relation to that.  I have looked at a few of them.  One was the <i>Waterford Star</i>.  I saw the aftermath of An Tóstal in Waterford.  I know what the aftermath of An Tóstal was in Roscommon town in my own constituency. I know what it was in a few other places.  There are still debts to be paid on An Tóstal.  I deplore the fact that, when this House was unanimous on An Tóstal, all sorts of opportunists should have tied themselves in behind An Tóstal.  That was a mistake.  It was not the political Parties who did harm; it was the chancers and the racketeers in every town and county who saw a chance of <Col N="83" /> making money quickly at the expense of the public.  They tied themselves in and denied decent people an opportunity of making a success of it.  If anyone wants to know the reason why the idea of An Tóstal is not going well to-day all he need do is take a look at the type who are in it in many areas. I am always very careful here not to speak of people in such fashion as to make them recognisable, and for that reason I do not propose to pursue that particular line any further.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister's action in combining these two bodies will prove beneficial to tourism generally.  I appeal to him to bear in mind that our chief attraction lies in our natural scenery&mdash;our mountains, our bogs, and our lakes.  If we develop these we will have tourists coming here not once in five years or once in ten years, but year after year; that is the type of tourist who will help the local people and the country generally because of the money he will spend in it.</P>

      <P>When the Minister introduced this Bill the House more or less expected that he would give an outline of unanimous Government policy in relation to the development of tourism.  For some months past anyone reading the daily papers could not but be struck by the effort made by certain organs of the Press supporting the Government to decry tourism, An Bord Fáilte and the other organisations. Deputy McQuillan mentioned that the net receipt from tourism was something like £1,250,000.  Now that was all part of a campaign&mdash;some financial expert was brought in; I do not know where he came from&mdash;and I think it was in one of the Sunday papers that Deputy McQuillan saw that figure.</P>

Some financial wizard who wanted to decry tourism, to kill tourism and encourage the Government not to provide money for An Bord Fáilte or any other organisation arrived <Col N="84" /> at that figure.  I hope the Minister in reply, speaking on behalf of the Government, will tell the House and the country that this Government is solidly behind the development of tourism and will endeavour to develop it in every way that is both feasible and desirable.  It is a well-known fact that certain elements constituting the present Government were not always&mdash; whether they are now or not I do not know&mdash;in favour of developing tourism or encouraging tourists to come here. One of the first Press campaigns in support of the present Government centred around the great economies that would be effected and day after day play was made about the great waste there was on the part of An Bord Fáilte and the associate organisations. Now the Minister is asking the House to vote the same amount of money in the coming year as was voted in the past.  It is desirable that he should do that and I am sure no one will object to it.  We would like to see that money well spent and if the Minister can spend it to better advantage than in the past we will say: &ldquo;More power to him!&rdquo;  The country, however, wants an expression of opinion from the Minister on behalf of the Government as to where the Government stands in relation to the future development of tourism.  An Tóstal was decried.  Certain elements of the Press here and throughout the country tried to kill An Tóstal during the past six months. They did everything possible to kill it and to kill the idea behind An Tóstal. I do not think there is any doubt about that at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>All this money was being spent and I hope the Minister will assure the House on behalf of the Government that it will continue to be spent.  There were some few points which I should like to make with <Col N="85" /> regard to the activities of An Bord Fáilte in the future.  There are some very fine scenic views to which there are no roadways.  There should be a survey of all these scenic views throughout the country.  That is something useful that An Bord Fáilte might do or have done through engineers and architects.  They should have a survey made of all the scenic views throughout the country and have them put in a proper record.  Proper roadways should then be built to all these places.  That, in my view, is something which would help tourism and the development of tourism in the country.</P>
      <P>There is also the question of the ancient monuments.  I feel sure that there is not an actual single record of all the ancient monuments in the country.  Having such a record would, in my mind, help tourism a great deal. We have a number of bodies dealing with ancient monuments and things like that but there is no provision made to have the records of these bodies made available to the general public or to have a single volume containing these records made available. I feel that much could be done in that direction and it would all be helping tourism.  There could, for instance, be guides provided for tourists.  I do not think that even the smallest effort has been made anywhere in the country to have such guides made available.  For the benefit of foreign tourists particularly such guides should be provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like also to refer to the work which could be done for the development of tourism by co-ordination between the different organisations in the country&mdash;for instance, Aer Lingus, C.I.E. and the different cultural organisations throughout Ireland. Of course, the local authorities could also assist in a big way.  Much co-ordination of effort and important voluntary work could be done in this way, but these organisations need proper leadership.  The Minister is in a position to give that leadership, and I feel that he should make a big effort to achieve co-ordination between the various voluntary bodies throughout the country so that tourist amenities could be improved in the way they are <Col N="86" /> capable of being improved.  This would help tourists from outside particularly to have a better appreciation of the country, and I think that the people of the country as a whole would welcome such a situation.</P>
    <P>Mention was made by some Deputies about organising our fishing and shooting facilities, and I agree that these are two very important aspects of our amenities for tourists.  Some effort has been made in the matter of stocking our rivers and our preserves, but much more could be done in the matter of stocking our rivers and preserves with fish and game.  The Minister has mentioned the moneys which may be voted by the House through the agency of this Bill, and I feel that much of this money could be devoted to the stocking of our rivers and our preserves.  In this way tourists could be encouraged to come into the country in the winter months, in the off-season months, for fishing, shooting and, of course, hunting.  Some tourists from outside do come here in the winter months, and I feel sure a lot more could be done to develop that tendency.  This is a natural hunting country, probably one of the best in the world.  We have the best bred horses and the best riders, and probably we have the best country over which to hunt in the world, and if these were developed and publicised properly more tourists would avail of them.</P>
    <P>I have nothing further to say but I should like to impress on the Minister the importance of accepting the advice that has been tendered to him from all sides of the House, particularly the advice about the proposal to have the name of Bord Fáilte changed to Irish Tourist Board.  People all over the country know of An Bord Fáilte and that organisation has been so named for a number of years now.  People outside and inside this country have accepted that as the name of the organisation dealing with tourism and I think it would be a retrograde step to introduce the English equivalent. All the other Irish organisations such as Bord na Móna are known by their Irish names.  All of these names have been accepted by the Irish people and <Col N="87" /> by the foreigner, so I hope the Minister will not insist on bringing in the English equivalent now in this instance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I was really surprised listening to certain Deputies here that no one with the possible exception of Deputy Lemass mentioned the Christenberry Report and the reports of other groups such as O.E.C. and I.H.C. and such reports as those got out by Messrs O'Doherty and K. Barry of the Irish Tourist Board.  They mentioned that the boards should be united and evidently that is what the Minister has in mind here.  I feel that the Irish Tourist Board and the Irish Tourist Association should be completely reorganised.  I should like to say something also about the co-ordination that should exist between these two boards and between the other voluntary organisations throughout the country.  My hope is that in the selection of members for these boards the Christenberry Report will be followed and that the members will be selected from regions.  Up to this the membership has never been regional or, I feel, properly representative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would not like to see the Irish Tourist Association swamped because we all know the great service it has given to the cause of tourist development in this country.  I think it is capable of giving great service in the future.  In this matter of tourist attraction I should like that we would commence at home with our own people and in saying that I am not going to ask the Minister to forget the object of bringing tourists in from outside. I feel that a lot more attention should be given to the development of our tourist resorts for our own people. The Tourist Board or An Bord Fáilte, as it was called, should make it their business to see that Irish people could get easily to the various resorts throughout the country so that when visitors come in from outside they will not find these places abandoned. Foreigners coming in to enjoy our tourist amenities would then find a little more life in those places&mdash;they <Col N="88" /> would look more alive.  I am speaking particularly on behalf of the resorts around where I come from.  When private enterprise had buses and owned the railways, thousands were to be found in such places as Tramore because travel facilities to these places were better at that time.  In the matter of attracting tourists from England, I think that Deputy Lemass was perfectly right in suggesting that British Railways had not been doing their business properly.  Certainly they do not look like setting about their business even now and if they do not I think the Minister should consider at another day building ships himself. Mention was made of the fact that people are being left at Dún Laoghaire. I have no sympathy with these people at all because there are fine ports like Rosslare and Waterford to which they could come, probably more easily and more cheaply.</P>
    <P>Mention was also made of the fact that some people come in here bringing their own cars and I agree that this should be encouraged because it could be a very profitable aspect of tourism.  I went to the officials of the Waterford Harbour Board to ascertain what it costs to bring in cars here and I feel sure some of your ears will open when I tell you that to take a car from Newcastle to Oslo costs £6, and that the cost of taking a car to Rosslare or Waterford is £12 10s.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>From Fishguard.  I shall not go into any more figures, but I would suggest to the Minister that this is an important part of the tourist business which should be looked into immediately.  It should be represented to British Railways that these cars should be transported at low rates in the off-season, when the boats are practically empty.  Even if we had to subsidise the transport.  I would prefer that than that money should be thrown away on some of the bad advertising that is done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of the speakers here do not know the problem of Irish people in England.  Many Irishmen who are <Col N="89" /> married in England and who have children would like to bring them home to see their people and their country. They cannot afford the high rates at present charged.  In 1948 and 1949 there were low rates in operation in the month of April and May to Dublin, Waterford, and so on, and the people took advantage of them.  It was better than any Tóstal.  The boats were packed.  It has been said that you cannot force people to come.  You can, if you give them value and offer them cheap rates.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to fishing and shooting.  One gentleman wanted to be able to fish any place at any time he wanted.  That is not feasible.</P>
    <P>I went with Mr. Christenberry to see one of our beauty spots and his comment was why do we keep it a secret.  That is one matter in which advertising failed.  I have seen some of the advertising that we do in America and it makes my blood boil. We should make it our business to see that the agents who are responsible for some of these advertisements are never employed by us again.</P>
    <P>The Irish-American has a great love for Ireland.  We could spend 11,000 dollars asking the Americans to &ldquo;Come to Oireland&rdquo; in publications such as the <i>Saturday Evening Post</i> but I doubt if that would bring them here.  The Irish people in America are grouped mainly around Boston.  Then, there are groups around New York, Philadelphia, Chicago and California. We should concentrate on these places and carry out our publicity through the Irish clubs and the various well-organised Irish societies.</P>
    <P>Archbishop Cushing organised a pilgrimage to Ireland and brought a liner of people to Cobh.  It was a great success.  Similar pilgrimages could be organised and two or three counties could be co-ordinated, say Waterford, Kilkenny and Wexford, to bring people to these counties.  Special excursions could be arranged perhaps with the air companies.</P>
    <P>I have seen films that were made in this country which were magnificent. They showed Killarney, Glendalough and other beauty spots.  The pictures that count most with Irish people in <Col N="90" /> America are pictures taken by amateurs outside the church door, at the hurling match, at the fair.  I met a friend of mine who had come home to Ireland for the second time in two years and he told me that he had seen his mother in a film that was taken here and he thought she was not looking well and therefore he came back to see her.  Another Irish-American had seen a picture of a crowd going to Tramore races and that prompted him to come home on a visit.  Advantage should be taken of all the Irish societies and clubs in America to promote tourism.</P>
    <P>The Irish fair and market is the heart and soul of rural Ireland.  I have friends and relatives in every State in the Union and whenever they visit me I bring them to a fair and I have great difficulty in getting them to leave it.  It is part of the Ireland that they dream about.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the French climate.  Our climate is not too bad.  I have experienced as much rain and cold in France as anywhere else. I come from Waterford, the harbour of the sun.  The Meteorological Office have confirmed that there is more sunshine in Ireland than in England with the exception of Devon and Cornwall, but the south-east of Ireland is well ahead of them.</P>
    <P>Where possible, signposting should be carried out in co-operation with local historical societies.  There are many such societies in existence, such as the Old Dublin Society and the societies in Wexford, Kilkenny, Waterford and Limerick.  These societies would be in a position to advise as to inscriptions on plaques and the production of tourist folders.  The country should be divided into regions and a folder published in respect of each region.</P>
    <P>If my suggestion as to representations to British Railways to introduce cheap fares in the off season is carried out, the board should also ask the hotels to advertise cheap rates for periods when the hotels are not doing anything.</P>
    <P>I wish to say a word about menus. There is a menu in Ireland which is becoming eternal&mdash;soup, out of the <Col N="91" /> tin; salmon, out of the tin; cooked ham, out of the factory; and chicken that was cooked three days ago and has been reheated.  The hoteliers should get out of this factory-cooked ham and should cook the hams in their own hotels.  They should look around them and ask their mothers&mdash;they should not mind their French cookery books&mdash;for some old Irish recipes and should put them on.  A great friend of mine, God rest him, who was a great hotelier during his lifetime, made it his business to put on some old Irish recipes whenever there was a big dinner and they were always a magnificent success.</P>
    <P>I would say something for my own constituency, for Rosslare and for Cork&mdash;and I would find fault with speakers from Cork who did not speak for their port.  There is a magnificent boat going into Cork, Rosslare and Waterford, but traffic is mainly promoted through Dublin, even when Dublin does not need it.  I was in a very big tourist bureau in London in August and an Englishman said: &ldquo;I want to go to Ireland,&rdquo; and before he knew where he was, he was being routed from Euston to Holyhead and into Dublin, where he was up to his neck on the boat.  He could have been sent to Rosslare or Waterford or Cork. I said to the man: &ldquo;Would it not be better to route him that way and back through Dublin?&rdquo;  I do not think he knew there were such places.  We are badly treated on that point.  I was at a dinner given by British Railways here and there were a lot of brass hats at it but they did not know anywhere except Dún Laoghaire.  British Railways at present have one agent in Ireland.  I had the honour to meet him.  Before they became British Railways, the Great Western had an agent who resided in Dublin, above all places, and the L.M.S. had another agent here.  The Great Western&mdash;that is now the British Railways Western Region&mdash;should have their agent in Waterford or Wexford, as the Western Region have no stations here at all&mdash; their stations are Rosslare and Waterford.</P>
    <P>In the matter of transport of motorcars, <Col N="92" /> friends of mine have told me they had cars brought in through Dublin, Rosslare, Waterford or Cork, and I am sure&mdash;even though I have heard adverse comment occasionally&mdash;that the companies do their job well.  The cars are usually on the dock, unless there is a big crowd of them; and if you go at any reasonable time of the evening before you are going away they will take in your car.</P>
    <P>We have just more than hunting, shooting and fishing to sell to people here.  We have a history, a tradition and a hospitality and we have a lightness of heart here that they have not in England.  Even though we may be accused of overcharging, we are not as good at clipping the people as they are in France and Spain.  I am sorry for delaying the House&mdash;I could spend another three or four hours on this&mdash; and I will close by saying that the members of the new board should be picked from the regions, that special advertising should be done in consultation with the regions and, if possible, the venues of the board's meetings should rotate to the various centres in the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree at all with Deputies who say that tourism is not very important.  I believe the more tourists we can get to eat our food, which we are in the habit of exporting, the more money we can keep in the country.  There is a point which should be brought to the notice of those responsible for setting up the new board.  A few months ago the present bodies issued a book which was supposed to contain particulars of attractions and of hotels.  I happened to check through it and was amazed to find that those bodies were not aware that the County Meath existed at all. Tara, Slane, the Boyne Valley, Kells and Trim were completely ignored. They also ignored the fact that during the summer season one-tenth of the hotel accommodation in Ireland is contained in a holiday camp in Meath. That was not mentioned at all, but a small holiday camp in County Dublin was mentioned.  I wonder was it something more than that they just missed it out, that someone did not tell them <Col N="93" /> County Meath existed, or if there was some other reason why the whole matter was ignored.</P>
      <P>The new board should do something about listing the real attractions, as Deputy Allen said.  While Deputy McQuillan's fishing and shooting folk might be spending a lot of money, the ordinary working-class people who enjoy a few weeks' holidays in England or the Continent would be glad to spend a holiday in Ireland in order to see some real scenery and some real attractions.  Unfortunately, we seem to have the idea that it is sufficient to get a concentration of tourists into Dublin during An Tóstal or some other time.  The people who run hotels down the country have not helped, because they can lay it on and it does not matter whether you are from America or England or Dublin, you will be clipped just the same.  These people should be looked after, but there should be some attempt by the responsible body to see that tourists are attracted.  Less than 12 months ago, one of the tourist bodies spent a considerable sum of money in a town in England giving a ball to the &ldquo;big noises&rdquo; in the area, but it did not succeed in bringing one tourist here as a result.  In the next town some commercial people were able to bring 2,000 tourists over in one week by going about it in the right way.</P>
      <P>I am afraid too much of the money is spent on showing off in the wrong way, both in England and in Ireland. Some of the people sent abroad to publicise Ireland are doing it in the wrong way, spending the money given to the tourist associations as if it were something given to impress the wrong people.  It is to be hoped the new body will attract people who are prepared to come for a modest holiday and to spend a reasonable amount of money.  They will come again and again and that will mean we are going a long way to achieve what the Tourist Board is supposed to achieve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McQuillan mentioned fishing and shooting.  I agree that as long as we leave the Cromwellian settlers in possession of the fishing and shooting <Col N="94" /> rights on practically all the good fishing rivers and shooting land, we cannot expect people to come here and look at someone else having the sport while they must stay on the road.  I think that the Government should take immediate steps to take and preserve those rights for the State because they should not be in the hands of the people in whose hands they are at the present time.</P>
    <P>One other point I would like to make is this omission&mdash;I think it is the most serious thing I have seen for a long time&mdash;of the entire County of Meath out of this publication while we have from the County Meath two representatives on the body that is responsible for having it published.  The people who are setting up the new body should be very careful that the right people are put on this new body so that they will not go asleep when something is happening in which they should be vitally interested.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill affords an opportunity to those of us who might be anxious to air our grievances with regard to the tourist business.  I do not think at this stage there is much that one could say that has not already been said and even after listening to the South of Ireland people I will not succumb to the temptation of extolling the beauties of Donegal.  Tourism, as has often been said, is like any other business.  It is a question of having something to sell, displaying your goods in the window and when a customer comes in dealing properly with him.  We have the goods; we have all that is required to attract tourists; we are concerned with how we should display those goods, how we should advertise those goods, and when the people are attracted by our efforts how we should deal with them in order to bring them back and bring others with them.  That, as has often been pointed out, is actually what the tourist trade means.  We all disagree in details, or with regard to particular details from time to time as to whether or not we are doing the best things to attract more people or a more suitable type of people to come here to spend their money.  We have our grievances, <Col N="95" /> too, in the north of the country.  We feel that a bureau should be established there, preferably in Bundoran, the gateway of Donegal, which would control tourism for the entire north of the Republic.  We hope that approaches now being made to the Irish Tourist Association in that respect will not fail.</P>
      <P>We think that it would perhaps help in many cases to offset many disadvantages from which we suffer with regard to distance, and so on.  You will remember that in the Christenberry Report we got but a brief, though very significant reference, and it was pointed out that Donegal was unequalled in Ireland as a tourist county but that our roads were not up to the standard&mdash;particularly our back roads &mdash;that most tourists would require, and that is the present position.  I think if the Minister who is concerned with tourism&mdash;the Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash;would co-ordinate the little efforts in some other Department it would ensure that more money would be spent on some of the back roads which lead to places of scenic beauty, to the seashore, to lakes, and at the same time roads which are serving the people would be improved.  If he would lean in that direction, he would not merely be serving the important matter of tourism but he would also be providing necessary employment and at the same time giving better amenities to those who have to live in those areas.  We are very grateful to the previous Minister for giving us a most generous grant in that respect in Donegal.  It enabled us to set going a very extensive and important work in some of the main arteries leading into what was hitherto practically undeveloped territory. Our main roads are not bad throughout the country but once the tourist leaves the main arteries to go to places&mdash;and there are many beautiful places which are not listed as important resorts&mdash;he very often finds the road is not one which would encourage him to come back or ask others to come back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the point I would like to make in the few words I would like to <Col N="96" /> say on this Bill now is to stress the importance of having more money diverted to roads which would serve the dual purpose of providing employment and amenities for the tourists.  I think everyone in this House would be unanimous in agreeing to any effort that may be made to improve our position in that respect.  As I say, we have taken a very important step in that direction&mdash;I think the amount allocated by the previous Minister was something in the region of £5,000,000 to be spent over eight years&mdash;and very much needed work will be done.  I would like to say that work could be even further extended if this question were kept in mind when allocations are being made from the road grant with particular reference to counties which are well known as premier tourist counties.</P>
    <P>There is another important aspect of the tourist trade which has been mentioned by some and which is most important in so far as business people are concerned, and it is the question of extending the season.  With that particular aspect in view, the Tóstal was organised and arranged early in the season and I think it is a pity that everybody does not throw his full weight behind efforts to make a success of the Tóstal.  Those who expected it to be an outstanding success as a festival in one or two or three years were expecting too much.  The important thing is, of course, to keep it going and to get it established particularly among the Irish abroad as a festival to which they may look forward from time to time to unite with friends at home, and make it a time for visiting their homeland and enjoying whatever little jollification, brighter life and happier times they have when they revisit their friends here.</P>
    <P>It is only fitting that we in a country which has sent emigrants to every country in the world should have a particular time set aside to enable people to return and have that as a festival period such as An Tóstal is intended to be, and at the same time make it become an attraction to others who would like to spend holidays here. There is no reason why it should not be established as such a festival if we <Col N="97" /> persist in our efforts to keep it going and get the assistance of people who are best fitted to do that work.  One Deputy criticised the type of people you will find associated with the organisation of An Tóstal functions and so forth.  You may very well find undesirable people in any walk of life or in any organisation, but by and large, the people who are prepared to give of their time and energy voluntarily to work that will bring even a few extra people to the village or to the seaside resort or district generally are entitled to some encouragement.  No matter what their motives may be if they succeed in organising a decent function to attract and entertain strangers they are performing very useful work and should be given full encouragement in that work.  We have not got enough of that type of people.  The voluntary worker is disappearing in many of the matters which require local effort and co-operation for the well-being of particular districts.</P>
    <P>Perhaps one does not experience the same thing in Roscommon as in other areas, but I thought that we had some very able, enthusiastic and energetic workers on the Tóstal committees who were actuated by only one motive&mdash;to make the Tóstal a success and to organise suitable entertainment and bring extra people into the area to enjoy the festival during the period prescribed for it.  If we keep going on these lines and if we persist in our efforts, we will eventually succeed in having it established in the minds of our people abroad as the annual festival which gives them an opportunity of a reunion with their friends for a short period.</P>
    <P>To extend the season at the other end, more attention should be paid to shooting and very little attention is being paid to it at the moment.  There are complaints that some of our best shooting is held by absentee landlords, but, if it is readily available to people who want to shoot, and if an attempt is made to preserve the grouse and other game, we cannot complain.  What is mainly happening, however, in many parts is that the people who own the land, and particularly rough shooting, do not secure any reward for the <Col N="98" /> grouse shot on their lands.  In some cases, their permission is not even sought by those who trespass on their lands&mdash;people perhaps with guns for which they may hold only what we call a vermin licence or poachers who have no licence at all.  Unless we can make an organised effort to develop, to protect and to preserve the shooting, we can hardly expect to extend our tourist season for the period from 12th August onward.  I think we have there the greatest potential source of tourist attraction, if the necessary attention is paid to it.</P>
    <P>I should like those who live in industrial centres which are also tourist centres to appreciate the difficulty of resorts which depend entirely on the short tourist season. When the season closes, they have virtually no means of livelihood until it reopens, and I think that such places as those should get special consideration in any applications made under the 1953 Act which entitles seaside resorts to participate in the scheme whereby they may get loans free of interest for the development of particular projects in their areas.  The board should favour that type of resort when applications are made for loans for the development of projects in their areas.  I refer to the seaside resorts which depend entirely on the short tourist season for a livelihood, as distinct from places like Dublin, Cork and Waterford, which are highly industrialised, comparatively speaking, and have not got a big percentage of their population solely dependent on the tourist season&mdash;places like Bundoran, Ballybunion and resorts along the western coast.  I believe they should get preference in the allocation of any loans or grants for the furtherance of any projects they may put forward in relation to the tourist business.</P>
    <P>The weather conditions have been referred to as one of the greatest detrimental factors in relation to our tourist season and no doubt a season like last season was enough to discourage people from taking holidays at all; but it must be remembered that that incessant rain was widespread and was experienced <Col N="99" /> in most countries.  People who came back from the south of France and Spain reported the same wet season. I was one of the people who went to Strasbourg later in the season and we experienced rain practically throughout our entire stay.  We must admit that we get our due share of what rain is going, but one small thing which might offset the bad effect which such a season has on the tourist trade is what private enterprise can do in the matter &mdash;and even local tourist boards&mdash;in concentrating on the provision of indoor swimming pools, games and amusements which will provide for at least a certain section of our people.</P>
    <P>In some of our holiday resorts are to be found some of the best swimming pools one could see and I am inclined to mention some of those I have seen in Northern Ireland, particularly in Portrush, where you will find in some of the hotels the very best of swimming pools, heated to suit the particular time of the year&mdash;better swimming pools than one could find in the open&mdash;which are available at a moderate charge and which provide facilities for swimmers and non-swimmers alike.  That is the result of a little enterprise on the part of people anxious to cater for the tourist at a time when the weather precludes him from enjoying his stay on the golf course, at the seaside or elsewhere in the open.  It should not be necessary for any board or association to remind private enterprise that it is to their benefit to do these things and that very generous loans are available for the development of such amenities for the hotelier who is anxious to take advantage of them.  If these were well known to all concerned, advantage would be taken of them by increasingly large numbers as the years go on.</P>
    <P>By and large, the time that has passed has led the people to become more tourist-minded, and, while some people say that all the money we are spending on tourism is wasted, I think it is by no means wasted.  The people have certainly risen to the occasion and a general improvement is already evident in hotels throughout the country.  The number of people who <Col N="100" /> are doing hotel management courses and the number of institutions catering for them&mdash;the coaching of people who are anxious to take up hotel work of one type or another&mdash;are in themselves evidence that we are taking advantage of the industry and prepared to make the most of an industry which is undoubtedly a great boon to the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to welcome this Bill, as one must welcome any kind of legislation which is directed towards the co-ordination of energy in any particular respect, rather than allowing the rather anomalous division of energies which has operated in this country in many spheres, and particularly in tourism.  I feel at the very beginning that I must concur with Deputy Brennan in many of the views he has put forward on tourism.  I must compliment him on his reasoned approach to this particular business. Apart from the ordinary natural resources of this country such as agriculture, tourism should, I think, probably rank next in importance.  Deputy Brennan mentioned that the roads leading from the main arteries should be improved and that in that way a double job would be done, namely, employment would be given and at the same time a way would be made for the tourist to wander down what I might describe as the laneways of our beauty spots.  In my opinion, not only would it do a double job but it would do a triple job.  It would give employment. It would enable the tourists to go more readily into those beauty spots and it would perform the more important want still of giving comfort to the people who have been living in the neighbourhood of these beauty spots so long unattended.  Many things were said in the course of this debate on An Tóstal, Cromwellians and all kinds of terribly undesirable people who seem to creep into every aspect of public life in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know which is the more undesirable&mdash;the people who are called undesirable in that respect or the people who hasten to cash in with carping criticism of what Deputy Brennan has referred to as our worthy voluntary workers.  There must be undesirable <Col N="101" /> people from time to time in every walk of life but to harp continually on these particular things is something, I think, that is to be deplored in our Irish way of life.  It lessens considerably any activity that would hasten the well-being of the people, not alone in regard to tourism but in regard to everything else.</P>
    <P>It is very hard to assess, even after the years that it has now been in operation, the merits or demerits of An Tóstal.  Whether it has been a success even at the time of the year at which it is held or a success on its own merits as a festival at all is not an easy matter on which to arrive at any kind of a conclusion as to whether An Tóstal deserves to be continued or not. In my opinion, An Tóstal has had very little effect outside the fanfare of trumpets in the City of Dublin on the occasion of its solemn opening each year and the giving of a badge that is used in publication notices all over the country.  I am strongly of opinion that matters of this kind must be approached not so much from the legislative effect of anything we can do here as from trying to man a board, which will be the result of legislation here, with people who are capable of viewing this whole matter with such a degree of sympathy and understanding that rather than incur the wrath of the people with any kind of dictatorial methods by themselves or by their agents, they will inspire people and give them the courage that is necessary to advance on a private enterprise basis.</P>
    <P>For the life of me I cannot see why officials or civil servants&mdash;I do not know what they are&mdash;go down in the nature of supervisors in connection with small country hotels and cause an unholy row as to whether a corner is sharp or round.  This, I take it, is an effort to banish the cobweb from the corner between the roof.  I think that the main aspect of tourism is cleanliness. I do not think that would be questioned.  When a man leaves one country to come to another and brings the family with him or even when he goes from Dublin to a different part of this country, he does that to enjoy something that is different from what <Col N="102" /> he has been enjoying in the course of the year.</P>
    <P>On the matter of menus, probably Deputy Lynch is right to some extent when he complains of the eternal menu.  Probably the mistake small hotels and guest houses make in catering for tourists is that they try to do something to serve dishes which they think the tourists have been used to in their own homes.  I think the success of tourism is to give the people what you have.  Give them wholesome food and give it to them clean and reasonable.</P>
    <P>With regard to cleanliness and private enterprise, I must pay a tribute to the people in my constituency who have nothing to rely upon but tourism and during the off-season the migratory labour effort.  I refer to the Island of Achill where everything possible that can be done by way of private enterprise in relation to small hotels has been done.  The small hotels are good and clean and are making their mark in tourism.  They have been doing that for a long time.  One of the things which the tourist body responsible for the proper advertising in relation to tourism should do and which would be of more benefit than any fanfare of trumpets is to develop local voluntary committees everywhere. One of the things I would commend seriously to the Tourist Board is that they should make a real effort towards beautifying our villages and towns by the removal of derelict buildings. Get rid of the blackened chimney, the half fallen ivy-clad walls.  Get rid of all those eyesores.  It may be a means of giving employment of some kind.  If not, it certainly will inspire every person in every village to see his village clean and an attraction not only to the people who visit it but to those who pass by.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I wish to say that I welcome this Bill.  I welcome it, as I said in the beginning, as something which is going to co-ordinate the energies of our people, in the proper quarter, and which is going to do something which will probably take away from tourism the particular political aspects which unhappily have been growing with the years.  I want <Col N="103" /> to urge upon the Minister that, in forming a board as the result of the coming into operation of this particular Bill, he will pay due regard to regions, and see that the persons selected will be people of some experience, who will not have a particular are to grind, politically or from the tourist point of view, but will be people who are of such calibre as to give this country, and the tourist industry, the fillip it so badly needs.</P>

      <P>Maidir leis an teideal agus an fo-theideal atá beartaithe a thabhairt don Bhord Cuartaíochta nua, is é mo bharúil gur céim siar é fo-theideal Béarla a thabhairt dó, mar is ró-bhaolach gurb é an fo-theideal Béarla a húsáidfear, cé go raibh an teideal An Bord Fáilte, á úsáid sa mbaile agus i gcéin le roinnt blian anuas.</P>
      <P>On the question of the title and the sub-title which it is proposed to give to the new tourist board, I think it is a retrograde step to have an English sub-title inserted, because automatically, the usage will be the English one, whereas over the past couple of years An Bord Fáilte has become not alone national, but international.  I think there is as much justification for asking the Minister to change Bord na Móna and have the sub-title turf board as to have as a sub-title or co-title &ldquo;the tourist board.&rdquo;  I think nobody would agree that having a sub-title or co-title in English will be of any kind of assistance, or will give a higher status, or a more widespread application.  I would love to hear the Minister state why it has been decided that, after being in operation for a few years, it is now necessary to have an English title appended to this board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is a delight to hear foreigners, especially English people, who come into this country, bandying Irish words, such as An Bord Fáilte. This certainly makes some of the Irish people sit back and think.  It is well known what those two words stand for, not alone in this country, but in America and Europe, whose people we <Col N="104" /> are trying to entice to come here, and spend their holidays.  Of course, before ever there was An Bord Fáilte, or a tourist board of any kind, the Irish word &ldquo;failte&rdquo; was an international word, rather than an Irish word.  It more or less corresponds with the Irish word &ldquo;slainte,&rdquo; which is also international. However, if there is a good reason for superimposing an English title I would love to hear it.  I do not think there is any justification given for the change.  It is a change for the worse.</P>
    <P>Somebody stated that the Bill would co-ordinate the work of the two boards. I cannot imagine that there existed An Bord Fáilte, charged with looking after the interests of the tourist industry, and also Fógra Fáilte, charged with the responsibility of advertising Irish tourist attractions&mdash;I cannot visualise the existence of two such bodies without having already had co-ordination. I know, and the Minister knows, that there was co-ordination between the two bodies.  This Bill does not co-ordinate, it amalgamates.  Whether that is beneficial or not, I do not know.  I think that the work done by each separate board up until now was work which could be done better.</P>
    <P>I think, in the development and fostering of the tourist industry, there is a vast amount of leeway to be made up.</P>
    <P>Further, in regard to the advertising of our tourist attractions, and the presentation of our tourist facilities to outsiders, I think there is a lot of ground to be covered yet.  I think that two boards, one charged with the purpose and object of bringing Ireland to the notice of the world was, in itself, a full-time job, which could be done better by an independent body, provided it had some co-ordination with the board whose duty it was to look after the internal interests of the tourist trade; and looking after that interest within the country was a job which could, and did, and would, very well occupy the full-time energies of the Tourist Board.  However, it is something that is not worth quarrelling seriously about.</P>
    <P>When this amalgamation&mdash;and it is amalgamation rather than co-ordination&mdash;takes <Col N="105" /> place, there will still be in the newly-formed body two sections. You must have a person, with his subordinates, in charge of publicity. He must be an expert, and those under him experts, on publicity.  Inside the body proposed to be set up by the Minister, to which he has given the name of Bord Fáilte, and an English sub-title, there will be a definite, clearcut advertising arm.</P>
    <P>The personnel employed therein cannot and must not be less numerous than the personnel which heretofore was employed by a separate Bórd Fáilte.  I do not think the Minister will argue seriously against that, so that there will be no saving; there will be no less a number employed because in regard to the dual work, whether from a publicity angle or from an organising angle within the country, a great deal remains to be done.  We are only in the very beginning.  The development of the tourist industry is something very new.  I remember during the 1947 election campaign the cry of Fine Gael was that we had foreigners coming into this country, that they were eating our ration of bread, drinking our ration of tea, eating our ration of butter and that eventually they would eat us out of house and home.  We are glad that that tune has changed.  We are glad that nowadays and over the past few years all Parties in this House are agreed that the tourist industry is one of our major and most important industries, that it brings into this country more than the cattle trade brings in, that it brings in more than any of the other industries here.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>Anyhow it is agreed by all sides of the House that it is an important industry, that it <Col N="106" /> brings into this country £30,000,000 and that it is something that can be extended.  It is, as I said, a new growth at least to this extent that all of us now are agreed that everything and anything possible to foster this industry should be done.  Having got that backing from all sides, we are now in a position to forge ahead with the further development of the industry.</P>
      <P>Ireland is a country which lends itself to further development.  By no means has it reached the stage of other countries or parts of other countries which have been developed to such an extent that they are now commercialised. Improvements can take place in our hotels and in the service in the hotels.  After all, a holidaymaker when he goes to a hotel does require and expects to get good food and good bedroom accommodation. This is a matter for private enterprise and it is important to know that. Certainly vast strides have been made in the last few years in that respect. It was pleasing to see how during the first Tóstal private individuals did take a very keen interest and caught on to the spirit of the festival with the result that improvements to hotels and guest houses did take place.</P>
      <P>The only fault I have to find with An Tóstal is that it is inclined to cater more or less for the larger centres, for the bigger cities.  It is a pity that it would not be staggered, that, say, Dublin would have its Tóstal week, that Cork should have a later Tóstal week and the other provincial cities in rotation after that, something on the lines of the Scottish fairs.  In a three-week period Dublin, Cork and some of the other bigger centres occupy all the time with the result that the smaller places are neglected and they feel there is not much point in their taking a very active interest in it because no matter what is done in those places people will go to the bigger centres where most of the celebrations and the activities are taking place.  If the Tóstal were staggered it would not be necessary to have it on a city or large provincial town basis; it could be held on a regional basis, each region having its own particular Tóstal week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="107" /> A very big point arising when we discuss visitors is the means of bringing visitors to this country.  Certainly it must cause annoyance, disheartenment and a sense of frustration to find that the shipping companies are doing what would seem to be an intended disservice to the tourist trade here.  It may not be intentional but it looks very much like it, to find that we have thousands of passengers stranded at Dún Laoghaire and some of the other Irish ports whereas the best ships and the most frequent calls are being made to Belfast by the very same companies. You will find on the Dublin routes the worst passenger-cum-cargo ships and the worst passenger ships, whereas on the Belfast route the best ships are put into operation.  It is nothing new to find people having to decide that they had better go to Belfast and cross from Belfast rather than cross from Dublin.</P>
    <P>It is only recently that the glaringness of that has struck us forcibly.  Of course, it has been going on for years and years but at last we have wakened up to the situation.  Now is the time to find a remedy and if the present companies who are operating the passenger services are not prepared to toe the line then we can take the matter into our own hands.  I would not like to see another tourist season open and still have this grave matter still unremedied.  I think the Minister would be very wise to do his utmost and to use any strong measure&mdash;as Deputy Lemass has told him, he will get the backing of all sides of the House no matter what action he takes &mdash;in either prevailing upon those people to mend their ways or remedying the matter ourselves if they refuse to do it.</P>

      <P>First of all, I would like to say that I take exception to a statement made by Deputy Cunningham when he said that in 1947 the Fine Gael Party were opposed to tourism in this country, that we did not want the English people or other visitors to come in to eat up all the butter and meat we had to supply.  The Fine Gael Party was never in opposition to tourism in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="108" /> I should not be surprised that people did object at a time when the Fianna Fáil Government allowed a ration of two ounces of butter and one and a half ounces of tea.  In such circumstances I think that people would naturally object.</P>

      <P>Fianna Fáil first made tourism the plaything of politics in this country when, in 1938 or 1939, they set up a Tourist Board which had a personnel of Fianna Fáil people.  I was going to call them something else, but I will not because it might not be parliamentary to do so.  Ever since then, boards have been the plaything of Fianna Fáil.  First of all, they set up the Irish Tourist Board.  When they returned to office in 1951, after the first inter-Party Government went out of office, those who were deprived of their seats in the old Tourist Board were set up in a new Tourist Board called&mdash;I forget the name just now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickWPalmer" hpid="Mr. Palmer Mr. Palmer">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>Fianna Fáil then set up two boards.  Now we are amalgamating them.  One board should have been quite sufficient.  In my view, there are too many boards and there should be no need at all for a Tourist Board. It would be very much better if we gave full recognition to the Irish Tourist Association, which was responsible for tourism in this country away back in years when the Government had nothing at all to do with tourism, when it was a local enterprise and when hoteliers and others interested in tourism formed a voluntary association and did the work.  I might say, in passing, that people from America and Britain and other countries came at that time in almost as large numbers as they come to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="109" /> There is some discussion from the Opposition Benches about inserting &ldquo;The Irish Tourist Board&rdquo; in brackets after &ldquo;An Bord Fáilte.&rdquo;  It does not matter whether or not &ldquo;The Irish Tourist Board&rdquo; is inserted in brackets. The main thing is that the personnel of the board will be such as will be able to do their work intelligently; that they will have a sufficient knowledge of the business they have to do and, as I think Deputy Lynch said, that there will be regional representation. Fancy, on the two or three occasions that boards were set up, there was not even one representative from Killarney or South Kerry&mdash;the centre of tourism in Ireland.  I will ask the Minister now that when he is setting up his new board he will not forget the rights of that particular area.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope that when money is being allocated&mdash;as I presume it will be allocated, particularly for the improvement and renovation of hotels &mdash;the improvement of roads in tourist areas will be catered for too.  I have in mind now not only the main roads but also those roads leading to glens and valleys and lakes and, for the benefit of hikers and cyclists, I trust that even mountain paths will be improved.</P>
    <P>I come now to the question of the improvement of hotels.  Up to the present it has been difficult&mdash;in fact, almost impossible&mdash;for hoteliers who wish to renovate their premises to get loans to enable them to do so unless very expensive alterations are involved. Consider the ordinary hotel which may be just as comfortable as a luxury hotel&mdash;one of those luxury hotels that were being built and with which I suppose the country would be full of now if the Fianna Fáil plan had been allowed to go ahead.  I would ask the Minister to look into the position as it affects small hoteliers.  After all, alterations can be made in a hotel without their being too expensive and entirely beyond the financial reach of the owner of the hotel.  I suggest the Minister might consider whether moneys could be given without very expensive plans being drawn up by <Col N="110" /> architects or engineers of the Tourist Board.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made of the publicity carried on by Fógra Fáilte. Recently I received a letter from an ex-president of the Irish Tourist Association. He was a director of the Irish Tourist Association for years but now he is in the U.S.A.  He stated that in that country no publicity at all is given to Ireland and that he was really surprised and ashamed to find out that you could not get a map of Ireland there.  He said that the only thing you could get was a few copies of &ldquo;Ireland at Home&rdquo;.  That was the position up to last October.  I hope the new board will make some arrangements whereby one special individual&mdash; say, at the Irish Consulate or at the Office of the Irish Ambassador&mdash;will be responsible for boosting Irish tourism in the U.S.A., and the same should hold for Britain.  I feel that the ideal solution would be one director of tourism here in Ireland, helped and advised by an advisory body consisting of some of the directors of the Irish Tourist Association.  Let us hope that the new board, when it gets into action, will carry out the necessary publicity, not only in the U.S.A. and Canada but also in Britain and in the Commonwealth countries.</P>
    <P>An Tóstal has been mentioned here very frequently.  When that festival was first projected, a very high official was sent, at very great cost, to the U.S.A.  However, during the Tóstal period we saw scarcely anyone at all coming from America or Britain: all we had was our own people who assembled in the towns and villages where any functions were carried on in connection with that festival.  I do not know if Deputy Lynch mentioned the Puck Fair which takes place annually in Kerry.  That fair has been known throughout the world for years past and long before An Tóstal was ever heard of and, without any great publicity at all, people from all parts of the world come to see it.  They know all about it.</P>
    <P>The festival of An Tóstal has incurred a very great deal of expense and, indeed, many of the committees set up to carry it out are still under <Col N="111" /> heavy financial strain because they are heavily in debt.  In my view, it was not the great success it was supposed to be.  If full publicity is given to the natural beauty of this country, its historical places, its historical buildings, and so forth, and if that publicity is presented in an attractive form, then many people will become interested in our country and will want to visit it. If our hotels, no matter whether they are big or small, supply good Irish food, well cooked, and if they are perfectly clean, people will come to this country.  They will enjoy the amenities which the country can offer and they will return home to tell their people all about it.  That is the best propaganda that could be devised to advance tourism in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>As tourism is a very important matter for the country, I should like to support any measures intended to promote it, first of all, on a national plane.  No matter what Bill is passed here or what board is set up, if the people of Ireland are not alive to the fact that this is a national industry and are not prepared to treat it as such and to give it all the encouragement possible, anything done in this House can only end in failure. I want to take this opportunity to point out to hotel owners and owners of guest houses that they have a national duty to perform, if they want to make tourism a success.  The only way they can do that is to treat people who come to this country reasonably and fairly.  Those of them who take the attitude of trying to kill the goose that lays the golden eggs, or trying, in other words, to get rich quickly, are the worst enemies of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am delighted that Deputies supporting the Government have agreed that the tourist industry is so valuable to this country, as shown by the fact that they are prepared to follow the lines laid down by the previous Government. Travelling through the country I have heard complaints that a number of our hotel owners and proprietors of guest houses are not playing the game.  It is, unfortunately, true that a number of people, who were in <Col N="112" /> a position to do something for the tourist industry, have not helped as much as they might.  I say that every citizen of the State should look upon tourism as a national industry and should give it every encouragement he can because everybody in the country stands to gain by the development of the industry.  I therefore appeal to every single citizen to try to make the industry a success.</P>
    <P>I should like to see the new board which is to be established, follow on the lines laid down by An Bord Fáilte inasmuch as I should like to see funds placed at the disposal of local committees to beautify our various holiday resorts.  Local authorities have already done a good deal in this direction but there is still much scope for improvement. Speaking of County Dublin, a great part of which could be regarded as the suburbs of the city, and the first area to be covered by visitors coming to the city, I think the amenities provided in recent years still leave a lot to be desired but the money necessary to carry out improvements can only be provided by way of State grants or grants from local authorities. I should like to see more co-ordination in the efforts to provide tourist amenities.</P>
    <P>Some considerable progress was made during the lifetime of the board which is to be superseded and I hope that no retrogression will now be permitted. I think other Deputies from the constituency of County Dublin will agree with me that much still remains to be done in regard to improving the attractions and the scenic amenities of resorts such as the Hill of Howth and other places along the coast.  If we are to keep our national beauty spots in the limelight, we must move with the times.  Other countries endeavouring to cater for tourists try to offer them something more than rocks and water.  We should endeavour at least to provide adequate shelters and up-to-date public conveniences at the various resorts.  Tourists will not be satisfied with mere access to the beach or resort to a hotel.  Other countries which have enjoyed freedom for even a shorter time than we, have developed the tourist industry to a <Col N="113" /> much greater extent.  I must say that quite a lot remains to be done in North County Dublin and, indeed, in South County Dublin.  I should like to make a strong appeal to the Minister to provide more money for the Tourist Board to enable it to develop the amenities of our seaside resorts and to assist local authorities in any steps they take towards that end so that at least we shall be brought into line with other countries who have always looked upon the tourist industry as a great source of revenue.</P>
    <P>I heard some criticism of the various boards that have been established.  It is a pity that we would not make an effort to get out of the rut of trying to suggest that more progress would have been made if this fellow had not been on that board or some other fellow had been on the other board. If this is a national board, we should be big enough to give it every support and provide it with the means to make the best job it can of the task which confronts it.  The only way to ensure success for any national project is to pick the best men that are available to do the job in hand.  I think it can be said that, so far as we on this side of the House are concerned, we made every effort to secure progress along these lines.  This, after all, is a comparatively young country and it is only in recent years that a sustained effort has been made to develop the tourist industry.  I admit that people visited this country from the earliest times but not at all in the numbers in which they have come here in recent years. We want to see a continuance of that progress and the only way we can secure that is to ensure that the people charged with the responsibility of catering for tourists in our hotels will see that the tourists are treated reasonably, that they are well looked after and treated in a way that will make them anxious to come back again and bring some friends with them.  It should be the aim of everybody concerned with the industry to bring about that desirable state of affairs.</P>

      <P>I have listened to the Minister's opening speech and also to that of the former Minister, Deputy Lemass, as well as to the speeches of <Col N="114" /> other Deputies and there does not seem to have been any very great difference of opinion on this whole question of tourism.  Everybody seems to be enthusiastic about furthering tourism.  I agree with the last speaker that a lot depends on individual effort. I have no doubt that the present Minister is sincere in his efforts to further the tourist industry and that Deputy Lemass, the former Minister, also did everything that was humanly possible to promote tourism.  Now Deputy Burke has said that a great deal depends on individual effort and on the way in which individuals receive tourists here.  He also said that it is highly desirable that individuals who come in contact with tourists should do everything humanly possible to make their stay pleasant and encourage their return to this country.  He stressed the point that this is both a large and an important industry and that from a national point of view it is an asset to the country.  I agree with those statements but I believe that changing from one board to another will not necessarily have the desired effect.  Deputy Lemass said that he was disappointed with some of the results of his efforts.  He referred to An Tóstal.  That has also been referred to by other Deputies. In fairness to Deputy Lemass, it should be said that when he made up his mind to introduce this festival he was quite sincere and I personally believe it met with quite a good measure of success. The unfortunate thing is that we are rather inclined to become very enthusiastic about something for a short time; then, as time goes on, we begin to lose interest.  It can be said that Deputy Lemass and the others at the top did not lose interest in relation to An Tóstal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am afraid that the enthusiasm waned to a great extent in the country and to some degree in Dublin City as well.  We should appreciate that if we intend to build up a business it is only by persistent efforts and hard work that we can hope to succeed.  There is no use in being enthusiastic about something for a week or two, or even a year or two for that matter, and then losing all interest in the project and forgetting about it.  It is only by <Col N="115" /> persistent effort that we shall get anywhere. I have in mind little functions that were organised in my own part of the country when An Tóstal was first mooted.  There was a revival of crossroads dancing, ceilidithe, aeriochtaí and feiseanna.  Some of those functions have remained.  Some of the organisers charged with responsibility have stayed together and still play their part in keeping these functions going.  Unfortunately, in other parts of the country the people seem to have lost some of their first enthusiasm.  That is rather regrettable. Indeed, it is a very regrettable state of affairs and it all comes back to the point I have been making that a great deal depends on individual effort.  We are, perhaps, as a race inclined to look to the Government for everything.  Governments can help in their own way but without the individual effort one cannot get very far.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister and to the new board that they should enlist the support of organised groups throughout the country in an effort to encourage the people to bring about such improvements as will make life happier and brighter for our prospective tourists.  Muintir na Tíre, Macra na Feirme and the Irish Countrywomen's Association could all play their part provided the Minister encourages these associations to take an interest; if he does that he will be doing a good day's work.</P>
    <P>There is a regrettable tendency on the part of some of our people to, as it were, ape the foreigner.  Fortunately that does not apply generally, for the majority of our people believe in living their own lives in their own way.  We ought all to realise that we have our own traditions and that we are very proud of these traditions.  We should demonstrate to the foreigner that we believe in the Irish way of life.  In that connection one's mind jumps immediately to the present fashion in dancing.  In many parts of the country to-day ceilidhe dancing is unheard of. Now the tourists who come here are not interested in seeing foreign dances. They want to see the native dances. <Col N="116" /> They want to hear Irish music.  Foreigners are amazed at the grip that imported dances and music have got on the people at the present time. Twenty-five years ago feiseanna were quite common in this country; they were a feast of song and story and dance.  These gatherings have now become almost unknown.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the new Minister and the new board to do everything they can through whatever organisations are at their disposal to revive these things because of their importance from the point of view of attracting tourists. I think it was Deputy Lindsay who said that the tourist comes here to see our way of life, a way of life somewhat different from that of his own country. So far as we in Mayo are concerned I regret to say that we have not got much assistance from any of the boards to which reference has been made here. They may have been active in certain directions but, from the point of view of practical assistance, we in Mayo have a serious complaint to make.</P>
    <P>We have scores and scores of lakes in Mayo in which trout are in abundance.  These lakes are hidden in the mountains.  Local people will cross the fields with fishing rods and fish in these lakes.  Unfortunately the majority of our people have now grown a bit more leisurely and they prefer to pull up in their motor cars and fish somewhere nearby.  The result is that these little lakes are neglected.  If there were proper approach roads to these lakes hundreds of tourists would be attracted to them.  The construction of such roads would also be beneficial to the local people and, after all, it is our responsibility to cater for our own.  Some of the streams that drain our lakes are choked with weeds and so forth.  Now these lakes are the hatcheries for the rivers further down. I can speak with personal knowledge of the River Moy.  On part of that river at the present time it is impossible to catch trout because the outfall from Shrone lake is choked and the fish cannot get up or down.  This particular part of the River Moy at the present time has no trout fishing. The matter is at least worthy of note. I have been told that by people who <Col N="117" /> are in a position to know and to judge. I think the Minister should, through this organisation, have a survey of these places carried out and I think that in such a survey he would have the co-operation of the Deputies and the county councillors in the areas.  I am afraid that these things have been neglected and Donegal Deputies have expressed the same viewpoint.  In the country areas we are not getting the attention that we should get from the point of view of tourism.  In Dublin I have met foreigners on different occasions who have said that they are very glad to go down the country, that they are tired and sick of seeing buildings, cinemas and so forth.  As far as propaganda through leaflets and notices in the papers can go attention should be directed at all times to the rural areas as distinct from the cities where the tourists can enjoy leisure and fresh air.  This aspect is particularly appreciated by those who live in big cities and densely populated areas.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I should like to refer is the question of sanitation. I am very much afraid that we have need to hang our heads in shame at the lack of sanitary accommodation in our smaller towns and villages.  I am afraid we have done very, very little to improve sanitary conditions in these towns.  Anybody who has reason to travel fairly extensively throughout Ireland will appreciate this lack, and visitors from other lands are very loud in their criticism of our sanitary amenities.  Take, for instance, an important place such as Knock shrine, where you find up to 30,000 or 40,000 or 50,000 people gathered together on a Sunday evening and where there are no proper sanitary arrangements.</P>

      <P>I just mentioned it in passing.  Of course, I do not want to go outside the rules of debate but you have in many areas places to which thousands of people come from all parts of Ireland and from abroad&mdash;let them be places of amusement or of prayer&mdash;which are sadly lacking in <Col N="118" /> sanitary arrangements.  There is also the point of the thatched cottage.  I am afraid the thatched cottage is fast disappearing from rural Ireland, and while we all desire very much that we should improve our housing conditions both in town and country, I think it is a pity that so many thatched houses are disappearing from the countryside at the present time.  The majority of people coming here from America and England invariably inquire when they get off the boat where they can see the thatched cottages, and at the present time they have to go a long way afield before they can see any.  I think there should be some form of encouragement given to people in rural Ireland to improve their thatched cottages wherever they are lived in.  We have gone all out to have slated houses but I think that we should also concentrate on the condition and appearance of the few thatched cottages we still have.  I would suggest that, if necessary, grants should be given&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>References were made by some Deputies to hotel charges and I think that above all we should appreciate that it is a very bad business indeed to have a situation where people could complain of having been overcharged when they come into the country.  I am afraid that such overcharging would give people a very bad impression and we should all appreciate that.  Very many of the people who come in here on holidays are our own people.  Some of them are closely related to us and some are great personal friends.  We should appreciate the fact that a good many of these people left the country because of very difficult circumstances and hard times when living conditions here were deplorable.  Many of the people who left this country have later given great help to it.  Most of them have had to work hard to eke out a living and to save something to send to their people at home, and it would be a very sad thing to think that these people when they came home to spend a holiday here would be overcharged <Col N="119" /> or that there could be a complaint that they would be charged exorbitant prices by anybody here. I should like to appeal in conclusion to hotel proprietors and guest house proprietors to treat people who come to them in the manner in which they would like to be treated themselves. If they abide by that rule I think it will be a safe rule from the point of view that they will thereby be ensuring that these people will return again and stay at their hotels.  Everybody should try to co-operate to improve this great national industry.</P>

      <P>Hardly a year passes here in which we do not have a field day on tourism.  There is a hell of a lot of bombast and nonsense talked about tourism and I am quite satisfied that if even part of the money we spent on it were spent in looking after the interests of the Irish people at home, tourism would improve considerably and we would all be much better off than we are at the moment. I feel that if you put your own place in order first, if you look after the interests and the living conditions of your own people, people will come into the country.  Do not try to impress the foreigner but let the foreigner see the Irish people in the reality.  We should try to safeguard our own national culture before we start thinking of this thing called tourism. Personally I am not satisfied that anything at all is being done for my own county although we have put up as much money as anybody else and although we have had two or three representatives on the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that my county gets very scant consideration from the board or from their representatives. Most of those boards are nothing more than a group of place-hunters who are out for a field-day themselves and who are shoving their friends and neighhours into good jobs at the expense of the people who pay.  I am satisfied that to get down to reality we must face this thing from an Irish viewpoint primarily.  I believe that you can overdo tourism because I feel that 95 to 98 per cent. of the people who come here would have come if Ireland had <Col N="120" /> never been advertised outside or if a penny had never been spent on advertising it.  The foreigners come here to see what sort of a country we have.  We should foster an Irish way of life.  We should concentrate on making this country a peaceful and happy land for our Irish people and any money we have to spend should be spent towards that end.</P>
    <P>In the county in which I live a foreign holiday camp was established. I have nothing against that camp or the way in which it is conducted but I would prefer never to have seen it. There is a lovely seaboard at Laytown, Mornington and Bettystown, and not a penny is spent there.  It is left in a wild state and there is no one to care for it.  Right beside it, there is a foreign camp, which is well run from the worldly point of view or the foreigners' point of view.  Everything is done by clockwork.  It is not representative of the Irish way of life. There may be a few Irish slogans on posters here and there in the camp but, as an Irishman who helped in the struggle for independence, I believe that when you have such innovations there will be no Irish culture left because we are great imitators of the foreigner.  We should develop Ireland from an Irish point of view.  If foreign innovations are allowed to creep in here, our fight for freedom will be wasted and we might as well have the British Empire and all she stands for. But we did not fight for nothing.  We fought for the rights of this country and the right to run it in the interests of Ireland.  As fast as we can, we try to imitate the foreigner and the idea is that nothing is good enough in this country but we must go across the water to see if there is anything we can emulate.  At the same time we spend money on tourism.</P>
    <P>Any money we have to spare should be spent on creating employment at home, in developing seaside resorts for the Irish people first and the foreigner afterwards.  Tourists will come here if it suits them.  If there were not a threat of world war to-morrow, they would go to Europe, to peep behind the Iron Curtain; they would go to Switzerland, Geneva, Monte Carlo. <Col N="121" /> That is where they want to go.  Ninety-five per cent. of the big money spinners that we are told come in here do so because they have nowhere else to go.  The real money spinners are the poor Irish workers who return from England, who have saved £50 over the winter and who spend every penny of it in thatching the cabin for their parents or in paying a passage for their brothers and sisters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that what Deputy McQuillan has said is quite right.  Let us develop fishing and shooting.  These sports do not depend on weather conditions.  Our climate is damp and our seaside resorts can never be developed to the fullest extent because of that.</P>
      <P>One of the most beautiful rivers in this country, the Boyne, runs through the Midlands to the east coast.  It is teeming with fish of all types.  The condition of that river is a disgrace to the nation and to this House.  One can hardly walk along the banks.  There are briars, bushes, broken trees, weeds and dirt of all sorts, mud-banks.  Not a penny is spent to make it attractive. Foreigners of all types have had control of the best parts of the river for scores of years, and they have greater control to-day than they had 20 or 30 years ago and nothing is being done about it.</P>
      <P>Why not open up Irish rivers for the Irish people and not allow vested interests to have rigid control?  It is time to remove the control of vested interests so that our Irish people can have a happy hunting ground in their own land and have the shooting and fishing rights to which they are justly entitled and let the foreigner pay his way.  The foreigners also have control of shooting.</P>

If the present condition is allowed to continue for the next four or five years, there will be no place in this country over which any man can shoot.  Vested interests are gaining control all over the country and the ordinary man who pays his £2 licence can get no rights while you will find people from the City of Dublin who never walked on land in their lives&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>Year in and year out, there is the same old story&mdash;spend millions on tourism.  We are told that tourism is worth £30,000,000 to the country. Ninety-five per cent. of the tourists would come in any case.  They do not come for love of us.  We should cater for the Irish people first.  We should make the country a show-piece and should develop Irish culture.  By all means develop the amenities in the country but do so in the interests of the Irish people.  If the Minister has done nothing else, he has broken up the rings which were doing nothing for tourism or for this country only feathering their own nests and getting their pictures in the papers and putting their friends into jobs.  I know too much about that, as I come from a county that saw a lot of it.  Nothing was done for that county by the Irish Tourist Board.  My county is as important as any in Ireland&mdash;it contains the seat of the ancient Irish <Col N="123" /> kings, the Hill of Tara&mdash;yet in all the books fostered by the board you find very little of Royal Meath, though some of the men who are very prominent on the board are from Royal Meath.  They blew in and we could not get them out and they are rooted there.  The Minister should see that the money is well spent and that the board does its job.  He should get the right man in control at the head. As we can see in some of the other boards, such as the sugar company and Bord na Móna, when you get the right man in the right place the business fosters itself and will need very little more money.  Too much money is being poured into this, there is too much talk and too little result and any results are very doubtful from an Irish point of view.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaugeBrennan" hpid="Mr. P. Brennan Mr. P. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I come from a tourist county and wish to put some points before the House.  It is generally agreed that the tourist industry is very important.  A lot has been done to encourage it, but I feel a lot more can be done.  An Tóstal has been referred to by many Deputies and the case has been put for and against it. I feel that An Tóstal was well meant and when it was accepted by the people in the towns and villages as it was intended it was all right.</P>
      <P>Last year in Bray we had a very energetic committee running Bray Civic Week.  It was a very successful week. Competition came into it, because the people of little Bray were jealous of the people of big Bray and they had celebrations for two weeks.  If we can develop An Tóstal on those lines we will be doing a lot of good.  As Deputy O'Hara said, the big trouble is that in the smaller villages the committees fell through and did not continue as in the first year.  The Minister would be well advised to give An Tóstal all the encouragement he can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Wicklow is a very historic county, with many places of historic interest. It is the county of Michael Dwyer, Billy Byrne, and Charles Stewart Parnell.  I doubt if there is one road sign on any of the public highways to <Col N="124" /> indicate where those people were born or where they operated during the different fights for our independence. An Bord Fáilte could do a lot to encourage tourism by looking after matters such as that.  When they have erected the signs, the next important step is to make sure that the roads leading to those historic places are put in a passable condition.</P>
    <P>In Wicklow we have received substantial road grants over a number of years for tourist roads from An Bord Fáilte.  We were grateful for those grants, but there is a lot of roads&mdash; practically every road in my county could be classed as a tourist road and there are many miles impassable to motor transport.  The board could do a lot to attract tourists to those places by providing good roads.  At the same time, it would relieve the ratepayers of having to provide the roads and would be giving a necessary and important service to the natives of the county by way of the improvement of county roads.</P>
    <P>There has been criticism of the hotels from both sides of the House.  I am not an authority on that, but I have heard very few complaints from any visitors to County Wicklow.  We can claim that in our county we have some of the best hotels in Ireland.  I do not know whether they are overcharging or not, but in the majority of them, large and small, there is first-class service and first-class food, and cleanliness is the high note.</P>
    <P>One Deputy referred to sanitation and water supplies, and if I am in order I would say that a lot could be done in that respect.  There are some villages in my county still without water and sewage schemes.  It would be a big burden on the ratepayers of Wicklow to provide them at the moment and if An Bord Fáilte can contribute in any way towards giving those villages and towns such facilities it would help the tourist industry, because in all those towns and villages there are boarding-houses, small restaurants and small hotels which have no facilities and cannot compete with hotels and boarding-houses in larger towns.</P>
    <P>I conclude by appealing to the Minister <Col N="125" /> to use his influence with the board to see that the greatest amount of road grants possible will be made available to tourist counties and to see also to it that places of historic interest are properly signposted on the main roads leading from the City of Dublin.</P>

      <P>Coming from one of the main tourist centres, as Galway can claim to be, I would like to press one point on the Minister, the question of publicity.  The radio and the film would be a great medium of publicity. We know that through the radio we got more in Galway from the song, <i>Galway Bay,</i> than from any tourist board.  We know also that through the films <i>The Quiet Man</i> has done more than any tourist board ever did in the last 20 years.  I would briefly put these two points before the Minister and would like that that medium be stressed to the Tourist Board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that the board in the past was not sufficiently representative of all the interests. There was too much stress on representation from the hotels.  I would like to stress the importance of racing from the tourist point of view.  The Racing Board has gone a long way in improving the racing, but it has not sufficiently appreciated, in my opinion, the full potentialities of this portion of tourism.  For instance, Limerick some time ago applied for an extra fixture something on the lines of Galway race week and for some reason best known to the Racing Board themselves this was turned down.  I do not want to become provincial on this question, but I think that this being the home of the greatest racehorses, producing the greatest racehorses in the world, we should have a race in this country on the same lines as the Grand National and the Derby.  I would ask the Minister to pay particular attention, if he is increasing the membership of the board, to the giving of representation to the racing fraternity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is well there were not many potential tourists listening to Deputy Giles when he spoke about people coming to see the old country anyway. They might not come a second time if <Col N="126" /> some of the ideas the Deputy had were put into use.  The Deputy has completely ignored the point that tourism is one of the greatest benefits in our balance of payments and if Deputy Giles's logic was brought to the conclusion to which he evidently wished it to be brought, then we might as well turn around and say why would we feed foreigners with our beef, or does Deputy Giles also advocate that we should turn around and say: feed the Irish at home first and then take care of the foreigners.  Perhaps the Deputy would elucidate that at some other time.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister and the new board to pay particular attention to the question of not putting too much stress on the luxury type of hotel.  Quite a small percentage of the people coming into this country do in fact frequent the grade A hotels.  That is a small percentage.  I think sufficient attention is not paid to the standard of public-houses in this country. I think, for instance, that a meal should be served in public-houses, in the larger cities anyway, so that a person would be able to get a meal We have brought in legislation to improve hygiene for shops selling food, but it is just as important in places selling drink, and God knows even in Dublin one can go into some public-houses where the drink, the condition of glasses and everything else are simply appalling.  Even if you go into the lounge bars in the high-class places you will get such things as the dregs of drinks in glasses.</P>

While it might not be the responsibility of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, he could work in unison with the Minister for Justice and have the courage to tackle the licensing laws of this country once and for all.  I think the fear of getting the box of a crozier is exaggerated.</P>

      <P>The other matter is a question of the lack of a national theatre in this country at the present time.  Plans evidently are envisaged for its erection here in Dublin and I think the sooner that is done the better.  I also think the Minister should recommend to the new board such an institution as the Taidhdhearc in Galway.  This is too small as it is at present but these are matters which could be kept in mind.</P>

      <P>I would like to support this Bill as giving, not only a new impetus to the tourist trade in this country but also, I would hope in some respects at least, a new direction as well.  It seems to me it might be a suitable time when the boards are being amalgamated, or one board is being created instead of two, for the board and for the public in general to try to come back to something basic with regard to the form of tourist trade there is.  Certainly nothing can be more individualistic and more a matter of small enterprise than the tourist trade in this country.  In so far as it is an industry, probably of all industries that one can even conceive in this country it is the one which lends itself most to small units of private enterprise&mdash;putting it that way&mdash;independently wrong and matters of small private enterprise.  Having regard to that it does seem to me to be of great importance that the board should appreciate and start on the basis that it is there to assist, to guide and not to direct, to guide, to assist, to co-ordinate as far as possible, but surely not to direct.  On that it seems to me that one thing which Deputy Lemass said at the commencement of this debate is somewhat disturbing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He was commenting on what was maybe a lack of efficiency or activity on the part of An Bord Fáilte in the past and he referred to the fact that he hoped it was doing its job with regard to hotel accommodation but he was afraid by reason of the absence of complaints from hotel keepers that the <Col N="128" /> board possibly or probably was not. I do not think that any board which has been set up to assist the tourist industry in this country should be measured in regard to its success by the volume of complaint which it manages to get from hotel keepers. I do not think the thing should be approached in this way at all as I think it would be most improper for any board to get the idea that it was some form of disciplinarian over the tourist industry of this country. Certain standards must be kept and penalties imposed and directions given for the keeping of those standards, but I think it should be kept in the forefront of the mind of any organisation concerned with tourism that it is there to assist small units of private enterprise.  In the way of new direction what I would like to see is that there should not be overemphasis on publicity at the cost of assisting tourist attractions.  I believe that what was said, I think by Deputy Palmer, was right that by far the best publicity for tourism anywhere in Ireland is one satisfied tourist.  It is worth 12 posters and 20 leaflets.  It does seem to me that publicity is essential to meet competitive publicity of other countries.  Information is absolutely essential in this trade, but I do think there should not be overemphasis on publicity or the distribution of information if that is going to be done at the expense of improving attractions.  If we can get people here and satisfy those who come here I think the grapevine&mdash;the almost-international grapevine&mdash;is almost the best form of publicity we can get.</P>
    <P>There is only one other matter which I would like to mention arising out of this debate.  There has been considerable and, I think, rather hazy talk about the sports of shooting and fishing in this country.  It seems they are separate problems to a certain extent, but with regard to fishing a very considerable amount has been done recently by the Department of Fisheries to improve the strength and condition of rivers.  Deputies have spoken of having shooting and fishing in the hands of Cromwellian settlers only.  I do not think that is so.  Anybody who looks at the Twenty-Six Counties as a <Col N="129" /> whole will find that in the last 20 or 25 years the Forestry Division alone has acquired a vast area of good shooting land, and I think the example of what the tenants of the Forestry Division have done&mdash;and they are certainly not Cromwellian&mdash; towards preservation of game and the killing of vermin is not very notable.  It is a question of individual effort, individual approach, it may be a question of individual capital, but I do not think there is any good approach to the problem by saying these rights are all owned by Cromwellian settlers; buy them out and everything in the garden will be fair.  I do think it will be fair.  In the case of shooting, it can be tackled, in the first place, by destroying vermin, and, when that has been done, by restocking with game. I do not think that can be helped or improved by any acquisition of shooting. I think it is a matter which will require assistance from the Government, but it is largely a matter which will have to flow from a voluntary effort on the part of the ordinary people who shoot and enjoy shooting in this country.</P>
    <P>With regard to An Tóstal, I agree with what Deputy Lemass said that it was of great importance and of great service and that, when it was launched, it was launched without any attempt on the part of the then Government to gain kudos.  It is equally important that Deputies supporting the Government now should not appear in any way as a political matter to oppose it merely because it was commenced by their predecessors; but I do think we should examine it, and while the idea of attractions out of season&mdash;extending the season&mdash;is very desirable&mdash;at the same time, it may be that again, and certainly in the City of Dublin, a wrong slant has been put in the past on the form of these attractions.  An Tóstal is Ireland at home, and I wonder are we at home in the form of Tóstal we have run in the City of Dublin up to this or are we parading, so to speak, in a rather garish and unusual Sunday suit.  It seems to me that fireworks and parades, and to a certain extent even these trade parades, are not Ireland at <Col N="130" /> home and may not be the best way of attracting tourists to this country.</P>
    <P>We have something very different to sell in tourism, and I should like to see the energy and the genuine enthusiasm which goes to the making of An Tóstal possibly changing its direction somewhat more towards the stimulation and encouragement of separate events, be they sporting or cultural, if necessary, at very different times in the year in different places, each one suitable to the place and to the time and that the energy which goes into a general Tóstal should go separately into these in every region in the country.  That would be a better way of attracting tourists and would be a more real and more genuine way of showing Ireland at home to people who are willing to come to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate has ranged over a very wide area and many matters of detail have been raised on which it is hardly necessary for me to comment on the Second Reading; but there were some points thrown up to which I think we should give attention, and, in the time at my disposal, I will endeavour to deal with these.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lemass raised a question as to the wisdom of amalgamating these two boards and creating instead a single board.  I could never understand why two boards were created in 1952.  I have a personal suspicion why they were created in 1952, but it is fruitless to dilate on that at this stage, and the only point for consideration is whether it is wise to amalgamate both boards and to constitute a single body dealing with tourism.  When I went into the Department of Industry and Commerce, I found there a most unsatisfactory position regarding both those boards and the relationship of one board with the other was distinctly unsatisfactory, if not openly hostile. The further I examined the matter, the more I found that these relations had continued for quite a while.  It did not just arise the day I went there. They were there for quite a while and a very bad atmosphere existed which was frustrating completely any idea of co-operation between the two boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For example, Section 34 of the <Col N="131" /> Tourist Traffic Act, 1952, which set up Fógra Fáilte, declared:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In the discharge of its functions under this Act, the board shall ensure that tourist publicity is directed in accord with the policy of An Bord Fáilte on the development of tourist traffic in, and to, the State.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I found that there was an issue over that particular section.  Fógra Fáilte took the view that it was its job to do the publicity and to such an extent that it need not consult An Bord Fáilte, the body responsible for framing tourist policy, so that, although the Act said that Fógra Fáilte should ensure that tourist publicity was directed in accordance with the policy of An Bord Fáilte, Fógra Fáilte did not regard it as their duty to consult An Bord Fáilte, the body which, as I have said, was fashioning tourist policy.  As a matter of fact, Fógra Fáilte did some printing without even consulting An Bord Fáilte and anybody who could pretend to believe that that was a satisfactory state of affairs would be easily pleased.</P>
    <P>I spent a considerable amount of time dealing with these two bodies, time which I should not have been required to spend in dealing with these two bodies.  They were set up to discharge certain functions.  I was not satisfied that they were co-operating in the discharge of these functions and not satisfied that they were discharging the functions in the way this House intended them to discharge them, and it was because I was so dissatisfied with them that I brought them into my office and spoke to them about this whole business and told them how dissatisfied I was with the way they were functioning, or rather and more accurately, not functioning, in the manner in which the Legislature intended they should function.</P>
    <P>I came to the conclusion early on that these two boards should be welded together under some single and comprehensive authority and that this rivalry and clash of personalities, with one outbidding the other and competing with the other, as if they were <Col N="132" /> two separate firms, was the best possible way in which to waste the nation's money.  I made up my mind early that this country was not getting value for the £500,000 which was being devoted to these two bodies to promote tourism in this country.  Having decided, therefore, that the proper course to adopt was to amalgamate these two bodies by the dissolution of one of them, I endeavoured to get them to meet jointly, in the anticipation that this legislation would come along and that, when the legislation was passed by the Dáil, they could just slip into gear easily and function and that the future board would function in that easy and efficient way.</P>
    <P>I had a considerable job to get them to meet jointly and even some of the joint meetings were anything but harmonious. The difficulty was to get them even to turn up at the joint meetings for the purpose of discharging these functions.  Every conceivable difficulty was found in getting about ten people to meet together and to decide in what way they could best spend the £500,000 which was being taken out of the pockets of the people of the country and entrusted to these two boards for the purpose of promoting tourist development here.  By the time I came to meet the boards and having told them my views about merging them into one, they themselves had realised that that was probably the only solution of their difficulty.</P>
    <P>I do not want to quote from a lengthy report, but I spent some hours meeting representatives of both these bodies and they told me when they came to meet me that, having had experience of their efforts to try to live as two separate bodies, they were unanimously of the opinion that the better organisation of the tourist industry required that there should be only one board on which the Irish Tourist Association would have representation. I went on to ask them how they were functioning and what was the difficulty of getting them to mesh together satisfactorily and co-operatively. One member of the board said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In considering the whole matter, <Col N="133" /> the representatives had been thinking further ahead than the proposed arrangement for joint meetings.  They felt that an arrangement of one board only was the best and that the sooner it was introduced the better. The existence of two boards was wasteful of funds in that there were separate board members, separate staffs, premises and transport arrangements.  At present the two boards had seven different premises spread over Dublin.  He&mdash;that is, the member of the board&mdash;felt strongly about the waste of public funds involved. One board would be more economic and efficient.  He did not think that the arrangement for joint meetings would be satisfactory because personalities came into the matter to some extent and the officers of both might be inclined to give undue regard to the importance of their own positions.  If there were one board, publicity could be handled as a separate department by that board and the arrangements would not create any hardship or redundancy of staff.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>So that we had a confession by the board themselves that the scheme of two boards was not working satisfactorily. I found an atmosphere of complete hostility between the two boards. Where that atmosphere of friction, frustration and hostility existed, quite clearly the people would not get value for the £500,000 the State was making available to both boards.  I think the atmosphere which I say I found, the long continued friction which existed and the confessions of the members of the boards&mdash;they believed one board was the only way of remedying the situation&mdash;all makes a very strong case for the procedure enshrined in this Bill, namely, to dissolve one of the boards, create a single board and give that single board the unified control over the entire tourist industry.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass raised some points to which I would like to refer.  He made reference to the danger that you might have too many hotel owners on the new board.  I agree with him that it would be quite undesirable to over-balance this board with any <Col N="134" /> particular class of person.  I agree that it is not desirable that the board should be controlled by hotel owners or that they should have any undue weight on the board, but I would not at the same time rule out the possibility that an hotelier might be a member of the board, because the hotel industry is an important factor in our whole tourist economy.  I would see no objection to an hotelier being on the board.  I agree with him that the board has to be balanced carefully and I have the task of balancing that board.  I will try to balance it from the point of view of getting on to the board people who have an interest by their associations in the development of a tourist business here.  I would like to make the board as representative as I possibly can and I will certainly try to get a board together of people who will blend co-operatively in trying to give us an efficient tourist organisation in the future.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass said that I had put an officer of the Department on the board to sit in on the talks of the board.  That is not quite correct.  I did ask a senior officer of the Department to sit in on the Tóstal Committee which is dealing with this year's Tóstal.  I did that for certain reasons but I will come to them afterwards. No officer sits in on Bord Fáilte meetings or Fógra Fáilte meetings.  An officer holding assistant secretary rank, sits in on An Tóstal committee meetings.  He was put there for the purpose of helping the Tóstal committee in trying to get a better balance in the events of 1955 than we had in the 1954 Tóstal programme. However, I will come back to An Tóstal in a few moments.  That, I think, ought to clear up that misunderstanding.</P>
    <P>The question of our policy on tourism was raised by Deputy Lemass and, I think, by other speakers. Deputy Lemass seemed to think that it is necessary to state what the Government's policy is in respect of tourism.  I should not have thought that would be necessary at this stage because I understood that all Parties in the State accept the policy that it was desirable in the national interest <Col N="135" /> that tourism should be promoted in every possible way.  I hope that whatever differences there may be between one Party and another on other issues there will at least be unanimity among all Parties and Governments from time to time that it is highly desirable, from the national point of view, that we should endeavour to exploit our tourist potential to the fullest.  So far as I am concerned and as long as I am Minister for Industry and Commerce, I will do my best to ensure that the policy of developing the tourist trade will be pushed as hard as possible and as far as possible and that every possible assistance will be given to any organisation or group which is concerned with promoting the immense possibilities which this country has from a tourist point of view.</P>
    <P>I think we have to recognise now that the whole pattern of our tourist trade has changed since the conclusion of hostilities in 1945 and since the abandonment of rationing in England and the disappearance of austerity on the Continent.  During the war period we got many visitors here who, quite frankly, came because there was plenty of food here, because there was no purchase tax here, no clothes rationing and because it was easier to buy things here.  They got good value for the money they spent here.  That was a kind of tourist who came here stimulated very largely by the material advantages of good feeding and good and cheap buying.</P>
    <P>But rationing is gone in Britain now and in addition to that the allowances in respect of sterling currency for travellers to the Continent has been raised substantially and, of course, the Continent must always present a very considerable attraction for people living in Britain as it presents a very considerable attraction for people living here.  It may well, therefore, be that the type of person who came in here under the artificial stimulus of emergency conditions may not continue to come here and that our tourist pattern may take on a new orientation.</P>
    <P>If my view is worth anything, I would be inclined to say that the tourists we are likely to get in the <Col N="136" /> future will be more the middle-class American and the middle-class English person as well as the English worker and, perhaps, the American worker who are in steady employment and who like a holiday annually and who can afford a certain sum of money within their means for the purpose of having a modest holiday but it may well be that the wealthy class who filled the city hotels during the emergency will not come in the same numbers as previously and that the pattern in the future will be tourists, perhaps less wealthy but, of course, no less welcome on that account because there are much more of that type of tourist than there is of the wealthier type.  I certainly would be happy if we could manage to attract to this country a class of middle-class person in England or the British worker in steady employment and his wife and children.  If we could get those here we would fill in in our tourist availabilities a very substantial gap that is there at the moment in respect of that particular class of tourist.  I think, therefore, we have got to try and cater for that class of tourist as well.</P>
    <P>I made inquiries recently on a visit which I paid to the Shannon, to ascertain the possibilities of its being developed for tourist purposes, as to the number of fishermen in England.  I was assured by a reliable authority that there are nearly 3,000,000 people who are members of coarse fishing clubs in England.  They are the kind of folk who go out on canals, rivers and sometimes quarries and try to fish for coarse fish.  They do not take the fish away but take a record of the weight of the fish and throw it back again.  There are about 3,000,000 of these people.  Some of them fish unsuccessfully for coarse fish.  The bulk of them live within two hours' journey by plane of this country and the bulk of them live within five or six hours' journey in all from the river Shannon. If you could get a substantial number of these folk to go down and take accommodation in the little villages that nestle along the Shannon or other rivers as well and if you could spray them out over the country in that way, <Col N="137" /> you would bring a new kind of prosperity into the small towns and villages.  You will get the type of tourist who is so interested in fishing that He will come back again and again because of the abundance of fish in our rivers.  He would act as a canvasser and in turn bring in a still larger number of tourists who are interested in the fishing possibilities which we have to offer.  Similarly for the sportsman with his gun, whose heart would be gladdened to see the game which rises in such abundance up and down our sea coasts.  There again, there are possibilities for developing our tourist attractions, if we can sell to people in Britain, and elsewhere, the fact that there is such abundance of game, and such abundance of fish, which are only five hours' journey from where they live in England or Scotland.</P>
    <P>I think it is for that type of visitor more than the odd number of wealthy folk that the Tourist Board would have to cater.  I think that they can bring into this country a considerable number of people who have never been here before, people who would be astounded by the attractions which we have to offer in these fields, people who would get good value for their money when they are eating Irish food, and cultivating grand friendship and companionship which is not to be found in abundance in other countries of the world.  I hope the Tourist Board will not neglect the possibilities of development in the direction of attracting that type of tourist, because I think that type is a good investment from our point of view.  I would like to see the Tourist Board get a list of the numbers of coarse fishing clubs in England, and send an emissary over there to tell them about the attractions Ireland has, and tell them that they would make all the necessary arrangements to book any specific number of members of its fishing clubs in any of the little villages or towns convenient to the rivers which have abundance of fish.  It may be a slow process, but it is worth doing.  If you succeed at the outset, you will be holding those customers for a very long time to come.</P>
    <P>The question of the title of the <Col N="138" /> board arose.  I have no very strong feelings about that, but it is a matter for consideration.  Again and again we get tourists from England, America, and indeed a small number from New Zealand, Australia and South Africa. In all those areas there is about 250,000,000 English speaking people, and while everybody knows what An Bord Fáilte means, and what Fógra Fáilte means&mdash;or the generality of people know&mdash;those titles are not understood in those other countries. Fógra Fáilte and An Bord Fáilte, having built up a reputation, it was suggested it was built up in those countries where their terms were clearly identifiable.  I do not mind keeping An Bord Fáilte.  The Bill, in fact, provides that they shall keep the title of An Bord Fáilte, but in order to enable An Bord Fáilte to be identified outside this country, I made the suggestion that they might include the Irish Tourist Board so as to give recipients of circulars, leaflets, handouts or letters, anything you will, an idea of what An Bord Fáilte meant.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the circumstances are the same.  The position is, I assume, in those countries, that a person makes up his mind to go to France, which has been down through the centuries a tourist country.  Here we are trying to build up and develop the tourist industry. That means immense circularisation. Even the circularisation we have at present represents only a drop in the ocean as regards covering the potential markets available to us.  While they could use An Bord Fáilte at home, I thought that they might desire to use &ldquo;Irish Tourist Board&rdquo; for the purpose of interpreting to non-Irish people what Fógra Fáilte means.  As a matter of fact, I think one of the organisations &mdash;I cannot say which, I think it was Fógra Fáilte&mdash;did not feel apparently so happy about its identity being so widely known, because at the bottom of their literature it feels compelled to put this: &ldquo;Fógra Fáilte is the national tourist publicity organisation for Ireland.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no objection to it whatever, but why put it in a statutory title?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it means anything one way or the other.  As far as I am concerned, if anybody puts down an amendment to delete &ldquo;Irish Tourist Board&rdquo;, you can have a free vote on it.  I think getting one more tourist into this country is much more important than putting &ldquo;Irish Tourist Board&rdquo; in the title of the body.  I will not waste time indulging in dialectics as to whether we should put in &ldquo;Irish Tourist Board&rdquo; or leave it An Bord Fáilte.  I have no strong feelings about it except it is always given when you are trying to sell what the country has to offer, and it was only in that sense that the English title was put in the Bill with the Irish title.  If the House does not want it, it can delete it.  I will not shed any tears, and will have no regrets.</P>
      <P>As far as An Tóstal is concerned, I think I made it clear within a month or two of taking office that I was prepared to give An Tóstal an opportunity of proving itself.  I told the board that I was anxious that they should do everything possible to justify the inauguration of the Tóstal ceremony, and in order that they should plan ahead, I told them that they could plan last year for two years ahead.  Up to last year they were planning from year to year.  It was only last year, before I went into office, that they had two years more life in them.  I told them: &ldquo;You are thinking of planning international events for which you have got to make connections over a wide area.&rdquo; I said to them last year: &ldquo;I will give you an opportunity of planning for two Tostals ahead, 1955 and 1956.&rdquo;  I told them in 1954: &ldquo;Plan for 1955 and plan for 1956.&rdquo; I think that was the action of a person anxious to give them a first opportunity of planning ahead for two years.  If I saw this year that they made a success of it I would not mind telling them to go ahead for a further three years, which I think Deputy Lemass will agree was, in fact, greater liberality, and giving them a longer existence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I approached the problem from the <Col N="140" /> standpoint of encouraging them to make the best possible job they could of An Tóstal.  I saw the programme of An Tóstal.  I went over the events which they held last year.  I disagreed with the emphasis on some of them.  I got the impression that there must be millions of golfers bursting to come here to An Tóstal.  I thought some of the money used for golfing competitions might be spread over other competitions, and provide other attractions. I said there would be ways of attracting visitors for specialised events.  I did that in order to help them and in order that they would not have to come back to me time and again and say: &ldquo;What do you think of this proposition or that proposition?&rdquo; I seconded an officer of the Department to An Tóstal committee. I understand the officer has been most co-operative.  The number of occasions on which reference has been made to me since he went on the committee was about six, and I think they were merely acquainting me and keeping me in touch with what the Tóstal committee was doing, but I certainly regard the officer as helpful to the committee.  It was for that purpose he was selected.</P>
    <P>Deputy McQuillan raised the question of the preservation of certain rights for the staff transferred from Fógra Fáilte to An Bord Fáilte.  This Bill is safeguarding the pension rights of full-time members of Fógra Fáilte. They have those pension rights at the moment.  This Bill recognises that fact and provision accordingly is made in Section 4 (2).  So far as the transfer of staff from Fógra Fáilte to the new board is concerned, transfer is on the same conditions of tenure and remuneration as they have now with Fógra Fáilte, and whatever these conditions are will be taken over by the new board, the board accepting all the liability thereby involved and at the same time availing of any rights which the board itself may have under the conditions of the officers transferred.</P>
    <P>The question of transport between this country and Britain has been raised. This is a problem which is as old as this House.  Down through the years people who have been using the cross-Channel <Col N="141" /> services, particularly on the L.M.S. route Holyhead-Dún Laoghaire, have in my opinion been getting a very raw deal.  They got it from L.M.S. and they have been getting it for many years from British Railways and up to last year as well.  I got complaints about this matter and from my own personal knowledge and observations I discussed the matter with the officials of my Department.  I told them what my views were and we told British Railway representatives that the cross-Channel boats were operating in such a way as to prevent people from coming to spend their holidays in Ireland.  We told them that particularly third-class passengers were being warehoused on the decks of the boats and we said British Railways, which was in a specially privileged position so far as the transport of passengers to and from this country was concerned, should provide proper civilised conditions for the tourists who are using their boats.  As a result of the representations which I made last year there was some improvement in the services but a great deal still remains to be done before these services can be regarded as satisfactory.</P>
    <P>I have had this matter under consideration again in recent weeks and as a result of the further and strong representations which were made to British Railways they told us that this year their services represented a big improvement on their 1954 services and that if on experience the 1955 services were not adequate they would consider what further steps should be taken to secure an improvement in 1956.  I do not think we can go on with this trial and error pattern of transport and I have caused British Railways to be informed that this is not good enough, that they must now take steps to ensure that our people and their own citizens who are using the Holyhead-Dún Laoghaire route are transported in comfort and that they are not exposed to all the hardships which have been the common lot of many passengers using the services down through the years.  Our Department have told British Railways representatives that they should recognise <Col N="142" /> they have a special responsibility in the matter and that we expect them in 1955 to apply the remedy which is obviously called for on the experience we have had in 1954 and in earlier years and if British Railways do not indicate of their own volition that they will provide these modern services for traffic in the carriage of which they have a specially privileged position then I personally propose to take this matter up with the British Minister of Transport so as to ensure that our people who use the British Railways services between Holyhead and Dún Laoghaire or in the reverse direction will get decent treatment for the fares which they are required to pay.</P>
    <P>I am glad, therefore, that the debate on this Bill has been availed of to give expression to the views from all parts of this House that British Railways are not doing the job which we expect them to do and that a united House here is of opinion that our people are entitled to better transport services than they have been getting in the past or are getting up to the present.  I hope all this will serve as a clear manifestation to British Railways that something more is expected from them and that that something more should be provided for our people this year.</P>

      <P>Their own people are suffering as much as our people.  From the way in which they are transporting people one would get the impression that it is a commando course they are being asked to undergo in crossing over and many people have gone back from this country saying: &ldquo;Never again will I withstand the hardships of a run on the boat between Holyhead and Dún Laoghaire&rdquo;.  There is another aspect of this tourist business I ought to mention. I have been very dissatisfied with the kind of carriages provided for the tourists when they arrive or the type of carriages taking people down to the pier at Dún Laoghaire.  I have told C.I.E. they ought to get rid of those carriages.  They are unsightly things.  They give an appalling impression to tourists and they look to me to be the worst that can be found; if there are any worse there I have not <Col N="143" /> seen them.  People arrive at Dún Laoghaire thinking they are coming into a land of promise and their first contact is with these dirty, untidy vans. I told C.I.E. I would give them a limited period to put on decent carriages and they have given me an undertaking to put on those by Easter and by the time the tourist season is in full swing this year tourists from Dún Laoghaire into Dublin will travel in carriages they never saw before and we will be rid once and for all of the type of carriages which have been used so long to transport tourists on that journey from Dún Laoghaire to Dublin.</P>
      <P>The question of the car transport service has been raised by some Deputies.  I have taken that matter up with British Railways at a high level and I have told them if they have a monopoly of the service from Holyhead to Dún Laoghaire there is an obligation on them to provide a car ferry service.  I have left them in no doubt as to what my views are.  They are now dealing with the matter and our aim will be to ensure that a car ferry service is provided on that route. In connection with this you may rest satisfied that the question of the charge for these cars will also be raised with British Railways.  There are some other matters which were raised but time does not permit of my dealing with them.  However, I think I have covered the main points which have been raised and I am grateful to the House for the manner in which the discussion on the Second Reading of the Bill has proceeded.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on Section 66, amendment No. 49.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>On the 15th December last I moved amendment No. 49 which reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In line 10, before 'by' to insert &lsquo;and after consultation with the Dublin City Council and the Dublin County Council&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Would the Minister be prepared to say, having had considerable time for reflection, that he would accept that little suggestion?</P>

      <P>I can see the Deputy's point of view in moving the amendment, but I cannot visualise circumstances <Col N="145" /> in which the Dublin Corporation and the county council would not be consulted.  For instance, the only circumstances in which the section would be invoked, in my opinion, would be for the altering of the Dublin Public Assistance boundaries.  That would only come up from either the corporation or the county council.  However, if the Deputy would prefer it, I will consider it between now and the Report Stage, but I cannot visualise any circumstances in which they would not be consulted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is no objection in principle to a local authority being consulted as a result of an application made by one body to the Minister which would affect the other body, what is the difference in regard to putting it in this Bill?  From our experience, we are held rigidly, word for word, to the Acts.  I am speaking from experience over a long period of time.  If it is not in the Act we will be told it is not in the Act and that therefore we do not have to be consulted. We are always tied to the actual phraseology, word for word, of the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The only foreseeable reason that I can think of is the extension of either the city or county boundaries&mdash;and that can only be done at the request of the city and county authorities, and they would be consulted. My only reason for not accepting the amendment is, really, to simplify the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking without my brief and completely from memory, but I have a recollection that I had a somewhat more fundamental objection to this section.  I rather wanted to put this point to the Minister. Up to the moment, adjustment of the boundaries of the Dublin Public Assistance District, and so on and so forth, is rather confined: the powers to make these adjustments are rather confined.  Will this section have the effect of enabling the Minister at any time, by Order, to adjust these boundaries in such a manner as he may wish&mdash;the Minister meaning the <Col N="146" /> corporation, so to speak?  Will this have the effect of giving the Minister and his Department complete flexibility from now on in the adjustment of these boundaries?  That is apart from the point made by Deputy Briscoe, whose contention I support. Unfortunately, I have not my brief with me at the moment.  Heretofore, adjustments in such boundaries could only be done under certain statutory conditions.  Does the effect of Section 66 not work out that now, by mere Order, the Minister can more freely adjust boundaries and consequently this section abolishes, in effect, statutory restrictions on the Minister?  Is that not the position?  If that is so, I should like the Minister to examine that again before the Report Stage.</P>

      <P>The decision of the Chair is based on the fact that this Bill does not deal with qualifications or disqualifications of persons seeking membership of a local authority and therefore this is not the piece <Col N="148" /> of legislation that it should be sought to amend in respect of amendment 50. It is not my intention to point out, as Deputy de Valera asked me, what code he has to amend.

      <P>By what canon are we to judge relevancy?  With respect I would agree that if a particular act or code were not dealt with in the Bill it could be excluded on such grounds but when a particular enactment, namely the Local Government (Application of Enactments) Order, 1898, is included in the schedule of repeals, it seems difficult to see what legitimate distinction can be made to prevent the other portion being dealt with.</P>

I wrote to the movers of these amendments on the 17th November, 1954, it is now the 9th February, 1955.  I think that gave the Deputies sufficient opportunity to make representations to me if Deputies thought that my rejection of the amendments was incorrect.  I am now standing by that ruling.</P>

It is in relation to the amendment of No. 39 of the 1926 Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Act.  The amendment takes out certain words from a section and what is left, on my reading of it, does not then make any sense at all.  The extent of the repeal is to remove the words:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;and every person so appointed shall hold office until a person is appointed to such office under the provisions (other than this sub-section) of this Act&rdquo;&mdash;in Section 5.</P>

      <P>I am delighted, because this now gives a perfect picture of the present Bill as something that seeks to clarify local government law.</P>

      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECOND SCHEDULE.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 53, not moved.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Second Schedule be the Second Schedule to the Bill&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>On the Schedule, we are here dealing with something which relates back to the section in connection with certain conditions in relation to pensions and pensionable employment.  We have already made certain submissions.  I made some in the course of the debate.  Deputy Colley and others have done so too. There are, I think, the seeds of potential injustices within the present framework.  Without labouring the arguments already advanced, and of which I hope the Minister is aware, can we ask him now to give that particular matter further consideration?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>It will certainly get sympathetic consideration.</P>

      <P>I would like to take this opportunity of mentioning once more that this is, as the Minister says, apparently a departmental Bill prepared with a view to consolidation. Now consolidation is merely the process of clarifying and codifying the existing law.  It does not involve new law.  This Bill, however, is bringing in new law and one of the most objectionable things I see in the Bill from start to finish is the extension of the power of legislation by Order, particularly in relation to paragraph <Col N="154" /> (n) of Section 14.  We have pressed the Minister very strongly on that and we will press him still further on the remaining stages.  He has given us, however, a courteous assurance that he will look into the matter and I hope we shall see that defect remedied on the Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows my point of view in this matter and I am in complete agreement with him. As I said before, I will look into the matter between now and the Report Stage.  I would like to take this opportunity of thanking Deputy de Valera, Deputy Briscoe and the Labour Deputies who have given me such considerable help and assistance on the Committee Stage of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>We enjoyed curing them.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Title put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Bill reported with amendments.</P>

      <P>With regard to the next stage, perhaps we could get some agreement.  We got the County Management Bill yesterday morning but the Minister has not yet indicated when he proposes to take that measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would hope to have the Second Reading before we reach the Report Stage of the Local Government Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be very satisfactory.</P>
      <P>Ordered: That the Report Stage be taken on Wednesday, 23rd February.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.30 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Thursday, 10th February, 1955.</P>
