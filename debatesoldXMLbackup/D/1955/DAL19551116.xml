    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. T. Walsh Mr. T. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if the statement made by the Minister for Agriculture at the meeting of the F.A.O. in Rome advocating a world commonwealth guaranteeing free passage of men, money and goods was an expression of Government policy; and if it is in accordance with this policy that the Government's attitude towards tillage and the growing of wheat has been determined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The sentiments expressed by the Minister for Agriculture in the statement referred to by the Deputy embody personal and stimulating opinions of the Minister.</P>
      <P>On the question of the policy of the Government in regard to tillage and the growing of wheat, I would invite the Deputy's attention to the speech made by the Minister during the debate on a motion on wheat prices which took place in this House on the 2nd December last&mdash;and, in particular, as regards wheat, to his statement that farmers are entitled to have a fair profit and an ample margin above the world price for wheat, and, as regards the other cereal crops, that the Government's purpose is to evoke from the farmers a greater acreage and a greater supply of oats and barley.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we to take it then that the sentiments expressed by the Minister for Agriculture in Rome are the sentiments of the Government in regard to cereal crops and other agricultural produce, that there is no protection for them and that we can now buy in the cheapest market?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the second portion of my answer which is Government policy and the policy of the Minister for Agriculture so far as this country is concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite what he said in Rome?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want either Deputy Aiken or Deputy Walsh to misunderstand me.  I think the Minister's statement is a personal one and he is entitled to make that as a personal statement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Minister for Agriculture go to Rome then in a personal capacity?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly not, and may I make this comment&mdash;and it is on both Deputies' supplementary questions and on Deputy Lemass's alleged supplementary &mdash; that the Fianna Fáil Party appear to have very little to do when they occupy the time of the House with questions of this kind? (<i>Interruptions.</i>)</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister for Agriculture represented the Government and spoke on behalf of the Government why is he permitted to express these sentiments?</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 38 and 39 together.</P>
      <P>As Deputies are aware, the Road Fund improvement grants for 1955-56 notified earlier this year substantially exceeded the corresponding Road Fund grants for last year.  Supplementary grants from the Road Fund amounting to £500,000 are now being notified to county councils.  The primary purpose of these grants is to enable the county councils to expand their work of county road improvement during the present financial year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The grants for Local Authorities <Col N="769" /> (Works) Act schemes notified to county councils earlier this year slightly exceeded the total grants for such purposes notified to county councils during the whole of last financial year.  A supplementary grant of £5,000 per county is now being made to each county council.</P>
    <P>As a result of these supplementary grants, the total allocation in Road Fund and drainage grants to local authorities this year is in excess of that allocated last year.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £9,731 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1956, for <Col N="774" /> the Salaries and Expenses of the Institutions of Science and Art, for certain Miscellaneous Educational and Cultural Services, the Centenary Commemorations of Thomas Davis and the Young Ireland Movement, and Sundry Grants-in-Aid.</P>
    <P>The main item in this Supplementry Estimate is the provision of £9,500 under sub-head A (5)&mdash;Purchase of Specimens&mdash;for the purchase of a collection of Irish silver.  This collection consists of 25 items representing first-rate specimens of Irish craftmanship. All are superb examples of the work of Irish silversmiths during the 17th and 18th centuries and it would be an irreparable loss if they were allowed to leave the country.  It was in fact to obviate their being sold abroad that steps were taken to acquire them for the museum.  Their purchase will go far towards making the museum collection of Irish silver, what it ought to be, the best in the world, containing as it will, as a result of this purchase, many unique items intimately related to the social and economic life of the country in the periods to which they belong.  In the purchase of these specimens, I had the advice of a number of experts and am satisfied that the price paid is reasonable and is in fact lower than that which the vendor would have received if he had not been well disposed towards the museum and if he had elected to sell them in the open market abroad.</P>
    <P>A sum of £231 is required under sub-head B (1)&mdash;Publications in Irish&mdash;to regularise certain payments towards the publication of books in Irish which were incorrectly charged against the Vote in the financial year 1952-53. Issues totalling £2,440 were made during the financial year 1952-53 to the board for disbursement and were charged in full against the Vote for that year although they included payments amounting to £231 not actually made by the board until the following financial year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad that the National Museum has been able to acquire the collection of Irish silver to which the Minister refers.  The price <Col N="775" /> he has indicated is reasonable and I am sure it is even more so having regard to the importance of the collection. I note that silver furniture and other such articles which might properly attract the attention of the National Museum have been going up in price very much during the past two years.  More recently all these articles have shown a tendency to share in the general inflation of prices.  Such articles of the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries are limited in supply owing to the fact that the American market is open to them and agents are collecting them for export to the United States.  One is inclined to be anxious as to whether anything will be left of the domestic art to which the Minister has referred, particularly Irish silver which has such a reputation abroad and which is one of the special branches of craftsmanship in which our workers excelled.</P>
      <P>The fact that the original Estimate of £1,000 for the purchase of specimens for the National Museum has now to be increased to £10,500 to enable this transaction to be completed indicates that neither at present nor at any time in my memory have we been overgenerous in the allowance we have made to the National Museum, the National Gallery or the National Library for the purchase of suitable specimens.</P>
      <P>I trust that, where an important collection, an important piece or an important library having special interest for us comes on the market, the particular figure appearing in the annual Estimates will not deter the Minister or the Taoiseach who, I know, is keenly interested in these matters, in seeing that the particular institution is equipped with the necessary funds to make the purchases which they consider necessary and to avail of opportunities which may not recur.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the purchase of this old Irish silver.  I would urge the Minister to take the necessary steps to see that those concerned in the National Gallery and the National Museum with the purchase of works of art will read carefully the advertisements in English papers of <Col N="776" /> auctions such as the Fine Arts Sales at Christies.  Invaluable treasures have been lost to the Irish nation down through the years.  Throughout the year advertisements appear in the <i>London Times</i> and other papers, of auctions of pictures, furniture, manuscripts and silver which would be of the greatest interest and value to us. I am not suggesting the purchase of every single article which may have an association with this country.  Obviously such a practice would be fraught with great difficulty, apart from the financial implications.  I do say that we are not sufficiently wide-awake to the market across the water.  I do not know how these very valuable pictures and manuscripts and other works arrived there, but I do know that they are constantly being disposed of and, so far, I have not seen evidence of any effort to secure these invaluable articles of historic interest for the nation.  I trust that the Minister will do everything in his power to encourage the purchase of such works by the people to whom these matters are entrusted.</P>
      <P>I would also draw the Minister's attention to the fact that the export of masterpieces, not only of furniture or pictures, but of old Irish silver such as is the subject of this Vote, is taking place from this country.  It may be difficult to put an embargo on such exports, but the Minister should see to it that his representatives bid at auctions where these articles are disposed of.  Otherwise, as Deputy Derrig said, the country will shortly be denuded of its treasures.  In my opinion, successive Governments have not been active enough in this respect.  The Estimates for this purpose have been totally inadequate. We have not sufficient appreciation of the arts.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £1,000 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1956, for the Salaries and Expenses of the National Gallery, including a Grant-in-Aid.</P>
      <P>The Supplementary Estimate is presented to rectify a matter relating to the Appropriation Accounts for the financial year 1952-53 when a sum of £1,000 was charged to the Vote for that year.  Contracts were made by the Director of the National Gallery before the 31st March, 1953, with three local printing firms for the supply of postcard reproductions of certain paintings. The matter was raised before the Committee of Public Accounts and the Committee in its report dated 30th March, 1955, on the Appropriation Accounts for the financial year 1952-53, recommended that the Charge be disallowed as the accounts had not matured for payment.  It is purely an adjustment for accounting purposes. The postcards were delivered and paid for but the payment was made in the wrong year.</P>

      <P>I think this has been a very useful and valuable development and I feel sure Deputies have been interested to know of the number of masterpieces in the National Gallery that have been reproduced in postcard form.  I should like to ask the Minister whether these cards are for sale in the ordinary commercial way through the shops.  One notices in the shops at present a lack of cards of Irish manufacture.  Perhaps there is a very good reason for that and it is no harm to remind the public that these postcards can at this time of the year take the place of the ordinary Christmas cards.</P>

      <P>I do not think anybody will have any objection to this Supplementary Estimate.  It is not generally appreciated, I think, that at present we have one of the finest art galleries in the world, for a city the size of Dublin.  The tragedy is that the <Col N="779" /> masterpieces and treasures which we have have not received sufficient publicity. For that reason, even though it is belated, we must welcome this effort on behalf of the gallery to take some steps to publicise its masterpieces by means of postcards.  There are two points which I should like to raise.  Firstly, I would ask the Minister to suggest to the directors of the gallery to provide, as soon as possible, a catalogue of the works of art in their possession.</P>
      <P>It is a strange thing that for a gallery of its size, situated in our capital city, it is not possible for visitors to purchase a catalogue of the works of art contained in it.  I am now asking the Minister to have the matter remedied as soon as possible.  The other matter is the desirability of getting some of the works of art in the gallery sent on loan to country towns.  I do not think it is right that all the masterpieces should be permanently kept in Dublin; they are the property of the people of the whole country, and certainly in off-times in the gallery, when the tourist season is not at its height, some of the masterpieces should be sent on loan to the provincial towns.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to voice a word of congratulation that this development has finally taken place. I remember when this was first considered by Deputy Moylan when he was Minister for Education.  There was a great deal of difficulty in getting the financial side to understand the necessity of such a small investment.  We waited a long time before the first complete set was available and I think, as some Deputies have said, if it were made better known to the public that a complete set of these postcards is now available many people would take the whole collection, not merely for sending but for keeping for themselves.  There are some other works of art that will also be publicised in the same way as these have been; they could be made available in postcard fashion and they would serve to keep the reproduction costs at a low level.</P>

      <P>I should like to support Deputy  Costello on the point that some of these masterpieces in the gallery should be sent down the country on loan to allow rural people to see them.  Such a development would be of great educational benefit to the people living in the country towns, since it is not possible for a lot of people to come to Dublin.  There are one or two other points which I should like to bring up and I hope I am in order in bringing them up here. It does not seem to me that the National College of Art is adequate for the country's needs.  I think it is not as up-to-date&mdash;</P>

      <P>A number of people in and around the City of Dublin who want to hold exhibitions have a certain amount of difficulty in getting a hall. We have here the Hibernian Academy with a certain amount of funds at its disposal.  Would it not be possible for the Minister's Department to interest themselves in trying to make a hall available in the neighbourhood of the city so that people who desire to have an exhibition could get a hall?  I understand that certain people who have tried to hold exhibitions have experienced considerable difficulty in getting such a hall in the city.</P>

      <P>While supporting Deputy Declan Costello in everything he has said, I should like to point out to the Minister that no real attempt <Col N="781" /> is being made to make the people throughout the country art conscious. I think that in his dual capacity the Minister should realise that there is no encouragement whatever given in the majority of schools in the matter of making our people art conscious. Accordingly, it seems to me that this development is putting the cart before the horse.  Art would seem to be the premier subject in only two schools and I think it is about time we faced up to the fact that this country should have in its school curriculum, particularly where it concerns children of over ten years of age, the proviso that art should be a major subject.</P>

      <P>That is a practice which has been found administratively convenient. I am prepared to give the Deputy all the reasons.  If the Deputy's amendment were adopted, it would mean that it would be necessary to nominate individuals by name to act in this particular capacity.  Many of these individuals would not be in this country, but elsewhere, and the problem would arise where the particular individual, having been appointed, might be transferred elsewhere, before we knew anything about it.  He might be on holidays at the particular time his services would be needed, or he might be critically ill.  If he were the only nominee to discharge these consular functions, then the ship concerned would be held up.  Those holding the ship would be put to very considerable expense if the only nominee in a particular place was either ill, on holidays, or transferred suddenly without our getting an opportunity of making a fresh appointment.</P>
      <P>The definition contained in this section is a definition&mdash;which is, as it were, reconfirmed here&mdash;in an adaptation Order made in 1945 which has continued since then.  It is provided for in this Bill as being administratively the most convenient way in which the matter can be dealt with.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In line 40, to delete &ldquo;by the Minister&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is an alternative to the amendment submitted by Deputy Lemass, which is amendment No. 3 to Section 19.  If the Deputy so wishes and the Ceann Comhairle will permit it, we could discuss both amendments together.  An Order made by the Government under Section 19 declaring a particular State to be a reciprocating State would not be subject to annulment by the Oireachtas, as the Bill is drafted.  Deputy Lemass has proposed an amendment to Section 19 to provide that such an Order shall not come into force until it has been approved by resolution of each House of the Oireachtas.  I do not propose to accept that amendment, because of the delay which would necessarily arise in giving effect to such an Order; but in order to travel some distance to meet the Deputy, I suggest instead to that the amendment should provide that such Government Orders shall be-subject to the provisions of this section by deleting the words &ldquo;by the Minister&rdquo; in the first line.  I hope that amendment will meet reasonably the object the Deputy has in view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter which has been not infrequently discussed in the House and it seems to me that something like a standard pattern has emerged.  Where a Bill gives a Minister power to do by regulations a <Col N="788" /> number of detailed things required to make the Bill effective, things which would be too small to be covered by specific sections in the Bill, then, there is a case for the procedure which is contemplated in parts of this Bill, of the Minister making an Order which the Houses of the Oireachtas have the power to annul, without prejudice to anything done under the Order.  But where the Minister or the Government is given power to extend considerably the scope of the legislation, to alter it in a fundamental way, then, it seems to me that the positive consent of the Oireachtas should be required in advance.  The main purpose of this Bill is to provide that an Irish registered ship will be owned only by an Irish national or a company registered here; but a section of the Bill gives the Government power to change that situation completely by giving the right to own an Irish-registered ship to a national of another country, provided they are satisfied that reciprocity has been secured.  Such a very substantial extension of the scope of the Bill should, I think, be positively approved of by the Oireachtas.  Otherwise, this Bill is far less definite than the House was led to believe.</P>
      <P>I do not see that the question of delay is a problem.  Wherever agreements relating to trade or some other matters, agreements relating to income-tax, double income-tax and so forth, are made with Governments of other countries, they have to be brought here for approval.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An agreement which gives the right to nationals of another country to own ships carrying the Irish flag and entitled to the privileges of being on the Irish register is a substantial and important agreement, and it should not, I think, come into operation until the House has been informed of the intention of the Government to make that agreement and asked to approve of it.  The normal provision which gives the Oireachtas power to annul ministerial Orders is all right where only administrative Orders are concerned. Where the legislation gives the Government power to extend in a very substantial way the scope of the legislation, I think there should be positive <Col N="789" /> approval in advance by the Oireachtas, and that has been the normal practice, I submit, in relation to matters of that kind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>If we can take what is happening to-day, so far as reciprocity in that line is concerned, as the normal procedure, the Deputy's amendment would, in fact, fracture that normal procedure as we know it to-day and create a hiatus which, I think, it is desirable to avoid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>How is that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I wish to explain to the Deputy.  Under the existing law, British citizens and companies registered in Britain, and in the British Commonwealth, are entitled to register a ship in Ireland, while Irish citizens and Irish bodies corporate are entitled to register and own ships in England.  The power of making reciprocal State orders, which is conferred by Section 19, has been taken principally to ensure that these rights be continued; in other words, that that mutuality be continued without interruption. It is the Government's intention to make an Order in favour of Britain, immediately on the passing of this Act, so as to avoid any interruption of the rights of those people to register any ship here.  That can be done in the manner suggested in Section 19, subject to the right of Parliament to annul the Order so made.  If it is done in that form, there is no interruption of the present mutual arrangement whereby there is reciprocation between both States; whereas if the Minister concerned is required to get positive approval for an Order of this kind, then in so far as there is any delay between the passing of this Act and the securing of authority from Parliament to endorse a reciprocating Order, to that extent this arrangement&mdash; which has continued and which it is desired to preserve&mdash;will be terminated for the duration of time in which it takes the Minister concerned to get authority from the House for the reciprocating Order.  I do not think Deputy Lemass would quarrel with <Col N="790" /> the procedure which I have contemplated adopting.</P>
      <P>If there are fears as regards any time in the future&mdash;after we have arranged the customary reciprocations &mdash;there might be a case for saying: &ldquo;Well, all right, you can do your existing reciprocations to continue the position for some time, but after a certain period, if you start anything new, you must come to the House and ask for a positive resolution before a reciprocating Order is made effective.&rdquo; I would point out to the Deputy that acceptance of his form of amendment at this stage would terminate an arrangement which has been in existence and which would continue in existence were it not for this Bill, and an arrangement that it is desired to preserve as being mutually advantageous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I will change the basis of my criticism altogether.  The section says that the Government may by Order permit nationals of other countries to have ships on the Irish register.  The implication is that the Government is given a power to do something which it may or may not exercise.  If the Government has already made up its mind that British nationals and British companies are to be entitled to have ships on the Irish register&mdash;and I agree that that should be the position so long as Irish nationals and Irish companies have the corresponding right in Britain&mdash;this Bill should so provide, and the question of the further extension of that privilege to the nationals of other countries, or the termination of that privilege, so far as Britain is concerned, should be a matter for governmental Order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that it is a wrong arrangement to take power to do something which the Government have already decided should be done, and for which they should have made the requisite provision in the Bill.  Nor do I see why there should be any delay, because the Minister can produce the draft of his Order forthwith and submit it to the Dáil, and, so far as I am concerned, I will support the approval of that Order, because nobody wants to <Col N="791" /> terminate the arrangement by which British companies, like the B. and I., keep their ships on the Irish register and sail them under the Irish flag.</P>
    <P>The device of merely taking power to do something when a decision to do it has already been made is, in a sense, misleading, and I think that the Bill should have been framed, if that was the intention, to provide in its terms for the granting of this facility to British nationals and companies, and only for its termination by Government Order, if and when circumstances required its termination&mdash;either internal circumstances or alteration of practice in Britain.  I will go further and repeat the view which I have asserted over many years&mdash;that the power of making Orders which only the Dáil can annul should be confined to administrative details which would be too cumbersome to set forth in the legislation itself.  Where the Government or a Minister takes power substantially to extend the scope of a measure, to do something which is, in effect, legislation, the prior approval of the Oireachtas should be sought.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if the Deputy has looked at the obverse side of what he is now proposing.  The proposal is that we should make a reciprocating Order in respect of the ships of a State with which we have a reciprocal arrangement, and therefore so long as both sides are willing to agree to this mutual recognition of the status of each other, the Order can have the currency of the goodwill that exists. But if you put down here in this Bill a provision whereby you definitely write into legislation that you are recognising this in respect of certain countries at this time, and if at a later stage one of those countries, for one reason or another, decided that it would not continue to recognise our status, fresh legislation would be needed.</P>

      <P>It is not proposed to move this section.  The power of temporary registration was first taken during the emergency, so that a ship on charter might be registered temporarily in Ireland, and thus become entitled to fly the Irish flag.  That power was retained by Section 4 of the <Col N="793" /> Merchant Shipping Act of 1947, and it had originally been intended that the section would be re-enacted in this Bill.  But since the Bill was introduced, the International Law Commission of the United Nations has published a set of provisional articles on the régime of the high seas and it is thought that this particular section might be in conflict with one of the articles issued by this International Law Commission.  In the view of that possibility, therefore, it has been decided, in consultation with the Department of External Affairs, not to proceed with this section since it would possibly be in conflict with a new code of laws which would apply in cases of this kind.</P>

    <P>I move it in the hope of getting some clarification from the Minister as to why he thinks the section as it appears in the Bill covers the contingency that he hopes to cover.  You will notice that Sections 41, 42 and 43 of the Act of 1950, which relate to the determination of compensation under that Act &ldquo;shall apply to compensation under this section.&rdquo; I think that, in an effort to pin point what I regard as a weakness in the section as it stands at the moment, we might usefully refer to sections of the 1940 Act, referred to here in this particular section.  Section 41 of the 1950 Act, stipulates that &ldquo;if any dispute or difference arises between the board and any person entitled to, or claiming to be entitled to compensation under Sections 38, 39 and 40&rdquo;&mdash; and it goes on to make certain provisions.</P>
    <P>It appears to me at any rate that Section 41 of the 1950 Act deals with the determination of disputes in relation to compensation but it specifically refers to compensation under Sections 38, 39 and 40 of the 1950 Act.  There is no doubt at all in my mind as to what the Minister seeks to do under this particular section but I put it to him does he not think there is a certain looseness in the wording of this particular sections as it appears in the Bill and does he not agree, because of the fact that Sections 41 and 42 of the 1950 Act refer specifically to Sections 38, 39 and 40 of that Act that if he leaves the section as it is at the moment there will be very wide room for legal argument.</P>

Sections 38, 39 and 40 of the Transport Act, 1950, relate to the payment of compensation to employees rendered redundant by the amalgamation of C.I.E. and the Grand Canal Company. <Col N="797" /> Sections 41, 42 and 47 of the Act provide for the settlement of disputes by arbitration and Section 4, sub-section (4) applies these sections to compensation payable under the Bill.

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 8, Section 17, sub-section (1), to insert &ldquo;and&rdquo; at the end of paragraph (d), line 8, delete &ldquo;and&rdquo; in paragraph (e), line 9, and delete paragraph (f), line 10.</P>
      <P>This amendment arises from remarks made by Deputy Costello on Section 30 when he urged that the words &ldquo;any other matter which appears to the court to be relevant&rdquo; should be deleted, and that in considering an application, the court should only take into consideration specific matters.  In accepting the suggestion on Section 30, I feel that it is only proper to do the same on Section 17.</P>

      <P>In page 8, Section 18, to add the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2)  A certificate granted by the District Court shall remain in full force until altered or revoked on appeal.</P>

    <P>(3)  Where, in the case of the refusal of a certificate by the District Court, the applicant is the holder of a subsisting licence the licence shall <Col N="799" /> continue in force pending the determination of an appeal against such refusal.</P>
    <P>I undertook on Committee Stage to consider a suggestion put forward by Deputy Moran and supported by other Deputies which is now embodied in the first part of this amendment and which will appear as sub-section (2) of Section 18.  I am also sponsoring a proposal which will appear as sub-section (3) of Section 18.  Having accepted the principle of Deputy Moran's proposal, I feel that I should go the whole way and provide for continuance of a subsisting licence, pending the determination of an appeal against a refusal of the District Court to grant a certificate for a new licence.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 9, Section 23, to delete paragraph (b), lines 20 to 22, inclusive.</P>
      <P>I am asking for the deletion of clause (b) of Section 23 as a result of the general discussion on this and the following section on Committee Stage. As there seemed to be some confusion on that stage as to what type of lottery could be promoted under Section 23 and by what class of person, I may explain that the section is intended to facilitate, without formality of any kind, the types of sweepstakes which are promoted in offices or factories on the days of big races&mdash;the kind of small lottery with tickets costing 1/- or 2/6 and prizes of a couple of pounds.  Such sweeps are only promoted very occasionally and do no harm to anybody.  The fact that the sale of tickets in such sweeps is confined to the members of societies or organisations, or offices or factories, will ensure in itself that such lotteries are not of large proportions.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 9, before Section 24, to insert the following:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="800" /> A lottery shall not be unlawful if&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) it is promoted as part of a dance, concert or other like event and the persons arranging for the holding of the event derive no personal profit from the event or from the lottery, and</P>
    <P>(b) no person may win more than the value of £5 in the lottery.</P>
    <P>In deference to suggestions made on the Committee Stage by a number of Deputies that raffles at dances and such events, where the promoters get no personal profit, should be permitted for prizes higher than the 10/- limit which we had fixed for circuses, carnivals and licensed amusement halls, I am inserting a provision that the dances at which such raffles are held and the raffles themselves must not be promoted for personal profit and I am providing that no person may win more than the value of £5.  I retain doubts as to the wisdom of departing from the general prize limits in order to facilitate dances and concerts for charitable purposes, but it is only a small departure and I am prepared to propose it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that a ham, a goose and a bottle of whiskey are not worth more than £5?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter was raised on the Committee Stage and the Minister, of course, is well aware that at functions like dances, the main&mdash;or very largely the main&mdash;profit made at a number of dances run for charitable purposes is made on lotteries and raffles held at these dances.  It seems to me that there is not much point in limiting the value of the prize to £5. The general scheme of the Bill, of course, is to discourage the lotteries carried on on a large scale throughout the country and the Bill permits lotteries to be carried on for certain purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I understand it, the policy of the Minister is to discourage, except for certain purposes, the holding of lotteries and then to have control of them.  I do not think any great harm will be done to the public and I do not think the public will be adversely <Col N="801" /> affected in any way if lotteries are permitted at dances and other functions, with prize funds of £5.  It is general knowledge that it would be impossible to make such a lottery in any way financially beneficial to the organisers of it, if the value of the prize fund was kept at £5 limit by the Minister.  If we are to have control of lotteries to be held on the evening of functions such as dances or concerts, I do not see any harm coming from increasing the £5 limit to&mdash;I would suggest&mdash;£20.  This would mean in effect that lotteries would, in fact, be a financial success.  I know they certainly will not be a success if this limit of £5 is maintained and I would like the Minister, therefore, to reconsider this limit of £5 and increase the sum to at least £20.  The harm that might be done in doing that will be negligible.  People will not suffer any great damage in holding a lottery at a dance, a carnival, or in a hall in which some function is being held, if the value of the first prize is increased to £20.  I have in mind persons who organise charitable functions and who have to meet very high overheads in They can only cover such overheads in part by the admission fees and, in order to make a profit&mdash;in some cases quite a meagre profit&mdash;they hold raffles.  I do not think such raffles will be a success if this limit of £5 is maintained and I would appeal to the Minister to reconsider that aspect of the situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I interjected before and asked if the Minister could tell us what is the value of a hamper containing a turkey, a goose, a bottle of whiskey and a ham.  At the present moment such a hamper has a certain value, but it could be worth a good deal more very soon.  I agree with what Deputy Costello has said and I suggest this particular type of raffle should not have a limit set in the Bill at all.  The Minister knows that if some charitable organisation or some public-spirited citizen wants to give a prize in a lottery consisting of a cabinet of cutlery, that cabinet of cutlery will obviously be worth much more than £5.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 9, to delete Section 24, lines 26 to 38, inclusive, and substitute:&mdash;</P>
      <P>A lottery shall not be unlawful if&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) either&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i) it is promoted as part of a circus or other travelling show on a day on which under Section 6 gaming is permitted, or</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(ii) it is promoted as part of a carnival, bazaar, sports meeting, local festival, exhibition or other like event on a day on which under Section 7 gaming is permitted and the persons arranging for the holding of the event derive no personal profit from the event or from the lottery, or <Col N="804" /> (iii) it is promoted by the licensee of a licensed amusement hall or funfair as part of the entertainment therein, and</P>
    <P>(b) the tickets are not sold outside the place or premises where the event is in progress, and</P>
    <P>(c) they are sold only on the same day as the draw and announcement of results, and</P>
    <P>(d) the price of each ticket is not more than sixpence, and</P>
    <P>(e) no person may win more than the value of ten shillings in the lottery, and</P>
    <P>(f) neither taking part in nor the result of the lottery entitles the participant to take part in any other lottery or game or otherwise to receive or be eligible to compete for any money or money's worth.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will recollect, there were suggestions on the Committee Stage that, in moving amendment No. 35, dealing with lotteries at circuses, carnivals and licensed amusement halls, I was in some way departing from the general principles of the Bill. I have had the whole matter reexamined and I am satisfied that there has been no departure from general principles.  Perhaps an explanation of this amendment, which I am moving now and which involves the deletion of Section 24, will clear the air.</P>
    <P>The promotion of games of chance in Parts II and III of this Bill is permitted for stakes not exceeding 6d. and prizes not exceeding 10/-; that is under Section 6 for commercial purposes, Section 7 for purposes other than private profit and Section 13 for commercial purposes also.  This amendment will permit the promotion of lotteries under Part IV of the Bill for tickets priced not more than 6d.; and prizes not exceeding 10/- in the identical circumstances of Sections 6, 7 and 13 of Parts II and III of the Bill.</P>
    <P>It was, of course, a defect originally in Section 23 of the Bill that there was no limitation on the price of tickets; and the amendment moved on the Committee Stage sought to give effect to our second thoughts.  Deputies <Col N="805" /> should get out of their heads that there is a departure from the principles enunciated in the Second Reading in now allowing lotteries at circuses and licensed halls.  These lotteries, with stakes not exceeding 6d. and prizes of not more than 10/-, do not differ in any essential from the games of chance for like amounts.  A lottery on the wheel-of-fortune is almost indistinguishable in its results from the collective game of pongo; and there is no good reason why the one should not be allowed as well as the other so long as the stakes are kept so low as not to bring about the quick expenditure of all the players ready cash and the prizes are not so high as to be a compelling inducement to try to &ldquo;get rich quick&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 7:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 10, Section 27, to delete sub-section (1), lines 22 to 24, inclusive, and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  The District Court may grant a licence for the promotion, during such period, not exceeding one year, as shall be specified in the licence, of periodical lotteries in accordance with this section.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment, which was suggested on Committee by Deputy D. Costello, is to permit an appeal in Section 31 from that part of the order of the District Court which limits the period during which a lottery under licence may be promoted. The District Court in Dublin, for instance, might allow different charities licences for differing periods. This amendment, with an appropriate amendment on Section 31, will enable any promoter who feels that the period of his licence is too short to appeal against the decision of the district justice.</P>

      <P>In page 11, line 52, to delete &ldquo;is void&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;shall not be enforceable by action&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We have been getting on so well and meeting the Minister so well that I hoped we would get a spirit of cooperation in return.  Most of the amendments so far have been from the ministerial side.  This is the only amendment from this side of the House.  I do not know whether the Minister appreciates that I am not asking for any change in the law to the extent that gambling debts shall in future become recoverable by court action.  All I am asking is that an opportunity be given to the claimant to be heard in court, even though the decision will remain unenforcable; in other words, a decree will be unenforceable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to consider the position: a bookmaker may have a client who may have an account; in the course of business transactions over a season that client may succeed in winning wagering best running into thousands of pounds.  He then begins to lose and he loses one, or two or three bets in succession.  Despite his having received a substantial amount of money from the bookmaker prior to these losing bets he now refuses to pay the bookmaker.  There is in existence an organisation&mdash;the Conyngham Club &mdash;with certain limited powers.  If the bookmaker reports that defaulting client to the club, the club sends him an invitation to come along and discuss <Col N="808" /> the matter and, if he cares to accept that invitation, the club can adjudicate. If he refuses to go they can adjudicate.  But if he disputes the claim they have no function.  I say that the bookmaker in that case is entitled to go to court and say: &ldquo;Here are my transactions. This man has had a number of bets with me.  He won £20 and I paid him each time.  He has lost two or three bets and did not pay me.  I only want to record that.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is all I am asking for and I cannot understand why the Minister sees difficulty in meeting that.  I know the decree will not be enforceable.  Why do I argue it then?  The bookmakers are a licensed and legalised body of men and they collect taxes by way of portion of their turnover which they contribute to the upkeep of the State. Very restrictive rules are operated against them.  If a bookmaker defaults and he is reported to the Racing Club he is immediately put out of business. He has to apply to court every year to have his premises re-licensed and if I go and say: &ldquo;This man has defaulted; he has not paid me on a bet,&rdquo; his licence is refused and he is out of business.  Surely the dice are loaded sufficiently in favour of the imprudent man, and the bookmaker is entitled to this limited amount of freedom?</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Minister did agree how many of these cases would, in fact, go to court, but I do believe that if the bookmaker were enabled to go to court and say: &ldquo;Here are the transactions of this gentleman&rdquo; the person who is described as the absolute welcher would be very reluctant to continue defaulting and would make some effort to come to terms with the bookmaker or pay by instalments.  I cannot understand the Minister's reluctance in this regard.  If the Minister were to say to me that he was sympathetic or, as he said on the Committee Stage, that what I am saying is common sense, and if he would give an undertaking that this matter would be again examined by the Government with a view to seeing if it could be met in some way, if not under this Bill, then under the Racing Bill proper, I would be prepared to accept that.  But <Col N="809" /> under the circumstance that the years have gone by, it is not fair to let this opportunity pass without making a fight for justice for these people because they are suffering a perpetuation of injustice.</P>
    <P>At this stage I ask the Minister, can he argue against it?  It is no use saying: &ldquo;I am not doing it.&rdquo;  I do not wish to introduce a discordant note into the discussion on this Bill.  It has been very pleasant up to now.  I do not want to say that this is something on which I am going to insist but I would ask the Minister for Finance, or perhaps the Taoiseach will say, if there is anything amoral in what I am asking? Is there anything unjust?  Let us do something for these people who are a large section of the community, who give very good employment to a great many people, who are big taxpayers and ratepayers and who are also tax gatherers.</P>

      <P>I do not think that the Minister or the Government should accept this amendment under any circumstances. I will give you an example of what can happen in rural Ireland, apart altogether from the betting end of it.  We have the case of people in business in rural areas.  You have the type who can induce a man to stay in a public house day after day, week after week, year after year, giving him drink &ldquo;on the nod&rdquo;.  It ends up with the publican owning that man's entire farm of land because the man has been living most of his life in the form of a dream.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>The same thing applies to the licensed bookmaker. You can have the individual who is allowed full scope by the bookmaker and his weaknesses are exploited by perhaps an unscrupulous bookmaker. Then the position is that the bookmaker, having allowed this man to get into debt for a huge sum, can go to court and force him to sell his property or his farm.  That would be the logical conclusion to the Deputy's amendment and I think the scale must always be weighted in favour of the publican.  I <Col N="810" /> think the solution to the Deputy's problem is to eliminate as far as possible this system of credit betting.  If a man wants to make a bet let him take his money to the bookmaker's office and bet with it.  Then the problem Deputy Briscoe has mentioned will not arise.</P>

      <P>I regret I am unable to accept the amendment proposed by Deputy Briscoe.  I gave him a promise that I would have the matter very sympathetically examined and I did so.  For Deputy Briscoe's information, let me say that the Turf Board have a commission and they deal with some of the grievances the Deputy has pointed out.  If I were to accept a change in the law, I am advised it would not alone affect bookmakers and racing but it would affect other people, including possibly those engaged in stock and share transactions. I do not intend to accept the amendment and propose to let the law remain as it is for the time being.  I cannot give any promise as to what another Minister may do.  As I said on the Second Reading, I agree with what Deputy Briscoe has said on many points, but there is this difficulty. If we were to use the courts we know that, having regard to public opinion, the children of some person, rather than have their father's name brought into court, might put themselves to great inconvenience to settle the matter with the bookmaker out of court.  I do not think anybody should be put in that position.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I be permitted to add just a few remarks to what the Minister has said?  I recognise that there are two points of view, possibly more than two points of view, on this matter.  There is a lot to be said for enabling betting contracts or engagements, whatever you call them, to be enforced in law.  Powerful arguments can be raised for that point of view. Equally powerful arguments can be raised for the point of view enshrined in this section.  My own view, perhaps from knowledge of occurrences in court and otherwise, tends conservatively to leaving the law as it has been for the last 100 years.  But it is <Col N="811" /> reinforced by other considerations to which perhaps Deputy Briscoe has not adverted.  While I am drawing attention to these other considerations, I am sure neither Deputy Briscoe nor any other Deputy will take me as casting any aspersion on bookmakers, individually or collectively, who are earning their living the same as any one of us is doing in our particular advocations.</P>
      <P>Deputy Briscoe has said that what is required is not to enforce the contract but to allow the matter to be brought by a bookmaker against a defaulting client and have him exposed in court, the bookmaker paying the cost of that proceeding.  He is not asking that this engagement should be enforceable in court but that the bookmaker should be entitled to go at his own expense and expose a particular defaulting client.</P>
      <P>That could be used in the manner of blackmail, which may be too strong a word.  May I give an example of the injustice that might be perpetrated? Take the case of a man who might be in a public position and who has a wife who might be engaged in betting transactions and a bookmaker threatens to bring an action for the recovery of her debts.  That would put that man in a very invidous and serious position.  I think it would be an abuse of the processes of our courts to allow that to happen.  So far as I know, the practice of our courts still permits that machinery to be brought into action and it will still permit it after this Bill has been passed.</P>
      <P>The practice in England is different. I do not think that we should permit such a practice to be brought into operation here.  I think it would be wrong to enable, by positive action of this House, that procedure to take place and legalise the recovery of money not merely on racing transactions but on all sorts of gaming transactions.  It frequently has been known that people will bet on all sorts of things such as cockroaches racing or two flies going up a wall.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>He paid up all right, but it would be deplorable if he had had to be sued.  This is not the last Gaming Bill to come to this House.  The bookmakers have several methods of pressure to deal with the problem they have.  The first method is one that rests in their own hands&mdash; they should not give unlimited credit. If they had the power to bring a defaulting client to court, they might not be so keen or so astute as they are at present as to the investigation of the creditworthiness of a client.  This is a matter that should be left entirely in their own hands.  Their second method of dealing with the problem is the one which they use at present, that is, black-listing amongst themselves, and the third is the one to which the Minister has referred, the machinery set up by the Racing Board, which I understand is operating pretty well. With all these courses open to them and in the knowledge that this is not the last Gaming Bill to come before the House, and also in the knowledge that if, when it has been in operation for some time, there is a question of an injustice, the present Minister or some future Minister will approach the matter with sympathy, I think the matter should rest as it is.</P>

Would the Minister say that he will receive a deputation representing the bookmakers with a view to getting the details of what they have in mind, so that at some future date the question of reinstating the Conyngham Club may be considered?

He can get another man to put on his bet with another bookmaker.  That is the type of case I am referring to.

    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Everett) James Everett">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Everett)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The object of the Bill is to continue the present Rent Acts in operation for a further period of one <Col N="818" /> year pending the outcome of the Government's review of the whole problem. As Deputies will recall, the Rent Restrictions Act of 1946, which was a consolidating Act, was to have expired at the end of 1950 but in October of that year the Government appointed a commission under Judge Conroy's chairmanship to investigate the working of the Act and to make recommendations. The commission reported in June, 1952, and recommended that the existing controls be continued, with certain increases to landlords who are liable for repairs, and that control be extended to dwellings built since 1941 or to be built hereafter and it also recommended the extension of control to furnished lettings.  There were a number of other recommendations, some of which are technical but no less important for that.</P>
      <P>When the present Government took office the various interested Departments had not concluded their examination of the report but since then the principal recommendations, together with departmental observations thereon, have been submitted to the Government which have been considering what is best to be done for the common good.  It is over 40 years since the first of the rent restriction measures was passed and in the meantime a host of new and complicated legal relationships have come into existence.  This is one of the relevant considerations.  There are, of course, other considerations which have to be taken into account.  Since 1952, when the Conroy Report was presented, there has been an improvement in the housing situation and in living standards. On the other hand, very few houses have been built for letting by private enterprise though a large number have been built for tenant purchasers, and there has been a high rate of building under the Housing of the Working Classes Act and Labourers Acts.  There is, nevertheless, a housing shortage, particularly in Dublin and Cork, which has yet to be overcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All of these aspects are receiving consideration but it will be some time before the Government are in a position to take final decisions.  Meanwhile, it is necessary to continue the <Col N="819" /> Acts in force for a further period. Every effort will be made to have the Government's legislative proposals communicated to the House during 1956.  In conclusion, I would like to take this opportunity of saying that authority has been given for the preparation of a Bill on the general lines of the second report of the Conroy Commission, that is to say, the Report on Reversionary Leases under the Landlord and Tenant Acts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know how the Minister kept a straight face while reading out his brief.  Three years ago, I was told, when I said amending legislation might take 12 months, that six months should be ample.  At that time, I could have made a far better case than the Minister now does because the Report of the Conroy Commission had only been received.  This Government has been 18 months in office and it must be three years since the Conroy Report was submitted.  I should have thought that that would be sufficient time in which to introduce a Bill.  I do not propose to put the matter to a division, but I think that we should have something more definite from the Minister; we should at least be told by the Minister whether the Bill has been sent for drafting and that the Government has come to a decision which would enable us to expect the Bill would be before the House inside 12 months.</P>
      <P>I remember telling the Minister for Justice in the first Coalition that he knew fairly well he would be unable to introduce such a Bill because he might not be in office long enough.  It just happened that he was not, but I was just taking a shot.  Let us not be making prophecies, because we do not know what may happen, but I would like to know if we can expect to have a permanent measure before this time 12 months.  I do not want to press the Minister too hard because I, naturally enough, know the difficulties as well as anybody else.  If the Minister is able to say to us that we may expect a Bill within the next 12 months, I shall not put this to a division.  All I want is to have something definite.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to raise a point which has arisen as a result of a fairly recent decision of the High Court on the question of lawful additions.  This decision is going to have considerable repercussions on the rights of tenants and I want to protect certain tenants who may be served with notices in respect of lawful additions and who at present are unprotected and who cannot afford to wait until an amending Act is brought in. As Deputies are aware, the scheme of the Act as it stands at present is that, when the basic rent of the premises has been determined either by the courts or by arbitration agreement, the landlord is entitled to certain lawful additions which in certain cases are automatic on the serving of notice.</P>
      <P>The lawful additions are made under either Section 11 (2) (g) of the Act or Section 17 (2) (e) in the case of controlled 1923 Act premises or controlled non-1923 Act premises.  At the moment, if a tenant is served with a notice increasing his rent over and above what he is charged by a suggested increase by the landlord under a notice under the sections to which I have referred, the tenant's rights are then determined under Section 20 of the Act.  If the landlord serves on the tenant a notice increasing his rent to a figure to which the landlord claims he is entitled because of exceptional repairs he has carried out, the tenant's rights under the Act as it stands are confined to his rights under Section 20.  Section 20 of the Act gives the tenant the right to apply to the court to set aside this notice and the section goes on in sub-section (5):&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The court may, on the application of the tenant, if satisfied that the expenditure (in so far as it is applicable <Col N="821" /> to any of the said matters) in respect of which the notice was served was not incurred or was unnecessary in whole or in part, disallow or reduce the increase accordingly.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In other words, the tenant is entitled to come into the court and say only two things: either that the expenditure was not incurred at all&mdash;in other words, that the notice was fraudulent &mdash;or that it was unnecessary, in whole or in part.  It does happen, and in fact has happened, that landlords serve notice under Section 11 (2) (g) or Section 17 (2) (e) and ask the tenant to pay an increase in his rent for what the landlord says are exceptional repairs and the tenant's answer to these notices is that the expenditure was incurred not for exceptional repairs but in respect of repairs which the landlord should have carried out in any event under his contractual or statutory obligation to repair the premises.  Landlords, who should repair premises and who do not, have served these notices and get a lawful addition for expenditure which they should have incurred under their ordinary repairing covenant.  The tenant should be entitled to make that case when he comes into the court.</P>
    <P>He should be entitled to come into the court and say either that the expenditure was not incurred, or that it was unnecessary either in whole or in part or&mdash;and this is where I should like the 1946 Act amended&mdash;that the expenditure was incurred in accordance with the contractual or statutory obligation on the landlord's part.  I should like the Act amended in order to entitle the tenant to make this case when he applies to the court under Section 20.  The tenant is restricted at the moment under Section 20; he may bring only two matters before the court.  I do not want in any way to take away the landlord's rights to get an increase in his rent when he has <i>bona fide</i> carried out repairs which are to the benefit of the tenant and the building.  But that is how I understand the scheme of the Act.  If he carries out exceptional repairs, he is entitled to increase his rent by 15, 8 or 6 per cent., as the case may be.  What <Col N="822" /> I do want to secure is that the tenant, when he is faced with a notice, is not restricted when he applies to the courts.</P>
    <P>I should like to see the 1946 Act amended, so that, when a tenant is served with notice under the Act, he will be entitled to apply to the court for a decision by the court whether the expenditure was, in fact, expenditure which the landlord should have incurred in any event.  I know there are many cases of landlords who incurred large expenditure and who should be entitled, in view of the scheme of the Rent Act at the moment, to some return for it when that expenditure is exceptional expenditure for repairs which accrue to the benefit of the tenant as well as the landlord.  I think it should be open to the tenant to let the court determine whether, in fact, the expenditure was excessive, or whether it was expenditure the landlord should have incurred in any event under his ordinary contractual or statutory obligation to repair.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister not to take all stages of this Bill to-day in order to permit me to put down an amendment on this point, and I would ask him to consider favourably the amendment I should like to put down.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this short Bill is to remove a doubt which has arisen in the interpretation of the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945.  It is provided in that Act that the cost of construction work on arterial drainage schemes carried out by the Commissioners of Public Works shall be a Stage charge and that, on completion, the works shall be maintained at the expense of the county council or county councils concerned.  The commissioners are responsible under the Act for both construction work and subsequent maintenance work, and provision is made in Section 37 for repayment to them annually, by the appropriate county councils, of the amounts expended from year to year on maintenance. Efficient and economical maintenance of the large-scale catchment drainage schemes will require the employment of mechanical plant (excavators, vehicles, etc.) and of considerable quantities of small tools and supplies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the purposes of their drainage programme generally the commissioners have a large pool of plant, machines, vehicles, tools and other equipment based at their central engineering workshop from which issues are made as required to the <Col N="824" /> various works in progress.  The obvious and practical course is to draw on these resources for the purpose of the maintenance of drainage works, in the same way as for drainage construction works.  To arrive at the full cost of works the normal practice is to add, to the direct outlay, charges reflecting the value of the services rendered&mdash;the charge for tools and supplies being their recorded value and for machinery a weekly rate computed by reference to the cost of purchasing, servicing and overhauling the item concerned and to its estimated working life.</P>
    <P>A local depot, combining the functions of an office and a store, will be needed for the maintenance of each completed drainage scheme, and in measuring the cost of maintenance for each year account must be taken of the annual value of the premises made available.</P>
    <P>On considering sub-section (3) of Section 37 of the 1945 Act a doubt arose whether power was in fact given to the commissioners to include, in their statutory demands on county councils for recovery of the cost of maintenance, sums representing the value of the services rendered by engineering plant and machinery, stores or premises provided by the commissioners.  The purpose of the present Bill is to remove the legal doubt that has arisen in that regard.</P>
    <P>As Section 37 at present stands, the commissioners could buy specifically for the maintenance of each drainage scheme every item of plant, equipment or supplies required for that purpose and recover such outlay from the county council concerned.  The adoption of such a course would result in inordinately heavy charges against the county councils, particularly in the first year of maintenance when the heavy initial cost of plant would have to be recovered, and in an unequal distribution of the cost of maintenance as between one year and another.  The Bill enables the commissioners to adopt the obvious and practical course of drawing on the available pool of plant and machinery, etc.</P>
    <P>The main provisions of the Bill are in Section 2.  Paragraph (a1) of sub-section (1) of Section 2 covers the <Col N="825" /> question of machinery and engineering equipment and supplies and paragraph (a2) deals with the matter of premises.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Sweetman) Gerard Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Sweetman)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  One of the objects of the Statutory Instruments Act, 1947, is to ensure that reasonable publicity is given to the promulgation of statutory instruments.  For this purpose Section 3 of the Act lays down certain requirements which apply to every statutory instrument not excluded or exempted from the provisions of the Act.  These requirements may be summarised as follows:&mdash; (i) each statutory instrument must be printed under the superintendence of the Stationery Office; (ii) as soon as a statutory instrument is printed notice of its being made and of the place where copies may be obtained must be published in the <i>Irish Oifigiúil,</i> and (iii) as from the date of publication of the notice in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> copies of the instrument must be kept and made available at the place specified in the notice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the outset, difficulty has been experienced in securing prompt gazetting of statutory instruments in the <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i> This difficulty arises from the provisions of Section 3 of the 1947 Act which, as already stated, prescribed that a statutory instrument must be printed before it can be gazetted.  Despite the best endeavours of the Stationery Office delays frequently occur between the time an instrument is made and the time that printed copies of it are available. In consequence, the public may be without formal notice of the making of a statutory instrument for several <Col N="826" /> weeks.  Such a delay is undesirable and has been the subject of adverse comment by the Seanad Select Committee on Statutory Instruments.</P>
    <P>A further defect in the existing procedure is to be found in the operation of sub-section (4) of Section 3 of the 1947 Act which prescribes that a statutory instrument having printed on it the statement that&mdash;in the words of the Act&mdash;&ldquo;Notice of the making of the said statutory instrument was published in a particular issue of the <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> shall in any proceedings be <i>prima facie</i> evidence that such notice was published in that issue of the <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i>&rdquo;  This was intended to simplify proof of the gazetting of an instrument.  However, by reason of the order of procedure prescribed in the Act it is quite impossible to ensure that the first printed copies of a statutory instrument contain a statement about the date of gazetting, since printed copies of the instrument must be available before gazetting can be arranged.  This defect inconveniences not alone the State but also private individuals, who in seeking the enforcement of rights conferred by statutory instruments, may be put on proof of the gazetting of such instruments.</P>
    <P>The Bill deals with these defects by permitting gazetting to be effected in advance of printing.  Pending the production of prints, neostyled copies of statutory instruments will be made available to the public.  The Bill extends also the list of institutions to which copies of statutory instruments are required to be furnished, by including the King's Inns Library.  This merely adds to the statutory obligation that was enshrined in the original Act, and it merely puts into legislation a practice that was in operation, since the Act was passed, of giving the King's Inns Library a copy of each statute.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture (Mr. O. Flanagan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  In accordance with the provisions of the Agricultural Produce (Eggs) Act, 1939, every egg and every packet of eggs consigned from a registered egg wholesaler's premises must be marked with the marks prescribed by the regulations made under that Act. The marks at present prescribed for the shells of fresh eggs are the country of origin mark and code mark.  The marks prescribed for packages containing eggs consigned for export are the nationality mark, that is, the words &ldquo;Produce of the Republic of Ireland&rdquo;; the transport mark&mdash;&ldquo;Eggs&mdash;This Side Up&rdquo;; the exporter's identification number, the quantity mark and the date of export mark.  Each of these marks serves a useful purpose from the point of view of the efficient marketing of our eggs and has not, I am satisfied, militated in the past against the sale of our eggs abroad. Recently, however, inquiries for unstamped eggs have been received by some of our exporters from countries in which we have been trying to find an outlet for our surplus poultry products, while importers in some of our markets on the Continent have stated that Irish eggs would be more readily saleable on those markets if the date of export mark did not appear on the boxes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the intense competition which our eggs are meeting on the export markets, it seems to me essential that any obstacles which hinder, even in the slightest degree, the sale of our eggs on those markets should, where possible, be removed.  The Bill before the House is intended to do that.  I might add that it is not my intention to grant exemptions automatically; every application will be carefully examined and exemption will be <Col N="829" /> granted only where I am satisfied that that course is in the best interests of our egg and poultry industry and that the exporter is complying with the requirements of the importing country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that this Bill must be necessary, as otherwise the Minister would not have introduced it, but I should like to have some points clarified before I agree to giving him this Bill.  What provision is going to be made down the country, for instance, regarding the marking of eggs?  The Parliamentary Secretary has stated that inquiries have been made to exporters here by people abroad who are looking for our eggs, stating that, unless they get these eggs unstamped, they will not be able to take them.  But there is another point to be taken into consideration.  Before ever they arrive at the wholesalers in Dublin, they are produced in the country.  What guarantee have the exporters that these are fresh eggs? Is it not going to have a damaging effect on our eggs if eggs are sent out of the country which may be stale, because there is no mark on them? When eggs are collected in the country, they may be three, four, five or six days old.  They will be held possibly for 48 hours in the collector's establishment and then sent to Dublin, and they may be a week, ten days or a fortnight old before they go out.  There is no guarantee that they will not be. The only guarantee we have at the moment that eggs are fresh is the fact that they are marked and stamped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill may do greater damage unless you have a specific order, a specific supply or from a specific person or persons; otherwise, if you leave it as a general supply all over the country, you may do irreparable damage to egg exports, simply for the reason that there is no guarantee of the age of the eggs by the time they reach Dublin and the exporter can only take the supplier's word that these are fresh eggs which are produced within a certain period.  I should like to have greater clarification of that point and an explanation from the Parliamentary Secretary about the precautions to be taken regarding the quality and freshness of the eggs going out, the precautions <Col N="830" /> that will be taken to preserve the standard and the reputation of our eggs in foreign markets.  That reputation has been gained because the people purchasing beyond know exactly that every precaution has been taken to ensure that they are of the highest quality.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill because I believe it will assist us in developing an export trade which otherwise would not be available to us. The purpose of this Bill is to enable us to sell eggs to certain States just as fresh as the eggs which are stamped and which we are selling to the others who will take them.  I feel that, in the normal course of trade, the onus will be on the exporters, in their own business interests, to ensure that the eggs will be reasonably fresh.  In these days of quick travel, we can rest assured that eggs will reach the retail counter at very great distances from here within a very reasonable time.  I agree with Deputy Walsh when he says that the fact that these eggs are not going to be stamped&mdash;that that will not be insisted on for eggs being exported to these particular countries&mdash;is going to leave a position where we will not be certain regarding the condition of the eggs leaving the country.  However, I feel that the removal of these particular regulations, if it is designed to improve the position for the poultry trade in this country, will obtain for our egg producers markets which they cannot have at the moment, but which they could have, if the eggs were not stamped.  I feel that the wider field for the sale of eggs will bring great advantages to the poultry keepers in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think it is right for us to assume that the people who will be engaged in this egg export business will take the risk of allowing eggs to lie for a long time and deteriorate before they get into the hands of the retailers in these other countries.  It would be contrary to their own interests to allow a situation like that to arise, because they would lose the trade immediately.  Deputy Walsh has mentioned his desire that our good name in other countries should be <Col N="831" /> maintained, and he has pointed out that the stamping of eggs was one way of doing the best we could to ensure that the good name of our poultry products in other countries should be preserved. I feel that we should not be fearful of difficulties that would arise if we exported to certain other countries, because we know at the moment that we could not export the eggs at the present time to certain countries, if they were stamped.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to give our exporters the chance of sending the eggs to these countries.  We have countries to which our eggs can be exported when they are stamped, but I feel that this Bill is necessary in the national interest and to bring a measure of prosperity to poultry exporters. For instance, at certain times of the year, eggs are plentiful in this country, and at that time, the eggs are seeking a market at a reasonable price. I remember that only a few months ago producers were complaining that they were getting a very bad price for their eggs, somewhere around 2/- a dozen.  Now that they are scarce and when the producers have not got the eggs, they are being offered 8/- a dozen for any eggs that can be found.  The opening of a market in other countries may give the producers an economic price for their eggs at a time of the year when they are obliged to accept uneconomic prices in the ordinary way. Producers were obliged to accept uneconomic prices earlier this year when eggs were plentiful.  I feel that this Bill will widen the marketing field for our eggs and that the producers will be given an opportunity to get a better price at the plentiful times.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O. Flanagan Mr. O. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure Deputy Walsh and other Deputies that every possible precaution has been and will be taken to ensure that, in so far as the export of our eggs is concerned, only the very best and highest quality will be exported.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Walsh has asked that points raised by him should be given a little more clarification.  I would like to make it clear that every wholesaler must test and mark all eggs and all this Bill asks for is for power to exempt <Col N="832" /> from marking.  That is the only power that is asked for in the Bill and we are asking for that power because we feel from inquiries that have recently been made of our exporters from countries in which we have been trying to find an outlet for our poultry products, that there are certain possibilities. It has been stated by people on the Continent that Irish eggs would be more readily saleable if the date of export mark did not appear on the boxes.  That is the main purpose of this Bill&mdash;to further the sale of our eggs on such markets.</P>
    <P>It is only right that the House should also be made aware of the fact that each exporter requiring such a concession must make application for exemption in the case of each export. In view of that, there cannot be any doubt whatever that the merits of each application will be very fully considered by the Department.  It is also well to note that every egg intended for export must be tested within 48 hours of acquisition.  Such eggs are examined by the inspectors of the Department at the ports and wholesalers who disobey the law in this respect will lose their registration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Everett)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The purpose of this Bill, which had its origin with the late Mr. Justice Casey when he was Attorney-General, is to consolidate with amendments what are known as the Fatal Accidents Acts.  These Acts are three in number and were enacted in 1846, 1864 and 1908.  At the time the original Act&mdash; generally called Lord Campbell's Act &mdash;was framed over a century ago, the spread of railway communications had caused a great increase in the number of fatal accidents.  Prior to 1846, the law was that &ldquo;in a civil court the death of a human being could not be complained of as an injury&rdquo;, and no person had a legally protected interest in the life of another.  To this law there has been an exception in this country which resulted from a provision in the Grand Jury Act, 1836, providing for compensation to be awarded by the old County Court to the personal representative of a deceased killed for giving information or evidence against a person or persons charged with any offence against the public peace, the amount awarded to be raised from local rates.  This provision, which applied also in the case of the death of a magistrate or a peace officer, was and continues to be peculiar to Ireland.  Under the law in England and Ireland since Lord Campbell's Act of 1846, the members of the family of a deceased person may, through the personal representative or by themselves, bring an action against the wrongdoer who by his tortious act has caused the death of the deceased, irrespective of the circumstances of the death.</P>
      <P>The Bill is, under Section 1, designed to come into operation on the 1st January next and the proposed legislation will not apply in relation to any death before that date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill defines dependents <Col N="834" /> as the members of the family who suffer loss.  It is proposed to increase these members by adding in the brothers and sisters of the deceased and the half-brothers and half-sisters, persons not covered in the existing legislation.  In doing this we are following the precedent of the Workmen's Compensation Act, 1934, the Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1936, and the Garda Síochána (Compensation) Act, 1941.  In addition to what may be called the ordinary members of a family, the section covers adopted persons and illegitimate persons.  The provision concerning adopted persons is already part of the law by reason of the Adoption Act, 1952, but the provision as to illegitimate persons is new.</P>
    <P>A specific provision for such persons will be found in that portion of the Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1936, which deals with fatal air accidents and also in the Workmen's Compensation Act, 1934.  The question of whether it is desirable further to extend the category of dependents who may succeed in an ordinary fatal accident action has received a careful and detailed examination, but, if Deputies are of opinion that the section in the Bill should be amended, the Government are quite willing to examine any specific proposals made in this debate or on Committee.  For instance, we have been considering a provision to cover persons who were in the position of a parent to the deceased and persons to whom the deceased stood in the position of a parent.</P>
    <P>We have also had in mind the question of aged relatives wholly or mainly dependent on the deceased. One of the dangers&mdash;and it is a very real one&mdash;of increasing the dependents is that insurance companies could be tempted to increase accident premiums to cover their enlarged liability. Another danger is that juries might tend in some cases to decide to award roughly the same total amount irrespective of the fact that additional dependents, not strictly members of the family, were covered.  The result could then well be to cut down the sums which would go to the major sufferers, namely the wife and children. Dependents are covered by the <Col N="835" /> Workmen's Compensation Act, 1934, but the provision is rather wide, and includes persons who are not relatives and who should not, we think, be covered in the present Bill.</P>
    <P>Apart from this, the total liability under the 1934 Act, as amended, is specifically limited in amount to £1,800.  Brothers and sisters were not included when the Fatal Accidents Acts were amended in Britain in 1934 and in the Six Counties in 1937. Brothers and sisters, persons in the position of a parent to the deceased and persons to whom the deceased stood in the position of a parent are covered in some of the provinces of Canada. Further, under a Superannuation Warrant of 1946 in this country, where a civil servant is killed in the course of his duties children to whom the deceased stood in the position of a parent are amongst those entitled to allowances from the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with this matter of dependents at some length, first of all, in order to give Deputies an idea of the background of Section 2, and, secondly, because I want to point out that a statement which recently appeared in the Press that we fell into the error of merely copying the definition of &ldquo;member of a family&rdquo; or dependent from the Workmen's Compensation Act, 1934, is not accurate.  In fact, the section follows rather the Air Act of 1936 with the addition of adopted persons.  The Government did not rush into this matter and take any convenient definition they found.  We examined all the legislation dealing with fatal cases in this country, going back even to the Grand Jury Act of 1836, we looked at the law in Britain and the Six Counties, and we went abroad as far as Canada.  We were aware that, when the matter was considered by a distinguished committee across the water, it was recommended that adopted persons and illegitimate persons only should be added and that there was no recommendation about brothers and sisters and other dependents.</P>
    <P>Before I leave Section 2 I might as well say that, though we think that <Col N="836" /> the limitation in the section to close relatives may not theoretically be ideal, it is, in our view, practically sound as, otherwise, it might be difficult to draw the line.  Still, if the section can be improved without bringing in too many people, we are willing to improve it and will give careful consideration to any suggestion.  The difficulty is to find a suitable draft which will make for a definite and clear limitation.</P>
    <P>Section 3 re-enacts the existing law which makes a tortfeasor who causes death liable in damages.  Sub-section (4) extends the period of limitation from one year to three years.  We think one year is too short.</P>
    <P>Section 4 is the damages section. Here again we gave much thought to the question of improving the existing provision in the 1846 Act, as many people consider that the awards in fatal cases are too small.  We tried another definition of damages, but eventually abandoned it, because we felt it might only lead to a lot of litigation to determine what it actually meant in specific cases and also because we were convinced that in the final result it would place the dependents in no better position.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (1) of the section follows the 1846 Act and the proposal is that damages will continue to be proportioned to the injury resulting from the death.  The law is that damages are to be such as will represent the pecuniary loss sustained by the relatives, that is to say, the actual and probable loss estimated in money, as far as such things can be estimated in money.  Sentimental damages are not awarded.  Nothing is given for bereavement or pain and suffering or for loss of the society of the deceased.  As a learned judge put the matter some years ago: &ldquo;It is a hard matter of pounds, shillings and pence, subject to the element of reasonable future probabilities.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It has been argued that this should not be so, but it is impractical to introduce the speculation which would be inherent in putting in money terms the sentimental loss of a relative, and we doubt if it should be attempted.  Be <Col N="837" /> all this as it may, there is a strong and reasonable case made by those who say that awards should be bigger under the existing law.  This can only be achieved, however, if in the long run the courts are persuaded to be more liberal in their awards.  Such persuasion is for the members of the legal profession and there is nothing practical the Legislature can do to help.</P>
    <P>The Bill, although it follows the existing definition of damages will, however, mean that greater amounts may in future be awarded.  Under sub-section (2) of Section 4, damages may be awarded for expenses such as funeral and medical expenses actually incurred.</P>
    <P>Section 5 goes further still by providing that in assessing damages account shall not be taken of any pension, gratuity or other like benefit payable under statute or otherwise in consequence of the death of the deceased. Insurance payable on the death is also not to be taken into account but this has been the law since 1908.  The provision as to pensions and gratuities is new and should be a very great benefit to the relatives of a deceased who are entitled to pensions and gratuities consequent on his death.</P>
    <P>At present, if a person is killed by the negligence of another and the widow and children become entitled to a gratuity or pension, other than a social welfare benefit, the payments to which they are entitled must be taken into account in assessing damages, and this as far as we know is the law in other countries.  It is certainly the law in England and in the Six Counties and it is the law in Canada.  Pensions and allowances payable under the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Acts, 1935 to 1952, benefits to widows and orphans under the Social Welfare Act, 1952, and children's allowances under the Children's Allowances Acts, 1944 to 1952, are not taken into account in assessing damages, but these constitute fairly small sums when compared with the amount awarded as damages.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes in addition that no amounts, except, of course, workmen's <Col N="838" /> compensation, payable under statute or otherwise on the death are to be taken into account in assessing damages.  This means that the relatives of a deceased person will be entitled to the pension and gratuity payable as a result of the death as well as full damages calculated as if no pension or gratuity were payable.  Statutory pensions and gratuities are payable under the Superannuation Acts, 1834 to 1954, the Local Government (Superannuation) Act, 1948, the Mental Treatment Act, 1945, the Police Forces Amalgamation Act, 1925, the Army Pensions Acts, 1923 to 1953, the Defence Forces (Pensions) Acts, 1932 to 1949, and the Ministers and Parliamentary Offices Acts, 1938 to 1952.</P>
    <P>Companies like the E.S.B. have pension schemes for the widows and children of their officers and payments under these schemes will be excluded in calculating damages, and so also will similar payments made by an ordinary public or private company.</P>
    <P>A simple example will illustrate the effect of the provision.  If a serving civil servant dies, his wife is entitled to a gratuity equal to a year's salary. Suppose that the gratuity comes to £500 and that, in addition, the widow has a good cause of action by reason of the fact that her husband's death is caused by the negligent act of another person.  In assessing damages under the existing legislation, the court must take into account the fact that the widow is entitled to £500 and the damages will be reduced accordingly, so that where, if there was no question of a gratuity, she would have been awarded £2,000, she will as the widow of the civil servant get only £1,500.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill, she will be entitled to the full award of £2,000 from the court and she will get the £500 gratuity as well from the Minister for Finance.  Thus she will be £500 better off.  By the way, I might mention that there is another side to a case like this.  It is possible to prevent the widow reaping the benefit of the proposal in the Bill by a provision in the pension legislation that the gratuity is to be subject to deduction on account of compensation received in respect of the death.  There were provisions to <Col N="839" /> this effect in the Garda Síochána Pensions Orders, but they were repealed in the 1955 Order.</P>
    <P>In coming to the conclusion that all gratuities and pensions payable in the ordinary way on death should not be taken into account in computing fatal injury damages, the Government acted on the principle that these gratuities and pensions are in fact portion of the emoluments of the deceased.  In other words, he has earned them and in calculating his pay it is to be presumed that account is taken of the fact that on his death his widow and children will be entitled to a gratuity or pension. In some cases he will have contributed towards the benefits payable to his family.</P>
    <P>Section 6 of the Bill provides for the survival of causes of action against the estate of a deceased tortfeasor and is on the lines of Section 171 of the Road Traffic Act, 1933, which deals with proceedings against the estate of a deceased person who has been liable for the negligent driving or management of a mechanically propelled vehicle.</P>
    <P>Section 7 deals with death caused by the negligent driving of a State-owned vehicle and is also taken from the 1933 Road Traffic Act.</P>
    <P>Section 8 adapts any references in existing legislation to the Fatal Accidents Acts.</P>
    <P>Section 9 is the repeals section and Section 10 is the Short Title section.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill to the House. It contains a valuable piece of consolidation and in addition makes desirable amendments in the existing legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>This is essentially a consolidation Bill and, in principle, I do not see any objection to it.  I would suggest, however, that the approach in framing it has been conditioned almost too much by previous measures.  The Minister has used the word &ldquo;consolidation&rdquo;.  It is consolidation with improvement, but whether it might not have been better to move for a radical amendment, leaving a <Col N="840" /> simpler situation to be dealt with by the courts, is another question.</P>
      <P>If one man injured another, the injured party had a right at common law to take an action.  If the injured party was killed, that right of action died with him.  That situation led to difficulties in the case of those Acts which are now being repealed, Acts which were designed to redress or overcome that situation.  Instead of doing the simple thing, namely, putting in any other injured person, injured indirectly from the tort which killed the person directly injured, and enabling that person to sue as if he were directly injured, a very hedged-in and artificial scheme was introduced in the 1946 Act. Only certain people, limited as a class rather than limited in relation to actual damage, were given the right to sue, in effect, in place of the deceased or in consequence of his decease.  Consequently, there were certain formalities introduced in the past and the amending Acts which are now being repealed here were merely consequential.</P>
      <P>The essential difference is that when giving a right of action arising out of the death of a person to the people indirectly injured, such as the people named in the original Act, a wife, a husband, a parent, a child, and so forth, that right was given for the benefit of a class.  I cannot see any reason why it should not be framed to provide that any person who suffers damage through a tort should be able to maintain an action to recover the damage done, because that is the essence of the whole case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why do we want a husband, a wife, a relative or any other person to recover damages arising out of a tort which killed a person who would have had an action himself had he survived? Why do we want to continue that action?  Simply because these specific persons have suffered damage through that tort, and, in principle, we are seeking to establish an action to enable these people who have suffered to recover damages now.  Now if that were the position, I would recommend the Bill; but in the Bill now before the House, the approach is to put in any person who, in effect, suffers damage <Col N="841" /> and put the onus on that person of proving the damage resulting from the tort.  However, that is largely an academic matter.</P>
    <P>We have, in effect, continued here the old idea that a certain class can sue and recover damages, that class being based mainly on relationship; but the relationship provided for is somewhat wider than that contained in the original Acts.  To that extent, the Minister has done well, but I still wonder whether it would not have been simpler from the point of view of enforcing the rights which are intended to be given under this Bill to make the approach a more general one, by going to the root of the matter and including persons substantially damaged through this tort; and, having asked the question as to who has been substantially damaged through this tort, then, let them recover damages in proportion, if they have been so damaged.</P>
    <P>That is a matter of principle.  Passing from that, I think this Bill fundamentally is as defective as the original Acts, but, in so far as the original framework is capable of improvement, there are improvements in this Bill.  I am not up-to-date on the Rules of Court and perhaps some of the practising lawyers would help us on this point.  Sub-section (3) of Section 3 states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The action may with the consent of all the parties be heard and determined by a judge without a jury but, in the absence of such consent, shall be heard and determined by a judge with a jury.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I take it these rights will be enforceable in tort actions in the Circuit Court.  I take it the Act will apply to the Circuit Court jurisdication.  As I read this section, it seems to imply that one must have a jury in the Circuit Court, unless there is consent to have it tried by a judge.  I thought the position in the Circuit Court was that trial would be without a jury in tort actions, unless by special request. Juries went out of fashion in the Circuit Court from 1936 onwards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unlikely, but it could be.  I merely raise the point for what it is worth.  That is something which could be re-examined, if there is anything in it.  The remainder of the amendments to the 1864 and the 1908 Acts are, generally speaking, incorporated in this Bill, and there is very little else one can say by way of criticism or praise of the measure.</P>
      <P>The Minister gave a fairly full description of what is in the Act.  Apart from extending the three-year limit, giving a rather wider jurisdiction in so far as the claimant is concerned and a wider possibility for claiming by extending the definition, there is relatively little new in the Bill.  I think the extension of the period is a very proper one, and I wonder why the period in this type of action should not be the same as in other comparable tort actions or, indeed, why there should be a statutory limit at all.  This is reminiscent of the situation in relation to local authorities, a situation which has caused a good deal of trouble.  Indeed, the particular one we are dealing with has also caused trouble.</P>
      <P>The Bill in its present form will get away from certain technicalities in pleading, technicalities which have been a nuisance on occasions in these Lord Campbell Act cases.  On the whole, there is nothing very new in this Bill.  I see no reason why it should not pass.  If, however, we are thinking of originality in our approach to these matters, on a fundamental basis, I cannot see that there is very much originality shown in this measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support this Bill.  At the very outset, let me say that I do not agree with Deputy de Valera who says that there is no originality in this Bill.  There is a very large measure of originality in it, in so far as there is a very definite invasion being made in this Bill on well-known <Col N="843" /> legal maxims which have survived for a very long time.  However, I will come to that at a later stage of my remarks.</P>
      <P>Section 2 of this Bill, I welcome very cordially having regard not alone to my academic knowledge of the need for such an extension of the class of dependents, but also having regard to my own experience in practice in the courts.  Even here, the exension now given leaves out people who, to my knowledge, should be included and people who, to the knowledge of every Deputy, occupy positions in families and in households all over this country that are to be regarded as positions of strict dependency in the case of death by accident of a member of the family in which they reside.</P>
      <P>Take, for instance, the position of spinsters and aged aunts or bachelors and aged uncles living in a household who are dependent upon a married nephew or niece, or some such person. Take further the position of a young person who would be a relative and would not come within the scope of the people contemplated in Section 2 (a) and (b), who would be a sort of ward within the family, a child who was brought there very young, some kind of relative, may be a distant cousin or a child of a deceased sister or brother, and who would be for everything dependent upon the person who was killed in the accident.  I would strongly commend to the Minister and to his advisers to include in this class of persons, which they have now very happily extended, as compared with the original Act, those people I mention, aunts and uncles and people who would be in the position of being <i>in loco parentis</i> generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to see that in Section 2(b) an illegitimate person shall be considered the legitimate offspring of his mother and reputed father.  I am happy to see that the position is being rectified in legislation that is coming before us now and that it is becoming a feature of legislation to recognise the very equitable principle that the sins, if indeed sins they have been, of the people responsible for bringing such persons into this world, should be <Col N="844" /> visited upon the persons themselves. I welcome that feature of this Bill particularly, because as long as human nature is what it is, you will always have such persons living in our midst.</P>
    <P>Section 3 deals with the question of a hearing by a judge, with the consent of all the parties, or, in the absence of consent, by a judge and a jury. That is no departure at all from what the law is at the moment in the Circuit Court in relation to fatal accidents&mdash;that the action be commenced within three years after death.  I have no quarrel with the three-year limitation; that is an increase from the present limitation of one year under the Lord Campbell Act.  But I would like the Minister and his advisers, and the Government generally, to direct their attention towards a limitation incorporated in legislation such as this and try to have uniformity of limitation for all matters, so that our limitation within statutes, shall we say, would incidentally be an ease to the person who was seeking the remedy and would also make the life of the lawyers less difficult.  Keeping an eye on periods of limitation, so that nothing will be lost in the interests of their clients, is often a very great heartache and headache to lawyers from time to time.</P>
    <P>On the section dealing with damages, there is something new.  It is very new and at this stage I might as well make the point that, in my experience, it would always appear that juries in awarding damages, or even judges in awarding damages on the lines they must follow as laid down for them, award more substantial damages to a maimed person than they do to the dependent of a person who dies in an accident.  I must confess I have never been able to see the reason why, say, the maimed head of a household should get a very large sum in damages in contrast to the very low amount which his dependents would get, if he had died.  I see no reason why the damages in this case should not be the same.</P>
    <P>Damages, in my opinion, and particularly for the purpose of this Bill, if the definition is to be accepted, should be of such amount as would <Col N="845" /> place the charges dependent upon the deceased in the same material position as if that decease had not taken place, due regard being had, of course, to the period of time during which those dependents would have been real dependents.  It is necessary under the existing law that an actuary be brought in to assess the worth, as it were, to the dependents of the deceased's income and contribution to them as dependents.  That became necessary, owing to a well-known case of Gallagher v. the E.S.B. in 1933, which put the assessing on a very mathematical basis.  An actuary was brought in and the death of a person arising out of an accident was made very much a matter of pounds, shillings and pence, and very often pence were resorted to in this type of assessment.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to see in Section 5 that certain sums, the sums as outlined by the Minister in the examples he gave, are not to be taken into account in the assessment of damages.  This is a matter to which I must give certain further consideration&mdash;whether it would be a good thing to have some sort of clause added to Section 5 that would make any attempt to give evidence of such sums, benefits, pensions, opportunities inadmissible.  There would always be a temptation there on the part of defendants to get across to the jury or the judge that the person making the claim was not really as badly off as he would like the court to believe.  The survival of the cause of action on the death of the tortfeasor is a very definite departure from the existing practice in relation to the fatal accidents code.  As such it would be welcome, because my own view, and other people might come to the same conclusion, is that legal maxims were drafted in an age in which law was largely the prerequisite and avocation of the privileged classes.  That is a personal view of my own, but I am inclined to think that there is something in it.</P>
    <P>Adverting for a moment to the question of damages, I think that damages should include something for the loss of expectation of life to the particular estate and that there should be some award to the estate claiming <Col N="846" /> for the pain and suffering of the deceased prior to his death.  These are matters which should be carefully considered, and while the Minister says that he and the advisers of the Government have gone to great lengths to get a definition of damages, I think that such a definition should be as wide as possible, having regard to the changing circumstances of our times. There is no point in trying to have these things assessed on an actuarial basis any longer.  I can see no point in the continuance of the practice that a maimed person should receive more than his dependents would receive if he died.</P>
    <P>This, on the whole, is a very welcome piece of legislation.  It certainly goes a long way towards curing the defects which I have noticed myself in the fatal accidents code up to now and those which I have often discussed with my colleagues.  I do not accept the view of Deputy Vivion de Valera that it should include any person who can prove that he has suffered damage. You would have all classes of persons coming in and making the claim that they had suffered loss.  It would be a welcome provision for practitioners, but it would be a very serious impediment to the working and progress of the courts.  I hope the Minister will include in the Bill provision for people like aunts and uncles, married or unmarried, and also people who stand <i>in loco parentis.</i> I would ask him to try to find some sort of basis on which damages can be assessed, without reference to the mathematical practice of doing it on an actuarial basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome this Bill.  I must say that one of the problems which I have been confronted with in the courts is to explain the disparity which seems to exist between the amount of compensation awarded in the case of a personal injury as against a fatal accident case. I remember, not long ago, dealing with two such cases in one week.  One was the case of a fairly young widow with two children whose husband had been killed.  She obtained the sum of £1,200 compensation for herself and the two children.  On the actuarial basis, that was the correct amount.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="847" /> In the same week, I obtained for a man who had suffered some injuries which affected his appearance and his capacity for speech&mdash;it did not impede his powers of speech but his palate was damaged and it affected his enunciation&mdash;a payment of £5,000 for damages.  Obviously, it was difficult to explain to the young widow who had lost her husband, who was a labouring man, and who was left with two young children, why she only obtained £1,200 as against the case of the man who had only been disfigured, but who had got £5,000.  That is an experience which every lawyer has had and it is difficult to explain to the public generally the disparity in the damages in a fatal accident case as against the damages in a personal injury case.  This Bill tries to remedy that situation and our purpose here should be to ensure that it remedies it as thoroughly as possible.</P>
    <P>Like the last speaker, I should like to urge upon the Government the possibility of extending the definition of dependents, though not in quite as wide a sense as Deputy de Valera suggested, because his suggestion would give rise to many difficulties.  Many small claims would be made by persons who suffered very remotely from a death.  However, I can visualise many cases where a severe loss would be felt by somebody not in the class of relatives set out in Section 2.  There is the case mentioned by Deputy Lindsay of an uncle or an aunt who might be entirely dependent upon the earnings of a niece or a nephew.  Such people should be provided for.  There are, particularly in the country, many instances of elderly people who are dependent entirely on the earnings of a nephew or niece.  If that nephew or niece is killed, due to the negligence or wrongdoing of another person, I think it is only right that the uncle or aunt dependent upon their earnings should be compensated.</P>
    <P>I would suggest, if possible, the finding of some definition that would include more than an aunt or an uncle, that would include a person standing <i>in loco parentis</i> or dependent upon an income from the deceased.</P>
    <P>I can appreciate fully the difficulties <Col N="848" /> of finding a definition that would cover the whole situation.  However, I hope that, between this and the Committee Stage, it may be possible for the Government to consider extending the definition. The definition, as contained in the Bill, is a definition which is more or less equivalent to the definition in the workmen's compensation code and in the aerial navigation code, but certainly we should at least cover the case of the uncle and aunt and nephew and niece who may be dependent upon a deceased person.</P>
    <P>I am inclined to agree with Deputy de Valera that it is very hard to see why the separate period of time limitation is imposed by the Bill as distinct from the ordinary tort.  I think we all agree that the earlier limitation of 12 months was too short and in many cases it did inflict an injustice or a hardship on the persons who suffered a loss of this nature.  A period of three years, from a practical point of view, is probably adequate, and possibly my objection to it is purely the lawyer's objection, that it is difficult to remember that in some particular action one has to bring the case within a certain period of time, whereas, in others, it is six years.  It would simplify matters if it were put on the same basis as an ordinary tort where there is a period of six years.</P>
    <P>I do not think it would affect the issue very much, but it would make it simpler from the lawyer's point of view.  That may not be a good reason to change it, but it would be a reason. The more we can simplify matters of that kind, probably the better.  However, it is not an extremely important point because any action would be brought well within the three years, unless there were strong reasons against it.</P>
    <P>Likewise, I agree entirely with the extension of the provisions in the Bill that deal with damages.  There is one sub-section of Section 4 that might possibly need further examination. Sub-section (4) of Section 4 provides:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The amount recovered in the action shall, after deducting the costs not recovered from the defendant, be divided among the parties <Col N="849" /> entitled in such shares as the jury or the judge, as the case may be, may have determined.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I wonder to what extent that is feasible?  Let me put this possible difficulty; it is a difficulty that might be overcome: How will a jury proceed to assess the amount of damages in different shares after the costs have been determined?  The jury will have finished its work, once the action has been determined.  The costs are assessed afterwards.  Unless the jury determine purely on a percentage basis, I do not see how they could determine the amount of compensation after the deduction of the costs which may be payable by and on behalf of the plaintiff.  It probably could be done by the jury deciding the percentage of the amount to which each was entitled.</P>
    <P>Also, there is this difficulty&mdash;there may be nothing in it; I am talking rather at random on this, without really having given it a great deal of consideration: Assuming that the action is brought, that notice of trial is served with a jury, at that stage, that the jury has the assessment of the case, so to speak; it is an action which has to be tried and determined by a jury.  It very often happens that between the time notice of trial is served and the trial is due to take place, the case is compromised.  If that happens, does it mean that a jury will have to be empanelled to apportion the amount between the different relatives?  There may be nothing in that apparent difficulty.  I am just mentioning it so that it may be considered. Assuming that an action is set down for trial by a judge and jury, that an offer is made by the insurance company or the defendants which is acceptable to the parties, does it then mean that the action will have to come before a jury in any event in order that the jury may apportion the amount agreed upon between the different dependents?</P>
    <P>In regard to Section 5, might I suggest that the addition of a further sub-section or paragraph be considered? Section 5, as the House will recall, provides that, in assessing damages, no account shall be taken of certain <Col N="850" /> things.  No account shall be taken of sums payable on the death of the deceased under any contract of insurance; no account shall be taken of any pension, gratuity or benefit payable under statute or otherwise in consequence of the death of the deceased.</P>
    <P>In some cases, I do know that legacies and inheritances or gifts arising from the death have been taken into account and can be taken into account.  Would it be well to exclude also from account any legacy, inheritance or other gift resulting from the death of the deceased?  I am merely raising that as a point worth considering.</P>
    <P>Of course, one of the difficulties in dealing with fatal accidents is that one never wishes to create a situation whereby a person will benefit unduly from the death of somebody else. Obviously, in principle, that would be wrong.  All we are anxious to ensure, I take it, is that a person shall not suffer financially by reason of the death of a person.  A case might arise where a child, for instance, might receive some legacy or benefit following upon a death and where these benefits would in no way be adequate in part or in whole for the loss sustained by the child.  I just mention these few points in the hope that the Government and the Minister might consider them before the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I should like to add that the Bill is long overdue.  As far as fatal accidents are concerned, it is practically a revolution in the existing state of the law.  It is an immense improvement in the position that has existed and I welcome it.  I think we should aim at seeing whether there are any other improvements in the existing law which could be made before the Committee Stage.  I hope it may be possible to extend the scope of the Bill a little bit more to ensure that under the various headings&mdash;the headings of dependency and of damages&mdash;it will get rid of a number of the existing anomalies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAFinlay1954" hpid="Mr. Finlay Mr. Finlay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finlay</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, would like to welcome this Bill in its general terms and in its intentions.  Like Deputy MacBride, there are two or three matters which I should like to mention <Col N="851" /> at this stage so that the Minister might consider them before Committee Stage. With regard to what has been said by Deputies Lindsay and MacBride&mdash;I am afraid I missed some of what Deputy de Valera said in connection with the definition of family and class to be embraced by the Bill&mdash;I agree there is a grave danger that if you extend that, as Deputy Lindsay suggested it might be extended, to aunts and uncles, you will leave a defendant guilty of tort at a peculiar disadvantage.  It is almost inevitable that the question of contribution of dependency is something peculiarly within the knowledge of the plaintiff and is a matter which a defendant cannot investigate or controvert.</P>
      <P>That is the inevitable disadvantage of a defendant in an action under this Bill.  It does seem to me sufficiently important to make it worth while restricting the class and I would ask the Minister with regard to the class of person to be embraced to try to devise some watertight method of letting in genuinely adopted children as distinct and apart from legally adopted children.  The present position is that, apart from blood relations&mdash; fully lawful blood relations&mdash;there are two classes also included; one, children legally adopted and the other, illegitimate children.  In reality, there is inevitably in the country quite a large class of persons who are in fact adopted.  Perhaps relations of some family have taken over the entire responsibility for bringing up the children of that family&mdash;the responsibility both financial and moral.  That responsibility may have been taken on without going through the formality of legally adopting the child.</P>
      <P>I should not like to see that class, which I think is not very large, excluded from this Bill, and, while I would say that otherwise I would not be in favour of an extension of the members of a family under the Bill, I should like the Minister to consider widening it to the extent of embracing the class of genuinely adopted children, though they are not legally adopted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Section 3 of the Bill, there is one part with which I would be somewhat concerned.  It is sub-section <Col N="852" /> (3) which provides that, in the absence of the consent of both parties, the action shall be tried by a jury.  That is an innovation, as far as I am aware.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised that point and Deputy Lindsay said is coincided with the existing rule.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasAFinlay1954" hpid="Mr. Finlay Mr. Finlay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finlay</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I know, it is a complete innovation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAFinlay1954" hpid="Mr. Finlay Mr. Finlay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finlay</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the Circuit Court, as far as I am aware, the present position is that a jury can be obtained only if the plaintiff seeks it or if the defendant seeks it.  There is no necessity, as far as I know, to obtain the consent of both parties to proceed with any action without a jury. In the High Court, as I understand it, a plaintiff in any form of action may serve notice to have the action tried by a judge without a jury, and, if the defendant acquiesces the action is tried without a jury.  I think the difficulty which arises here is that you are going to require some document of consent from the parties to have a matter tried without a jury.  I can see a situation under which the ordinary rules of court for tort actions would at some stage vary with regard to jury provision and I can see the necessity for the exclusion of sub-section (3) of Section 3.  This particular form of action should be on all-fours with any other type of action for tort and should be covered by whatever provisions there are with regard to jury trials.  I would leave the Bill silent on the question of how the matter should be tried, except that I would have provision whereby the Circuit and High Courts would have jurisdiction as in any other tort; and, if there is to be any alteration in the future, that it could be done merely by an alteration in the rules of court, without making provision in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the provision for damages, I welcome it in its entirety. It would seem much more fair and equitable in regard to the question of loss suffered by persons as the result of a death of a person on whom they <Col N="853" /> were dependent.  I think Deputy MacBride possibly has some point with regard to the difficulty of administering sub-section (4) of Section 4, but I would not like to see the provision in that sub-section being done away with in any way.  So far as I am aware, the present position is that an aggrieved person, say, the widow of a deceased man, bringing an action under the Fatal Accidents Acts, brings the action and gets a decree, and the matter of costs is disposed of on a party and party basis.</P>
    <P>The decree may be in respect of herself and three minor children, and the judge apportions the amount.  The amount awarded to the widow is paid out and the children's amounts are lodged in court.  There may be a large discrepancy between the amount the widow is awarded and the amounts payable to the children.  I know of no method whereby the widow may share with the children the discrepancy between party and party costs, and solicitor and client costs.  She has, in fact, to pay the whole of the extra costs of the action, and therefore, while it may be necessary in Committee again to consider sub-section (4) of Section 4 with regard to its working, I would not like to see the principle enshrined in it disappear altogether.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter in relation to the Bill which I should like to raise now.  It deals with Section 7 and it may involve too large an amendment, but I would ask the Minister to consider the matter before the Committee Stage.  As I understand the existing situation the dependents of a person who is knocked down by an army lorry or a post office van in the road and who dies, have a claim against the Minister for Finance under Section 7. His claim is on the same basis as if he had been knocked down by a privately-owned vehicle.  Unless I am wrong, if a person is killed as a result of the negligent action of a servant of the Post Office or of the Army, other than the person driving the vehicle&mdash;the classical example is that of a man who is knocked down and fatally injured on a street where a lorry is being unloaded and a servant hits the man <Col N="854" /> with a swinging bar&mdash;that person or his dependents have no remedy against the State, the position being that the helper on the State vehicle, if he is not driving the vehicle, does not come within the artificial liability created by Section 7.  He is the only person responsible for his negligent action and there is no way in which the State can be made responsible.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that that applies both to persons who are injured but not killed, and to the dependents of those who are killed.  When considering this Bill, and this section which creates the responsibility of the State for the negligence of their servants, there is a very considerable case to be made, on this section alone, for the inclusion of a provision whereby a person other than the driver of the State vehicle could be held responsible as the servant of the State.  The old rule, whereby a servant of the State was not in the employment of the Crown, is no longer applicable and the more the State involves itself in the day-to-day business affairs of the country the better.  A common example is the land reclamation and drainage schemes which take place throughout the country. Somebody may be killed as a result of the negligence of a person working directly as the servant of the Government but the person or the dependents of the person who is injured have no redress if the servant guilty of the negligent action was not the driver of a mechanically propelled vehicle.  I would ask the Minister to consider whether, in all equity, there is a case to be made for creating artificial responsibility for driving and not for other torts of any description.</P>

      <P>It would involve more than an amendment; it would mean a new section.

That situation is not recreated in this Bill. I do not think that was an unnecessary burden on the plaintiff.  The particulars were matters peculiarly within the knowledge of the plaintiff and peculiarly not within the knowledge of the defendant.  I should like the Minister to consider whether he would not make regulations in this Bill providing that where a person makes a claim there is a certain minimum of information that he must give to the person whom he is suing.</P>

As I intimated in my opening statement, we shall consider very carefully all the suggestions made with a view to providing a measure which will benefit the greatest number of people.  Deputy Major de Valera raised a point about a three year limit.  I should like to say in that regard that another Bill which will be introduced in the near future will also include a similar period for all personal injuries and we should like to retain that period in order to have uniformity.  There will be another Personal Injuries Bill introduced shortly.</P>
      <P>In regard to points raised by Deputy MacBride, I should like to say that a Statute of Limitations Bill will be considered very shortly.  Deputy Finlay made a very important suggestion about children who are not legally adopted and I can assure him that my hope is to try and do justice to all sections of the community.  I shall endeavour to see that a measure will be provided which will not leave any legal loopholes later on in the courts. I wish again particularly to thank the members of the legal profession in the House and I promise that the Department will give favourable consideration to all of the points raised.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Amendment of Army Pensions Act, 1953&mdash;Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="EugeneGilbride" hpid="Mr. Gilbride Mr. Gilbride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilbride</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That Dáil Eireann is of opinion that legislation should be introduced as soon as possible to amend the Army Pensions Act, 1953, so as to enable all recipients of service medals to be eligible for the special allowance if their means are sufficiently low and thereby put an end to the present unsatisfactory position which renders ineligible all holders of medals whose applications for medals were not received prior to the 5th day of August, 1954.</P>
      <P>I move this motion because, in the course of making representations on behalf of I.R.A. applicants over the last two years, I was surprised to find that, although a man had made an application for a service certificate, it was necessary in certain cases that the applicant should make application for a medal as well.  These are the people in whom I am mainly interested in this motion.  Take the case of a man who applies for a service certificate.  He is awarded a pension and automatically receives a medal.  If his case is turned down he has to make application again for the medal and if that application was not lodged before August 5th, 1954, he is not entitled to a special allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This special allowance is a very important item and has become more important down the years.  I think it was introduced first in 1946 and was improved in 1951, and again in 1953.  This special allowance was one of the best things done for the I.R.A. since this House was established.  This flaw in the Act is a hardship on a lot of people.  Take a borderline case where a man applied for a pension as far back as 1946.  I know cases where men applied as far back as 1934 after the first Act was introduced and who reapplied at different times and still no <Col N="857" /> decision was given until after the 5th August, 1954.  How are such men to know they would have to apply secondly?  I think the House will agree with me that the man who had an application in for a pension would feel that he was worsening his case by application for the medal.  I suppose it would have been an oversight by the Minister at the time, Deputy Traynor, that he did not allow that to happen.</P>
    <P>When I found this out, I went to the present Minister and drew his attention to it.  He told me that he was in complete agreement and that he himself, when the 1953 Bill was going through, asked the then Minister to leave it an open date.  I have here what he said on that occasion.  It is reported in Volume 140 of the Official Debates, column 1350, as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;General MacEoin: I think the Minister is to be congratulated for the effort he has made on behalf of the Old I.R.A. and their dependents. He has at the outset, in my opinion, taken steps that will expedite and speed up decisions.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The next part does not affect it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="EugeneGilbride" hpid="Mr. Gilbride Mr. Gilbride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilbride</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy MacEoin continued:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;As Deputy MacBride has pointed out, I hate this type of legislation by reference.  It is impossible for any Deputy to know exactly what cases will be covered fully and then, of course, as usual, we will always have the borderline cases.  I would ask the Minister two things before going into the Bill itself: first, for goodness' sake to take out the line or date limit&mdash;that you must apply on or before such a date.  There is no necessity for that, and you are simply tying your hand again worse than the Minister for Finance could ever tie it, because you are tying yourself by statute.  Take it out.  If a person is entitled to it in June, then he is entitled to it in the following January just as well.  I do not like it.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister now has it in his own hands and I hope he will not tie his <Col N="858" /> hands again.  I asked the Minister to look into it and he promised he would. I pointed out to him what he said at the time the 1953 Act was going through.  He can remedy that now and I hope he will do so at the first opportunity.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ted O'Sullivan also advocated the taking out of the date.  He is reported at column 1360 of the same volume as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We are glad also to note that the date for application for medals is being extended by a further year after the passing of this Bill.  I said here on a previous occasion&mdash;the Minister did not appreciate it very much at the time, I am sure&mdash;that I thought there should be no time limit to applications for service or disability pensions because, even in 1953, applicants are coming along for pensions that they were entitled to under the 1924 Act and the 1934 Act, that is, 29 years afterwards.  It would be a pity if one of our soldiers, one of our great men, turns up from New Zealand or Australia in ten years' time and finds that he is precluded from obtaining a service pension, a service medal, a disability pension or a special allowance.  Will not that be just too bad?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEoin and Deputy Ted O'Sullivan advocated that.  I remark that they did not press the point.  The then Minister, in winding up the debate, said he had a very open mind on it.  He is reported at column 1417 as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Several Deputies spoke on the question of an open date for applications. I, personally, have no very strong convictions about it for the simple reason that, in the course of time, these applications will disappear anyhow.  Time will solve that difficulty.  The fact of the matter is that, as regards medals, for instance, we fixed a closing date under a particular Act.  We advertised in the newspapers; we broadcast on the radio and we made every possible endeavour to ensure that everybody who was entitled to apply for a service medal, would apply before the closing date.  If they did not apply <Col N="859" /> before the closing date, it was not the fault of the State.  In spite of that I am again extending, in this particular Bill, the date for another 12 months.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was the Minister's attitude.  There was nothing done in Committee or elsewhere to insert an amendment to have the date fixed up and everyone seems to have given the Bill a blessing.  I do not believe the Minister foresaw at that time what might happen, that these cases might hang on without a decision for that length of time and that it would deprive these men of a special allowance now.  Anyone who knows the I.R.A. will remember that it is not the men who went out on different jobs&mdash;to attack barracks and so on&mdash;who were the mainstay of the I.R.A.  Oftentimes the fellows who were at home, who did the raiding and the outpost duty, were the men who helped to keep the I.R.A. at that particular time, oftentimes watching for them and spending weeks and weeks without going to bed.  Under the terms in the different Acts, these men would not qualify for a pension and I think the least that could be done for them would be to ensure that they would come under this now.  They have not so many years to live in most cases and the least we should do is to ensure that they come under this Special Allowances Bill.</P>
    <P>In regard to what Deputy Ted O'Sullivan said at that time, I would like to give the Minister an instance. I know an I.R.A. man who was born outside the State.  After the war was over, he emigrated and took up a position under a Government in the country he was born in.  Because of that position, that man could not apply for a pension.  If anything were to happen&mdash;and none of us knows what might happen&mdash;through an upheaval in that State or through his losing his health or through anything else and if that man were compelled to come back, I think we would all be sorry if we were not able to do something for him.  Under the present conditions, that man would have no claim.  I think that men like him and the men who did heavy work in the I.R.A. <Col N="860" /> should benefit now under this Special Allowances Bill.  The Special Allowances Act never got very much publication. It is only very lately that a lot of people got to know the benefits that accrue under it.</P>

      <P>The Minister might be surprised at the number of people who do not realise it.  Even to-night, I was told of benefits under that Act that I did not realise were there, with regard to men in hospitals.  There are benefits under it that very few people know about.  For that reason I would ask the Minister to accept this motion and to make sure that these people get a chance.  When I found out these flaws in the Bill, I went to the Minister and then to my own Party and got their consent and instruction to introduce this motion.  As I have endeavoured to point out, it would not cost the State very much.  I do not think there will be very many people involved because most of the I.R.A. have been dealt with.  I do not think it will involve a very lengthy Bill.  If the Minister wishes to improve the conditions of the I.R.A. he has a way to do it by the issue of the general directions.  He could widen the scope of the Bill a good deal by changing the general directions.</P>
      <P>There is not very much more I wish to say on this motion.  I would ask the Minister and the House to accept it.  I believe it is a necessary motion and that these people are wronged.  If I had known at the time I was bringing this motion that there was a by-election in the offing I probably would not have brought it in.  I would appeal to the Minister not to put the I.R.A. up for sale.  Anything that is done for them, let it be done in a quiet way.  If he does that, he will be doing a very good day's work for a lot of men who deserve it.</P>

      <P>I have heard a good many reasons as to why I should accept it, anyway.  I presume some of the best reasons were part of the argument I put myself to my predecessor.  I have stated in answer to a parliamentary question to-day that I do propose to amend the Military Service Pensions Act and I hope to have proposals before the House at an early date.  I hope that before Christmas, anyway, the Dáil may have a look at the Bill, but I am not exactly in the position to say that now.</P>
      <P>Broadly speaking, there is no difficulty in accepting this proposed amendment.  It only refers to the date for application for the medal and that owners of the medal, when it is allotted, should be eligible for the special allowance under the Act.  That is a very restricted amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know that there is any point in amending the Act if that were the only aspect, because, while Deputy Gilbride says there are not many people or much money involved, I do not think he is correct in that.  Since the 5th August, 1954, 1,500 applications have come in. That is a substantial number.  Why they waited until after the 5th August, 1954, I do not know.  The Deputy knows thoroughly well that it was publicised up and down.  Dear knows, I thought that the mere fact of my drawing attention, when I was in opposition, to the fact that it was going to close on the 5th August, 1954, would in itself be ample notification to everybody that they should apply and that I could reasonably assume so.  The Minister and Government of the day then put in the date.  I said: &ldquo;Do not put in any date.  If you are entitled to it in June, you are entitled to it in January.&rdquo; The Minister answered me by saying: &ldquo;We have announced it on the radio, we have put it in advertisements, we have done everything.&rdquo;  He said to me: &ldquo;You cannot assume that there is anybody left.  Anyway, I am extending it to the 5th August, 1954, and that <Col N="862" /> ought to be ample time to get finality.&rdquo;  Would you not think it was?</P>
      <P>The strange thing about it is, of course, that Deputy Gilbride does forget that the applications for medals were closed down completely in 1947. All was closed, a closed book.  The Minister and the Government then took the view that everybody who ever served or did anything must have applied at that stage for the medal or was in receipt of the certificate.  The 1949 Act was brought in by one of my predecessors.  I do not want to go into that now, except to point out again that it opened the date and it was thought that that opening of the date would be sufficient.  Then my immediate predecessor found that it was not, and he extended it, as I say, to August, 1954.  However, I am not going to argue the point as to whether they were right or wrong.</P>
      <P>I had thought that the major included the lesser but the law officers of the Department held against me, and I presume advised my predecessor in the same way, that the application for the major did not include the lesser. I held that it did.  I held that when you applied for a certificate of service, put the case, went up before the board and the Referee and there was verification or evidence of some sort given on behalf of the applicant, even if it was found that he had not qualifying service as required under the Act, he had at least established membership between 1st April, 1921, and the 11th July, 1921, which entitled him to the medal.  I am told that that is not so. Why it is I do not know, but that is the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy said that the medal conferred greater benefits than he was aware of.  I think that that is a slight exaggeration.  I do not think there is anybody who was a member of the Old I.R.A., or associated with anybody who was attached to it, who did not know every benefit that went with the medal.  There is very little my colleagues on the far side and on this side of the House do not know, but there are one or two aspects of the case to which I have referred here before. They do not come within the terms of the motion, although I think it is no <Col N="863" /> harm to mention them but on the question of special allowances, a very significant fact has emerged&mdash;that the total number in receipt of a special allowance on 31st March last&mdash;I am not going to give the present day figures, but they are substantially greater&mdash; was 4,321.  Of that number, 80 per cent. were people who held medals only. The 20 per cent. refers to people who had certificates of service.  In other words, those who had not as much service as would qualify them for a certificate of service were getting more than the people who had certified service.</P>

      <P>As a matter of interest, I should like to know from the Minister if he is going to amend the Act to bring in the open date to which he referred in a previous debate.  The open date, of course, means that people could apply in any particular period, that there would be no restriction, good, bad or indifferent.  As far as my recollection goes, I was circumscribed, not by my own law officers or anyone in the Department of Defence, but by reason of the fact that, while I was an <Col N="864" /> advocate, like the Minister, of the open date, I could never get financial approval of it.</P>

      <P>The main thing is that you are accepting the motion.  That is very pleasant to know.  It is not very often that a motion by Opposition Deputies can be accepted, but on this occasion, I suppose, we are all of the one mind.  I would like to make a confession now, despite what the Minister has said about having been advised by his own law officers.  I was not aware, and as far as my recollection goes I am not going to be dogmatic about it&mdash;I was never advised at any period that the application for the major did not affect the minor.  As far as I was concerned, I did believe, in view of the fact that all applications for service certificates went before the Referee, that the Referee in his wisdom, or otherwise, decided &ldquo;A is entitled to a pension; B is not.&rdquo;  A then automatically got a medal and B was ruled out, but I always concluded that, in view of the fact that B had to put in his application all the necessary information that would have, in his opinion, entitled him to a certificate, that would have sufficed to satisfy the authorities examining the claim that this man was a member of the forces, because that is the deciding factor.  The individual must be a member of the forces to get the ordinary medal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that when Deputy Gilbride was making his reference to the fact that, under the special allowances, individual members of the I.R.A. were getting much better conditions than even some of the persons who were in receipt of a pension, he was rather surprised, and some of my colleagues <Col N="865" /> behind me seem to have doubts as to why it should be so.  It seems rather surprising that a man who was out in Easter Week, who was one of the pioneers of the Volunteer movement, who gave service later on and who was awarded a service certificate valued at about, say, £35, had, because of the fact that he remained in good health and had not reached the age of 70 years, to be satisfied with that amount, whilst an individual who was not proved to have had any active service, good, bad, or indifferent, was entitled to a sum of £104, if he was single and to £130, if he was married.  Those are the benefits to which Deputy Gilbride was referring.</P>
    <P>Now, I am not objecting to that, because as long as a Volunteer gets the service to which he is entitled and as long as he retains his health, I would say he ought to be satisfied.  An individual who is entitled to the greater amount under the special allowance is entitled only because his circumstances are so different from those of the other individual, but I think that the fact that the Minister has informed us that he is accepting this, and I am assuming that that means that he will amend the Act&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I would like to express satisfaction with the decision which the Minister has given and the attitude that he has taken up with regard to the points in the motion. There is, however, a sentence here which I think deserves comment, at least, that is: &ldquo;so as to enable all recipients of service medals to be eligible for the special allowance&rdquo;. Everybody knows, I think, that, in the early stages, many of the Volunteers <Col N="866" /> themselves knew, or were advised, that application for the major award of a service certificate entitling them to a service pension did not include the minor award of a badge of membership and service, that is, the service medal.  They were definitely advised that they would depress their own case for the award of a service certificate, if they asked for the medal, that that was an admission by them that the medal was all they considered themselves, and that their officer considered them, entitled to.</P>

      <P>I am afraid the Deputy is widening the debate, which is to enable all recipients of service medals to be eligible, that is, people who have been awarded medals since August, 1954.  They are not entitled to a special allowance and that is the type of case that Deputy Gilbride was arguing, that the person who applied for and was granted a medal subsequent to the 5th August, 1954, should be entitled to a medal also.  As the law stands, he is not.  That is the case that Deputy Gilbride&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>My point is that people with medals&mdash;some awarded before August and some after August&mdash; are having the merits of those awards reinvestigated when they apply for special allowances.  Consequently, every member holding a medal is not considered eligible for a special allowance until the award of that medal is verified, so to speak.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps not in all cases, but in a wide number of cases. That re-examination has delayed the making of awards of special allowances to men and women who have given <Col N="867" /> very good services and whose commanding officers, or those who had the best knowledge of their services, are now dead.  Consequently, verification is very difficult.  I am just mentioning that so that the Minister, when amending the Act, can take these matters into consideration and ensure that, when the investigation of an award of a medal takes place, the severity of the investigation will not be such as to debar people from the benefits accruing from the medals awarded to them.</P>

      <P>I should like to add the voice of our Party to the voice of the people who have already spoken and suggested that the Minister should leave an open date.  As one who was far too young to be involved in the &ldquo;Trouble&rdquo; and whose only recollection is that of the &ldquo;Tans&rdquo; raiding the house, I think we in this House are dealing in a manner a little too niggardly with a group of people which is getting smaller day by day and which will eventually die out, whether we like it or not.  I think it is a reflection on the House and everybody in it to find that there are so many obstacles put in the way of people who would not apply for allowances until the stage when they needed them very badly.  That they did not apply up to the 5th August, 1954, might be explained by the fact that they were in good circumstances at that time and that, through no fault of their own, their circumstances might have deteriorated since then, but, because they did not apply for the allowance until they could not do without it, they are turned down, no matter what their services were because they did not apply before that date.  I think that consideration should be borne in mind by the Minister. I know two cases myself where people were affected in that way.</P>
      <P>On that point, I think the Minister should consider very carefully the question of including an open date, because, in ten years' time, this will not be a problem and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Because of the date which was put in haphazardly&mdash;the Minister said it was moved from year to year, but I wonder why was August 5th, 1954, chosen?&mdash;these people who would not apply until they needed the allowance were debarred from getting it.  I think the date should be an open date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister a question.  I do not want to speak on this as I have spoken on these matters before in regard to applications for medals that have to be reinvestigated to see if they were duly awarded according to the terms of the Acts&mdash;that is why reinvestigation takes place.  Before a man can get a special allowance, the Department must be satisfied that the medals were duly awarded.  Applications for medals were made before that Act was passed. They were investigated and certified, or had previous certificates from the board of assessors or certified by officials in the Department of Defence, on the evidence then before them.  The medals were then awarded.  After the passage of the Act that provides for special allowances, the Department had to see that the medals were duly awarded, and in many cases had to have a reinvestigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This reinvestigation takes place when a man applies for a special allowance, and what I want to know is this: Will that reinvestigation take place in all cases, whether the individual who has the medal now applies for a special allowance or does not?  If it does not take place in all cases, it does not make any great difference to these people who have already applied for medals whether the date is extended or not because they are eligible to apply for a special allowance at any time of their lives, say, when their circumstances are such that their means qualify them, <Col N="869" /> or their health qualifies them, or when old age comes and they reach the age of 70.  If, in ten or 15 or 20 years' time, a man who served in the I.R.A. who has a service medal applies for a special allowance and if the medal was not duly awarded, how is it to be duly awarded then?  It will have to be investigated now.  All those applications will have to be investigated now.  I ask the Minister if that will be done when the date is extended?</P>
    <P>I am precluded under the terms of the motion from asking the Minister whether or not he intends to extend the date for applications from sisters of men who fell in action or died otherwise, or from other classes of people who are precluded from applying under the Act, as it now stands.</P>

      <P>Before the Deputy concludes&mdash;under the Act, the Minister must be satisfied that the medals have been duly awarded.  As Deputies are aware&mdash;I informed them of this before &mdash;since numbers of medals were awarded, reports were sent in that were found to be well-founded, that medals had been awarded to people not entitled to them.  That has been well established.  The result was and is that something has to be done about it.  There were numbers who were certified by two or three people and these people afterwards withdrew their certification, which makes the matter very annoying.  Let me say in reply to Deputy Hilliard that my intention is&mdash; if I succeed, and I hope I will&mdash;that, when this amendment of mine to extend the dates goes through the House, steps will be taken to see to it now that every medal awarded will be duly awarded.  Whatever investigation is necessary will be done now and not in ten or 15 years' time.</P>

In other words, at the moment the Department&mdash;I am sorry if I am going outside the motion, but this arises indirectly on the motion-communicates with officers down the country in regard to applicants who may or may not be eligible for medals.  I am aware that in certain cases junior officers have been approached in the absence of the senior officer, who may have left the country or died in the meantime. I am aware that in some of those cases these junior officers have not the full knowledge of the applicant.  That is why I would like the Minister&mdash;I know that he is sympathetic&mdash;to ensure when he is introducing legislation or setting up whatever machinery is necessary that evidence will be taken over the widest field before a decision is given either for or against the applicant.</P>

He made the point that 80 per cent. of the special allowances is given to men who have no pensions.  I am glad of that, because neither the special allowance nor the pension was ever intended as a livelihood and both the Department and the board are to be congratulated in spreading out the pensions and the allowances as far as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know the open date is a very big question but I would appeal to the Minister to try to get the Department <Col N="871" /> of Finance to agree, if not to an open date, at least to giving the Minister descretion in special cases.  I instanced a case, when I was speaking earlier, where a prospective applicant is now serving with a foreign Government and, because of that, is precluded from applying for a pension.  No one knows what may happen.  Some day that man might be glad to come back here and, having come back, he might be in need of a pension.  I think we would all feel badly if the door was closed against him.  If the Minister succeeds in getting an open date we will all congratulate him.  If he does not succeed in that, I hope he will at least get discretionary powers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That Dáil Eireann is of opinion (a) that the legal machinery for the acquisition of land for afforestation is inadequate and that legislation to expedite acquisition should forthwith be introduced; and (b) that the policy for the Forestry Branch of the Department of Lands should be so directed that a greater proportion of its activities should be concentrated in the congested areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I and many members of my Party have for a considerable time been of the opinion that this motion is one which should be enshrined in the legislation of this House.  One of the principal reasons for tabling the motion is that our experience of the workings of the Forestry Branch in the past has been that, in many cases along the western seaboard and in the West of Ireland generally, land suitable for afforestation has been land in the nature of commonage held by more than one person, unfenced and undivided.  The result has been that very often, although the Department of Lands is agreeable to taking the land and the majority of the tenants are prepared to part with the land because of the benefit that would accrue to them by virtue of an afforestation scheme, a few <Col N="872" /> interested parties in that commonage object and the fact that one, or more, object means that the scheme is immediately knocked on the head.</P>
    <P>We all agree that a great deal can be done for the West and for the undeveloped areas generally through afforestation.  Many, many schemes have been tried, and much thought has been given by the Department and successive Governments to the problem of providing work for the people in the West and in the congested areas.  Many schemes have been mooted.  Much money has been expended.  But the one thing that can be done and the one thing that, if done, will prove a success is reafforestation.  We have the land.  We have the people to work the scheme.  Everything is in our favour.  Yet, while we are bending our energies in other directions and implementing other schemes for the relief of congestion in order to give employment in these areas, we have never given afforestation the place it should hold in our economy.</P>
    <P>One of the chief reasons for our failure is that, irrespective of the attitude of the Department of Lands or whatever Minister may be in office, no great progress can be made in the West, where progress is most needed, unless there is a change in existing legislation in relation to the acquisition of land and the taking over of commonages.  I have experience of what happens.  There may be 20 tenants on a hill suitable for afforestation.  Two of those tenants may be running 500 or 1,000 head of sheep each.  The other 18 have no sheep.  The 18 who have got nothing and are paying some rent and possibly some rates in respect of their portion of that holding, that mountain or hill, will, as soon as approached by the Minister's officials, agree to sell out their interest for a small figure per acre.  But as soon as you approach the other two or three who have got the 500 or the 1,000 head of sheep there, you will find they will never, under present law, give their consent to taking a very good annual income from them for a small sum of money.</P>
    <P>In getting around to doing this job, we must have some thoughts for the <Col N="873" /> rights even of the few who have in the past been standing in the way of the progress of the forestry schemes.  I believe that one way in which we could tackle the problem would be that we should regard the tenants of any commonage in much the same way as we would regard the members or the directors of a company, that it would be by the vote of a percentage, a percentage naturally greater than half, of those holders or tenants.  If they indicated their willingness to part then the others should be bound by the majority rule.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am putting it to the Minister merely as something that I suggest should be worked.  I am holding that if ten people own something and eight of them say: &ldquo;We will sell at a fixed price&rdquo;, the other two should not be allowed to stand in the way of the progress of the country and of our afforestation schemes for their own personal gain.  Whether the comparison I have made gets home to the Minister or not, is not really material.  I think he understands what I am trying to get at and I believe that he appreciates the difficulty because he must have come up against this same difficulty himself during his present term of office and in his last term there also.</P>
      <P>Another point is that apart from the specific question of acquiring commonages and asking that legislation be brought in to enable it to be taken over more easily, there is also in this motion a suggestion that the policy of the Department in future should be that a greater proportion of the afforestation programme should be concentrated in the congested areas.  In the past we have had forestry schemes established and now flourishing in areas that were not congested.  We have had lands planted that could have been better used for tillage or grazing or lands that could have been divided among land hungry people along the western seaboard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It might be all very well to have that situation obtaining if we had already planted all the land which is <Col N="874" /> not very much good for anything else. at the same time we should have planted in the areas giving the greatest amount of benefit by virtue of their employment potential.  We have not been doing that.  All we have to do is to go down the east coast and have a look at some of the very fine afforestation schemes or down to the Midlands and see exactly the same thing. I agree that afforestation is very good anywhere in a country such as ours where we have got so little of it and where so much is needed, but it should not be carried out on the better lands of the country or in the areas that are not congested.  I strongly advocate that in future the policy of the Forestry Branch of the Department of Lands should be directed towards the extension of afforestation along the western seaboard from Donegal to Kerry.</P>
    <P>Great unemployment exists there and much emigration takes place year in and year out, in addition to which there is much migration as well.  We can do something permanent there through afforestation.  We can do it by concentrating our energies there. We can acquire land on the other hand by changing our legislation so as to enable the Department to acquire these commonages which form a great part of the total plantable land available in the western regions.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister and to the Government to take heed of this motion, to accept it and to accept it wholeheartedly, knowing that in doing so they are doing something that will help in the general direction of enriching our country, providing employment, and reducing emigration. Very likely, as the forest regions spread throughout the West, the climate of that part of the country may well be affected and affected in a way advantageous to other lands adjacent to these forests.  At this stage no one can give any definite indication as to the benefits of that work, but I think it can be taken fairly definitely for granted that if we can plant some of our rather steep hillsides surrounding some fertile valleys we will have in the West in the future less flooding of this fertile land in the lower regions.</P>
    <P>We may also affect the climate in a way that may improve the fertility of <Col N="875" /> that land and improve its production. If our forestry schemes can give us not only the benefits of the labour absorbed, trees producing timber that may be usefully used in the future, the establishment of factories for the manufacture, possibly, of pulp for paper production or other kindred articles, but in addition can improve the fertility of our small valleys of good land and improve their production, then surely that is a double reason why we should go all out to get the Government, the Department and the Forestry Branch in particular so geared as to enable them to go into the West and do something really worth while about planting there.</P>
    <P>What we have been doing in the past has been quite good work.  The number of acres planted each year is certainly a contribution but so little have we as a total at the moment and so great is the amount we still require and could usefully use, that we should be able to step up our production twofold and threefold.  It would be no harm if we could step it up fourfold. That cannot be done unless we tap the resources of the suitable land in the West.  Otherwise we must use, as has been used in the past, some of our fertile land, some of our land that could be better used in directions other than planting.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister then to call to mind his own county where he knows conditions exist that I am trying to outline.  They exist in his county as they do in mine and in several other counties in the West-large tracts of land unsuitable for anything much other than planting.  There are large areas where there is congestion, no employment and no hope of employment in the future.  All the talk of factories being established to absorb that unemployed labour is very nice and well but, by and large, the amount that can be done to absorb all the labour in the West and in the congested areas is so very little that far greater results would be obtained if afforestation were pushed ahead, as it should be.  Something really worth while would then be done for the people of the West and, in addition, it would be a national asset.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="876" /> I cannot understand why all the energies have been bent towards other areas and why so little has been done in the West, the part of the country where tree culture could be carried on so successfully, where the land and the people are available and where everything is in our favour.  We should give to the Forestry Division the power to acquire land where the greater of the tenants are agreeable to sell their commonage.</P>
    <P>I shall conclude by asking the Minister to regard this motion as a help to him as a Minister, within his own Government and Cabinet, an aid to get better and greater facilities in acquiring the lands about which I speak.  We are putting the motion to the Minister in that way and not in any way for the purpose of vote-catching or of criticism.  We are putting it as a help to him; we are asking him to meet us in that way and to accept it.  If he does I believe much good will come of it now and in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to second this motion.  We had hoped that the Minister would have introduced his proposals before this.  He put the Bill on the Order Paper before the recess, and we were led to believe that in a short time the House would have the Bill in hands and that we would know what the Minister's proposals were.</P>
      <P>The question of extending the work of afforestation in the congested counties has been occupying our attention on this side of the House for some time.  I am in the position that I am familiar with the difficulties and the case that can be made that a certain procedure has to be followed and certain matters observed in the acquisition of land and in proceeding with the afforestation programme generally. There is a general feeling, not confined to this side of the House, that more energetic steps ought to be taken to develop afforestation.  Deputies who hold that view feel that the afforestation programme provides some solution, perhaps not a complete solution, to the question of unemployment and the solution of the emigration problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There arises also the question of the exhaustion of peat resources during the <Col N="877" /> coming generation.  Both from the short-term point of view, as regards the giving of employment and the providing of opportunities in the West, and from the long-term point of view of building up our national resources as far as possible, we ought to ensure that, when a shortage of our peat resources occur, the people of the West, who depend to such a large extent on it for fuel, will have an alternative which will make up to some extent for any shortage of turf.</P>
    <P>In following Deputy Blaney, I have only to say that Deputies representing western constituencies know that the progress of land acquisition has been very slow in certain areas.  Even in those areas, where some advances have been made and a good deal of progress recorded, the vexed question of commonages arises.  In counties like Mayo, Roscommon and Galway the intake of land is very far short of requirements, if we are to make any substantial advances in the provision of employment.</P>
    <P>When Mr. Cameron wrote his report on the development of afforestation, he emphasised that in order to make forestry work really profitable and economical the blocks of afforested land should be up to 3,000 or 4,000 acres in extent.  In fact, even in the oldest established forest in this country, we scarcely reach those figures, although we are there for more than 30 years. Efforts have been made for a great part of that time to build them up further.  It is suggested by those who have an intimate knowledge of counties like Mayo that the difficulties arising in acquiring commonages are in great part the cause of the slowness in regard to acquisition.  I know that Deputy Moran, who, is unfortunately absent as he did not expect the motion to come forward this evening, has a great deal of experience in the matter and believes that large numbers of holdings have become practically derelict, the greater number of the owners being in America.</P>
    <P>If not, they are being let year after year for a long period of years.  The question arises as to whether that state of affairs is to be allowed to continue or whether steps should not be taken, <Col N="878" /> without any injury to the rights of the owners, who probably are not in this country at all, to devise means by which lands which are either derelict or being let year after year should be made available to the acquisition branch of the Forestry Department.</P>
    <P>The Minister has the advantage of the liaison that exists with the Irish Land Commission and the experience they have had in framing legislation of the type whereby tenants were given the benefits of the vesting of their holdings, although the actual legal vesting of the land in the tenants did not take place for some time afterwards.  It should be possible to enable the Forestry Division to go ahead with the acquisition of lands which are not being used for agricultural purposes, and in whose development otherwise there is no great interest.  It should be possible to devise means whereby the rights of those people would not be made void, but whereby the Land Commission of the Forestry Branch would go ahead and acquire the lands and start the work which the House and the country expect them to do in these areas.</P>
    <P>I mentioned in the debates on the annual Estimates that there should be a more detailed survey made of these areas.  In the West of Ireland, there are areas like Slieveaugty where there are some plantations and valuable stands for timber at the present time; areas like Tourmakeady-Leenane, and the Ox Mountains where it seemed to be possible to acquire land, if the will and anxiety that exists on the part of all Parties in the House could be translated into action through the policy of the Government and the operations of the Forestry Branch, particularly the acquisition officers.</P>
    <P>Apart from the question of employment and the question of providing a reserve of fuel, there is also the question of the future of afforestation work when the timber now planted matures. Whether one regards it from the point of view of the planting operations, or the thinning operations, or the felling operations and the possibility of the establishment of a pulp industry in due course, one realises that the larger the areas that can be dealt with, the better, particularly now that we are <Col N="879" /> depending on mechanical means for drainage and preparation of these inferior lands on which the Forestry Branch has largely to depend.  It seems clear that, if we are to make the fullest use of that machinery, we should endeavour to have much larger areas to work on.</P>
    <P>During my time in the Department, I found that year by year the average acreage per transaction for the acquisition of land was declining.  That was because we were depending on the acquisition of isolated mountain holdings. As I have said before in this House, the acquisition of a holding of 30 or 40 acres was just as troublesome, in the amount of the inspectors' time involved and from the point of view of legal procedure, as the acquisition of an estate of some thousands of acres. It was with a realisation of the difficulty of making progress if we were to continue along that line that I suggested a systematic survey of those areas which, in my view, are very important from the point of view of afforestation.  Of course, they are not confined to the West.  There are areas like the Devil's Bit, for example, and there are areas in Donegal and Leitrim where there seemed to be greater willingness to meet the acquisition officers and to come to terms.  In fact, Donegal and Leitrim were entitled, from what I have seen, to a high priority in the attention that should be given by the Forestry Branch to particular areas. It seemed as if progress was being made, as if it was not too difficult to come to terms with mountain or other tenants in those areas.</P>
    <P>Even if the legislation which the Minister proposes deals with the question of title in some such manner as he has indicated, more will be necessary. Therefore, I suggested that, in addition to the survey of lands that are said to be available and the Plantable Survey, these areas should be zoned or scheduled and mentioned in the legislation as being areas which, in the opinion of the State and of the Executive, are potential forest lands.  That would mean that the attention of the Minister and of the Forestry Branch would necessarily have to be directed to those particular areas.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="880" /> At the present time, it must be confessed, the work of the Forestry Branch is made very difficult, if not impossible, by the fact that their activities are spread over such a large number of comparitively small centres, and, furthermore, that the searches for land have to be in the nature of hit and miss, rather too haphazard.  The principle of compulsory acquisition does not seem to commend itself to the House.  The Plantable Survey is quoted extensively, without due regard to the fact that the figure mentioned of 1,250,000 acres, or whatever it may have been, was the result of a rather rough survey of possible forest land and was not based on any close examination or research, parish by parish, of lands that might come into the hands of the Forestry Branch.  It was simply a general survey as to the possibilities.</P>
    <P>When the agricultural position of the country was discussed in former years, we generally spoke of 12,000,000 acres of arable land, but, if my memory serves me aright, when the compulsory tillage regulations were in operation, it was found that, in the best view of the Department of Agriculture, in face of the emergency, we had to take a lower figure of something in the nature of 10,000,000 acres of arable land.</P>
    <P>In the same way if we come down to an exact appreciation of the situation, so far as land available for forestry in the different districts is concerned, having regard to the fact that lands that heretofore were not considered even potentially arable are now being made arable through the operations of the land project and through the work of the farming community, it seems to me that there is bound to be a reduction in these figures.</P>
    <P>The Plantable Survey presumably included a great deal of mountain land that on close examination might be considered to be entirely uneconomic and unplantable.  In the newspapers to-day, there is a letter from a legal gentleman in the West of Ireland stating that of a fairly large parcel of mountain land, which he was able to offer the Forestry Branch, they considered that only a comparatively <Col N="881" /> small proportion of it was plantable or economic from their point of view.</P>
    <P>All these factors must be taken into consideration.  As I have said, the Plantable Survey was not done parish by parish or in a very close way from the point of view of examining in each district the actual possibilities.  A great deal of the land mentioned therein might be of the type the Forestry Branch are refusing every day or which, when they do take it over as part of a large block, find that up to 20 per cent. is unplantable.</P>
    <P>It is for that reason I would again ask the Minister to consider my suggestion of scheduling these areas where we know there are large tracts of land, and of considering asking the Forestry Branch to devote special attention to them in order that in the next 15 or 20 years comparatively large forests may be built up.  I think it will be necessary to do that whatever amending legislation the Minister may propose in regard to the title of commonages or title of those isolated mountain holdings which are giving such a great deal of trouble at the present time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>We all welcome generally in principle any motion tending to make possible the speedier afforestation of the country.  Much time has gone by that could have been utilised.  The legislation now sought for in this motion, and some time ago promised by the Minister, should come before us with all due dispatch so that we can put it into effect and solve whatever difficulties the Minister has found in relation to commonage and certain isolated type of holdings where continued difficulties have existed in relation to title.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When speaking on the main Estimate for Forestry, I said I felt that we were doing too much talking and far too little work.  I am still of that opinion.  We have got to approach this matter realistically.  On all sides of the House we talk with sanctimonious concern particularly for the people of the Gaeltacht, the congested districts and the people in the fastnesses of a county such as I represent and right <Col N="882" /> along the Western seaboard and in parts of Kerry.  There is no doubt that the realist, looking at the problem, will appreciate that if forestry had moved in there about a generation ago, we would have within those areas now substantial industry because I do not suppose that there is any more fruitful raw material for industry than wood.</P>
    <P>When one envisages the tremendous diversity of manufacturing processes of which the raw material is wood, one has to ask oneself seriously the question whether we have ever been in earnest in our concern for those areas. We know that much of the area we are dealing with is not ever likely to be in the highly-rated arable class land or in any of us who approach this problem in any reasonable state of mind knows that if we had adequate forests throughout the areas to which this motion refers we would now be running into the period when we might be able to eliminate importing many of the goods that come in yearly to this country.</P>
    <P>As long as I am a member of the Dáil I shall keep on insisting that we get more and more forests planted.  I do not want in any way to discredit the effort that is being made by the Forestry Department.  On analysis, we find that in the course of the past five, six or seven years expansion has been rapid and continuous but it is the very fact of what we were able to do in a short period of years that forces us to press for still greater development.</P>
    <P>You can go through the import list any time you like and there readily available for your information you will see the millions and millions of pounds spent annually on the import of various wood products or wood byproducts. When one considers the immense difficulty of the problem of the Gaeltacht and the congested districts, one gets impatient that there are not forests now coming to hand that could be a source of gainful employment for people within the area with the assurance of continuity as replanting became necessary and continuity of supply of raw materials as industry developed.</P>
    <P>I do not suppose that anybody in <Col N="883" /> this House will cavil at the Minister getting powers to enable him to use land suitable for forests if he pays a reasonable price.  I think nobody in this House will cavil at simplifying the machinery of acquisition or simplifying the machinery whereby his Department can find title.  I want to see industry developed in this country as much as possible from raw materials that we can produce within this country.  There is no doubt at all that the more forests we put down the greater will be the supply of raw materials for a myriad wood products.</P>
    <P>I am not at all in favour of over-scheduling anything.  I would be far more in favour of trying to step-up the procedure of the Department to get a larger and wider intake than trying in any way to involve it in the difficulties of scheduled priority because it may well be that, in the scheduled priority system, difficulties might hold up something in the priority group and aggravate a situation where the Department might have been able to go ahead in other areas which were not on the priority schedule.</P>
    <P>It is only a few weeks since the Minister opened the forestry centre at Glengariff and since then&mdash;I am quite sure the Minister will confirm what I am saying&mdash;the impetus that has been given to the offering of land in that whole area is extraordinary.  People down there now feel that the Forestry Department are in earnest and that, if they offer them their land, they will take it and do something with it.  That is a simple little answer to the Minister's problem.  The Minister will find that, as rapidly as he can set up worthwhile forestry centres, the problem of getting land for forestry will ease itself. People will see the practical working of it in their areas, and, at the same time, they will give their neighbours the incentive to offer land which they feel the Department will take.</P>
    <P>I am going to support this motion. I believe the Minister should accept it in the spirit in which it is moved, as something to give him a further earnest of the unanimity and goodwill <Col N="884" /> that is on all sides of the House for a forward impetus in relation to afforestation. I said in this House&mdash;other Deputies also said it; I listened to Deputies MacBride saying it&mdash;let the Minister bring in to the House the legislation he contemplates.  Let him come to this House to ask what support he wants in his drive for forestry and he will find an ever-increasing feeling of goodwill, if he shows an earnest of forward movement.</P>
    <P>We have got to face basic facts. Apart from what we can produce on the land or the harvest we can reap from the sea, the most practical and the most reasonable avenue of development is afforestation.  Not only will it enhance the beauty of the countryside, but it will be an ever-increasing valuable national asset.  We invest money in this State in all kinds of development.  People can watch from year to year timber growing to maturity, knowing that, as it matures, it will provide worth while raw material for industry.  It will give immense employment and, at the same time, it will start again the cycle of replanting.</P>
    <P>There is all that potential available. It is not a fairy tale or a pipe dream. The work has been done in the Scandinavian countries and in the Black Forest areas of Germany.  It is something which has been done in all wooded countries where there have been built up substantial pulping industries, match-making industries, box-making industries and subsidiary industries from all the various byproducts of wood down to charcoal.  I tell to the Minister to come into this House any time he likes and he will get support, as long as he shows a real earnest of his desire to get the work done.  The sooner this work is done, the sooner will we find ourselves in a position in certain parts of the Gaeltacht and the congested districts to do something lasting and enduring to keep the people within their own areas employed in industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>It is needless for me to say that I agree with everything Deputy Collins said, as, indeed, I agree with the terms of this motion. <Col N="885" /> I think it would be superfluous at this stage to reiterate all the arguments that can be advanced in favour of forestry.  Suffice it to say that, as far as agricultural employment is concerned, forestry is the only form of additional employment which is open. From the point of view of increasing the productivity of the country and of increasing the national income, forestry is the readiest source from which we can produce industrial raw materials that can provide the raw materials necessary for the building of numberless secondary industries.</P>
      <P>All these things are so obvious that they do not need to be restated at this stage of our history.  I am glad to see that there now appears to be a realisation on all sides that a greater degree of importance must be attached to forestry.  What worries me, what disheartens me, though, is the lack of progress.  It is six years now since it was decided that there should be an annual plantation rate of 25,000 acres. That is the target which the present Minister accepts.  We are very far short of that target.  I gather that the highest hopes of the Minister this year are that 15,000 acres will be planted&mdash; which is 10,000 acres short of the target which is agreed upon as being the minimum annual plantation rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Numberless different excuses over the past 20 years have been offered by successive Ministers for the lack of progress.  We were told on occasions that it was lack of barbed wire; we were told there were too many rabbits; we were told there were not enough skilled foresters.  I remember, I think, on one occasion that some statement was issued, in reply to some criticism that I had dared to advance, that they could not get enough axes.  That is quite so; that was put forward, I remember, as one of the reasons for lack of progress at one stage during the war &mdash;as if you needed axes to buy land and plant trees.  Now we are told that it is because we cannot buy the land, because there are too many difficulties in acquiring land.  We were told that last year; we were told it early this year.  The Minister announced as far back as last April his intention of introducing a Bill that would facilitate <Col N="886" /> land acquisition.  We were told in April or May&mdash;I am not quite certain of the month&mdash;that the Bill was on its way, that it was cluttered up in the parliamentary draftsman's office. This is the month of November, we have not seen that Bill yet.  Where is the Bill?  When are we going to see the Bill?  What is the Bill going to contain?  I am impatient and I think public opinion in the country is impatient.</P>
    <P>Deputy Collins has said that he hoped that the Minister would accept this motion.  I agree with that.  I hope the Minister will accept it, as I accept it.  Deputy Collins went on to say that he hoped the Minister would accept it in the spirit in which it was offered.  There I disagree with Deputy Collins.  The motion is offered by Deputy Derrig and some of his colleagues who, for 20 years, sat back and did not introduce such a Bill.  I hope it will not be accepted by the Minister in the same spirit.  I hope he is not going to accept this motion and then sit back in his office for another 20 years and allow forestry to dawdle in the way it has been dawdling.</P>
    <P>We are not here discussing anything other than the subject of the motion. I am not going to level a certain amount of criticism that I feel should be levelled at the way in which forestry is run.  I am going to confine my remarks to the motion.  The motion was tabled, I think, as soon as the Minister announced that he intended to introduce a Bill.  We could all accept that motion, but what I want, and what I think the country wants, is the Bill itself.  What we want is some action.  I would suggest, if this course is acceptable to the movers of the motion, that we should adjourn the further consideration of this motion until we get the Bill and we should insist on getting from the Minister to-night a date-line by which that Bill is going to be presented to the House.</P>
    <P>The Dáil is doing practically nothing these days.  I gather we will finish the business to-night and not even sit tomorrow. If whoever is responsible for that Bill&mdash;whether it is the Minister's Department or the parliamentary <Col N="887" /> draftsman, or someone else&mdash;had been doing his job, we could pass that Bill in this House to-morrow.  We could have passed it a week ago, a fortnight or a month ago.  Could I impress upon the Government and upon the Minister that those of us who have a clear conception of the economic difficulties of this country are losing patience, when the Government and the Departments responsible fail to take the obvious remedies that are open to us to deal with at least a certain percentage of our economic problems?</P>
    <P>I am not going to say any more to-night. I have already indicated, and I indicate it again, that, as far as I am concerned, I do not mind if it is necessary to bring down this Government&mdash; I will bring it down unless I find that a more serious attitude is adopted in regard to forestry.  I am in deadly earnest about that, because, in my view, the lack of progress in forestry is largely responsible for a big slice of the unemployment and emigration problems from which we are suffering.</P>
    <P>I know that the Minister himself is anxious that progress should be made, and I would like to compliment the Minister on the progress that has been made, but it is still 10,000 acres a year short of what it should be.  I know that many of the problems which confront the Minister&mdash;and I am sure confront the Minister for Lands&mdash;do not arise from lack of interest, but merely from a difficulty in getting the slow wheels of the departmental machinery to turn.  If it was agreed as far back as April or May last that such a Bill was necessary, if the Minister was able to tell us last April or May what was going to be in the Bill, what excuse is there for not having the Bill before the House now?  It is a matter of urgency and the country regards it as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <P>Like the other speakers who have contributed to this debate, I propose to be very brief in my remarks.  I do not intend to embark on a statement dealing with the tremendous advantages that would accrue to the country generally by the development of a large-scale forestry programme.  I prefer to confine myself to probing the Minister's mind with regard to what he has in this Bill that can be discussed properly under this particular motion.  There is an old saying: &ldquo;By their deeds ye shall know them.&rdquo;  This Bill that will come before the House in a very short time will clarify for many people whether or not this Minister is tackling seriously the difficulties that beset the Department in its attempts to embark on a large-scale forestry programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy MacBride has dealt briefly with the reasons given in the past, with the excuses made by the various Ministers for the delay involved, with the difficulties that were met when the forestry programme was being undertaken. As Deputy MacBride said, the question of wire netting was trotted out as a big difficulty.  The question of the rabbits was brought up, but of course, myxomatosis has dealt with that.  There is a question, the most important of all, which has not been referred to here, the question of finance, the question of the money <Col N="889" /> being made available.  We have discovered now that the main difficulty, the main thing preventing the Department from going ahead on a forestry scheme of large proportions, is the difficulty of obtaining land.  Now, I am not convinced personally that that is the main difficulty.  I believe&mdash;and I may be proved wrong in 12 months' or two years' time&mdash;that, in spite of the fact that the Minister is going to bring in legislation to simplify the acquisition of land by the forestry section, and in spite of that simplification, we will still be just as far off as Deputy MacBride said we are to-day from the minimum target wished for and hoped for six years ago, namely, 25,000 acres.</P>
    <P>I believe that, while the Forestry Department is so closely associated with a body like the Land Commission, we will not see the progress we all desire.  Perhaps certain improvements may take place as a result of this new measure, but I believe that, until that Forestry Department is set up on its own, somewhat on the lines of the E.S.B. or Bord na Móna, free from the red tape which besets it at the moment and free of day to day interference in this House, and given funds and powers of acquisition, we will not see the action we all desire.  Rather than see a Ministry for the Gaeltacht established, I would prefer a special Ministry for Afforestation set up by this House&mdash;in preference to talking in airy terms about the benefits going to accrue in the near future to the few inhabitants left of the Gaeltacht areas.</P>
    <P>Two of the difficulties that beset the Forestry Department at the present time, we are told, are internal ones.  If to-morrow morning a man down the country offers a substantial amount of land to the forestry people, there is an immediate difficulty, perhaps about the question of title.  We find that that person, the occupant of the land, will have to go back to the time of his grandfather who died, perhaps, intestate and an examination has to be carried out which will cost quite an amount of money.  The cost of that examination must be borne by the unfortunate person who is aiming to sell the land to the Forestry Department. <Col N="890" /> We will put it this way, that a Mr. Murphy offers so much land to the Land Commission and the price is £120.  We find that the search involved and the legal difficulties in clarifying the title, and the cost of examination, will amount to £30 or £40, and that £30 or £40 has to come out of the £120 offered to this individual. How can you expect that man to be willing to co-operate with the Department in a forestry scheme?</P>
    <P>We know that at present the State Solicitor's Office is the body charged with responsibility for handling the legal end for the Forestry Department. Can anyone think of anything more ridiculous than to see the Forestry Department, which is supposed to purchase land having its legal work done by the State Solicitor?  If it is a question of the acquisition of land by the Land Commission, that body has its own legal section and its own experts and inspectors.  I maintain that, unless the new legislation which the Minister brings before the House meets the points I am going to make, it will not be satisfactory.  First of all, he must set up an examiner's branch in the Forestry Department, and, secondly, he must have established a proper legal section within that Department, corresponding with the one at present in the Land Commission. If these two matters are not included in the new legislation, I want to warn Deputies that the difficulties that are present at the moment with regard to the purchase of land for forestry will not be remedied, and no matter what smoke-screen is put up with regard to the new Bill, unless these two points are covered by it, we will not see any progress made.</P>
    <P>I suppose the Minister and I do not see eye to eye on these things, but my own viewpoint is that the biggest difficulty he will be up against as a member of this or any other Government is the question of finance.  I will have to be convinced that it is otherwise. I know that members of various Governments have stated that money is no object, that there is no shortage of money at all when it comes to afforestation.  It is very easy to say that, but it is a different thing when <Col N="891" /> the particular Minister for Lands or for forestry moves into the Minister for Finance's office and says: &ldquo;I want so much this year for afforestation.&rdquo;  I can presume very well the type of answer the unfortunate Minister for Lands is going to get from a Minister for Finance put to the pin of his collar to meet other commitments by strong Ministers in other Departments.  That is a difficulty the Minister can get over when he hears an expression of opinion from all sides of this House and can see how serious all Deputies are in backing him in his demands on a tightfisted Minister for Finance.  The natural feeling of any Minister for Finance or Government is to express his generosity in terms of words, to say that all in the Government are interested in afforestation, but when it comes down to the practical implementation of that, it is a horse of a different colour.</P>
    <P>Human nature, of course, is such that any Government will have to plan on a short-term basis.  Elections in this country come with such frequency, or have done so in the past, at any rate, that we do not know where we are exactly with regard to Governments. The benefits to a Government of embarking on an afforestation scheme do not become apparent within the lifetime of that Government, or even the next, so that consequently it is not a great vote-catching business to introduce a forestry programme.  That is why I say all the more credit will accrue to the present Minister, if, with the backing of this House, he goes ahead with a forestry programme that may not bring him kudos in his lifetime as a Minister in the present Government period; but in time to come, when the spruce and other trees planted during his administration are tall and majestic, the children of this generation will point out to their offspring: &ldquo;It was Mr. Blowick, from Mayo, who was responsible for those large trees that are now facing our front door.&rdquo;  That will be a glorious day for the Minister.  When he is in heaven, he can look down to see them.</P>

      <P>I rise to give my encouragement to the Minister to bring in the Bill without delay.  He has been assured from all sides of the House that it will be passed without delay.  I think the Minister ought to feel very glad that the speeches have been very vigorous.  They have been very encouraging indeed, because the vigour of the speeches and the things said are an assurance to him that the Bill will be passed, and passed very quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I avail of the opportunity of congratulating the Minister on the conclusion of the many years' proceedings dealing with the purchase of Glengariff. He is to be congratulated on the purchase there, and, I hope, for the planting of trees at a very early date.  Timber will be a very valuable asset in Ireland in days to come when shipping becomes almost impossible to secure and timber become dear.  We will then have our own supplies giving good employment, and reducing emigration, which, regardless of what Party has been in power, we do not appear to know how to stem.  This is an opportunity for the Minister to show his greatness.  A few days ago I <Col N="893" /> heard the Minister praised by a person very interested in afforestation for what is to be done in Glengariff, but the same person hoped that the Minister, when planning what is to be done in Glengariff, will not spoil the vista which is the beauty of that area.</P>
    <P>I join with the other Deputies in encouraging the Minister, and with others, I would earnestly express the hope that he would accept the motion in the friendly spirit in which it has been moved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMGlynn" hpid="Mr. Glynn Mr. Glynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in complete sympathy with the motion, and in particular with sub-section (b) which relates to the concentration of the Department's efforts in the congested areas.  I should like to preface my remarks by saying that it is quite clear that the Minister in charge of the Department is probably the most genuine worker we have had in that Department in our 30 years of self-Government. His efforts up to the moment may not have been as spectacular as we should like, but, nevertheless, he has, since he came into the Department of Lands in 1948 very substantially increased the acreage planted. The fact is, however, that despite his enthusiasm and sincerity in this matter, a substantial acreage has, quite clearly, not yet been planted.  I think there are various reasons for this but I might mention one, of which I have personal experience of, in relation to plantable areas and plantable land in my own constituency in South Galway.  That is that there seems to be very little genuine effort made to acquire lands which are available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an approach by a Department inspector to the owner of the lands.  The owner makes a reasonable proposal either in regard to price, but mostly in regard to exchange, and he never hears another word about it. The whole matter is dismissed for ever after.  I know farmers, farmers who have small valuations but who have large plantable areas on their farms, who voluntarily will give up these lands to the Forestry Department at any time if they are given a small economic holding in exchange.  I do not think it is an unreasonable <Col N="894" /> request; I do not think the Department are approaching the matter in a constructive way if they refuse all further parley or negotiation on these lines.  There are other lands which the Department expect to acquire for the ridiculous price of £2 or £3 an acre. The Minister himself comes from a western area and I need not tell him or anybody else that it is ridiculous to expect an acre of any land, no matter how bad it is, in this year of 1955, for the paltry sum of £2 an acre, a sum which, according to a reply given in this House last week, is worth about what 15/- was in 1939.</P>
    <P>Could anything be more ridiculous than this offer?  Who is responsible for fixing such a price for the acquisition of lands for afforestation purposes? Surely the capital amount expended on the purchase of the land is the least expense in the ultimate cost of afforestation. We have the cost of the trees, the cost of planting, fencing, protective measures and the maintenance of the forest and we quibble with the farmer about the price.  We tender a price of £2 or £3 an acre and we never come back to negotiate further.  I do not think the Department will get lands in the congested areas by that method of negotiation or by that approach.</P>
    <P>I have been reading the Estimates and I know that the Minister has stated, when introducing the Estimates, that there is a great desire on his part to increase planting and to proceed with afforestation and the potentialities of afforestation in the congested areas.  That has only transpired, as far as I can see, in the 1955 Estimates.  It may be that I am being premature in making these remarks but I have noticed in the last four years in a large county like Galway, which is notably a congested area, only 2,000 acres were acquired in the four previous years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>In County Galway.  I would refer the Minister to the debates of the 7th June, 1955, Volume 151.  I think it was Deputy Derrig mentioned that matter.  In the course of his statement he referred to the congested areas and he pointed out that in <Col N="895" /> County Donegal the progress made was probably the best of these counties. The next best county seemed to be Sligo, which had, roughly, about 3,000 acres, of which 750 acres came through the Land Commission.  The other counties were not satisfactory.  The Galway figure of about 2,000 acres for such a large county, a county which included the Connemara area, could be described as a poor result.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanMGlynn" hpid="Mr. Glynn Mr. Glynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Column 797 of Volume 151.  The Deputy went on to give the figure for Leitrim, which was less than 2,000 acres.  In other words, the figure in respect of Leitrim was comparable, almost, with the Galway figure, although Galway is the second largest county in Ireland.  I have no hesitation in saying that Galway County, in parts, is also one of the most congested counties in Ireland.  In relation to the congested areas I would quote the Minister himself where, in column 784 of the same volume he says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Deputies will be interested to know that almost 40 per cent. of the year's planting will be in the congested districts where the need for forestry development as a social service providing one of the answers to employment and emigration problems is most acute.  The introduction in 1950-51 of new methods of cultivation of marginal lands, using heavy machinery to solve the drainage problem, has made this big expansion of forestry in these areas possible. The application of the new technique to large areas in the West was experimental in the first instance, and until the development of the plantations showed whether the new methods would produce good timber at an economic cost, the whole future of this new development had to remain in doubt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Experimentation on blanket-bog and submarginal land types is still going ahead and results so far are sufficiently encouraging to enable me to assure the House that forestry has <Col N="896" /> come to stay as an economic aid to the West.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is very important from the point of view of my constituency, because in my constituency we have huge tracts of what the Minister describes as blanket-bog and submarginal land types.  We have an area&mdash;I would not measure it in hundreds but in thousands of acres&mdash;available for afforestation in County Galway, submarginal, marginal and suitable types of land for afforestation.  I sincerely hope that steps will be taken to avail of these lands in the very near future for afforestation purposes.</P>
    <P>While we are waiting for the good results expected from the experimentation to which the Minister referred, I would suggest that there are very large areas of suitable land at present available if steps were taken to acquire them.  I did mention to the Minister one area&mdash;I think it must be eight or nine months ago since I wrote either to the Minister or to the Department or the Land Commission &mdash;near Kilchreest, Loughrea, in which there was a very substantial area of over 1,000 acres available and waiting for afforestation.  All that was asked was that the Land Commission should step in and apportion turf banks on a small proportion of that land for 82 or 84 tenants&mdash;I think two acres each was suggested and not more than 190 acres would be utilised for the benefit of the tenants.  Over 1,000 acres besides this would be available for afforestation. As far as I can see, I have not yet got a satisfactory reply to that suggestion and I do not think that is dealing with the problem in a congested area&mdash;or in any other area for that matter&mdash;in a satisfactory way.</P>
    <P>I have also had the experience of making several offers of exchanges of 100 acres or thereabouts of poor land of small valuation for economic holdings of 30 or 40 acres.  Again, I got an acknowledgment but nothing else.  I do not know if the people have even been approached to inspect the land or decide on its suitability or decide anything in the matter.  These are matters about which it is not I who have the complaint, but others.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="897" /> Reading the debates and the Estimates connected with this matter, I must say that the present Minister and the Land Commission or the Forestry Division in recent years have progressed steadily.  I have heard Deputies complain that this progress is not sufficient and I agree it is hardly sufficient.  I would suggest that a different approach might be made and, as a start, that a higher range of prices might be decided on by the Department in the light of the fact that this initial expense is by no means an expense which should be a deterrent to the acquisition of land.  It is the smallest portion of the capital outlay involved and I think farmers or any owners who are giving up land for afforestation purposes should be reasonably and suitably compensated and should not be offered the poor prices which are at present being offered, having regard to the present value of money.</P>
    <P>We should get away from the history and methods of the past when any Government Department was entitled to go down the country, acquire lands at confiscation prices, and, if the owner objected, he was told he could avail of arbitration machinery.  Anybody with any experience of arbitration machinery, so far as compulsory acquisition of land is concerned&mdash;omitting I must say, the acquisition of land under the 1950 Act which the Minister himself introduced&mdash;knows that a farmer is offered a price and, if he is not satisfied, he is told he can avail of the arbitration machinery.  I think it is adding insult to injury to tell a man he is being treated fairly and that there will be arbitration.  To my mind it is not arbitration; it is another way of politely confiscating the land because arbitration is invariably used in a threatening kind of way when it is mentioned in negotiations under compulsory acquisition proceedings.  The owner is told: &ldquo;If you do not accept this price we offer,&rdquo;&mdash;30/- an acre, perhaps&mdash;&ldquo;we will let you go to arbitration.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanMGlynn" hpid="Mr. Glynn Mr. Glynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that it is voluntary but the point I wish to make is that the prices that are being offered for voluntary acquisition are comparable to the prices being given under compulsory acquisition.  How can you acquire voluntarily while giving prices comparable to compulsory acquisition prices?  That is a fact&mdash;the prices offered are not related to the value of the land to the owners at all.  If they were, more land would be given for afforestation, either sold or exchanged.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister should ensure that the Forestry Division and the Land Commission&mdash;while there appears to be some liaison between them at the moment&mdash;should work more in cooperation with each other.  I understand if they are acquiring for one purpose it cannot be given for another purpose.  If the Land Commission acquire land for the actual or alleged relief of congestion and if there is a little over, which is unsuitable for relieving congestion but suitable for afforestation, I understand the Land Commission cannot hand it over to the Forestry Division.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been told recently of a case in which a man was pointed out an exchange by a Land Commission official four or five years ago.  The house is built on those lands now, the estate is divided and the holding is vacant.  The house is still vacant.  The man was told that the Land Commission was very sorry but he could not be given an exchange by reason of the fact that the land he would be vacating would not be suitable for the relief of congestion and that the Land Commission had no power to acquire land for any purpose other than the relief of congestion.  This was stated although <Col N="899" /> it was pointed out that the land could be given to the Forestry Division.  It is one way or the other: either the Land Commission has power to acquire land for the Forestry Division in conjunction with the relief of congestion or they have not.</P>
      <P>I can give the particular person's name to the Minister later, if he wishes.  I gave him the facts before. I think I am quite correct in saying&mdash; I have no hesitation in saying it and no hesitation in emphasising it&mdash;that County Galway has been neglected for a long number of years, particularly in the matter of afforestation.  I would urge the Government to give more serious attention to County Galway, a congested area and an area from which there is a fair amount of emigration annually.  Between the 1951 General Election and the General Election of 1954, the <i>Connacht Tribune</i> which is the leading provincial paper in the West of Ireland, pointed out that the number of voters on the register had decreased by something like 900.  That is something of which the Minister and, indeed all of us, should take cognisance.</P>
      <P>There are people who suggest that industry is the cure for all our ills and that, if we establish industries in the West, emigration will cease.  I do not think industry is the cure for all our ills.  It is a cure for some ills, but industry, of itself, is practically useless because we will not have the labour to man such industry, and neither will we have what has been so often discused here, namely, the people to work the land.  Remember, this is a congested area and a special Act was passed to assist this area.</P>
      <P>The Minister may say that the acquisition of land for afforestation in this area will drive the people out of it.  I cannot subscribe to that suggestion.  Not only will it give immediate employment, but those who leave the area, while the forests are developing, will in the years to come return to the area to reap the benefits of afforestation to-day, industrially and otherwise, and the population will be double what it is to-day.</P>

      <P>The Bill to which I referred is in the post to-night.  Now, Deputy MacBride waxed very eloquent.  He asked: &ldquo;Where is the Bill?&rdquo;  He waxed so eloquent that I had a shrewd suspicion he had been down to his post box in the hall and got a copy of the Bill.</P>

      <P>If it is not, it ought to be.  It would not surprise me if Deputies had received it between six and seven o'clock this evening. Actually, I did not expect this motion to come on to-night.  I do not think that the Deputies who tabled the motion expected it to be taken to-night. No one anticipated that business would conclude as expeditiously as it did and no one expected that the first motion would conclude so rapidly.  I am sorry that the motion has come on to-night, because, had it been <Col N="901" /> deferred until next week, in all probability, I would have asked the House to discuss the Bill and the motion together, thereby saving a double debate. Sufficient for the Bill.  Deputies will have it in their hands to-morrow morning.</P>
      <P>The second part of this motion asks the Government to increase the planting of forests in the congested areas at a much greater pace.  In making that request, the movers of this motion are pushing a door which is already wide open.  During the last inter-Party Government, I think it was Deputy Moran from South Mayo who chided me for doing too much in the West, particularly in County Mayo.  It is a strange turn of the wheel to find him now as a signatory to this motion stating we are not doing enough.</P>
      <P>I am a little perplexed.  I do not know whether we are doing too much or too little.  If I give the House some figures, perhaps it may help to clear the air.  Personlly, I like the motion. I like a discussion of forestry because, to use the words of Deputy Seán Collins, forestry has been neglected. When I say that, I am not blaming anybody, because it is just as foolish to regret the past as to soliloquise about the wonderful forests and factories we shall have 50 years hence. We are living to-day.  Let us take stock of to-day and do our best to improve things to-day.  Moaning about the past or prophesying about the future is a somewhat useless proceeding.  Prophesying about our forests may be a pleasant occupation but it is, at the same time, a somewhat futile one.</P>
      <P>To come now to the figures:  at 31st March, 1955, the total area of land held for forestry purposes in the congested districts was 95,000 acres.  In March, 1943, the area was 36,000; therefore, over a period of 12 years, we have practically trebled the area of land devoted to forestry in these regions.</P>

It is not likely that forestry will ever develop to any great extent in those parts of Galway where the land is of that particular type.  Personally, I think it would be a bad thing from the national point of view if we were ever to encourage afforestation on good arable or semi-arable land.  As a nation, we want to make the best use we can of our land, the same use as a farmer makes of his holding and, from that point of view, we must devote it to what is most suitable for it.</P>
      <P>The first aspect we have to consider is the position of our own citizens.  I admit trees are grand.  There is no greater fanatic in this House or outside it than I am in, so far as forestry is concerned.  There is no one as interested in it as I am.  Nevertheless, we have to consider our people first. We have to grow food for them and, from that point of view, arable and semi-arable land is of prime importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned now with areas which do not rank so highly from the agricultural food production point of view.  In 1943, there were 27 forest centres in the congested districts. There are now 57 and, of these, 24 were established in the past five years. Take the congested districts as divided broadly into three separate regions: Donegal, Sligo and Leitrim as the northern block; a central block comprising <Col N="903" /> Mayo, Roscommon and Galway, Clare, Kerry and portion of West Cork as the southern block.</P>
    <P>Up to 1952 in County Donegal only six State forests had been established and these lay mainly in the eastern half of the country where congestion is not such a pressing problem.  Since then, centres have been opened at Gweedore and Gweebara&mdash;a total of 1,629 acres; at Kilcar&mdash;1,805 acres; and in four other areas&mdash;Meenirroy, Raphoe, Lough Eske and Mulroy&mdash;a total of 4,652 acres.</P>
    <P>Out of the central block, take Connemara, where up to 1951 only one State forest, Ross, had been established and that only at the threshold of Connemara.  Since then, we have made a start at three other centres&mdash; Cloosh Valley, 8,504 acres, Maam Valley&mdash;700 acres; Ballinahinch&mdash;1,305 acres, and I am expecting to get over soon a substantial area at Kilkieran Bay, where it is expected, with favourable conditions of shelter, that the plantations will run right down almost to the coastline.</P>
    <P>Take my own county, Mayo.  Since 1951, we have made a start on forestry in such areas as Doolough&mdash;1,377 acres, Nephin Beg and Nephin More&mdash;a total of 6,053 acres, at Lough Carra and at Tourmakeady.  Here, too, we have commenced planting preparations on the new area at Glenamoy and I hope shortly to take over some 1,400 acres at Shanettra, as the nucleus of still another centre in the Bangor Erris region.</P>
    <P>The southern block I mentioned has not the same potential for spectacular expansion, but here too we have added new forests at Killorglin&mdash;1,000 acres and Brosna&mdash;520 acres.</P>
    <P>These facts point clearly to the expansion which has taken place in western areas.  An even stronger indication is afforded by an examination of the trend of planting in recent years.  In 1938-39, planting in the congested areas came to 1,662 acres or 22 per cent. of the total area planted in that year.  I am about to give figures now which ought to interest Deputies, particularly those from the West of Ireland.  The area in 1951-52 was 3,975 <Col N="904" /> acres or 26.5 per cent. of that year's planting; in 1952-53 4,480 acres were planted, 36 per cent. of the total for that year and in 1953-54 and 1954-55 the areas planted were 4,740 acres and 5,095 acres respectively, about 38 per cent. of the total area planted in the respective years.</P>
    <P>If Deputies would just ponder for a moment on those figures, they will see a very steady but determined expansion in planting in the western areas. I would like Deputies also to take into account that the area planted each year was not static.  It was not the same each year, 5,000 6,000 12,000 acres.  The total area each year was increasing all over the country and, at the same time, the percentage of that increasing total was increasing in the West, according to the figures I have given.  Therefore, the Deputies who have put down the motion and who have supported it will see quite clearly that it is unnecessary and that actually we have been taking steps since 1948-49 along the lines I have just indicated.</P>
    <P>In the current planting season, 1955-56, we propose to plant in the area of the congested districts a total of 6,500 acres, approximately 43 per cent. of our programme for the country as a whole.  Deputies will note the manner in which the percentage of western planting advanced so spectacularly in 1952-53 and has continued to climb inexorably since.</P>
    <P>Further support for my contention is afforded by examination of the employment figures in recent years.  In March, 1949, there were 470 men employed in forests in the congested districts and the number rose to 700 in 1951.  In March, 1955, the number employed was 1190 and the figure at present is 1360.  Now have Deputies any doubt about the expansion in the congested counties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">

      <P>It is far too low.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that goes without saying.  That is not very helpful because there is no one more painfully aware of that fact than I am.  At the very least, that is a very nice increase. It shows that, whatever other Government Department may be accused of <Col N="905" /> slacking, the Forestry Department cannot because they are doing their utmost to improve the position.  I will give other figures to-night which will set Deputies thinking.</P>
      <P>Deputies will recognise that the majority of these forests are at the formative stage and the employment potential of such areas is much lower than that of a forest which has reached the later stages of development.  It follows that, without taking account of the inevitable expansion which is in progress, there is in our forests as they stand at present a rapidly expanding source of employment which will be of very real benefit to the congested districts.</P>
      <P>I hope Deputies will now realise what has been taking place in the congested districts.  From a planting rate all over the country of approximately 6,000 acres six or seven years ago, we have risen to 15,000 acres a year.  Deputy MacBride to-night threatened to bring down the Government&mdash;I think that was the term he used&mdash;if the planting rate was not increased.  Perhaps at this stage, a few words to Deputies who may not be quite familiar with the set-up of forestry generally will not be out of place.  I want to make one clear and emphatic statement, that the planting of 25,000 acres is easily within the competence of the Forestry Department, provided they have the land.  There is no trouble about labour or about money.  It will only take a short time to get the nurseries here to turn out the necessary number of transplants for 25,000 or 35,000 acres per year.  The whole thing hinges on the acquisition of land.  Deputy MacBride seemed to make fun of what happened in the past, during the war years; there was no barbed wire, not enough foresters and there was a shortage of hatchets.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Some people do not seem to be short of axes to grind. Perhaps these things did happen during the war years, but I am not sufficiently familiar with that to speak offhand.  There was a shortage of skilled foresters.  I remember, when Deputy MacBride was Minister for External Affairs, having a very serious <Col N="906" /> talk one day about it.  He told me as far as he was concerned we could go ahead and increase the number of forest trainees.  At the time, I think I doubled the number from ten to 20 per year.  This gives the Department a sufficient number at the present time.</P>
      <P>As I said, the whole question hinges on the acquisition of land.  I would like Deputies to clear the air and tell us what ground they stand on about the acquisition of land.  It is most remarkable that the Deputies who come from the western seaboard, from the rural areas, are just as cautious about the question of the acquisition of land as I am, coming from a farming district and a farming family myself. We can get plenty of land if we adopt Hitler's methods, but I am not going to do that.  If it means bringing down the Government, I will help to bring down the Government that will attempt to adopt any dictatorial methods, grabbing from the farmers what they have won so hard in the past.  If this State wants land for forestry, this State will purchase it and it will purchase it according to law, and not by any other method while I have responsibility.  I want everyone to know where this Government stands on this question.  There will be no confiscation of land because it is to the smallest and poorest of our farmers that the Forestry Department, if given compulsory powers of acquisition, would have to turn, and it is the poorest of our famers that the State machine would be used to crush down.</P>
      <P>I am having introduced a Bill which is going as far as humanly possible to go under the Constitution and as far as I am determined to go at the moment.  Both myself and every other member of the Government will oppose any attempt to acquire land compulsorily for forestry.  We have a body which acquires land compulsorily for the relief of congestion, but that is a different matter from going into a farmer's house and telling him: &ldquo;You get out of your farm and go where you like as we want it for growing trees.&rdquo;  If there is to be anything of that nature, I, for one, will head men with guns to defeat it.  It is for the good of everybody to know what a red hot question this is.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>It is red hot.  There are people who do not own a perch of land and who have no stake in the country, and they are the first to demand that land should be confiscated for forestry in this country.  I want to tell these people that if they want trouble through the taking of land, let them try and they will get more than they bargain for.</P>
      <P>Deputy Blaney mentioned that, in the case of commonage, the number of owners who ask to have their land acquired should be allowed to go ahead.  I take that as dealing with cases where the big majority of the owners are willing to sell.  But there are the one, two or three who are nearest to the common and who may have the capital to stock the common. These are the two or three people who are stocking the common and getting the grazing of 300, 400 or 1,000 sheep, because their neighbours cannot afford to pay the rent and rates.  Such people are actually stealing the other people's grazing.  As things are, we cannot establish a scheme whereby the 15, 16 or 18 people who are willing to sell out straight and fair can sell and at the same time despoil the other two or three who also have a share in the common.</P>
      <P>The Bill I propose will deal with that matter.  I intend to leave them their share in the common, but only their share.  Say, for instance, that we have 18 shareholders in the common, and there are 15 or 16 of these who are willing to sell.  What I propose to do is to buy these out.  I have taken the power to partition the common and leave the other two or three there.  If they find themselves left there with their own little bit, they will soon come around all right.  That is one of the clauses which I hope to put in the Bill.</P>
      <P>Deputy Glynn mentioned the question of the price paid for land for forestry.  I think he does not understand what happens and that he was mixing land purchase procedure with forestry.  We do not acquire land compulsorily for forestry.  In each case where land is acquired, it is a purely voluntary offer.</P>

    <Col N="908" />
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMGlynn" hpid="Mr. Glynn Mr. Glynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I made is that the prices offered for voluntary acquisitions are totally inadequate.  The farmers will not accept them.  I brought in the question of the price paid in the case of compulsory acquisition in comparison with the price paid in the case of voluntary negotiations.  The prices offered in the case of voluntary acquisition are almost the same as those paid in the case of compulsory acquisition and are completely inadequate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>My information is that our prices compare very favourably with the price of land in the locality. The land acquired for forestry is in most cases of low quality, but if there is a portion of good land in the lot we are buying for forestry, we buy it at a good high price.  In practically all cases, our prices are as good as, if not better, than prices in the locality.</P>
      <P>Deputy Alfred Byrne mentioned a point which I am anxious to reply to. He said that somebody had mentioned to him that it would be a pity if the Forestry Division interfered with the scenic beauties of Glengarriff.  Such is not the case.  Steps have been taken to go into the whole matter, so that, instead of interfering with the beauty, the operations will enhance it, if anything. I can give the Deputy that assurance.  I would be long sorry if anything like that should happen.  Just as in the case of other beauty spots, such as Cong, Killarney, pains will be taken to see that no destruction of the beauty will take place and they plan to do the work so that the beauty will be enhanced.</P>
      <P>I have not a whole lot more to say on this motion because I was practically certain that the Bill would have been in the hands of Deputies before the motion was reached.  I have given Deputy Blaney and others who have spoken an idea of some of the things which I hope the Bill will do.  There are other powers in it as well, and I will ask Deputies to peruse it very carefully between now and the time of the Second Reading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Lands is taking power in the Bill to go further than ever before.  Some of these things may <Col N="909" /> shock some ex-Ministers particularly when they look back on their own relations with the Minister for Finance in times gone by.</P>
    <P>Deputy Derrig mentioned Mr. Cameron's report of some years ago and referred to the plantable area.  The plantable, or survey, area is not a hard and fast matter.  He described it as a rough shot at the approximate area. It is a rough shot, and can only be a rough shot, because the land project and the arterial drainage schemes, and the work of the farmers themselves, are constantly changing the non-arable area of our country, but not to any outstanding extent.</P>
    <P>Early in May of this year, a Deputy put down a question to elicit information in regard to my attitude on the recommendation of the F.A.O.  Forestry Adviser that a special programme should be initiated.  In my reply, I stated clearly my attitude to the adviser's proposals and to the whole question of forestry in the West and the congested districts.  Mr. Cameron's recommendation was that the forestry programme should be confined to a rate estimated to meet half the country's requirements of commercial timber and that a social forestry programme of like dimensions should be inaugurated to promote employment without regard to the quality of the timber which might be produced.  I stated at that time that this recommendation was unacceptable and that the Department's policy must continue to aim at the expansion of commercial forestry operations to a level adequate to meet any foreseeable demand for timber in the country.</P>
    <P>I said, too, that I had encouraged my Department actively to pursue the development of submarginal lands for forestry purposes with the assistance of new techniques and that these advances would provide the solution to the problem of unemployment and emigration in these undeveloped areas. The objectives of the social forestry programme can thus be attained while still preserving all the fundamentals of good forestry practice.  This still remains my firm belief and there is adequate proof of the soundness of this <Col N="910" /> belief in the data which I have furnished. I see in this motion a support from the proposers for the policy which I am already pursuing in this whole matter.</P>
    <P>Most Deputies take a sane, levelheaded view of the whole question of forestry.  I am glad to see that.  Some Deputies are inclined to paint the picture to the country, that the Forestry Division is doing nothing.  I have no word to described that, except to say that it is cowardly black guardism in relation to officials who are doing one of the best jobs of work being done by civil servants.  No credit is reflected on anyone who indulges in that type of propaganda.</P>
    <P>It should not be forgotten that approximately 20,000 acres are being acquired per year.  We should be thankful that we have 50,000 acres of plantable reserve.  We are fast approaching the day, I hope, when we will attain a 20,000 acre programme. There will be nobody to clap louder than I will clap the day some Minister gets up in this House and says that they have passed the 25,000 acres target. The root of the trouble is the acquisition of land.  The acquisition of land must be done according to the law that this House makes.  If anybody thinks that he can drive me to use ruthlessly the compulsory powers of acquisition contained in the 1946 Act, he has another guess coming.  I will not do any such thing.</P>
    <P>I am very proud of the progress the forestry branch has made.  A figure of 15,000 acres is a very easy figure to mention in a debate in the House or on a public platform.  To the average person, who does not think, 1,500 or 50 is pretty much the same thing.  Let us consider what 15,000 acres really means.  It represents approximately 23½ square miles of country.  Fifteen thousand acres planted this year means that 23½ square miles of Mother Ireland will be covered with young forest. Just reflect on that.  That acreage would make a belt of forest one-quarter mile wide from Nelson Pillar in Dublin to the town of Loughrea in Galway, right across the Shannon. That is exactly what will be put down <Col N="911" /> this year.  That is what is being done by foresters all over the country.  That is another way to bring home to those who are talking glibly, through their hats, about planting what exactly is being done.</P>
    <P>Let us not forget that this is an agricultural country and that we are depending for our livelihood on agriculture, not on forestry.  Let us not forget that every 15,000 acres planted means approximately 20,000 acres taken from agricultural production, even if it is low production.  Let us not forget that if these 15,000 acres were not utilised for forestry purposes, they could be divided into economic holdings, enough to support 450 families a year.  These are just ways to look at exactly what we are doing and Deputies who look at it in that way will have food for reflection.  I recommend that consideration to those Deputies who never planted a tree and who never stood in a forest.  They may, perhaps, have driven along the road and have seen a forest on each side and remarked what a lovely thing it was to look at, but they did not know the amount of labour it represented from the day the owner of the land was first approached to sell it.</P>
    <P>If I am a bit harsh in my language, it is merely for the purpose of trying to keep the debate on a sane level.  I must thank Deputies on all sides of the House for the sane view they took.</P>
    <P>I am proud of what the Forestry Division are doing.  They are doing a magnificent job of work.  The new Bill, I hope, will make acquisition easier. Once the land comes in, there is no trouble in planting.  There is no shortage of money.  Deputy McQuillan seems to think that the Minister for Lands has to go for every penny he spends to the Department of Finance.  He has not.  He goes to the Government and has put into the Estimate whatever he wants and, if the Government cuts it down, that is the responsibility of the Government, not of the Department of Finance.  There again, it is making a cockshot of officials who cannot come in here to defend themselves.</P>
    <P>On the question of compulsory <Col N="912" /> acquisition, I will have none of it and will be the very first to oppose it.  I would not like to see the day that any Government or any Deputy would come into this House to re-establish the ruthless monster and to let it loose on the farmers to root them out of the holdings that Dillon, Davitt and Parnell secured for their forefathers not many generations ago, for the sake of gratifying those who would wish to put trees in their place.  I would like to see trees in this country, but we must go about it in the proper way and have first regard for the citizens.  They may be poor citizens, in the habit of going around with torn clothes, not very presentable in some cases; but there is just as good Irish blood in their veins as there is in the veins of many of their critics.</P>
    <P>When I say that the Bill is already circulated and when I have regard to the figures that I have given, in describing the rapid expansion of planting in the West, I am not being too ambitious when I say that the day should not be far off when 50 per cent. of the total planting of the country will take place in the nine congested counties.  I am not misleading the House by saying that and Deputies will not be able to accuse me in three or four years' time of being overambitious when I expressed that hope, here to-night, that 50 per cent.  of the planting will take place west of the Shannon.</P>
    <P>I find myself in the position that I cannot reject the motion and am forced to accept it, because the Deputies put down the motion knowing what was happening.  Deputy Derrig was Minister for Lands and must be well aware of the expansion taking place in the congested districts.</P>
