      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state the amount of fees paid per day to State counsel engaged on the inquiry into (i) the recent aircraft disaster at Shannon, and (ii) the aircraft crash near Birmingham.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>At the formal investigation of the accident to the K.L.M. aircraft PH-LKY in the estuary of the River Shannon on the 5th September, 1954, it was found necessary to engage senior and junior counsel on behalf of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, on behalf of the Attorney-General <Col N="322" /> and on behalf of certain State staff.  Each senior counsel was engaged at 150 guineas as fee on brief and at 40 guineas as refresher per day. Junior counsel were engaged at 100 guineas as fee on brief and 27 guineas as refresher per day.</P>
      <P>At the formal investigation of the accident to Aer Lingus aircraft EI-ACF on the 1st January, 1953, a senior and junior counsel were engaged on behalf of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The senior counsel was engaged at 40 guineas as fee on brief and 17 guineas as refresher per day.  Junior counsel was engaged at 30 guineas as fee on brief and 12 guineas as refresher per day.</P>
      <P>In the case of the K.L.M. inquiry it appeared that charges might be made against the Department of Industry and Commerce.  It was, therefore, undesirable that the case should be presented by counsel acting on behalf of the Minister for Industry and Commerce as was done at the inquiry into the Aer Lingus accident at Birmingham.</P>
      <P>Counsel for certain State staff were engaged at the request of the staff, but I considered that it would be unfair to require the staff to pay the costs involved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>One member of the Oireachtas was engaged on behalf of the State at the formal investigation of the accident to the aircraft PH-LKY on the 5th September, 1954.  The total amount of legal fees payable to him out of State funds amounts to £1,355 11s.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will introduce proposals for legislation to revise and control the conditions which may be attached to hire purchase transactions, particularly in regard to <Col N="323" /> the rate of interest which may be charged, the minimum deposit required, and the conditions of repayment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Hire Purchase Act, 1946, which regulates hire purchase transactions, brought our legislation on this subject up to date.</P>
      <P>The volume of complaint which has been received since the passing of that Act is not such as would make it necessary or desirable to have the Act amended.</P>

I think it was made quite clear during the debate that the limit of the liability the Government would undertake in connection with the abnormal flooding this year was the relief of distress.  It was not undertaken that the Government would commit itself to compensate every farmer in Ireland for losses of crops.</P>

That is provided for in every part of the country, <i>ad hoc</i> in the Shannon valley <Col N="339" /> and in the Tolka area, generally where distress arises, through the good offices of the Red Cross Society.  Any assistance that society may require effectively to discharge its function of the relief of distress due to the abnormal flooding, the Government, with the approval of the Dáil, will give.  The Government declared that it could not accept liability to compensate farmers all over the country for the losses of crops.  We all have had losses of crops this year.

      <P>I have received reports of flooding in many parts of the country, including the Moy area.  The most effective action for the relief of flooding depends on arterial drainage, and the survey of the Moy catchment area is now completed and is scheduled amongst the next six catchment areas for attention by the Arterial Drainage Section of the Office of Public Works.</P>

      <P>I am aware that objection has been made by one of the bodies mentioned to the erection of the proposed new bridge at Ardsallagh, Youghal.  I am not satisfied that there are any good grounds on which it can be assumed that the erection of the bridge at the site proposed will injure the interests of the local fishermen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that, on the statement made by those people, it will be absolutely impossible to cast their disc nets above the bridge and that five-eighths of the ground between the new bridge and the existing bridge will be absolutely useless for fishing?  That is their statement and I think it is serious enough for the Parliamentary Secretary to take note of it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O. Flanagan Mr. O. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must be aware that the decision to authorise the erection of the new bridge at the Ardsallagh site was taken following the holding of a public inquiry in October, 1952, by an inspector of the Department of Local Government at which interested parties were entitled to give evidence.  The Lismore Board of Fishery Conservators did not offer any evidence at that time.</P>

      <P>Yes but there was no evidence given at the inquiry by the board.  It is true to say that subsequently an objection was made to the inspector who conducted the inquiry and that the objection was very fully investigated by the engineering officers of the Department who were quite satisfied that there were no good grounds on which it could be assumed that the erection of the bridge at the site proposed would injure the fishermen. I may add, for the Deputy's information, that no additional evidence has since been received from the Lismore Board of Conservators or any other body that would warrant the opinion already expressed.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy refers to the areas in the vicinity of Belclare and Caherlistrane which suffered from abnormal flooding in December last.  I have had these areas inspected and am advised that they present swallow hole problems, the solution of which by normal arterial drainage works cannot be anticipated with any confidence.  In so far as the Belclare flooding was accentuated as a result of the overtopping of the right bank of the Clare river at Pollnamal and Clare-Tuam, this very rare occurrence will be prevented by the work at present in progress on the Corrib-Clare catchment. The remainder of the problems will be considered when a scheme for the Corrib-Shrule and Mask catchment is being prepared.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he will take steps to enable local authorities to make advances, before the houses are roofed, to purchasers obtaining loans under <Col N="354" /> the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts, and thus reduce housing costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 59 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1931, as amended by Section 23 of the Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1932, provides that where an advance is made under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts in respect of a house in course of construction, the advance may be made by instalments from time to time as the building of the house progresses, so that the total advance does not at any time before the completion of the house exceed 75 per centum of the value of the work done including the value of the borrower's interest in the site.  In practice local authorities do not issue the first instalment until the external walls and roof of the house are complete.  This requirement is intended to safeguard the interests of the local authority.  However, it is not a statutory requirment and it is open to any local authority to waive it if they are satisfied that undue risk is not involved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>It would require amending legislation to enable local housing authorities to administer the housing grants now administered in my Department.  New housing legislation is due to come up for consideration early next year.  It would be premature for me to express any opinion at this stage on the merits or practicability of decentralising this work.  The Deputy may take it, however, that this suggestion is one that has already come to my notice and that it, in common with many other suggestions for amendment of the housing law, will receive due consideration before legislation is introduced.</P>

      <P>As I have already said, the matter has been examined on many occasions and it has not been <Col N="356" /> considered that it is one which is practicable.

      <P>All aspects of the Youghal bridge project were fully examined arising out of the evidence tendered at the public local inquiry and the further representations and reports made since then.  The matters referred to by the Deputy were included in this examination. The authorities responsible for the new bridge are agreed that it should be sited at Ardsallagh.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary if he has ever looked at that report of the public inquiry and if he saw the evidence that was given there?  Is he further aware that the inspector at the public inquiry refused to consider certain evidence? Is he further aware that the Cork County Council, on one occasion at least, turned down the bridge at Ardsallagh and asked for reconstruction unanimously?  Of course, I am prepared to admit that that was on an occasion when the gentlemen on the county council of all Parties were depending on the people's votes, on the eve of a by-election.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is very well aware that following the results of a local inquiry held in 1952 the previous Fianna Fáil Minister for Local Government, his own colleague, Deputy Smith, was prepared to confirm the recommendation made by the inspector, namely, to proceed with the erection of the bridge at Ardsallagh. As a result of pressure brought to bear on the Minister at the time by Deputy Corry and members of Cork County Council an independent consultant was appointed and he was a native of the County of Cork, and that independent consultant confirmed the recommendation of the inspector, namely, that the bridge should be built at Ardsallagh. What further independent opinion could conceivably consider any further aspect of the case I do not know, but I do know this&mdash;and the Deputy will have to admit this&mdash;that were it not for his intervention at the time the bridge would have been built by now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>

But, of course, that does not matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am well aware that two independent consultants have confirmed the recommendations of the inspector who held the inquiry, that the two county engineers for Waterford and Cork agreed also, and that the engineering advisers of the Local Government Department confirmed the same recommendation.  I do not know what further independent opinion can be expected to deal with the matter, but I do know it is about time they started to build the bridge.</P>

      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £50,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1955, for Pensions, Superannuation, Compensation (including Workmen's Compensation), and Additional and other Allowances and Gratuities under the Superannuation Acts, 1834 to 1954, and sundry other Statutes; Extra-Statutory Pensions, Allowances, and Gratuities awarded by the Minister for Finance; fees to Medical Referees and occasional fees to Doctors; Compensation and other Payments in respect of Personal Injuries; etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A further sum of £50,000 will be required to meet the expenditure from this Vote in the current financial year, in addition to the net amount already provided, £813,030.  The additional expense arises on sub-heads A. and B. of the Vote which provide for the payment of superannuation allowances and <Col N="367" /> additional allowances (lump sums).  It is attributable to the fact that the incidence of retirement or death during the year among civil servants eligible for awards has proved greater than that for which allowance was originally made.  On the other hand, savings due to deaths of pensioners are less than anticipated.  Finally, the ante-dating of the Civil Service Arbitration Award to 1st November, 1952, required a revision of the pensions and lump sums paid to civil servants who retired between that date and 1st April, 1953.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Dillon) James M. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Dillon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  This is a simple Bill and purely an enabling one.  Its purpose is to empower county councils, where they so desire, to raise an increased agricultural rate, not exceeding a total rate of 10d. in the £, for the purposes of the agricultural schemes operated by the county committees of agriculture.  The annual income at present available for the service of the schemes of each committee of agriculture consists of an agricultural rate of not less than 2d. in the £ nor more than 7d. in the £ and a State grant related to the amount of the agricultural rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the enactment of the Agriculture (Amendment) Act, 1948, under which the maximum agricultural rate was raised from 4d. to 7d. in the £, all but two of the committees have obtained an agricultural rate higher than the former maximum.  Several of the committees are now in receipt of the existing maximum rate of 7d. in the £ and several others are in receipt of a rate of 6d. in the £ or higher. The income of the committees now receiving the maximum rate of 7d. is in nearly all cases smaller than the estimated cost of their agricultural schemes for 1954-55.  This position has arisen mainly because county advisory personnel have had to be steadily increased in recent years to cope with the demands for their services by the farming community, amongst whom there is a growing awareness of the importance of technical competence in efficient and economic farming.  At present the total number of advisory officers in the employment of the county committees is 269.  In 1948, the number was 185.  It is clear that, in the years immediately ahead, unless the committees now receiving the existing maximum rate of 7d. in the £, and others that in the meantime will go to that figure, are enabled to secure a larger income in the future they will be forced to reduce the scale of their activities.  Such a contingency would be most regrettable, having regard to <Col N="369" /> the important functions devolving on the committees of agriculture.</P>
    <P>The only solution of the difficulty is to amend the Agriculture Acts so as to empower the county councils, where they so desire, to raise an increased agricultural rate and to repeal the existing provision under which the maximum rate is fixed at 7d. in the £. The new maximum rate provided for in the Bill is 10d. in the £.</P>
    <P>As I have already said, the Bill is purely a permissive one.  It does not impose any mandatory duty on county councils to raise increased agricultural rates.  It merely empowers them to do so if they so wish, or, in other words, it is being left to the county councils to decide for themselves whether they wish to exercise the additional power provided under this Bill.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>Agreed to take the remaining stages now.</P>
    <P>Bill passed through Committee, reported without amendment, received for final consideration and passed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. O'Donnell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  One of the points in the 12-point programme of the inter-Party Government formed last June is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To restore democratic rights in respect of local government by amending the County Management Acts and giving to local authorities greater autonomy and effective power in local affairs....&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When speaking in reply to the debate on the Estimate for my Department, I announced my intention to find out at first hand what were the relations which existed between the elected <Col N="370" /> bodies and the managers.  I promised that I would visit every county and county borough in the country and seek out the views of the elected members and the managers on the question of the management system.  I did this in the course of the following months and I should like at this stage to express to the members of local authorities and managers with whom I have had contact my sincere thanks for their advice and assistance which I found most helpful in formulating the proposals contained in this Bill.  At the meetings with local authorities I listened to various criticisms made against the present system and to suggestions as to how it might be improved.  I have since given the most careful consideration to these criticisms and suggestions and I think I can fairly say that the present Bill meets the wishes of the vast majority of the local representatives with whom I spoke and that its provisions are intended to remove the defects which they brought to my attention.</P>
    <P>One of the main complaints of elected members against the present system is their lack of timely information about the affairs of the local authority.  While, under existing law, members are entitled to obtain from the manager any information they require, their general supervisory powers over the manager are effective only if prior information in regard to his proposals is available.  This was frequently brought to my notice with special reference to the allocation of tenancies of houses.  Many public representatives said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We do not wish to select the tenants ourselves, nor do we wish the legal allocation of a tenancy to be a reserved function.  What we do wish is that the list of eligible applicants as passed by the medical officer and the list of tenants proposed by the manager be discussed with us before houses are assigned to them.  The councillors' local knowledge may often be of value in correcting mistakes of fact in the assessment of housing needs.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I fully appreciated this case and I intended to provide specifically for <Col N="371" /> prior consultation by the manager with the elected body in regard to allocation of houses.  But there were other matters also on which some representatives desired to be consulted, for example, a decision to carry out a particular work by way of contract, the making of planning decisions under interim control, the course to be taken in connection with legal proceedings and so on.  When I came to consider the matter in its wider aspects, I decided that there was no reason why the elected body should not require that they be consulted by the manager in regard to any particular act or series of acts which he proposed to do before he actually did them, provided they themselves considered them of sufficient importance to wish to be consulted about them in advance.  I have, therefore, included in the Bill a section (Section 2) which I refer to as the &ldquo;consultation section&rdquo; which gives the members of the local authority the power to require the manager to notify them of his proposals before performing any specified executive function either in a particular case or in all cases of the performance of such function.</P>
    <P>Functions in relation to officers and servants and individual health functions are excluded from the scope of this section as the elected members' power of requisition, which I shall refer to later, does not extend to these functions.</P>
    <P>In regard to new works of a capital nature, sub-section (7) of Section 2 is included to ensure that the elected members must be informed in advance before the local authority is committed to any expenditure on such works.  On receipt of such information they may, under Section 3 of the Bill, require the manager not to proceed with the works in question provided they are not works which the local authority are required by law to undertake.</P>
    <P>Now we come to the exercise by the elected members of an effective system of control over the acts of the manager where they find, after consultation under Section 2, that he is unwilling <Col N="372" /> to meet their point of view.  At present they have the power (under Section 29 of the County Management Act, 1940, and similar provisions in the various City Management Acts) to require him to perform a specified function in a specified way.  I learned during my visits to the local bodies that this procedure was never invoked to any great extent, mainly because of the absence of power to obtain prior information as to the managers' proposals and also because the procedure involved is so cumbersome.  Under the existing law, the notice of intention to propose a resolution requiring the manager to do a particular thing must be signed by not less than one-third of the members and a date between seven and 14 days of the date of the notice specified for the holding of a special meeting at which the resolution is to be proposed. The resolution must be passed either by more than half the total membership of the local authority or by more than two-thirds of the members present and voting.  Section 4 of the present Bill is designed to provide a simple form of requisition in substitution for the existing cumbersome procedure. The notice of intention need only be signed by three members.  The resolution may be moved either at an ordinary meeting or at a special meeting. A simple majority of the members present and voting will be sufficient to carry the resolution provided the number voting for the resolution exceeds one-third of the total membership of the local authority.</P>
    <P>At present managers become appointed automatically on being recommended for the office by the Local Appointments Commissioners.  It is the function of the Minister to fix the date on which the manager on appointment is to take up duty.  This provision has caused the impression to be held by some local representatives that the manager is an officer of the Minister appointed by him, imposed on the local authorities and capable of being made subject to personal and extra-statutory directions from the Minister.</P>
    <P>In order that the true position may be understood by all local representatives, Section 5 of the Bill provides that the manager will be appointed on <Col N="373" /> the recommendation of the Local Appointments Commissioners by resolution of the appropriate local authority. This is to underline the important fact that the manager is an officer of the local authority by whom he is appointed in the same way as any other officer appointed on the recommendation of the Local Appointments Commissioners or otherwise.</P>
    <P>One of the most widely voiced criticisms of the present system is that the elected members of local authorities have not enough control over increases in staff or increases in remuneration. Many public representatives drew attention to the great increases which have taken place in the numbers of persons employed by county councils since the managers took control.  They admitted that such increases may have been warranted, but they pointed out that in many instances they were never made aware of the reasons for adding to the staff.  Section 6 of the Bill provides that a proposal to increase or decrease the number of permanent officers under a local authority may not be submitted by the manager for sanction without consent by resolution of the elected members and that the manager may not fix an increased or reduced rate of remuneration applicable to any class, description or grade of office or employment without similar consent by resolution.</P>
    <P>Under the law as it stands, the manager prepares the annual estimate of expenses and submits it for consideration at the annual estimates meeting. The elected members are thus placed at a disadvantage in their deliberations on the estimate, in that they have had no hand in its preparation. Section 7 of the Bill provides a new procedure.  Under it a local authority will elect from amongst its members an estimates committee to consist in the case of a county council of two members from each county electoral area and in the case of every other local authority of not more than one-third of its membership.</P>
    <P>The estimates committee will prepare the annual estimate of expenses. The manager, or an officer designated by him, will be required to attend each <Col N="374" /> meeting of the committee to give advice and information as required. The manager may furnish a separate report to the local authority if he is of opinion that the estimate prepared by the committee would seriously prejudice the efficient or economical performance of the duties of the local authority.  It shall also be the duty of the estimates committee from time to time to furnish the members of the local authority with whatever financial statements they require so as to keep informed of the position of the local authority's finances.  This is to meet the criticism voiced by some local bodies that for the greater portion of the financial year they are left in the dark as to the financial position of the local authority or that the information given is inadequate.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to give greater freedom to the elected members in dealing with the estimate of expenses at the annual estimates meeting.  Under existing law, the members of the local authority cannot at an estimates meeting make an amendment of the estimate to which the manager objects. Consideration of any amendment proposed must be adjourned to a special meeting and at that special meeting no new amendment can be considered. The provisions dealing with the procedure at estimates meetings in both the City and County Management Acts are being repealed and new provisions applying to all local authorities are included in Section 10.  This section enables local authorities to amend an estimate of expenses at the estimates meeting or at any adjournment thereof provided that the meeting may not be adjourned to a day outside the period of 21 days from the day on which the estimates meeting began.</P>
    <P>During the discussions I had with local representatives I was surprised to find that many of them appeared to be unaware of their powers, under the Management Acts, to make regulations prescribing the procedure to be followed in regard to the reception and examination of tenders.  I propose in Section 15, therefore, that there be an obligation on each newly elected council to make a formal decision as to whether to have regulations or not.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="375" /> This section will also provide that the regulations may extend to the seeking of tenders as well as to their reception and examination.</P>
    <P>Under Section 13 it is provided that the Minister may de-group any of the six pairs of counties grouped for management purposes on receipt of a request from each of two such grouped counties.  As a corollary to this it is proposed in Section 12 to allow the Minister to group two counties the councils of which have requested him to do so.  In Section 14 there are provisions enabling the present arrangement whereby the Dublin City Manager is also Dublin County Manager to be terminated.  Consequential provisions dealing with the Dublin assistant managers are contained in Section 22.</P>
    <P>Power is given to the manager under Section 17 to delegate any of his functions in relation to a local authority, with the approval of the Minister appropriate to the functions in question, to an approved officer of that local authority.  The manager will continue to be responsible for the acts of his delegate and he may revoke the delegation at any time.  He would thus be able to delegate to a responsible officer certain duties of a minor or routine nature and devote his time to his more important duties.</P>
    <P>I have included this section because I was informed that many managers are obliged to give an undue proportion of their time to the making of orders of a trivial or routine character and for that purpose to visit towns at a considerable distance from their headquarters on occasions when their journeys would not otherwise be necessary. This obligation arises out of the requirement that everything in the executive functions of a manager which formerly required to be done by resolution of the local authority should thereafter have to be done by the manager by signed order.</P>
    <P>The remaining sections of the Bill to which I do not make specific mention contain miscellaneous minor provisions designed to clarify or facilitate the administration of the Management Acts.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="376" /> This Bill will, I believe, provide much needed improvements in the management system and will, if I can judge from my experience at the many discussions I had with them, be welcomed by the public representatives.  I think I may say it represents the views of the local bodies all over the country.  It should help to engender a better atmosphere for the conduct of local authority affairs by the elected members and the managers jointly.  I believe the time is ripe for such a &ldquo;new look&rdquo; and I take this opportunity of acknowledging the cordiality and substantial unanimity with which the representatives of all the Parties assisted me in the examination of their problems in all the local centres.  I also think it right to acknowledge that my predecessor in the last Dáil introduced a Bill the contents of which contained somewhat similar provisions to those now included in Sections 6, 10 and 13 of this Bill, together with some of the minor provisions which I have not detailed in my present statement.</P>
    <P>This Bill is, I hope, presented in reasonably clear language for consideration by the members of this House.  We must, however, bear in mind that many members of local bodies lack the experience possessed by Deputies in reading and interpreting Acts of the Oireachtas.  When I pointed out to local authorities that their powers were set out in detail in the County Managements Acts, I received in many instances replies that suggested that either the Acts were not available to them or, if they were, they were unable to get from them a clear picture of their powers or of the procedure under which they might exercise them.</P>
    <P>I accordingly propose that, if and when this Bill is enacted by the Oireachtas, a memorandum of its contents and of the contents of the previous Management Acts (so far as unrepealed) will be circulated to every member of every local body and that each manager will thereafter be required to circulate copies of that memorandum to every member of the local bodies for which he is manager, following each local election.  The <Col N="377" /> memorandum will give in short and simple terms an account of the powers which the Acts confer on the elected representatives and of the methods by which these powers may be exercised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing very exciting in this Bill now before the House.  I am in no way surprised at that fact, because as the Minister has stated, an amending Bill introduced by myself had passed its Second Reading before the last election.  When the present Minister made his first public announcement I think he dealt with the County Management Acts.  I was rather surprised when he seemed to convey the impression that he had drastic intentions as far as these Acts were concerned.  Whether he had or not, or whether as a matter of fact he had given much thought at all to the subject, he seemed to speak in a way that suggested to me that he intended going very far towards restoring the position that existed prior to the introduction of the extension of the management system.</P>
      <P>I was wondering just how far he could go, and I hazarded the guess at the time that when he had an opportunity of thinking matters over, perhaps he would find that it would not be as easy as it seemed at a distance, and so we have before us a simple amending Bill which undoubtedly, as the Minister admitted, provides for a number of useful amendments, which I would regard as useful to the Management Acts: the right of the local representatives to determine whether or not the number of staff should be increased, the right of these elected people to determine the conditions under which they should serve&mdash;I mean as far as pay is concerned&mdash;the clarification of the position as far as the determination of the rate is concerned. All these are useful improvements which were, as has been stated, included in the amending Bill of 1953.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But there is a provision here which does not make sense to me, and the only reason I can find for its inclusion in the Bill is that it is intended as a sort of dressing-up to make it appear that there was something in these proposals that, in fact, the proposals do <Col N="378" /> not contain at all, as an effort to relieve this Bill of its bareness, and that is this proposal regarding the estimates committee.  Did any man ever hear of a committee of the county council being made responsible for the preparation of the estimates, or the committee of a corporation assisted by say the county manager, county secretary or some member of the staff?  Did anyone ever hear of a proposal to the effect that any member of a board of directors should be made responsible for that work, which is surely and clearly the responsibility of the manager?  I admit, of course, that you can say: &ldquo;Is it not an offer of further power to the local elected body?&rdquo; Even if we know in advance that it is a power they are not likely to exercise, it can always be said that if they do not exercise it why should they ask, why should they dispute or contend that powers have been taken from them by the Management Acts?</P>
    <P>I always thought that the way in which&mdash;in most counties anyhow&mdash;this business was done, even before there was a Management Act at all, was the correct procedure, and that was that the estimates were prepared by the secretary of the county council and later by the manager, I suppose, in consultation with the secretary.  If the county council so decided, they had an estimates committee to which the estimates were referred.  That committee went into those estimates very thoroughly and after they had completed their consideration of them they reported back to the body as a whole. They in turn discussed them item for item, having there the officials who were responsible for their preparation and who would be called upon to justify each provision that was proposed there.</P>
    <P>Just think of the nonsense which a provision such as is included here means.  Where you have in a county four electoral areas, it means asking eight members of an electoral body to come together and actually prepare the estimates.  If they do not prepare those estimates it will fall, as it should, as the duty of the manager to see that they are prepared.  I am not saying a provision like this will do any <Col N="379" /> harm, but it seems to me purposeless to include it when every sensible man knows it will never be used and should not be used.  Think of the time that will be wasted by these eight, ten or 12 individuals who will form this estimates committee.  Think of the number of occasions on which they will have to assemble and of the number of occasions on which they will have to have local officials before them.  Do we not know that that is not a practicable proposition in any shape or form?</P>
    <P>There is nothing in the Bill that is not all right, as far as I know, except that one provision.  Even that is a harmless kind of thing and I venture to say that it will not be used in any single case by any local authority.  It is a complete reversal of the way in which all business institutions go about their work.  Although this Bill might look a little plainer without such a provision, I still think it would be better without it.  I would be inclined to ask the Minister to reconsider this matter and to follow the procedure that has been adopted all down the years and which has proved in regard to this question to be quite satisfactory.</P>
    <P>When the previous amending Bill was before this House I remember, in concluding the Second Reading discussion, saying to all the Deputies here: &ldquo;This surely is not a political matter&rdquo;.  I have heard the management system discussed and criticised in this House by Deputies over a long number of years and I have heard that criticism down the country as well.  I think we can now approach a Bill like this in the way I was prepared to approach it in 1953 by extending to every Deputy in the House, representing whatever Party, whatever interests he might, an open invitation to put down considered amendments and, with the experience we have now gained from the operation of this system, to let us have a clear and open discussion.  We could in fact leave to the House the determination of any question that might be raised on the amendments as to the improvements <Col N="380" /> that might be effected in the managerial system.</P>
    <P>I do not think that even if those who have been talking glibly about the disadvantages of that system were given the freedom they would take responsibility for its abolition.  In regard to the previous proposals that were introduced here, I was just glancing at some of the speeches that were made on the Second Reading debate and they were all along the lines that what I was proposing was not revolutionary, and so on.</P>
    <P>We have another Bill here emanating from other sources which is in or about the same, and it is in or about the same for the reason that people have come to understand how difficult local administration has come to be. Even members of local bodies have come to understand that local affairs and local administration are so complicated that those members could not be expected to give the time that would be necessary if they were to do justice to their task.</P>
    <P>The management system, therefore, has come to stay.  The amendments that are proposed here will be helpful. They will restore some further responsibility to the elected representatives and they will maintain what I think is very desirable, a fair balance between what is to be in future the responsibility of the manager and the responsibility of the elected representatives. I have nothing but approval to offer in relation to the proposals here except for the fact that I do not like the provision to which I have referred and I would be glad if it could be eliminated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister was in any doubt as to whether his Bill was a success or not he need be in no doubt now when he has heard what his predecessor has had to say.  I am a member of a local authority and I have always been an opponent of the managerial system, often a lone wolf. However, I have come around to see for myself that there are certain functions that a manager must have. The statements which the present Minister for Local Government has made might have appeared to be revolutionary but he was brave enough <Col N="381" /> to go around to every county council in the country, consult them freely and openly as to what they thought, what they wanted, what functions they would like to have restored or what functions they would like the manager to continue with.  I was present at one of those conferences and the Minister put the question straight: &ldquo;Do you want all your functions restored?&rdquo; I personally said I did but my colleagues said &ldquo;no, they did not,&rdquo; and they did not want to have anything to do with the employment of staff.</P>
      <P>There are several other things which the manager has, as his reserved functions, that they were prepared to let him have.  However, managers have often employed staff and officers without consulting the council and it has often been a source of great annoyance to the members of local councils to read in the newspapers that more staff and more officers were to be employed &mdash;especially when members of the public would question them about the matter and their only knowledge would be what they had just read in the newspaper about it.  The Minister is giving the council power, by requisition, to prevent the manager from spending money on doing things they do not want him to do.</P>
      <P>Deputy Smith mentioned estimates committees.  He says the councils will be wasting their time drawing up estimates.  I have not as low an opinion as that of our county or borough councils.  I would not consider it a waste of time or a waste of the time of any councillor to have one's say in the drawing-up of estimates.  In my view, it is a power we should always have and I am grateful to the Minister for it.  Estimates were always prepared by officials behind closed doors and handed out to us practically as a <i>fait accompli.</i>  This departure by the Minister is good and I compliment him on it.  While on the subject of estimates committees I suggest that the Minister should allow the number to be greater.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come now to the appointment of a manager.  I do not like the Local Appointments Commission.  I never liked it and I never will like it.  I <Col N="382" /> might say, at first, that I am not trying to make a job for anybody.  I just want to say that there was an official in Waterford&mdash;and he is not a man who would vote for me&mdash;who, in my view, got a very raw deal.  He was a very able and competent official.  He had not university qualifications.  When a vacancy occurred in a rank higher than his own he should have been promoted to it.  The trouble, of course, is that, when such a man might go for interview before the Local Appointments Commissioners, some young man who might have some small experience as a county councillor, but who might have had a distinguished university career, would beat him.</P>

I consider that the Minister has given back to local authorities the powers that councillors and members of corporations all over the country asked him to restore.  He took a consensus of opinion and acted accordingly upon it in the Bill.  I welcome this Bill and I am glad that I am a member of this House to welcome it.</P>

      <P>I have very few words to say about this Bill except that I should like to recall to the House the circumstances under which the county management administration commenced back in the 1940s.  In the period about 1944-45, a number of representations were made to the then Minister for Local Government suggesting that the powers of the county managers were too wide and that they were keeping themselves too aloof from their county councils.  Two separate memoranda were sent in the years 1945 and 1946 to all members of local authorities throughout the State pointing out that there could be a reasonable interpretation of the extent to which county managers should co-operate <Col N="383" /> with members of local authorities and that there were a number of things that could be done by local authorities which although not expressly named in the County Management Act were, nevertheless, possible to be done without breaking the law.</P>
      <P>There are certain sections of this Bill which are simply legal repetition of suggestions given at that time to members of local authorities as to how they could interpret the County Management Act at that time.  For example, it was made perfectly clear that there was no reason why members of local authorities should not form estimates committees and roads committees to discuss in considerable detail and in their own time the estimates for the county council.  The only difference in this Bill is that it states a definite procedure and announces that there must be a given time of 21 days between the commencement of discussions on the estimate and the time the estimate is closed.  I may be wrong but, so far as I know, there is nothing to prevent a county council, in an informal manner, from doing that to-day&mdash;and they need not call the estimates committee the &ldquo;estimates committee&rdquo; if they do not want to.  At the present time, there is nothing to prevent them from discussing estimates before the period in which they have to be passed and before the rate has been struck.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come now to the section of the Bill in which a county council may direct a county manager to do certain things. So far as I know, there are quite a number of county councils at present where there is a friendly co-operation between the county manager and the members of the local authority.  In the ordinary way, the county manager submits proposals and takes advice, when given, by the local authority.  There are county councils to-day where although the county manager can increase the staff, if he so desires, without the consent of the local authority, in fact there can be informal deliberations on that matter.  I am not objecting to that being made legally enforceable.  I want merely to say, in defence both of the more efficient local authorities and the more co-operative managers, that many of the things recommended in this Bill <Col N="384" /> are being done in an informal way to-day in a number of county councils. I am glad the Minister has now put these into legislation so that they can be done in legal form.  I wanted to make that statement because at this time&mdash;back in the 1940s&mdash;we took very great trouble to try and make for a very flexible procedure.</P>
    <P>I am extremely glad the Labour Party have not had their way on this occasion in regard to one section, which was in the last County Management Bill but one, in which it was understood that members of local authorities could give or withhold home assistance.  We considered that a highly undesirable feature of that Bill &mdash;undesirable, because it is generally considered to be a good principle of democracy that the people who have the giving of money for a particular service should not be the same people as those who decide who shall have it. We considered that there should be some independent authority between them and the givers.  Such a system works for honest administration and impartiality of administration in this and every other democratic country of the world.  I am very glad to see that that particular feature is not in the Bill now before us, because it would seem to me to be introducing a system which all of us would wish not to have in this country.  Apart from that, I have very little more to say on the Bill except to express agreement with the statement of Deputy Smith that some of the sections can best be discussed in Committee and to say that I am glad this Bill resembles to a considerable degree the Bill we had in mind before we left office.  I hope the Bill will result in greater and more friendly co-operation between managers and local authorities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to congratulate the Minister on introducing the Bill. I believe that the Minister went to a lot of trouble to ascertain the views of members of county councils all over the country.  He visited every county, discussed the particular problems of local government with members of each county and, as a result of that, we have the Bill now before the House. I think that all Parties will agree that <Col N="385" /> it is a move in the right direction and that it restores to local bodies many of the powers which they formerly held.  Some people may feel that the Bill does not go far enough, that it is not restoring to local authorities all the powers that should be given back, but I believe that when the Minister interviewed the members of various county councils and corporations, he found that that was not the view that they held.  I know that when he visited the county council, of which I am a member, members definitely agreed that they were not anxious to have all the powers formerly held by county councils given back.  The different parts of the Bill will definitely give considerably more power to county councils than they now possess, as large powers as members of the county councils require.</P>
      <P>Deputy Smith referred to the proposed estimates committee and considered that it would be valueless.  I believe that that is a very useful part of the Bill because under the present position when an estimate is presented by the manager, very little opportunity is given to members of county councils of going into every detail at an estimates meeting.  If an estimates committee is set up, I believe the members of that committee will have time to examine the estimates fully, although it does not necessarily mean that they will prepare the estimates. The intention is that they will examine every portion of the estimate with the manager and the officials and any doubts which they may have in regard to any particular matter will be cleared up.  Then, when the council meets, members will be in a position to examine the estimates fully and have all their problems smoothed out.  My experience is that under the present system it is very difficult to get all the points raised clarified.  I think, therefore, that an estimates committee can be very useful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposal in another portion of the Bill giving powers to the county councils to deal with tenders is also a very important innovation.  In the past it has been our experience, in regard to tenders for housing schemes and large schemes of that nature, that <Col N="386" /> one knows nothing of what is happening with a big tender of that type until it appears on the papers.  That seems to be an extraordinary position.  You just know no more about it than any member of the public.  That state of affairs will be changed by this Bill and tenders can in future be examined by members of the county council.  I think that the Bill on the whole is a very useful measure and that it will help very considerably to solve the difficulties and the problems which have confronted members of county councils up to the present.  County councils definitely were not looking for the restoration of full powers.  This Bill, however, goes some distance towards restoring a more equitable balance in local administration.  It is taking some of the important functions and powers, the possession of which by the county manager was regarded as objectionable, and proposing to hand them over to the local bodies.  I think the Bill will help considerably to smooth local administration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other Deputies who have already spoken, I must say that generally I am in agreement with the Bill now before the House.  I should like to congratulate the Minister on introducing it, particularly as it very closely resembles the measure which the previous Minister brought before the House a year ago.  The outstanding feature about it, a feature that will go down as something worth while in regard to the Bill, is the inference that may now be justifiably drawn, that the present Government just as the previous Government are satisfied that the County Management Act is something that is necessary, something that we cannot do without. I am glad, for that reason, to see this Bill coming from the present Government so that, once and for all, this question may be removed out of politics and out of public life from every platform in the future, this question of the County Management Act which was condemned roundly by the Parties composing the present Government when it suited them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A typical example of their attitude to it is indicated by a few of the <Col N="387" /> expressions which I have taken at random from the report of the debate on the Bill brought in by the last Minister in February of last year.  Deputy Blowick, speaking on the 25th February, said that the County Management Act was a first-class administrative blunder.  He said, on the same date, that the 1954 Amendment Bill was a shabby attempt to catch up with what was originally a bad Act.  I wonder whether Deputy Blowick, and many others who expressed similar opinions in our day, are now satisfied that the County Management Act is not so bad, that in fact it is something on which we can build a proper county administration in future, an administration that has grown over recent years out of all proportion to what one would have expected some 20 years ago.  The services now being rendered by local authorities absolutely rule out, by the nature of the wide field they cover and the amount of work that must be done administratively, any question of giving back to local representatives all the powers that they held in the old days when they had very little to do in comparison with councils of to-day.</P>
    <P>In regard to a point that has already been raised by Deputy Smith, I agree with the principle of Section 17, the establishment of estimates committees and giving them statutory authority. While agreeing with the principle, I think, like Deputy Smith, that the manner in which it is proposed to operate it is not a workable proposition. Take, for instance, Donegal County Council.  We have a system working at the moment which is a purely voluntary co-operative system between ourselves and the manager and which, if given statutory effect, would be an ideal system.  I think that is what is aimed at in the section but, from the way it is worded, the section is not very clear.</P>
    <P>Our system is, briefly, that we set up an estimates committee to which the manager, guided by his officials from the various branches of the county council, brings the estimated demands <Col N="388" /> on our finances for the coming year. Having got those demands made out in detail, we then sit down and we take time &mdash;someone on the other side of the House suggested we would have to take time in the future&mdash;to consider these demands; we take approximately four full days on estimates in conjunction with the various executives of the different sections of the county council and with the manager in attendance. We go through the estimated demands for the coming year.  We query any item that we think should be lower.  In some cases we may think the demand is not adequate.  If general agreement is got around the table amongst the seven, eight or ten members appointed as an estimates committee, the manager, in consultation with the officer in charge of the particular section, usually agrees to try to reduce by a reasonable amount the figure set down, if that is considered desirable by the committee; on the other hand, if a good case is made, the estimated demand may be increased.  That system operates very well in our county.  Under the present measure statutory authority could be given for such a system.</P>

      <P>Paragraph 5 of the White Paper provides that a local authority shall elect from amongst its members an estimates committee, and it goes on:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="389" />&ldquo;It will be the duty of the estimates committee to prepare the annual estimate of expenses and to furnish the members of the local authority with financial statements in such manner and at such intervals as the local authority may direct.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the explanation of the section to which I refer and that procedure is the procedure which I think is unworkable. My fear is that it will work in a negative way because it will be the duty of the estimates committee under this to produce the estimates: in other words, to make up the estimates for the year.  That is different from the system which I know now works very well in my own county; that is the system whereby the manager prepares the estimates in advance, presents them to the committee and lets the committee fine-comb them; and subsequently, the results of that examination are presented as a joint effort to the council.  It appears to me, though I may be under a misapprehension, that this proposed committee will actually be expected in the first instance to provide a detailed estimate of expenditure for the year, or to bring out a balance sheet at any other time at which they may be requested to do so by the council.</P>

That is a system to which I would like to see legislative authority given.  Perhaps it would be better to leave this until the Committee Stage, as the Leas-Cheann Comhairle has suggested, but I hope I have conveyed to the Minister some idea of what I have in mind.  Any change he can bring about without adversely affecting the principle underlying the idea would meet the requirements, I think, of quite a number of people on this side of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the conferences held by the Minister, I agree that the idea <Col N="390" /> of going to the county councils was a very good idea.  It had, however, the defect that only the chairmen and vice-chairmen of committees were invited to attend; it so happened in Donegal that the vice-chairman was not invited.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">

      <P>I understand it, but I still think that had there been a greater number of selected members present the results might have been even more satisfactory.  But, as things are now turning out, I do not think we will hold that against the Minister or his Department.</P>
      <P>There is one matter upon which I would like to have some clarification. I have referred to it on previous occasions.  Possibly it is covered in the Bill in a roundabout way.  In connection with the letting of houses, Section 2 provides that the manager shall inform the members of the local authority of his proposals.  I have no wish to have the letting of cottages given back to councils as such.  I believe the present system should continue in operation, with this added safeguard: at the present time the county medical officer of health draws up his list; the manager goes through that.  Now the safeguard I wish to have added is that, before the manager finally makes his order, the list should be presented to the council so that if members of the council have any information at their disposal which might have the effect of altering the agreed priority, that information can be given before the order is actually made.  I understand that such an order, once made, is irrevocable.</P>

      <P>We welcome the introduction of the present measure in so far as it goes one step further towards putting power back into the hands of local representatives and, in doing so, removes a little more of the power out of the hands of the appointed managers.  However, I am somewhat worried as to whether or not under sub-section (3) the manager does not still retain all his powers because in sub-section (2) provision is made for the council to direct the manager to report on his proposals; mark, he is only to report.  Now sub-section (3) quite definitely and clearly excludes certain of his functions.  I feel that particular section can do with some further examination.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Notice taken that 20 Deputies were not present; House counted and 20 Deputies being present,</i>
      </P>
      <P>With regard to the provisions in the Bill concerning the appointment by local authorities of estimates committees I am inclined to agree to some little extent with Deputy Smith when he expressed the view that there might be some difficulty in carrying out the provisions in full.  However, I would suggest that where the Bill provides that the estimates committee in certain cases would consist of one-third of the members, this provision might be amended and the local authorities themselves afforded an opportunity of fixing the number to be appointed to the estimates committee.  It is true that certain authorities do examine the estimates each year very carefully but there has been a difficulty.  The difficulty exists up to the present&mdash;and I think will exist until this Bill goes through the House&mdash;that the estimates being examined by the committee are the estimates produced and submitted by the city or county manager.  Those estimates already have been prepared in many cases by principals of the various departments and have been submitted most likely to the manager. They may have been improved upon or they may have been increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill, in providing an opportunity for the elected members of the local authority to discuss the actual preparation of the estimates and to discuss, <Col N="392" /> before the final draft is made, the proposed expenditure under every heading each year, is I think doing a service.  Whether the local authority concerned operates these provisions or not is a matter for the particular local authority.  Provision is made whereby, if the local authority fails to do so, the preparation of the estimates will be carried out in time to have them passed.  The Bill does provide certain improvements to the various Management Acts.  It does provide some little restoration of powers to the councils and for those reasons I welcome its introduction.  I would, however, conclude on the note on which I opened&mdash; that I feel sub-section (3) of Section 2 might be examined again with a view to ensuring that a power which is apparently given to the elected representatives is in fact a reality and not an illusion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite satisfied with the Bill, too, and should like to congratulate the Minister on not having put into it things which were threatened and foreshadowed as a result of previous references.  We had before the House last year a similar Bill and in view of the fact that we had a similar Bill which passed at Second Reading, people were inclined to think from references made by the Minister time and again that this Bill would propose drastic amendments to the much maligned Managerial Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>So it does.  That is the reason why I congratulated the Minister because he did not include the things he had threatened and which we were led to believe might have been included in this Bill.  If he had said we were satisfied with the Bill before the House already we would expect just the Bill we have got.  We are glad to have got that.  I agree with most of what is in it, but when the Minister made references to serious changes which he proposed to make we all awaited something much more drastic. We are glad we did not get that kind of a Bill and congratulate the Minister that he did not succumb to those early <Col N="393" /> temptations to which he gave expression at the outset.  This Bill does nothing more than give statutory effect to what was already in practice where there was goodwill between managers and elected representatives.  That is exactly what this Bill is and that is what the Bill introduced by the Minister's predecessor also included.  It may not be the practice in all counties to have consultations between the managers and the local authorities; it may not be the practice in certain counties for the managers to take into their confidence the members of the local authorities, but in so far as I can see the provisions in this Bill give statutory effect to what was already in practice in counties where good relations existed between the managers and the elected representatives.</P>
      <P>To my mind that is a vindication of the Managerial Act and I should like to reiterate what Deputy Blaney has said that we welcome this Bill in so far as it signifies the approval of the anti-Fianna Fáil sections of the House of the Managerial Act.  Often we had to contest local elections in the past knowing that in every election since the managerial system came into existence we had to listen to candidates representing themselves as opposing the managerial system by their frequent allegations that they were deprived of powers; that it was not their fault that people were deprived of powers which the local representatives should have; that Fianna Fáil were responsible for that incongruous Act.  Naturally the inference to be drawn from that type of campaign was that at the first opportunity the County Management Act would disappear. The present Minister and anyone who has any common sense must know that, having regard to the volume of work at present being dealt with by local authorities, it would be impossible to have that work carried out by an elected body that had the same powers as elected bodies had prior to the enactment of the County Management Act.  It simply could not be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his opening statement the Minister referred to powers which local authorities had under the County Management <Col N="394" /> Act and said that Section 29 of the 1940 Act was not invoked.  That is quite true.  We felt that, while it was not necessary to invoke those powers, the powers provided for in that section served a useful purpose.  The very fact that the manager and the elected representatives knew that those powers existed was in itself a safeguard and obviated the necessity to invoke the powers.  The sections in the present Bill will serve the same purpose.  It will not be necessary to invoke them because the manager will know that these powers exist and the elected representatives will know they exist.  For that reason the harmony which has existed in the past will continue and the Bill we are now discussing will have no marked effect where matters were already running smoothly.</P>
    <P>There has been contention regarding the section which requires an estimates committee to be set up.  Personally I am not inclined to take the same view as some Deputies have expressed with regard to these powers.  I agree that it is not necessary to have the section worded as it is but I do not take the view that the estimates committee will have to get down to it with their coats off to prepare the estimates each year. They will use the council's staff to prepare the estimates, as has been done in the past, and will go into them to see where they can be curtailed or increased and their word will be the last word so far as the estimates are concerned. That is my view about the estimates committee.  At a glance one might think that is was imposing a burden on the committee which it would not be capable of performing and would not have the time to carry out.</P>
    <P>I may on Committee Stage ask the Minister to amend that section somewhat. I do not think it is right that an estimates committee should be formed on the formation of a new council and allowed to continue until the expiration of that council's life.  The estimates committee should be appointed annually and should be constituted each year at the annual meeting so that membership of the committee would rotate and members would have a chance of serving on the estimates <Col N="395" /> committee.  In that way all members of a local authority would have the experience of acting on the estimates committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Sub-section (2) of Section 7 provides for that: &ldquo;A local authority may by resolution revoke the appointment of an estimates committee.&rdquo; They may revoke it at any time.  In case there is any doubt I will certainly bear the Deputy's observations in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not desirable that the same members should act on the estimates committee during the lifetime of the council.  It is not necessary for me to repeat what Deputy Blaney has outlined in regard to Donegal County Council where the estimates committee is appointed each year.  That estimates committee on some occasions has worked until 1 a.m. paring down estimates which had to go before the council.  It is wrong to say that there was a complete rehash of all that work by the council.  The general body of the council were glad to know that the estimates were reduced even by the smallest degree and their only desire was to reduce them still further.  There was no rehash of all the work already done. The estimates committee were working satisfactory and were proving to be a very useful committee of the council.</P>
      <P>There are some sections which one would like to see amended on Committee Stage.  By and large, the Bill is by no means revolutionary.  The tendency is to give extra powers to the elected representatives but, on the whole, the Bill is a vindication of the managerial system.  Now that all Parties in the House have subscribed to the managerial system, we can settle down for all time agreed that the system is good, that it is necessary and that it shall continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lynch said how brave the Minister was to face the county councils. We are a civilised group and we welcome Ministers when they visit us. I am sure the Minister secured some useful information.  When one reads the Bill one is inclined to ask the <Col N="396" /> Minister was his journey really necessary. Perhaps it was inasmuch as the Minister was satisfied that, with the exception of some small details, the people generally were satisfied with the managerial system as operated under the various Acts.  I do not think that anybody will quarrel with it as everybody in this House admitted in the past that the Act was on trial, that it was going through a probationary period and was subject to periodical review with a view to improvement. This Bill is one of the improvements, I hope.  As time goes on, other Ministers or other Governments may see fit to make further amendments so that in time it will become the perfect instrument of the local authority and the legislation will enable local authorities to carry out the increasing volume of business.</P>
    <P>I approve of most of what is in the Bill but I expected that there would be more in it having regard to statements made by members who are now on the Government side of the House when they were in opposition.  I would have liked to see some of the load removed from local authorities.  I would have liked some of the burden to have been shifted to the central authority.</P>

      <P>I want to quote <Col N="399" /> what the Minister said in discussing the previous Bill:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If we are going to curb the power of county managers in regard to the employment of staffs and increases in remuneration in future, I think we should give some thought to the past and to cases where redundant staffs have been employed.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister goes on then to make the suggestion that the legislation should be made retrospective and suggests that rate collectors are not essential, that the rate demand could be issued through the postal service and collected in the same manner.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">

      <P>That may result in one county abolishing rate collectors and another county allowing them to remain, creating a position where there would be no uniformity in the system. The Minister should have been bold enough to take a definite step one way or the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, I wish to refer to the fairness <Col N="400" /> of the Bill.  As some Deputies said, it is not a revolutionary one, it contains no particularly exciting proposal and merely gives statutory effect to what was already done in practice where there were good relations between the manager and the elected representatives.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>With some of the remarks of Deputy Brennan I agree. It is as we go along that we see the flaws in various Acts.  We have seen them in the past and have been able to take some action.  Until this Bill has been in operation for some time we will not see the points in it which need attention.  It would be fantastic for anyone to suggest that it will not be necessary to have further amending legislation to improve it as time goes on.  Various members have been able to get up here and discuss these things in a frank and sincere manner as members of local authorities.  It is an advantage to see that we are discussing this matter, not simply as politicians but as representatives of local authorities, trying to get a system compatible with the true sense of local government.</P>
      <P>Deputy Blaney mentioned the letting of houses.  We have been continuously pointing out the importance of operating a system such as he mentioned this evening, whereby the advice and information of the members of county councils is put at the disposal of the manager and the county medical officer.  If we are coming to the stage where that advice is at their disposal, they will be able to tighten up flaws that exist in various areas.  That would be an advantage in supporting a measure like this.  However, there will be time to discuss that on the Committee Stage.  As those who have spoken already have covered most of the points, it would be fantastic for us to keep others from speaking now who may have other points to put forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two items I wish to deal with.  I am interested in Section 9, which Deputy Brennan mentioned, but from a very different angle.  I agree with the section, in regard to the estimates committees, but as a member of a local authority in a county with <Col N="401" /> 46 members, this section could not possibly give us the satisfaction we need. We are at present dealing with estimates of the local authority for the coming financial year, amounting to about £4,000,000.  We are entitled to ask the Minister, in regard to the setting up of the finance committees, with two members from each electoral area, how long they would take to do the job.</P>
    <P>It is fantastic to set up an estimates committee unless they are going to do the job.  How long would it take these members to go through and consider to the best of their ability an estimate amounting to £4,000,000 in the year? When that would be done&mdash;it is, of course, intended that during the whole discussions, which would be essential, they would get the advice of the manager or his officials&mdash;have we any guarantee that after all that length of time that those members of the estimates committee might take in going through it, it will shorten the discussion on the estimates themselves? Personally, I believe it would not.  I believe it is fantastic to think that members of a local authority could, by being put on to an estimates committee, devote as much of their time as would be necessary to make a success of a committee on finance of this nature.  There is no need at this stage to dwell any further on it.</P>
    <P>The other section I would like to mention is, I think, Section 18.  I fully understand the right and necessity of the managers to have the power of delegation in connection with their duties.  That is essential, but I do believe that it would be more advantageous for everyone concerned &mdash;the managers, officials and members &mdash;if this power were delegated, as it were, after each election period.  At the present time in the different counties we have county surveyors and if at any time the county surveyor is ill or away on leave or anything like that, the man who is taking his place is known to all the members.  I have seen&mdash;as other members will have seen &mdash;orders made by a deputy for a county manager.  We see those after they have been made, but we never <Col N="402" /> knew that such a man was acting for the county manager.  I believe it would be possible after each local election, when there will be old members going out, maybe, and new members coming in, to have it made known to the members to whom such powers are being delegated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 2 will give that power, Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but my point is that I am quite prepared to say that on paper that does apply, but I am not prepared to say, bearing in mind our experience of the different interpretations which county managers and law advisers have put on these things in the past, that it will apply in practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally I should say this.  The members are satisfied.  Deputy Brennan said he was pleased it did not go any further.  As a whole the members agree there are certain advantages in this Bill.  Under Section 4 we had problems which we thought might arise and at first glance it did not seem it would be of any help in solving them but we now believe we can utilise that section to the advantage of the local authorities and the people whom they represent.  One thing which is missing in this Bill and to which I would like to draw special attention, is that there is no mention whatsoever in it about one association that we hear a good deal about and that we all know carries out some extraordinary functions and extraordinary decisions.  This is a City and County Management Bill and we realise that without a manager we could not have such a Bill, but I still say that if we are to have local government as we want it, and if we are to have democracy as we want it, for the betterment of the system of local government in this country we should have less of the county manager's association.  It is not what is being done in the open that worries some of us; it is what can be done between a Minister and his Department and such an association.  Even at the present time, a trade union or any such negotiating body is supposed to have a negotiating licence, but can any Minister for Local Government or any <Col N="403" /> other Minister show where there is such a thing as a negotiating licence for this association?  I am worried about this because I believe some of us are in an extraordinary position when we speak on this Bill because we have had the happy experience of having had the co-operation of good managers, but that does not relieve us of our responsibility in connection with this Bill.  As long as there is a county managers' association operating behind closed doors, as long as circulars can go from the Minister and his Department to that association, we are not going to have proper local government in this country.  I know the Minister believes he is doing well in introducing this Bill and we are hoping for the best, but inside this House, perhaps, as well as outside some of us are determined to make it quite clear to the Minister, his Department and the county managers that because of our determination to make local government the success we want it to be we will have to make sure that everything possible we can do to smash the grip of the county managers' association in this country will be done by us as members of local authorities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>This question of amending the County Management Act has been under discussion for many a year now and to my recollection the first experience I had of this matter was in 1948 when it was a subject in the general election campaign.  The inter-Party Government between 1948 and 1951 made efforts to amend the Management Act and they had introduced a Bill towards the end of their term of office.  However, the inter-Party Government fell before that Bill they introduced had a chance to be enacted and become law.  When Fianna Fáil took over office in 1951 they also expressed themselves as being anxious to bring in amending legislation to restore more power to the local authorities, to the county councils, and they introduced their measure in 1953. An extraordinary thing was that that Government fell shortly afterwards.  So I hope there is nothing significant about the fact that this is the third introduction of such legislation and I <Col N="404" /> hope on this occasion the measure will become law, even though, as Deputy Brennan, I think, has already suggested what will become legislation by this Bill is already in operation in many local authorities wherever a reasonable county manager has been in charge.</P>
      <P>The intention behind the Bill, I gather, is to restore the democratic rights of the people and of their representatives, but, to my mind, what is contained in this measure is really something to flatter the ego of the various councillors.  It will give them an idea, in time for the local elections, that far more power will lie in their hands, but I wonder if local representatives who make a study of this measure and realise the implications of certain sections will be so anxious to offer themselves again.  Up to this, the county manager was a very suitable cockshot.  He could be used on many occasions by the local representatives, but there is one section in this Bill dealing with the estimates committee which is going to pin down the councillors and under which the responsibility for increases that may take place will be laid at the door of the councillors and the county manager can no longer be blamed.</P>
      <P>This estimates committee which it will be mandatory on a council to set up may sound very attractive and desirable, in that the council watch-dogs will be there to pare, to inspect and to cut expenditure and to act generally as watchdogs for the ratepayers. We all know that in recent years tremendous sums of money are expended by local authorities, and if these large sums are to be expended and if we are to have efficient and speedy day to day administration, we must have some form of effective control in a local authority which is capable of acting immediately.  If this estimates committee is to function successfully, I believe it must meet at least once a week and I do not know if that will be possible.  It may be possible in urban areas, but it is a horse of a different colour where the rural areas are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This estimates committee will meet <Col N="405" /> and many of the councillors will have no technical knowledge or ability to deal with the problems facing them in the matter of expenditure.  The county manager, I presume, will sit in on the deliberations and I should like to know at this stage on whose side the county manager will be.  If this estimates committee is to function as many of us would like to see it functioning it will be necessary to have practically a financial adviser or a group of financial advisers or experts available to it, apart altogether from the council officers.  I do not intend that remark as any criticism of the action of council officers, but they are subject to the control of the county manager and it might not suit them to express their views openly to an estimates committee, if these views did not coincide with the opinions or outlook of the county manager and I see a grave difficulty there for this committee. They will be up against it immediately if they are to meet the council employees&mdash;they are skilled men with years of experience and training in their particular line&mdash;and it might be asked how eight or ten men who can only devote themselves in a part-time way to the vast amount of work that is entailed hope to be able to put their arguments across or to put their case across against these experts.</P>
    <P>The system up to the present has been that the estimates are prepared by the county manager, or by the officers under his control, and he puts them together and presents them to the council.  There is a general criticism and a hullabaloo at council meetings when the time comes for striking the rate and all sorts of suggestions are made as to what can be pared down, what item can be removed and what item can be postponed until the following year, but at the back of each county councillor's mind is the knowledge that the county manager is responsible, that it is his responsibility to prepare the estimates and the responsibility of the council members to try to suggest where reductions can be made in so far as they are capable of making suggestions along particular <Col N="406" /> lines.  The county manager now can sit back.  The estimates committee will have to prepare the estimates, and, when the general meeting takes place, the county manager can say to the committee: &ldquo;Gentlemen, these estimates are your baby now and not mine&rdquo;.  I will come back to that at a later stage.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to something which is not in the Bill and, first, I want to deal with the question of politics in local administration.  Fianna Fáil have always maintained that politics should enter into local administration, in so far as the members who go forward on their Party ticket follow through in a smaller way with the major policies of the Party.  Personally, I believe that the less politics we have in local government, the better. That is, of course, only an opinion, but I feel that if councillors' minds are working along political lines and if councillors are ready to jump at certain little political attractions, for the sake of an argument, their minds are not concentrating on the work for which they were elected.  At times, it is a godsend to a county manager and others to have these little political bickerings going on because it gives the administrative staff an opportunity to slip across items on an agenda as quickly as can be, while, perhaps, a heated argument between two political groups is going on.</P>
    <P>The Minister, before he introduced this measure, went around to all the local authorities and listened in a democratic way to the views expressed and I presume he felt that it was not desirable to incorporate a section which would preclude Deputies from taking part in the deliberations on local government.  If that decision has been arrived at as a result of the overall view of the country, we will have to bow to that majority view, but, in my short experience of local government, I have found that Deputies on a local authority line up on a somewhat similar basis to that which is to be seen in this House.  If there is a T.D. who happens to be a member of the Party with a majority, he will act as the leader of that section and a Deputy who is a member of the Opposition <Col N="407" /> Party will act as Opposition leader in the local authority.  The majority of the county councils will line up under a Party Whip just the same as in this House.  I do not like that.  I think it is wrong.  If the Minister had a look at how the business is conducted in Roscommon County Council he would find that there is no such thing as an overall majority.  The inter-Party Government have not got it.  Fianna Fáil have not got it.  It is held by the Independents. As a result of that I think it will be agreed by other members of the county council that we have very little political bickering on this county council because neither one side nor the other is in a position to enforce its views.</P>
    <P>I want to express disappointment so far as I am personally concerned that there is not some effort made in this measure to cut out the political business in regard to local authorities.  I can see the Minister's difficulty, especially in view of Deputy Mulcahy's recent statement at the Ard-Fheis, that in these particular local elections Fine Gael were going to contest them on an out and out basis to remove the majorities of Fianna Fáil.  If the Minister's own Party leader issues Party policy on these lines, I can see the reason why it would be impossible in a measure of this sort to make provision whereby Deputies would be debarred from taking their seats on local authorities.</P>
    <P>There is another matter to which reference was made and that is the appointment of rate collectors.  The one function that has been left to local authorities all through is the power to appoint rate collectors.  I do not think there was any greater curse in local authorities than this power of appointing rate collectors.  I tried on a number of occasions by motion in our own council in Roscommon to ensure that wherever a vacancy occurs the rates would be collected by post and that no fresh appointments of rate collectors would be made.  I discussed the matter with several councillors. They all seemed agreeable but when it <Col N="408" /> came to taking a decision I suppose they felt that they should hold on to the one power they had.  They decided a number of rate collectors would be appointed.  There were actually seven appointed in one group in the last couple of years.</P>

It provides a topic for the countryside for months on end.  I would like to see a section in this Act making it clear that wherever a vacancy occurs in future for a rate collector it would be filled by post.  We do not need to interfere with any of the present rate collectors at all.  Let them carry on as they are.  That should be carried out all over the country.</P>

      <P>I will take advantage of that offer.  I will leave the matter at that.  In conclusion, there is one point I want to come back to. I think there would not be any criticism worth while of the managerial system, as such, if the first loyalty of the managers appointed up to the present was to the local authority.  If that loyalty was there; if the managers acted as advisers and watch-dogs for the local authorities and helped to push the Custom House further away from the local authority, then I do not think we would have any need for this legislation.  But from what I can see in my short experience the county managers are under the thumbs of the moguls in the Custom House.  No matter what the views of the local representatives may be and no matter how strongly a council may feel in a particular matter, if the Minister for Local Government or some of his officials take up the phone in the Custom House and ring up the county manager that is the end of it so far as the local authority is concerned.</P>
      <P>It is very hard, even at this stage, to know, when the Managerial Act was introduced, whether the idea was to gather more power into the Custom House and at the same time give the idea to the local authorities that plenty of power was still left in their hands.  It was a good thing for the Minister or the Department of Local Government to be able to contact within an hour every county manager in Ireland and get into operation the policy of the Custom House.  That is the reason why that view and that outlook prevented the County Managerial Act from being a success and which caused so much dissatisfaction throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we could get back to the stage where the county manager's first loyalty was to the local authority and <Col N="410" /> so forth much would be achieved.  I will instance a proof for the Minister of what I said.  Not so long ago a certain county manager&mdash;I think it was in Monaghan&mdash;commented on the question of the supply of books in a particular library.  To my mind it was a very fair comment.  A number of craw-thumpers did not like&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the statement. The next thing I discovered was that the Minister for Local Government gave a rap on the knuckles to this county manager.  Is it not quite clear that it is the Minister for Local Government who is the real boss?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, I merely commented on the statement he made.  I am sure I am quite entitled to comment on the statement a county manager makes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">

      <P>The Minister took that county manager to task for the statement.  He definitely did.  I do not think the Minister was entitled to do so.  The only reason I mentioned it was to show that as far as the managers are concerned generally they must look to the Custom House for advice and not to the local authority. The county manager on that particular occasion was thinking of the financial situation, and how money could be saved for the local authority. He was told otherwise by the Minister. I will not take up the time of the House except to say that I welcome the measure even though it is not very revolutionary.  I want to thank the Minister for his suggestion in connection with submitting an amendment regarding the appointment of rate collectors.</P>

      <P>We were all relieved, anyhow, when we got the Bill, and we saw for the first time in ten or 12 years that the County Management Act which it is proposed to amend by this Bill, was being accepted.  For the first time it is the fundamental local government law which will enable local authorities to carry out their functions as members of a local authority.  So far so good.  I am speaking for myself and I believe to a great extent for the members of my Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The County Management Act was a piece of legislation which enabled local authorities to carry out their functions very fully.  I always believed that.  As a member of a local authority I saw that under the County Management Act the council was restricted in no way in carrying out their democratic functions fully.  Under the Act county councils met once a month.  It was their duty to deliberate and make certain decisions.  Afterwards they handed over to that day month to the secretary of the county council, the <Col N="412" /> county engineer and the principal officers of the council.  The management of the council's affairs was never detrimental to the best interests of the county.  Actually it took a lot more time.  The members of the local committees had much more time than they have at present to deal with day to day things with which the county manager now deals.</P>
    <P>As a member of a local authority I know that when the County Management Act came into operation a general purposes committee was appointed. Each year for the past ten or 12 years they met about five, six or seven days to consider the estimates.  They considered every single iota of which the estimate was composed.  They had full detailed information in respect of every item.  We insisted, and had no difficulty in doing so, that the county manager, the secretary and the other officers provided us with every bit of information required.  The Minister's proposals in this Bill put that into official form, so to speak.  What has happened in Donegal&mdash;I heard Deputy Blaney and Deputy Brennan saying that&mdash;has happened with other county councils.  In the same way they had full power under the County Management Act to insist that the county manager provide them with all the information required, and they had full power to consider the estimates in detail before they came to the estimates meeting.  As a result of our deliberations in my council we always succeeded in reducing the county manager's estimate.  We were often enabled to do that because we made him show cause why he required that particular demand he was making on the council.</P>
    <P>I think under Section 7 the Minister proposes to empower a county council to set up&mdash;I think it say they &ldquo;may&rdquo;&mdash; may do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;Shall.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is obligatory on them to set up an estimates committee, and prepare an estimate.  I would suggest to the Minister that the wording of this section is in many ways unfortunate.  He does not say that the <Col N="413" /> secretary of a county council should lay before them proposals for an estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed he does, and the county manager can provide them with any assistance they may require.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is in the section it is quite all right, if this is what it would mean.  The Minister winds up the section by saying that the county manager may prepare an estimate.  He does not add to the reserved functions of the council in this respect, except in so far as they may be by resolution under Section 19.  But the Schedule of reserved functions is not added to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Did you read Section 19?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I read Section 19 and I think it is only referring to Section 4 of the Bill.  But when more power is being given to the council it probably should have been set out in the Schedule of reserved functions.  In the present Act one of the reserved functions is the making of the rate, and in making a rate the local authority had all the time necessary for considering the estimate in detail in order to make that rate.  When the County Management Act came in first, I want to respectfully suggest, it was regulations made by the Minister for Local Government which interested councils more than anything else. The requirement is still there.  Under the 1940 Act all the information a manager need give was under five or six headings.  That requirement was made by the Minister for Local Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>

      <P>Many of us have experience of that.  We know what can happen by regulation.  We know about other regulations that were made by the Minister for Local Government. For instance, under regulations district charges were made county-at-large charges.  There are many things that could happen by giving the Minister for Local Government the right to make regulations.  I was discussing this estimates committee.  I want to suggest to the Minister that he appears to be giving them certain powers but at the same time he is taking those powers away from them by providing that the manager can object, under any heading, to any estimate that the finance committee think is sufficient for the expenses of that particular section of local government administration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Not nearly as well.  The functions should be carefully divided. The staff of the council should prepare the estimate for consideration by the finance committee and the finance committee report as a result of their deliberations to the whole council.  A while ago I spoke about matters prescribed by the Minister under the Act. Section 9 (1) says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;An estimates committee shall, in each local financial year, prepare during the prescribed period and in the prescribed form an estimate...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This form prescribed under the Act of 1940 just shows a bulk amount under five or six headings.  It is no advantage to the whole council for the finance committee to prepare an estimate in that form because it gives them no information.  There are five or six well-known headings under which an estimate is prepared, and if it is the only function of the finance committee of the council to report to their council in the approved form, they will get very little information, not nearly as much as they are getting at the present time.</P>
      <P>In his opening remarks the Minister promised to send a memorandum to members of local authorities all over the country with regard to the provisions of the Management Act.  I want to suggest that he should go a little further and send out a much more elaborate memorandum dealing with local government law in general.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be a good idea to widen it to that extent.  The Management Act is only a very small part of the code of local government law under which local authorities are asked to administer different Acts. With regard to the preparation of the <Col N="418" /> estimates and the powers of the local authority to vary the estimates in any respect I said in the House on other County Management Bills that almost 90 per cent. of the total estimate of any county was statutory and no local authority had any power whatever over it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Does that apply to roads?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>It applies to most things. Take, for instance, mental hospitals. I would point out that 97 per cent. of the costs of running a mental hospital are statutory: wages, salaries, pensions, food, clothing, maintenance. There was very little a finance committee could do about statutory charges.  Health services: there is little or nothing they can do in that respect beyond getting full details of the cost of every single item of the services. They might not provide as much as might be required.  With regard to home assistance, they would probably have some power to cut or increase the estimate.  They have power in that respect and they have that power at the moment without reference to the manager at all.  Housing: they have power in regard to money for repairs to houses but not as regards loan charges, and so forth.  Roads: they have certain limited powers there. They must provide for the wages of the workers in their employment.  They must provide for the officers, the engineers and for everybody concerned on the roads.  If you like, they can determine what they will spend on repairs&mdash;in other words, what materials or what number of workers they will provide over and above the number already designated for pension or superannuation purposes, what machinery they will buy and so forth. However, from year to year it varies very little indeed.  With regard to the amount of power they will wield in that respect, I would point out that even local authorities before them had very little.  Generally, every local authority provided their road estimate, that is, what they believed was reasonable to carry on the service.  They bear in mind what the total rate will be for their particular county.  They would be more liberal if they felt the <Col N="419" /> rate would not be too great a burden on the ratepayer.</P>

      <P>About 90 per cent of the total amount spent by the local authority is semi-statutory.  There is one other section here which deals with remuneration or increasing the number in the employment of the council.  I have a very grave doubt in my mind about that section.  First and foremost, I cannot see any advantage in it to the employees of the council.  If the County Management Act did one good thing from the point of view of all officers and servants of local authorities it improved their status.  They are reasonably uniform all over the country.  It was much easier for the representatives of the employees to deal with two or three dozen county managers than to have to deal with 500 or 600 local authorities. You have the uniform scales of remuneration applicable to all clerical officers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to that in a second.  All clerical officers and all professional officers have, I think, uniform rates over the whole country. In my view, that is desirable.  With regard to road workers, I would say that generally there is very little difference.  There is a small variation in the rates of wages, here and there, but it does not vary very much.  I suppose it is higher around Dublin and Cork.  Otherwise it does not vary to <Col N="420" /> any great extent.  I suppose that some are slower than others in coming up to the higher rate.</P>
      <P>I feel that the question of the remuneration of all officers and servants should have been left in the hands of the county managers. Members of local authorities know quite well that it is the one function the managers did not like to perform: it was a bit difficult for them at times. They would love to throw it back on the members of the local authority: they would love them to do something they should do themselves.  In my opinion, it is much better that the managers should negotiate with the representatives of the particular section of the employees&mdash;whatever section it may be&mdash;and fix the scale and have the scale reasonably uniform in the whole country.  It is bad for the employees and bad for the councils to throw this back, as it were, in the melting pot.  I will go a bit further and say that I fear this provides an opportunity to sections of councils to make political propaganda at councils' meetings.  That is all the good that this can do.

      <P>Where does the council come in?  With regard to numbers, I believe the provision in this Bill is sound.  It is something on which there is often friction between the management and members of the local authority&mdash;especially as to the numbers of clerical staffs and professional staffs in his employment.  To prevent him from bringing on as many professional or clerical staff as he thought he needed, that is a good provision in itself. I agree with it, but I do not agree that the onus, which is at present on the manager of deciding the terms of appointment and the conditions of employment, should be taken out of his hands.  They should be made to perform their function in that respect whether it is onerous or popular.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think I need hold up the House further on the Bill.  The Bill will do good, in so far as for the first time in 12 years the County Management Act is accepted on all sides of the House.  It is accepted as the fundamental law under which local authorities perform their functions.  It may, of course, be amended, as any other Act of the Oireachtas can be amended, at some future time.  If these amendments proposed by the Minister are accepted by all sections of the community, that fact in itself is something to be grateful for.  I hope the Minister will be luckier than two of his predecessors were in the two Bills which they introduced to amend the Act.  He is not, I hope, a superstitious man, otherwise he might be influenced by the fact that two of his predecessors who introduced a Bill to amend the Act went out of office before the Bills could be passed into law and after the elections they were no longer Ministers.  Even though the Minister comes from a part of the country in <Col N="422" /> which there is said to be a good deal of superstition&mdash;the North of Ireland &mdash;he is obviously not superstitious having regard to that fact.</P>
    <P>I want again to draw attention, though it may not be in order on this Bill, to the regulations made by Ministers for Local Government under different Acts.  They are never made in consultation with members of local authorities.  They are made in consultation with county managers and they are not always made with a view to bending the law in favour of the local authority or to make it work smoothly.  I hope the Minister will bear that in mind when he is making new regulations under this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Maybe I am lucky but because of some of the remarks made here this evening, I am tempted to give my views.  At the outset, I do not know what Deputies who referred to the question of the appointment of rate collectors actually meant.  The suggestion made by Deputy McQuillan that rate collectors should be appointed on a non-political basis seems to me to be impossible of achievement in this country at the present time.  I should like to see the Minister inserting in this Bill a section which would take the power of appointment of rate collectors entirely out of the hands of local authorities because of the fact that, even inside the last few months, I have had the opportunity of watching groups of politicians jockeying for position in regard to the appointment of rate collectors and nothing seemed to matter except the political affiliations of the people who were candidates. For that reason I think the Minister should consider a change and should agree that such appointment should be left in the hands of the county manager.  I also think that the allocation of houses should remain a function of the manager, since that <Col N="423" /> was long a matter with which politicians played around.</P>
      <P>Listening to the debate one thing struck me very forcibly, that no matter where one turns in this House, there appears to be general agreement on the point that there seems to be no such thing as a bad manager.  It is like the old man with the pint&mdash;there may be good managers and better managers, but there is no such thing as bad managers.  I am afraid I could not agree with that point of view as a trade unionist who has on occasion negotiated with a number of county managers.  For that reason, I am glad to see certain sections included in the Bill.  Where you come across a bad county manager, there is only one way to deal with him and that is through decent elected representatives, who will deal with him in the way he should be dealt with.</P>
      <P>So far as the estimates committee is concerned, although I have no intimate knowledge of the administration of local authorities, I am afraid I could not agree that the estimates committee will work in the way the Minister suggests because the striking of a rate and the drawing up of estimates are matters for a group of experts who are paid for doing that job.  To suggest that a group of councillors drawn from each electoral division should be set up for the purpose of drawing up estimates is, in my opinion, ridiculous because you have one of two things to consider. First the idea might be that the Party who had a majority on the council would try to have people of their own brand of politics on the committee for the purpose of doing with the estimates what they think best from the Party point of view.  Then, on the other hand, you have to consider the possibility that the people who have a majority on the council would try to put their opposite numbers on the estimates committee in order to put them out of favour with the electors.  The drawing up of an estimate can be a very unpopular thing, and if the responsibility can be saddled on certain people, these people would get it fairly hot when they came up for election later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the last speaker was entirely <Col N="424" /> wrong in the remarks he made with regard to the fixing of wages.  Possibly he did not study the Bill at all because he referred to the fact that county councils would be given power under this Bill to discuss wages and the working conditions of employees of the council.  That is not so, as I read the Bill and I think I read it aright.  Under the present Bill, it is suggested that the local authority would have no power other than the provision of money.  That, in theory, is what is happening at the present time but, in practice, it may not be so.  I think it is quite as well.  While I do not agree with the County Management Act, at the same time I think it wise to leave the discussion of wages a matter between county managers and representatives of the trade unions.  The fact that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister has stated that the Labour Court will be able to intervene in cases of dispute in the near future should wipe out any difficulties that may arise in that case.  For that reason, I think it is best to leave the matter as it is.</P>
    <P>So far as reference to politics in councils is concerned, I am afraid that is something that we cannot get away from.  Whether we like it or not, when certain matters arise, members of the various political persuasions will line up on their own particular side of the fence and there is nothing this House can do to prevent that. Whether or not Deputies or Senators should be members of councils is another point.  I, personally, think they should.  Those who do not come forward are, I think, dodging their responsibilities. People can do very good work on these councils and it is their duty to accept that responsibility if the electors elect them to the councils.  That is my personal opinion. Possibly others may not agree with that opinion.  I would like to compliment the Minister on the Bill and to congratulate the House on the way in which most members speaking to this measure have discussed it; they have shown thereby their willingness to co-operate in the betterment of our local government administration.</P>

      <P>Deputy McQuillan discussed the appointment of rate collectors. <Col N="425" /> Unfortunately I am not armed with all the facts I would like to have when taking part in this debate, but my mind goes back a couple of years when the Department suggested to us, and I suppose to other county councils too, an amalgamation of the smaller areas, the making of the rate collectorship a pensionable position and the giving of a living wage to the rate collectors themselves.  The argument advanced by some that the rate collector only works for six weeks, and so forth, is beside the point.  The rate collector has a big responsibility.  He has care of big moneys.  He has to compile the register.  He has other duties. The Minister, in the course of Deputy McQuillan's speech, interrupted to tell the Deputy that if he introduced an amendment on the Bill he, the Minister, would leave it to a free vote of the House.  By way of interjection at that point, I said that certain rate collectors at the present time have more pay than Cabinet Ministers.  That is so in a few counties.  Deputy James Tully knows what I am talking about. The poundage in some cases is immense.  The point I want to develop is that if, by way of amendment to this Bill, the Department's scheme to amalgamate areas obtains, then in all new appointments there could be a fixed salary of £500, £600 or £700 plus certain emoluments for quick rate collection.  The cost of collecting the rates under such a system would not be so high and there could be an inducement of 2½ per cent. to the ratepayer who would send in his rates in full direct to the council.  That matter should receive consideration in relation to this Bill.</P>
      <P>I come now to the estimates committee. I think such a committee would be very useful.  In my county we have a finance committee.  It meets two or three times in the year and has proved of tremendous help to the general council.  It examines seriatim the various items prepared by the manager and makes a report.  It prevents rambling discussion while pinpointing certain items in the estimates. I think the suggested committee would be of invaluable assistance to the councils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the tenders committee, <Col N="426" /> we were given a legal ruling under the Act at present in force that we had no right to have a tenders committee.  For that reason we have never tried to exercise such a right.  Now, according to the Minister, that right does exist and he has clarified the situation in this measure.  I welcome that step because such a committee is very necessary.  Councils are spending tens of thousands of pounds.  If such committees are set up suspicions in relation to particular firms getting all the contracts will be done away with.  I will leave it at that.  Huge stocks of machinery are being bought by councils now for road purposes, and everything else, and those in the trade should have an opportunity of tendering in the knowledge that they will get a fair deal.</P>
    <P>Deputy McQuillan talked about politics and the right of T.D.s to be county councillors.  We have a constitutional right to be elected to any body in this State.  People have that right in every democratic country in the world.  We have no right to deprive our people of it.  If they choose to stand as town commissioners, urban councillors, or anything else, they are perfectly entitled to do so and it would be contrary to democratic principles to try through the medium of a Bill here to deprive any Deputy or Senator of that right to be a member of a public body.  With regard to keeping politics out of local councils, I am afraid my education has been sadly neglected.  I do not understand the word &ldquo;politics&rdquo; at all.  I am like Joxer Daly when he says: &ldquo;What is the moon?  What are the stars?&rdquo; When I hear people in this House talking about politics and politicians, I go back for my philosophy to Joxer Daly.  I never heard such hypocrisy talked about there being no politics in county councils.  The very minute the members go into the council chamber they go in as politicians.  It is a very good thing for the country that they should act in a particular way and that all the matters that arise should be debated to the fullest extent.</P>
    <P>Summarising my approach to this Bill, I welcome the estimates committee. I have made a suggestion about rate collectors.  I shall be glad to have <Col N="427" /> clarification in relation to the question of tenders.  Above all, I welcome the conversion of the Labour Party to the principle of the managerial system.</P>

      <P>I take it that the purpose of this Bill is to improve local government administration.  It is undoubtedly a step forward, but it is a very small step.  This Bill is a somewhat bulky one, but its contents are not quite so substantial as its bulk would lead one to believe.  I am an unrepentant opponent of the County Management Act, 1939, and I am sorry that the present Minister has not seen fit to bring in more drastic amendments than those contained in this measure.  I hope that before this passes into law effect will be given to several vital amendments.</P>
      <P>The County Management Act was enacted originally in order to improve local government administration.  Has it achieved that purpose?  I do not think it has, irrespective of what angle we view it from.  It was charged at one time that members of county councils were corrupt.  Are not the members of county councils elected on the very same basis as the members of this House?  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>On the section, I am opposing it because it has for its purpose the changing of the name of An Bord Fáilte to the Irish Tourist Board. I expressed, on the Second Reading, my objections to the change proposed here and I think they are valid objections. The Minister then said that he did not feel very strongly about the need for this change and that he would leave it to a free vote of the House; but I would urge him not to let the matter go to a vote.  If he does not feel strongly on it he will appreciate that there are others who may.  He will also appreciate that the change is not one which is required.  The point which the Minister made was that the board has got to describe itself in its stationery as the official Irish tourist organisation when doing business in English-speaking countries&mdash;in Britain and America.  There can be no possible objection to that and I am quite certain that the tourist organisations of France, Switzerland and Italy also describe themselves in the English language when conducting publicity work in English-speaking countries. The practice which developed in this State of giving Irish names without English translations to these semi-State organisations is in conformity with the wishes of this House to encourage the use of the Irish language in its daily application and our experience has been that when we tried to give a statutory English translation <Col N="429" /> the English title was the one ordinarily used and the Irish fell into disuse.  My objection is not to Bord Fáilte putting the English translation on its stationery but the section is making it a statutory obligation on the board to put an English translation whenever it has to print its name.  That is what the object of this section is&mdash;to change what is a common-sense practice when dealing with English-speaking people in other countries into a statutory obligation.  I can see no need for that and I would urge the Minister not to proceed with the change.  I do not know if the Minister's proposal has been brought to the attention of the various organisations interested in the Irish language.  I feel they would object very strongly to it.  Even if the Minister personally does not feel very strongly on the subject I think he should be cognisant of the fact that it is likely to lead to antagonism.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support Deputy Lemass's objection to the purpose of this section.  I think it departs from the desires which we all have to promote the language, and I think the argument put forward by Deputy Lemass that the thing is not necessary should be sufficient to convince the Minister.  We do not require a translation of &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and there are many other appellations such as Bord na Móna which have established themselves.  I take it every member of this House can cite several other appellations of various sorts which we have accepted ourselves in the English language and for which we do not require any translation.  I think the point Deputy Lemass made was that it was likely to confine people to the use of the translation which would result in the original Irish title falling into disuse.  I have no doubt that translations will be forthcoming: somebody in America or in Germany may ask what Bord Fáilte means and they will be told what it means.  We may have had to do the same thing in respect of titles that we have seen here for the first time but having heard them once or twice the meaning of the original became sufficiently clearly embedded in our minds so that it caused us no further trouble.  Córas Iompair <Col N="430" /> Éireann has definitely demonstrated that this system of not having a double title is the proper one. Unfortunately, there are still a great many people in our own country who find as much difficulty as people elsewhere about Irish names but they seem to manage quite well about it.  There does not seem to be any reason why the Minister would not fall into line on this particular matter as he and his predecessor have done in respect of similar instances.</P>

      <P>I do not see why there should be a change now from what has been the general policy with regard to boards up to now.  They have been given an Irish name and an Irish name only.  The difficulty which is visualised of Bord Fáilte being in communication with persons outside the country and that it would accordingly need an English name does not apply to Aer Lingus.  Therefore, I do not see why it should apply here. After all, Aer Lingus is in communication with persons from outside the country and no difficulty has arisen. This is not the first time that this body has been given a name.  Had it been something new there might have been a reason for doubts in our minds as to whether the change was necessary but since 1952 the Irish name and the Irish name only has been in use and has been in use in correspondence and so on and no complaints have been voiced, publicly at any rate, that it caused any dislocation to tourist traffic.  I am surprised that some of the Irish bodies like Comhdháil Náisiunta na Gaeilge and the Gaelic League publicly have not voiced opposition to this.  They did voice such opposition in respect of others&mdash;when it was proposed to give the Store Street bus station a name. In that case the bodies managed to contact representatives with a view to getting them to use their influence to have an all-Irish name given to the Store Street bus station.  I have seen no public pronouncement by these two bodies.  We feel it our duty to protest against the proposal to give this body a dual name.  The Irish name has been sufficient since 1952, when the Tourist Traffic Act was passed, and there is <Col N="431" /> no reason whatsoever to change that now.</P>

I do not think this matter is of such importance that it should take up the time of the House.  Realism is called for.  Are we to use this piece of legislation as an instrument to promote Irish or are we <Col N="432" /> to use it for the purpose of attracting tourists?  If we are to be sensible about it we must recognise that the great majority of the people in foreign countries to whom we will be appealing to come here will be English-speaking. Propaganda advocating the advantages of this country from the point of view of tourists must convey instantly the fact that it is issued by an Irish tourist organisation, and I suggest that that will not be achieved by using the words &ldquo;An Bord Fáilte&rdquo; and nothing else.</P>

We are discussing the setting up of a board to deal on a world-wide basis with the promotion of tourism in Ireland.  What objection is there to the immediate revelation to the person reading any of our tourist propaganda that it comes from Ireland, that they have not to get a dictionary to discover what the words mean?  Common sense indicates that there should be an English sub-title for this Irish organisation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. MacCarthy Mr. MacCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>It should be quite unnecessary, and I am sure it is, for the Minister to alter what has become established practice in the naming of boards established in this country for the promotion of national wealth or tourism.  There is no person in this country who does not understand the meaning of the word &ldquo;Bord&rdquo;.  Whether you spell it bord or board, it means the same thing.  Wherever Irishmen are assembled, when they use the expression &ldquo;Céad Míle Fáilte&rdquo; people <Col N="433" /> of other nations understand what they mean.  They know the word &ldquo;Fáilte&rdquo;. They know that it means &ldquo;Welcome&rdquo;. Therefore, &ldquo;Ireland of the Welcomes&rdquo; is used in the journal of An Bord Fáilte.  That does not take away from the fact that the established and recognised name of the organisation is &ldquo;An Bord Fáilte&rdquo;.  I do not think we in this House at this stage should ask organisations like the Gaelic League to intervene in a matter of such simplicity.  Deputy Dunne has asked do we mean to promote Irish.  We wish to give a distinctive Irish name to an organisation which is to bring certain advantages to this country.  It is because Ireland is Ireland and has all the characteristics that past generations have established here that people are invited to come amongst us.</P>
      <P>The Minister when introducing the measure said sufficient to show that he needs no urging now.  Naturally, explanatory words will be used in tourist literature but, whatever may appear in that way, the recognised name will be An Bord Fáilte.  Aer Lingus, Bord na Móna, Córas Iompair Éireann, An Bord Fáilte, are all very simple names and there should be no criticism of the proposal to continue the practice of using these titles.</P>

      <P>I do not think Deputies opposite have made a very good case. This organisation will be known as An Bord Fáilte.  Every Deputy accepts that it should be known as An Bord Fáilte.  We must be realistic.  The organisation is for the purpose of attracting people to our country to spend their money.  Deputy Lemass, by way of interruption, mentioned French.  I am sure Deputy Lemass is an intelligent man and must know that French ranks amongst spoken languages second in the world, if not first. How many people speak Irish in relation to the number of people who speak French?  The same applies to English. The majority of people who come to Ireland for holidays speak English. The object of this Bill is to set up an organisation to bring people to this country.  I do not see what possible objection the Deputies opposite can have.  The premier name of the organisation <Col N="434" /> is &ldquo;An Bord Fáilte&rdquo; and in brackets there is an interpretation in English.  In the case of advertisements published by agencies in any part of the world the principal object is to use a language that the people who see them can understand.  This objection on the part of the Opposition is frivolous and nothing else.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>When I was speaking on this Bill on the Second Stage and when the point was raised by Deputy Lemass as to the name of the new unified organisation, I indicated that the use in brackets of the term &ldquo;Irish Tourist Board&rdquo; was done in order to enable the organisation to identify itself to a large number of travel agencies and individuals and organisations in a great many countries where the aggregate English-speaking population was in the vicinity of 250,000,000 people and I made the case for the use in parenthesis of the English title that that would help to have the organisation identified more readily there than the use of the term &ldquo;An Bord Fáilte&rdquo;.  Looking at the thing purely from a utilitarian point of view, I still think that that is so and that if we are going to sell something we ought to make it clear to those who are likely purchasers of the goods what the wares are.  The sole reason for offering this to the House from my standpoint was that that enabled this international tourist organisation&mdash;because that is what we hope it will be&mdash;to make its existence known and its pulling power felt much more effectively in those countries by reason of the fact that its name was one that you could easily recognise and easily pronounce and one that was understood by those who, whatever the country in which they may be, nevertheless use English as a means of expressing their views; but I say this, that I had not any profound feeling on the matter and I offered it to the House for its utility and as a means <Col N="435" /> of enabling the board to use that title if they so desired on its extern advertising literature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, well, I agree, but again I want to be realistic.  The drawing power of this country from the tourist standpoint has not been flowing towards Eastern Europe.  The drawing power of this country, from a tourist standpoint, has been in the main the Six Counties and Great Britain, and we have been making and we are able to make an appeal to the vast Irish empire over the seas and to English-speaking people who are not of Irish birth in Australia, Canada, New Zealand and South Africa&mdash;all countries where Irish people have emigrated and where there are people who are not of Irish birth but who have a profound regard for Ireland because of its contribution to the causes of national freedom and human liberty down through the ages.  That is the appeal I think we must make for a very long time to come, and it was with a view to aiding that appeal that I included the title Irish Tourist Board as a method of identifying the organisation to those who do not speak Irish.</P>
      <P>I do not say that my viewpoint is the right one, nor do I accept the view that those who say we should drop the title Irish Tourist Board are necessarily right.  I think it is desirable to do something which will command the support of the House.  It was to enable that support to be tested and to find out what the House would desire that I suggested that if an amendment were moved on the Committee Stage I would leave this to a free vote of the House; and that still represents my view.</P>

      <P>It was hoped that the Irish Tourist Association would receive some statutory recognition under this Bill, but there is no reference at all in it to that body.  The Irish Tourist Association is a very important factor in the tourist industry.  Its directors are mainly representatives of the local authorities which vote funds to the association.  In that way it represents a good cross-section of the country.  To my mind, it is an ideal vocational body. Its local knowledge is always of immense use to State boards and it has never been slow to give those boards the benefit of its advice and local knowledge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the present time the Irish Tourist Association operates under a licence from the Minister for Industry and Commerce, but that could be revoked at any time.  At the moment, so far as I know, its only function is the management of internal tourist bureaux under an agreement with Fógra Fáilte.  As it has played such an important part in tourism during the past 30 years or more, it would have been advisable and desirable that certain functions should be allotted to the Irish Tourist Association.  That is why I wished to move these amendments to the Bill by which the present <Col N="438" /> functions of Fógra Fáilte would be allotted to the Irish Tourist Association. Even at this stage I would try to impress on the Minister that if anything could be done to allot some statutory function to that body, I am sure it would be for the welfare of tourism in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>I, like Deputy Palmer, would like to make some remarks on this Section 6.  It says:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The board shall have the following additional functions&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  to engage in any kind of publicity both inside and outside the State, in connection with tourist traffic...&rdquo; etc.</P>
      <P>Being a member of the Irish Tourist Association, representing Louth County Council, I imagine there is an omission there in relation to the Irish Tourist Association.  Most people interested in tourism know that since 1925, the Irish Tourist Association have carried on a very intensive campaign to promote the cause of tourism in this country.  They have just and proper claims to more official, more statutory recognition on the part of the Minister in this particular Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Palmer has pointed out, they have been recognised by local authorities who have allotted funds annually from the rates to help them bear their expenses and that is a very important fact&mdash;that local authorities consider that the Irish Tourist Association is important enough as a body to warrant the donation of funds to promote the work it was set up to do. The Irish Tourist Association has set up bureaux throughout the country and, I think, also abroad to advance the cause of tourism.  It has also carried on a very intensive campaign of publicity-work in general, in addition to having established cookery scholarships, which are very important things.  The Irish Tourist Association is the parent body of tourism, and I, like Deputy Palmer, would urge the Minister to reconsider his attitude towards the Irish Tourist Association and to allot them more important functions and to give them statutory recognition other than the mere representation <Col N="439" /> on the board of An Bord Fáilte.  I would urge him to reconsider these points and bear these remarks in mind having realised that the Irish Tourist Association has 30 years' experience behind it and is a well-known body in the promotion of tourism in general.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. MacCarthy Mr. MacCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>The first point we must recognise about the Irish Tourist Association is that it is a voluntary organisation based on the unselfish efforts of its members and to some extent on contributions from those who willingly give for the purposes of the organisation, and it may in consequence be undesirable to tie it up too closely with statutory bodies which may, perhaps, bring about in the course of time a neglect of the work which is now being done and a throwing-over of effort on to the statutory board.  At the same time sufficient recognition should be given to it to ensure that the valuable work done over the years should be continued and it is a question of how the two things can be linked up&mdash;the voluntary efforts of the Irish Tourist Association and the statutory work of An Bord Fáilte&mdash;without interfering with the special character of either the one or the other, particularly the Irish Tourist Association, which should be preserved and recognition given to its efforts and to the officials who have done so much over the years.  What is the best way to do that&mdash;that is the point that we would ask the Minister, I presume, to give due consideration to, before he finalises this Bill.  The general character of this measure is to establish this board, to do away with An Bord Fáilte and so on.  The Irish Tourist Association will probably be hanging a bit in mid air in that interval.  I cannot see quite clearly what I would propose to the Minister except that I am not too keen, as I have said, on having a link-up of a voluntary body which would be too closely regulated in a statutory one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The pattern of all tourist legislation in recent years has been to assign to two statutory bodies, An Bord Fáilte and Fógra Fáilte, certain <Col N="440" /> duties in the matter of promoting tourism.  These two bodies, An Bord Fáilte and Fógra Fáilte, have had certain opportunities of functioning on their own, and it was in the light of the experience that this dual type of organisation did not make for efficiency and that it caused waste and overlapping that I was induced to introduce this Bill in the hope of getting one comprehensive organisation to deal with the whole question of tourism.  I think there is no greater opportunity for waste and overlapping than is to be found where you create a number of bodies to do functions which are interrelated because there the scope for waste and overlapping is considerable. It is because I have had personal experience, and reports on the difficulties of getting these two bodies to work in the way it was originally contemplated, that I was coerced logically into asking the House to approve of a Bill to marry these two bodies into one organisation.  I propose to do that by dissolving Fógra Fáilte and continuing An Bord Fáilte, and transferring to the latter the functions which are at present discharged by Fogra Fáilte. But the case made by Deputies Palmer and Coburn would restore all the weaknesses of having two bodies.  The House has agreed on the Second Stage that we will have one body.  At least, that is going to get a trial now, and that single body will be on trial having the comprehensive functions which were previously discharged by two separate organisations.  It will be on trial, and it knows it will be on trial, and we have to see if this is a better way of looking after tourism than by dividing responsibility over two separate autonomous bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The case made by Deputy Palmer and Deputy Coburn would repeat all the weaknesses in the old structure and would still leave two bodies dealing with what ought to be, in my view, unified functions.  But it would have even further weaknesses&mdash;it would transfer some of these functions which are now statutory functions to a body which is not a statutory body but is purely a private organisation and, as Deputy MacCarthy has pointed out, a voluntary organisation in its main structure.  I think, therefore, for the <Col N="441" /> reasons which I gave on the Second Reading of this Bill it would be a fundamental mistake at this stage to divide again the responsibilities for tourist promotion, recreating a position which, I think, has led up to the weaknesses which this Bill seeks to remedy.  I said that I hoped to ensure the Irish Tourist Association would be preserved by giving it representation on the new board and whatever fertility of mind the Irish Tourist Association have from the standpoint of ideas on promoting tourism can all filter through the new body.</P>
    <P>So as to make sure that that representation of the Irish Tourist Association on An Bord Fáilte will be an official type of representation, provision will be made that the representation of the Irish Tourist Association on An Bord Fáilte will be official inasmuch as the person or persons nominated to the directorate of An Bord Fáilte must have an official connection with the Irish Tourist Association.  In that way, I think I am providing in a reasonably satisfactory way for the continued nexus between the Irish Tourist Association and the official statutory tourist body.  It may well be, as Deputy MacCarthy has rightly said, that it is better for an organisation like the Irish Tourist Association, which is a voluntary organisation, which had a certain type of birth and a certain kind of upbringing, to stand back from an official statutory body such as this and to do the valuable work it has been doing down the years.</P>
    <P>The I.T.A. receive approximately £16,000 per year for the promotion of tourism in this country and there is power in this Bill whereby An Bord Fáilte can make grants to the Irish Tourist Association and, in the light of experience, perhaps these grants can be varied.  In the light of experience of the valuable work the Irish Tourist Association is doing, An Bord Fáilte may say that that work is perhaps costing more than it originally cost and may filter out moneys that way to this purely voluntary organisation; but while I think that, in itself, is a desirable situation, I think it would be at this stage not only contrary to the principle as passed on <Col N="442" /> Second Reading, but contrary even to prudent administration if we, after deciding to unify tourist promotional activities under one board, set about, so soon after deciding to do that on the Second Stage, recreating a second body and by doing so inherited again all the weaknesses which were inseparable, in my view, from the existence of the two bodies.</P>
    <P>I think we ought to give this a trial. It may well be that it will not satisfy our hopes and our ambitions, but at least we ought to give this new tourist body a trial and endeavour to ensure that it will be staffed by people who will push and drive our tourist potentialities. By continuing the official association through the directorate with the Irish Tourist Association, I am making provision that that train of thought represented by the Irish Tourist Association approach to tourist problems will always filter through to the directors of An Bord Fáilte and they have my assurance that that provision will be continued. At all events, there was some years ago a likelihood that the Irish Tourist Association would have been annihilated. That danger is past and it is now recognised that they have a place here in our tourist organisation.  It is again recognised and emphasised in this Bill, and, in going so far, I think I am going as far as could reasonably be expected in all the circumstances and having regard to the overriding consideration of trying to get one unified body to direct our tourist promotional activities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>While supporting the Minister's conclusion, I want to make it clear that I do so for a slightly different reason.  I do not think that having a separate body to deal with tourist publicity as distinct from all the other activities which an Bord Fáilte has under the Tourist Traffic Act necessarily represents a waste or inefficiency.  On the contrary, I believe that there is a far greater risk of inefficiency if you overcrowd one organisation with too many duties.  If it is true that there has been friction between the two bodies set up by the 1952 Act, that was due to a weakness of personalities and not to weakness <Col N="443" /> of the system, but I would strongly oppose the suggestion in this amendment.</P>
      <P>This legislation authorises the Government to go to the taxpayer to get money for tourist promotion purposes and it requires the Minister to see that that money is spent through organisations with constitutions and powers defined by legislation.  It would be entirely wrong to use that public money for that purpose through an organisation that was not responsible to the Minister.  The essential difference between An Bord Fáilte and the Irish Tourist Association is that An Bord Fáilte is responsible to the Minister, and, through the Minister, to this House, as to how it performs its duties, while the Tourist Association directors are responsible only to the main body of members who are ordinary private individuals who become members by paying a subscription.</P>
      <P>The Irish Tourist Association can be used as an agent by An Bord Fáilte for various purposes and it is at present being used as an agent by Fógra Fáilte.  There are many directions in which it could work more efficiently and effectively than some subsidiary organisation set up by An Bord Fáilte.  I certainly would encourage An Bord Fáilte to use the Irish Tourist Association as its agent wherever the work is of a character which the Irish Tourist Association is capable of doing, but that would be the right relationship between An Bord Fáilte and the Tourist Association. Ultimately, the public money is to be spent by a body that is responsible to the Minister and concerning which the Minister is liable to be questioned in the House and it would be a very bad principle indeed to create a situation in which these large sums of public money would be entrusted to a body over the rules or constitution of which this House has no control.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>My objection to Section 6 is that it hands over to this new body which unifies the two previous bodies more or less complete control <Col N="444" /> over Irish tourism.  I think it is a very good thing that there should be State support for tourism, but I should like to draw the Minister's attention to this fact, that the Irish Tourist Association is a voluntary body, and voluntary bodies in this country should be encouraged.  It is true that the Minister says he intends to appoint three directors to this new board, but that does not give the Irish Tourist Association the guarantee that they are going to get any real benefits from this State body.  The association will depend entirely on these three directors who may become immersed in the State outlook in that they are absorbed by and carried into the State body and may turn their backs on the organisation to which they previously belonged.  I should be far happier if the Minister would give us some indication as to what functions are to be allocated to the Irish Tourist Association.</P>
      <P>I subscribe to what the Minister says that it is a good thing to have an organisation like this with a certain amount of State control, if the State is to provide, as it is, £500,000; but, as against that, this section with its different sub-sections gives An Bord Fáilte full functions in relation to the doing and the regulating of everything connected with tourism.  Therein I see the danger.  I do not like State bodies, although I know that in present circumstances, in the changing conditions of the world, State control may be necessary, but I do like private enterprise bodies, and I maintain that the Irish Tourist Association has proved its worth.  When there was no State to do anything, they carried on and gave us the limited organisation we had, gradually increasing over the years, with the very limited funds at their disposal.</P>

    <P>I would like, therefore, if the Minister would give us some indication of the functions it is suggested or thought will be delegated to the Tourist Association and what funds may be placed at their disposal.  According to the letter I have&mdash;I am sure all Deputies received a similar letter recently&mdash;over the years from 1925, the date of its foundation, right up to 1951, the total sum at their disposal is in the neighbourhood of £300,000 and a State body <Col N="445" /> is going to get £500,000 in one year.  It will be a safeguard for private enterprise and for what it stands if the Minister will give us some indication as to what allocation they are going to get and what funds are going to be allocated to them.</P>

      <P>As a previous speaker pointed out, Section 6 gives very wide powers to this new board. Paragraph (b) refers to the preparation and publishing of guide books.  I hope that, when this new board is set up, there will be some system whereby those who prepare the guide books for world publicity cannot commit the unpardonable sin of completely ignoring any county.  I mentioned this matter on Second Reading the other day and since then I studied the correspondence in connection with the matter.  Not alone have they completely left out an entire county from their guide books but they have not had the courtesy to answer letters which were written to them by interested people.  They left them for weeks.  On the last occasion they left them over a month.  They have not acknowledged receipt of a letter from a private organisation that caters for one-tenth of the holiday-makers who come to this country.</P>
      <P>If the Minister is going to give these powers he should also put in a safeguard to make sure that the people responsible for making Irish tourism known all over the world should not do what was done by the present body very recently.  I should like to impress on the Minister the necessity to have the job done properly this time.</P>
      <P>I think it is a very good idea to amalgamate the two boards because the situation where you had two bodies &mdash;one a State-controlled body and the other a voluntary body covering almost the same ground and both jealous of the other's powers&mdash;was not for the good of tourism in this country.  I think it can be improved.  It is one of the biggest money spinners we have. I think if this present body helps, as it should, to straighten out the question of tourism in this country we should all welcome the Bill.</P>

      <P>Deputy Esmonde raised <Col N="446" /> the question of the functions of the Tourist Association.  The functions of the Tourist Association are not affected by the amending Bill the purpose of which is to bring An Bord Fáilte and Fógra Fáilte together as a single organisation.  This Bill does not in any way limit the functions of the Irish Tourist Association.  As I said, it is a private body.  It is a voluntary organisation and it has functioned down through the years in that capacity.  The Irish Tourist Association gets its revenue from voluntary contributions which are made by local authorities for tourist publicity purposes.  It gets approximately £16,000 per year and by arrangement with Fógra Fáilte it runs and staffs the tourist bureaux within the country out of the moneys so received from the local authorities.</P>
      <P>In addition to that, by an administrative arrangement, they were tied in at directorate level with Fógra Fáilte. I propose in this Bill to tie them in again with the new board, thereby, as I said, providing a conduit pipe for such ideas as may fertilise in the minds of the Irish Tourist Association and to enable these views to be transmitted through the directors of the Irish Tourist Association to the meetings of the directors of An Bord Fáilte. So that this Bill leaves the Irish Tourist Association as a body untouched and leaves its functions unimpaired so far as this particular Bill is concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>That can be said at the moment.  As Deputy Lemass points out, Fógra Fáilte is solely responsible for publicity activities and An Bord Fáilte deals with the other aspects of tourist promotion, including the supervision of hotels and a variety of activities of that kind.  Under this scheme, with a single organisation in existence, An Bord Fáilte and Fógra Fáilte will, in the future, take part in the entire directional activities of the single unified board.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to add much further to remarks I have already made on this Bill.  I have pointed out the position of the agricultural community regarding prices.  In my opinion, unless there is a rather big change of heart on the part of the Government there is very little hope, on the lines expressed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, that the only hope for this country was an increase in agricultural production. There is very little hope that there is going to be an increase when you are practically wiping out that industry. I have already pointed that out.</P>
      <P>I have been always anxious to get from the Minister his plans and proposals in regard to the steel industry, whether he is going to carry out the plans for its extension made by his predecessor.  We had a very bad period here for three or four years whilst the inter-Party Government were making up their minds what they were going to do.  Those are matters which in my opinion are of interest and which cause anxiety to the people.</P>
      <P>There is little use in talking of the reduction in the cost of living.  Any one who reads the newspapers can see that the cost of living is going up instead of falling.  Day by day we have suggestions from the Deputies opposite that the reason for this is: &ldquo;Oh, if prices go up during the period of the Fianna Fáil Government it is a wilful act on the part of that Government, but if prices go up while the inter-Party Government are in office it is an act of Providence.&rdquo;  Or they may say that it is something which cannot be counteracted or prevented.  That has been the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="448" /> The last general election was fought on promises, and there is no doubt that the campaign gave certain impressions to the people.  When you put out a big pint at 1/3 and side by side another pint at 1/-, you will have people under the impression that as soon as Deputy Norton became Minister for Industry and Commerce that the prices were going to go back.  I would suggest to whoever is directing propaganda for the Fianna Fáil Party that they now get out another leaflet showing how much these prices have been reduced since the inter-Party Government came into office.  Take for instance any one of these&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I would like to hear what has become of the report of that commission which was set up four years ago.  I would like to have a report on that.  Is there one law and one line here for every other industry, for every other retail trade, for every other business, except the agricultural industry?  That is what I would like to hear from the Minister.  Deputy Corish will probably remember that he got a bill for two and a half years' arrears to increase the pay to the medical services.</P>

We have questions asked here in connection with tea.  We know that the Government had to step in to keep the price of tea at the level at which Deputy Lemass held it, not at a reduced price.  It is costing some £1,250,000 to hold it at that price from now until next September.  Why is it being held over for that period?&mdash;so as to cover the local authority elections.  I would not be at all surprised&mdash;it might <Col N="450" /> be a blessing from heaven&mdash;if we had the two elections together in June.</P>
      <P>I have put up certain points to the Minister to which I hope he will reply. I want to know in particular what is to become of the industry that is keeping the town of Cobh alive.  He might be able to let us know also whether the oil refinery is going to come down to Whitegate or not and whether the bringing in of that industry is going to cheapen the price of T.V.O. to the farmers so that the cost of production will be reduced.</P>

      <P>What caused me to speak on this particular matter were the remarks made in the form of interruption by Deputy O'Donovan.  Last week Deputy O'Donovan, who is a Parliamentary Secretary, stated in this House that he had made no promises in the course of the last election in connection with the cost of living.  He stated that he promised the electors he would do his best.  I do not know whether Deputy O'Donovan or any other Deputies in the Fine Gael Party believe for one moment that that type of quibbling is going to be swallowed by the Irish public.  Deputy O'Donovan won a seat on the cost of living.  He is in this House as a Deputy simply and solely because he and other members of the Fine Gael Party promised they would lower the burden of taxation and reduce the cost of living.  He replaced a man in this House, former Deputy Dr. Noel Browne, on the basis that Deputy Browne was responsible for the increased cost of living between 1951 and 1954 and that he, Deputy O'Donovan, as a responsible Minister of the Government, would ensure that prices would go back to what they were in 1951 prior to Fianna Fáil taking office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder does Deputy O'Donovan or any other new Deputy in the Fine Gael Benches think it was because of his lovely blue eyes that the electors of Dublin put him into this House in preference to ex-Deputy Dr. Noel Browne who did more for the people of this <Col N="451" /> country than the whole Fine Gael Party put together but who, through a campaign of vilification and misrepresentation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The suggestion was made here, before Deputy Coogan came into this House, last April and May that the former Government should get out immediately and give an opportunity to what is now the Government to present a Budget, that if the Government that is now in office had the opportunity of bringing in that Budget this Utopia would be in operation in Ireland.  They promised it in the last campaign.  I want to make it clear at this stage that I do not expect miracles and I do not believe it is possible for any Government to reduce the cost of living overnight but what I do deplore are the promises that are made to gull the public that that situation can be created; in other words that responsible or so-called responsible leaders of Parties will brazenly tell the public that if their Party are returned to office they are able to reduce the cost of living and say, in the words of Deputy McGilligan, that they can reduce it by <Col N="452" /> repealing taxation to the tune of £10,000,000 in ten minutes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as the public are concerned, they are sick and tired of politics in this country and I do not blame them.  We had it from 1948 to 1951 that that Government had to clean up the mess that was there prior to their coming into office, a mess made by their predecessors.  Between 1951 and 1954, the next Government that came in had to clear up, in their words, the mess that had been created by their predecessors.  Now this Government that is in office cannot carry out their promises, so the first thing they must do before they can reduce the cost of living and lower taxation is to clear up the mess made by their predecessors.  How many years is that going to take?  How many years will that take?  In other words, each Government have stated publicly that they would have to have time to clear the mess made by their predecessors. The fact is that this country is in one hell of a mess to-day, after all the promises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I realise that in this particular debate I am confined to Supplies and Services and that I should deal with the cost of living alone.  There are many matters, in connection with the promises made by the present Government, that I should like to refer to now but I shall have an opportunity at a later stage to-night of dealing with them.  I should like to give credit where credit is due.  Recently, it became necessary to increase the price of tea.  There has been much criticism of the fact that the Government have stabilised the position.  I agree that the Government were perfectly right to cushion the public against that increase if there is any hope that, by next September or October, the price of tea will come down again.  In my view, the sections of the community that would be hardest hit by the increase in the price of tea would be the very poorer sections who can ill afford to withstand the cost of living as it is. Therefore, what has been done was <Col N="453" /> done in the hope that it will at least ease the burden somewhat on these sections of the community.  However, I have this criticism to offer in connection with that device, as I will describe it.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to tell me what amount of money the Irish people will have to pay by way of interest on the extra £1,250,000 that the tea will cost.  What interest will be paid to the commercial banks for that privilege?  Is it not a fact that, at the minimum, it will cost £60,000 by way of interest to save the tea drinkers the increased cost and are we not paying that £60,000 interest to commercial concerns?  Ultimately will that not mean increased taxation instead of a reduction in taxation?  Surely, that is not helping to keep down the cost of living, ultimately?</P>
    <P>If we borrow money from commercial banks at an exorbitant rate of interest for consumer purposes we are doing serious harm to the economy of this country&mdash;and it is here that I make a suggestion to the Minister for Industry and Commerce that he should use all his persuasion within the Government, and that his Party should do the same, to ensure that, in the interests of the public, the control of credit is brought into the hands of the State.  If the State has power over credit, and if it can control the rate of interest for an object such as the keeping down of the price of tea, then nobody can criticise an action such as that taken by the Government and say that it is wrong. Only when we borrow from the commercial banks, over whom the State has absolutely no control, is the red light seen with regard to our financial position generally.  I think the machinery is available, though it may not be very effective at the moment, in many ways to keep prices down, to control different commodities.  According to the various Ministers, it is not working successfully.  Deputy Lemass, the former Minister for Industry and Commerce, pointed out that the control of prices was a very difficult subject to deal with.  The present Minister will find it no easier.  If money causes a rise in prices and if its control lies outside <Col N="454" /> the hands of the Government, how can they, in turn, hope to keep down the cost of the commodity?  The real control that should be in the hands of the Government is control over money.  Until that control is exercised by this or some other Government then we shall be arguing&mdash;if we are still here&mdash;for many a day and many a year on how the cost of living can be kept down.</P>
    <P>I want to deal now with the reduction that was made in the price of butter.  I believe that when that reduction in the price of butter took place the Government felt they were killing two birds with the one stone: (1) they felt they were carrying out an election promise to reduce the cost of living and (2) they felt that, by the reduction, they might help to increase the consumption of butter at home so that, when our agricultural economy had improved and an expansion had taken place in the dairying industry&mdash; as we are led to believe by the Minister for Agriculture&mdash;the increased consumption of butter in Ireland would save us the expense of having to export that butter to Britain and to pay them a subsidy for taking it from us.  In my view, the reduction of 5d. per lb. made very little difference to the public and, in particular, it made very little difference to the poorer sections of the community who, at most, can buy two or three lb. of butter in the week.  A reduction of 5d. in the lb. did not mean that they were enabled to buy one extra lb. of butter per week.  If the reduction were such that a family that normally buys three lb. of butter per week was enabled to buy an extra lb. in the week then I would agree that the reduction was worthwhile.  However, from the knowledge at my disposal&mdash; and I am subject to correction on this &mdash;I do not believe the consumption of butter has gone up to any remarkable degree as a result of the lowering of the price by 5d. per lb.  Our whole idea should be to get down the price of butter as low as possible and to increase home consumption.  Is it not a much better proposition in the long run that the butter should be consumed here at home, and so build up <Col N="455" /> our people, rather than&mdash;if we have a surplus&mdash;that our people here in Ireland cannot afford to buy it because of the price and that we have almost to beg the British or somebody else to buy it from us and, in addition, pay them a subsidy to take it?  In my view, the reduction of 5d. per lb. was penny wise and pound foolish.</P>
    <P>It may be a little too early yet to criticise severely the actions of the present Government.  My criticism at the beginning of my speech to-night was that, from what I had gathered in the earlier portions of this debate, certain elements in the Government now suggest that all they had promised to do was their best.  I want to remind the public that the present Government did not get into office on any such mild statement.</P>
    <P>They got office on the specific promise to reduce the cost of living and to lower taxation.  If anybody wishes to check that from last week's debate, Deputy Michael O'Higgins reaffirmed that that was one of the reasons why the Government was elected when he said, as reported at column 270 of Volume 148:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is the policy of this Government to get down the cost of living.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In other words, that is the reason why they moved from one side of the House to the other and were given control. I think it would be just too bad to let Fine Gael, particularly, away with all that plámás, that all they promised to the Irish public was: &ldquo;We shall do our best.&rdquo;  So long as we get it clear in our minds that they gave specific promises through their election agents, through their leaflets, pamphlets and so forth to do a job, so far as I am personally concerned, I am prepared to give them time but I hate the idea of suggesting, or trying to put it across on us, that they did not make these promises.</P>
    <P>In the next six months, definite financial measures will come before this House and when the Budget is being discussed we shall have a chance of seeing what their policy for the future really is, how they hope to lower taxation and to reduce the cost of <Col N="456" /> living.  It may be that this Government find it completely impossible to lower the cost of commodities.  If they do, all we expect them to say is that they cannot do it but there are alternative suggestions that can be made.  One is that if they cannot reduce prices, they can increase wages and they can help to inject more money into industrial concerns and agriculture so that employers and employees, whether they be on the land or in the factories, will have more money in order to buy commodities and the necessaries of life. They have that alternative and I hope that we shall see in the very near future that these steps are taken.</P>
    <P>I think that the temper of the people is such that they are beginning to lose faith in institutions such as this Parliament, where we have nothing but a string of promises from one election to the other.  Then it is felt that political Parties and politicians can within a few months turn round and blandly say: &ldquo;Well, we promised nothing; we only promised that we would do our best.&rdquo;  Let us hope that when the Budget comes along this Government will at least be able to do what they suggested they would have been able to do if Fianna Fáil had gone out of office prior to the introduction of the last Budget.</P>

      <P>In this debate so far, discussion has centred around prices.  It was the same during the election campaign&mdash;prices were bandied around the different platforms. This time last year when the Supplies and Services Bill was being discussed, we had some very interesting statements from the present Minister&mdash;at least they have become interesting in the light of what has happened since. As reported in column 1711 of Volume 142, speaking in relation to prices, the Minister said that the Government&mdash; that is the Fianna Fáil Government&mdash; were priding themselves on having stabilised prices of different commodities, food and other items.  He was not satisfied evidently with that state of affairs.  He seemed to think that that was not good enough, that when Fianna Fáil were over on that side of the House the price of a number of items should have been reduced.  He <Col N="457" /> went on to indicate the grave dissatisfaction there was among the public on account of the high cost of living.  One speaker over there last week said that the cost of living was not worrying the people at the moment.  &ldquo;The people are quiet,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;in regard to the cost of living.&rdquo;  He must be living in a fool's paradise.  He cannot be in touch with the people.  If they are quiet, it certainly is all the worse for the present Government, as some day they will erupt because the cost of living has never before been at its present level.</P>
      <P>The present Minister when on this side of the House last year gave a list of items, the price of which had increased.  He said: &ldquo;This document shows an increase in sweets, milk, peas, yeast, fuel, petrol, paraffin oil, methylated spirits, coal, cocoa, electricity, gas, cigarettes, tobacco, agricultural machinery, bicycles&rdquo; and so forth.  Earlier he had mentioned the price of tea when he said: &ldquo;Tea is now 5/- per lb.&rdquo; and he compared it with 2/8d. some time previously.  He quoted from a statement by Deputy Byrne referring to the 9d. loaf as something that was utterly outside the reach of the ordinary working man.  That was a lashing by the present Minister of the prices operating this time last year.</P>
      <P>The present Minister has since gone into a position where, for the last six months, he could have done something about that list he mentioned.  He could have done something about the 9d. loaf mentioned by Deputy Byrne; he could have done something about Deputy Dunne's pint of stout.  What is the picture to-day?  I shall quote from a list of commodities the prices of which have increased, some of them very steeply since Deputy Norton became Minister.  The commodities are cocoa, coffee, tea, which was mentioned by the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

How will the people pay for the cheaper tea they are now getting?  When the price of tea drops in India and Ceylon and the other tea-producing countries will Tea Importers get their own back by being allowed to keep the price of tea at its present level when the price of tea in other countries has fallen?  Will that be the Government's method of refunding the £1,250,000 to Tea Importers?  Will the Government put a tax on some commodity? What will that commodity be?  Will we have a Coalition Finance Minister with enough backbone to impose a tax in order to get that money? The price of turf has gone up.  The price of coal has soared.</P>

I brought to the Minister's notice the fact that American coal is selling in Donegal at £10 per ton; a mixture of American and British coal is selling at something less than that, but not much less, and the Minister in reply to questions asked earlier in relation to fuel said that he had nothing to do with that business; it was not his headache at all.  He had no control over the price of coal.  It could go sky-high and he was not prepared to do anything about it.  It has gone sky-high in my constituency.  It is one of the commodities which has increased steeply in price since the present Minister took over.  The price of flake meal has increased.  The price of bacon has increased on several occasions since the present Minister went into office, and increased on his instructions.  The price of chocolate, meat, eggs, cheese, paraffin&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to Volume 142 of the Official Report, column 1708:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In view of the length of time which has elapsed since the Minister stated that the Supplies and Services Bill is unnecessary and unwanted, and that it should be scrapped and permanent price legislation introduced in its stead, I do not know whether we shall see that legislation by the year 1955 or what the character of the legislation is likely to be.  I have an unhappy feeling about price legislation and all the talk we have heard about price legislation over the past two years.  We can see clearly that the Government are slipping away, day by day and month by month, from their responsibility.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Yet, the Minister comes in here in 1955 with the very same Supplies and Services Bill.  And, mind you, in his opening statement there was no guarantee that by 1956 a comprehensive measure of permanent legislation would be introduced to deal with prices.  There was a pious hope that by the end of the year it might not, but there was the careful warning that it could happen it would be necessary for a further year to continue the Supplies and Services Bill after 1956.  There was then another question asked by the Minister: &ldquo;Does everybody not know perfectly well that it is harder to live to-day for the ordinary man and woman than it has ever been in the past 30 years?&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is more true to-day than it was at this time last year.  The cost of living has mounted and the Minister said in 1954 that the unemployment figure was 60,000 and he said: &ldquo;How <Col N="462" /> can those 60,000 unemployed exist with their families?&rdquo;  How can they exist to-day suffering from the increases in the price of commodities since he came into office?  And to-day we have 72,000 unemployed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is not that dishonest&mdash; to quote this month?  If you quote this day 12 months, the figures are 7,500 more than they are to-day.  You must know that because you are supplied with the information each week.  The unemployment figure is 7,500 less to-day than it was this day 12 months.</P>

      <P>The Minister came into the House on the 23rd August.  No, it was before the 23rd August, and he said that on the 23rd August the price of butter would be reduced by 5d. per lb. and when questioned as to how that would be effected, he said: &ldquo;We are doing it through savings.&rdquo;  And what is the <Col N="463" /> position in regard to savings to-day? The present Government wanted Fianna Fáil to get out before the Budget they had introduced went through the House.  That was an insinuation that the present Government would leave the taxpayers in a more happy mood and could only mean one thing&mdash;that they would reduce taxation, that they would cut expenditure and that less money would be spent in running the country.  The money provided in that Fianna Fáil Budget was about £6,000,000 too little for the present Coalition.  They would have to find £6,000,000 over and above that provided for in the Fianna Fáil Budget unless the situation improved. It is a good job that they were not allowed to produce that miraculous Budget which would be £20,000,000 short by this time.</P>
      <P>The subsidisation of butter is not going to come from savings wherever else it comes from and each and every one of us can have our own private guesses.  That was not bad enough. Into the bargain the Minister for Agriculture proceeded to export our subsidised butter.  A question I had down before the Christmas indicated that for the three months after August 23rd&mdash; that was the time on which the butter was subsidised&mdash;we exported to Britain and the Six Counties a quantity of butter on which our people had paid £80,000 in subsidy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very hard not to take notice.  In three months this Government had exported butter to the Six Counties and to Britain on which the Irish consumer had paid £80,000 in subsidy.  That amounts to one third of a million in 12 months. <Col N="464" /> I did refer to the unemployment question but there is one more serious matter which is worrying a lot of people and that is the vast increase in emigration, especially in the age group between 17 and 20.  There is wholesale emigration in that particular age group and very many people throughout the country are worried about it.  It all may not be due to any act of the present Government. It may be due, or part of it may be due, to other factors.  But over the past few months&mdash;actually since the beginning of the year&mdash;it has reached enormous proportions simply because with a figure of 72,000 unemployed&mdash; two weeks ago the figure was 74,000&mdash; emigration is bound to increase.  The figure for unemployment in September &mdash;and I doubt if the present Government were long enough in office to take credit for September's low unemployment figure&mdash;was 48,000.  Yet it has jumped in the meantime to 74,000 and at present it stands at 72,000.  Is it any wonder that the younger boys and girls of the age group which I mentioned are looking around them seeing their older friends and companions unemployed, seeing their fathers unemployed, and deciding for themselves that there is no future for them in this country under present conditions?  It is an alarming fact and something that should seriously be tackled by any Government.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Dáil Eireann is of opinion that immediate steps should be taken by the Government to deal with the serious national problems of (a) excessive emigration of our people in recent years, (b) the movement of our people from the countryside, and (c) the endemic unemployment in parts of the country; otherwise the country's ability to maintain <Col N="465" /> its present economic standing will be seriously impaired.</P>
    <P>The motion deals with the problem of emigration and the consequences of emigration if it is allowed to continue at the present rate.  It is not necessary to quote figures.  Statistics are available to every Deputy and have been published in newspapers.  Apart from statistics and newspaper reports, it is evident to anyone living in the country that emigration is showing its effects very forcibly.  Those effects are apparent in the number of schools that are closed and which have become derelict, in the small attendance at schools, in the reduced number of teachers as compared with ten, 15, 25 or 30 years ago, in the congregations in churches, constituted in the main by older men and women. This is clear evidence which must convey to the most meagre intelligence that the question is one of serious importance. The result of a continuance of the present rate of emigration must inevitably be the upheaval of our economy.  If the youth of this country continues to emigrate at the present rate, production must decline and production is the only means by which we can maintain social services.  The social services which we are good enough to increase year by year must come to finality if we cannot produce the wealth to meet our commitments. In that respect our economic condition is unstable.  May I ask what is the time allowed for this debate?</P>

      <P>Very well.  I have no desire to keep anyone out of the debate and my opening remarks would be limited by the extent to which I thought others might like to take part.</P>
      <P>I do not introduce the motion in any spirit of animosity or condemnation of a Government present or past.  I introduce it in a fair, open way in the hope that a clear discussion will take place out of which will come plans, schemes and suggestions which will have the effect of remedying a serious national position.  I introduce the motion without any bias, with no intention to find fault with the efforts made by previous Governments or to lay the blame for mistakes which have created and accelerated emigration.  No Government can completely wash its hands and say: &ldquo;We are not responsible for this extraordinary exodus of young people from the countryside.&rdquo;  No one can charge any Government that has been in office in this country with a sinister motive.  In every Government that has been in power since this State was established there have been honest men who proved their worth, loyalty, patriotism and desire to do good.  But, even those with the best intentions may find themselves committed to a plan and a policy that will produce results quite different from those that were intended.  Every Government of this State has been well intentioned but, somehow, aimed at grasping too much and overestimated the resources of this country and, in doing so, injured very seriously some of the minor interests that make up the whole or the greater part of the whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have many times in this House indicated that the condition of the people in the West of Ireland called for special attention.  With the experience of 30 years behind me, I maintain that I was right and that the idea of accepting exclusively the advice of experts as to what it was economic to produce here and what it was uneconomic has proved a failure.  Economic production is a splendid thing provided it means that we can produce commodities <Col N="467" /> that can bear competition with similar commodities produced elsewhere.  When the State was established it was understood that our resources and industrial experience were not equal to those of other countries with whom we had to compete.  We had in mind, and it seemed very sound and sensible, that agriculture, which was the main industry, was not of itself a sound basis on which to build the State and there were writers and thinkers who advocated that agriculture should be supported by industrial undertakings.</P>
    <P>All that met with ready acceptance by a people who were accustomed to the hardship of producing, under competitive international prices, agricultural goods at a very uneconomic price. But the trial of this thing brought us into the position that while we applied protection to encourage our home industries we found that the result was not as immediately beneficial as we had thought.  In theory, it was sound and good, but in practice it had queer results.  Every industry in this country, or almost every industry, meant an increased price on the consumer.  To the bulk of those engaged in those industries as workers, the position was met by the demand through their unions that increased wages must follow.  But this result of an increased price for the workers produced an increased price for the goods and an uneconomic wage for them.  This resulted in striking at what might be called the middleman.</P>
    <P>Our economy and our national wealth here comprised a group of farmers of moderate-sized farms whose work was done by their own family mainly.  These people worked not on a wage fixed by a trade union or an economic standard of living but on a strong desire, on that home instinct, that the home was the important place and that work and time and money did not count.</P>
    <P>As time grew on, that section of the community was being crushed out. The result to-day is shown very forcefully by the number of small farmers who are the mainstay of our country, who were in the past and are <Col N="468" /> to-day if allowed to continue in existence and who will be for the time to come if they are encouraged.  That was the section of the community who worked without looking at the clock and produced wealth by work and sweat, and who honoured and gloried in it.  But the position was made untenable. Everywhere around them, there was every encouragement for the youth to quit that hard work, to quit the hours without count of production and to join some form of union that would enable them to find industrial employment where their hours of work were regulated and their wages were regulated in strict accordance with the cost of living.  Is it any wonder that the youth began to leave?  They watched in vain for some hope of encouragement to the family that remained at home.  Probably at all times in the last 100 years or so in this country too many people depended on the farm, they became unambitious, they were satisfied to live, they were after coming out of the period of the Famine and even existence in a meagre way was a sort of sheltered condition that their father or grandfather could have told them did not exist so successfully when they were youths.  Nevertheless, the growing development of things and the conditions offered in an adjoining country and also in America and elsewhere encouraged our youth out.  And yet our young farmers, our young people, were hopeful that something would be done to improve their lot in time. They learned of the dark days when they were driven out of their farms by the landlords, ruthlessly and without prospect before them.  They thought of the home Government&mdash;surely some redress must come now.  In reality, their condition was&mdash;not intentionally by any Government but by the general policy of Governments&mdash;made impossible and untenable and hence they took to the ships and looked for employment elsewhere.  Our emigration has grown and grown to the extent that now it has become a matter of national emergency.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the increased cost of living due to the effort to introduce industrial undertakings here.  To what <Col N="469" /> extent will that improve the countryside? Strange to think, we find and we realise that, nationally, industrial undertakings here were an improvement&mdash;side by side with agriculture they were ideal&mdash;but when those industries were introduced the countryside that needed them most, where the most of our people were centred, could get none of them.  They were too far away from the seaport, and the importation of the raw material essential for many of the new industries would cost more to transplant down the country than if used in a seaport town.  Hence, economically, the country areas could not have industries.  How many industries, of those new industries that have been established, are in the countryside? Look, if we want to maintain an economically sound country there is only one way of doing it, that is, to develop agriculture side by side with industry, to develop agriculture and use the surplus population engaged in agriculture in industry in their own area.  Let them, if possible, live in their own homes, at their own firesides, in their own cottages; let them go out to do this industrial work and go home at the week-end with their wages in their pockets and thereby put that family in a sound economic condition that will be an encouragement for the youth to remain.  Instead of that, we are uneconomic when it comes to industry, we have to apply protection in order to make it possible and, having done that, it is uneconomic to transplant the industries down to the countryside because it costs a few shillings more in transport in conveying the raw materials down and transporting the manufactured article back again to the large centres of population.  It is inconsistent, it is not logical and it is ruinous in its results.</P>
    <P>In the old days, we had some recognition of the poorer parts of the country under the British Government under the Balfour regime.  He recognised that congested areas or slum areas were a reflection on the British Government's authority.  He established what was known as the Congested Districts Board to specialise in some means of improving the conditions of living in those areas where the farms were too small to <Col N="470" /> maintain the family connection.  That board was subsidised by the British Government and as a result of that&mdash; and that is back now 40 or 50 years ago, I cannot give a date&mdash;this State is still drawing a subsidy from the endowments awarded by the British Government to relieve congestion in that part of the country and to help the people who are there, who live there and are confined and constrained to live there.  That money is still coming into the revenue here; but by an Act of the home Government, early in its acceptance here, that money was transferred from the people for whom it was intended and now goes into the general revenue and so goes to the general benefit of the revenue of the State.  That money was to encourage and to maintain the people in the poorer districts; that is on record, and you people on that bench are drawing each year a sum of money specifically set aside to give relief and to improve and make better the condition of the people in the poorer districts; it was provided by the old, bad British Government and you are drawing that and paying it into the general revenue and spending it on the millionaire as well as on the poor.</P>

      <P>Very well.  One would have thought, and we were all told, that in dealing with the division of land special consideration would be given to the smaller farmers, that migration would to a large extent mean the breaking up of the ranches, very numerous some years ago and still very numerous, to relieve the congestion in the poorer parts.  But what was done?  I asked a question here some short time ago, to find out how many people were taken out in the form of migration.  I was led aside. The Minister told me he could not give figures for different counties as that would give rise to animosity, ill-feeling and jealousy.  The figures should be available to any Deputy on that question.  I cannot understand why there is reticence in giving figures for each county.  There is something sinister at the bottom of it, but I will <Col N="471" /> not pursue it at the moment any further than that.</P>
      <P>When it comes to migration, the poorest parts of this country are&mdash;I will not say completely&mdash;but very seriously neglected.  It is true that figures are given of a total acreage of land divided and shown as going towards the relief of congestion, but these figures in many parts of the country refer not to any improvement of the condition of the people but refer to the complete elimination of the population of that area.  Wherever an acreage of land divided by the Land Commission is given, it includes not new land taken from the ranchers in the well-to-do part of the county, but farms bought off small farmers in the locality and distributed again to the adjoining holdings.  That may appear in one respect as of advantage.  It is, so far as it increases an area of land which a small farmer has secured and therefore makes his holding more economic, but it also reduces the population of the area by one family.  There is no improvement so far as land division is concerned.  No new land is being made available, but one farm is eliminated, one more home gone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will go further.  There is on foot&mdash; not perhaps deliberately, I am not in a position to say that, but it is on foot and is as obvious to me as that I am speaking from this bench to-night&mdash; there is in existence as a result of general policy&mdash;again I will not say it is part of deliberate policy&mdash;a plan by which certain counties are ear-marked for complete elimination so far as population is concerned.  The Land Commission is no longer interested in migrating people from a poor farm to better land but they are very interested in buying up the lands of these people and putting them under forests.  Forests may be a grand thing and over long periods may contain much wealth for the State if we can wait long enough for it, but I dare any man to say that the trees, however beautiful, or attractive they may be to the incoming tourists can ever replace the shrill cry of little children.  They are closing the homes, the churches and the schools. That is what the policy of Governments in the past has been.  I know one half <Col N="472" /> of a county which has never received a migrationary grant but where all the land is now being bought over through the Forestry Section of the Land Commission for forests.  It is a national advantage, no doubt, over a long period but what award are the men getting who are being driven out?  £4 a week, maximum.  We are driving them out of their homes without a shilling in their pockets with which they can ever start again.  Is it any wonder that our people are going?  Is it any wonder that we see the homes in ruins, the churches half-populated and the schools closed?  This is not general, but I am speaking of areas which contained high populations of industrious, hardy people in the past, people who were intelligent and tuned to hard work, who have since been driven out.  I cannot say that the Government is not responsible&mdash;though not deliberately&mdash;by applying their general policy.  The general policy did not take into consideration the special economic needs of different districts as Balfour did 50 years ago when he established the Congested Districts Board.  He was prepared to provide ameliorative conditions to meet the people's needs, but his plan was swept aside.  Nothing was substituted.</P>
    <P>We established a general policy for agriculture which was a great improvement and we introduced&mdash;again it was a sound policy from the national point of view&mdash;a policy of providing our own needs in wheat and such things as we had to purchase previously from the United States and Canada and other countries at a great disadvantage in the matter of exchange.  We guaranteed farmers whose land was suitable good, economic prices, fixed by arbitration between the farmers and the Government which was going to pay the subsidy.  The price of wheat went up beyond what it would have gone to if we were to buy the same products from outside.  But what about the poor land and what about the poor farmer whose land was not capable of growing wheat?  All that happened was that he had to pay more.  Similarly, in the case of beet, and this, too, was a great national asset.  The farmer who was in a position to produce beet gained, <Col N="473" /> and an economic price for his goods was established but the poor people with the land unsuitable for growing the beet got no benefit and had to pay more.  The people had to emigrate because their conditions were so reduced that they could not stand any more.</P>
    <P>I am mentioning these things not in any spirit of hostility.  The general motive was good and from the national point of view was successful, but it lacked that individual attention, that appreciation of particular needs of each district and each section of the community which is the form of attention the people should receive from their own Government.  It is the kind of attention that a father would apply to his own children.  He has to look after each one, as far as he can, individually.  Up to the present, Governments are completely neglecting these areas.  We set out with the idea that we were going to have a grand State and that we would build industries side by side with agriculture ensuring economic conditions for everybody who produced but in doing that we made a general policy which was applicable to the biggest farmer with the largest holding in the country as it was to the poorest farmer with the smallest holding.  The result was as we see it now.  Look at the figures of our emigration.  What type of farmers have left this county?</P>
    <P>The farmers of under £30 valuation. They are no longer, under present conditions, able to survive here.  With such high costs, and not being able to participate in the high prices that other farmers can secure for their produce, they have had to give in. They are on the run and in their stead are coming the forest trees&mdash;ideal from the national point of view of 30 to 50 years hence&mdash;but what are the people we are driving out now to do?  They are being driven out without a shilling to take with them except the £4 an acre for their land, and they are coerced into accepting that because once the forests go into an area, that area is doomed so far as farming is concerned.  The adjoining farmers can this year or next year have no alternative but to offer their lands to the <Col N="474" /> Land Commission because for varying causes the land can no longer produce. There is now in existence a measure of coercion that is cruel, but it is the result of the general policy based on the advice of our experts.  Our experts say that timber is useful to grow, that it is a great national asset, but they say this without regard to the consequences of the enforced emigration of our people and on goes this scheme.</P>
    <P>These are some of the things which I think could be remedied and some of the things which I believe have been effective in bringing about the present flow of emigration.  Perhaps a survey of these things would lead us to understand that by some form of moderate approach to the problem, this desolation could be remedied.</P>
    <P>It must always be remembered that our chief source of wealth is agriculture and that those who are trained in agriculture, who have the heritage and the background, our agricultural workers are the real asset.  There are many ways by which scientifically the production from our land can be improved. It is one production in respect of which we can be sure of a free market, without any protection, bounty or bonus in relation to it.  Why not try then to develop this land of ours rather than turn it into forest land for the next 30 years?  Why not utilise these resources to the full so that we can maintain our people and encourage them to remain at home? Even the poorest land can be immensely improved now through the medium of suitable soil testing and the application of manure.</P>
    <P>In this connection, we had a magnificent scheme of land rehabilitation.  That was an excellent scheme indeed, and I do not think we could spend too much money on land improvement, but, in its operation, the scheme, while it was excellent and profitable for the farmers with the good land in its application to the poor land, the land with a poor degree of soil, where the introduction of heavy drainage was of no value whatever in so far as the soil was not deep enough to absorb the moisture overhead because it was held back by the non-porous subsoil, was a complete failure.  It was brought in in a few <Col N="475" /> places, but after a short time the Government withdrew and the scheme is now in abeyance in these areas; but the people in these areas still have to pay for the improvement of the land and the manuring of the land of the better-off farmers and the holders of the better soils, while they themselves are left derelict, which again shows the absurdity and the criminality of applying a general principle without regard to the special needs of particular areas.</P>
    <P>We are dealing here with a problem which is solving itself in a sad way. People have grown tired of waiting in anticipation of things to come for their betterment.  They have watched the failure to produce results over the years and now they are solving the problem by taking their overcoats under their arms, as the song told of the people long ago, and making off for another country.  It is an extraordinary indictment of a native Government that that is allowed to go on&mdash;that the wealth, national and economic, represented by a people trained to hard living over the years, a people accustomed to living and surviving under terrible conditions, should be driven out through the neglect of a native Government.  It is really criminal that that should happen in this State.</P>
    <P>There are representatives of districts like my own in this House who belong to different parties.  Let us speak up; let us demand that the needs of our special areas be looked after as carefully as are the needs of the better off areas, the areas which can grow wheat with success and profit, to the extent that fancy salesmen in Dublin and big merchants were last year encouraged to buy land on rent down the country and engage in a business of which they knew nothing.  Why not try to provide a living for those who know their business, for those who have survived hardships, for those who are industrious and hardworking and are the best people in the world? Why not give them a chance?  Why not come together side by side in face of this problem in relation to these areas from which our people are going? <Col N="476" /> This is all happening under our eyes and surely we ought to make an effort to save what is still left of a hardworking and energetic race.  We talk about the revival of Irish.  That has involved a long struggle and there was a time when Irish was not allowed to be spoken.  It was only under duress and threat of terrible punishment that our people were forced to forget it and to learn another language.  Irish practically disappeared, but there still remained a remnant of Irish speakers in Connemara, in parts of Donegal and parts of the South.  It was back there that we had to go to get the remnants of traditional Irish speakers when we wanted to revive the language.</P>
    <P>The same thing is happening to-day in regard to our agricultural community. We are driving them out and watching them fleeing the land. Occasionally, we say something by way of sorrowful comment, but what are we doing to stop it?  While these young men are still left in the countryside&mdash;not the big farmer or the rancher, but the hardworking industrious farmer who brought up his family in very severe conditions&mdash; it would be wise to take the opportunity of keeping them here.  Otherwise, we will find ourselves in the position of having to hunt after them as we had to hunt after the people in a few areas in Connemara, Donegal and Kerry when we sought to revive the language.</P>

      <P>It was not my intention to intervene in this debate, but I was more or less invited or prodded by Deputy Maguire to saying something with regard to what I believe is a kind of chip which he has on his shoulder in regard to afforestation.  I believe that, if, 20 years ago, the people who then had control of the destinies of this State had gone into the congested districts and had started afforestation there we would have to-day a solution of some of the problems enumerated by Deputy Maguire.  We could put in there State industries based on the <Col N="477" /> timber which would by now be maturing in these areas.  We all know that the surface has not been scratched in dealing with this problem in the West. We now know that migation, as it has been carried on, has not scratched the surface of the problem which exists in that part of the country, and I believe that if we had the raw material to-day and if we could go into these areas and start industries based on afforestation, we would have a much readier and, I believe, a much more acceptable solution of this problem in the West.</P>
      <P>There is, as we all know, a limit to the amount of land available for the relief of congestion anywhere and that practically every county in Ireland has, within its own boundaries, a very high percentage of uneconomic holders. Every public representative representing these counties will argue that the natives of these counties have a prior right to any land available.  In justice, I think we will be forced to concede that, and, conceding that, we will considerably reduce the amount of land available for migrants.  Somebody once said that the lifeblood of a nation is its young men and women.  Every five years, for a number of years, something like 11 per cent. of our rural population move from the land.  There are basic reasons for that and I believe that the major cause is that we have failed to develop our agricultural economy, that our position has remained, and is remaining, practically static and that the pattern of Irish agriculture has not altered within the last 50 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You can do anything you like with statistics but fundamentally we have got to admit that the physical volume of Irish agriculture has not increased anything more than 8 per cent.  We saw recently even the present Minister for Agriculture stating that we had the highest cattle population since 1921. Then a few days later we saw a poke at that by some statistician when he said that the increase in our cattle population was something like 1.4 per cent. since 1921.  You can do anything you like when you come to pounds, shillings and pence, especially with a pound whose purchasing price is varying from month to month and year to <Col N="478" /> year.  But, when you get back to something like physical volume, then you are up against it.  Then you can produce no figures which will show any appreciable increase in our physical volume of agricultural output.</P>
    <P>We have, unfortunately, lagged behind.  If we could boast to-day something like the same proportion of an increase in agriculture as we could boast in industry, then we would be getting somewhere.  If we could say that the proportion of development in agriculture over the past 20 years was as rapid as that of our industrial development, then we might be able to boast of something but agriculture has remained practically static.</P>
    <P>There has been no revolutionary change in the pattern of Irish agriculture and the chief reason is, I think, that there has been no substantial infusion of capital into Irish agriculture. Sops have been thrown out and we know that statisticians and economists estimate that it requires something like a capital investment of £2,000 to find employment for one adult male worker.  If we were to accept that figure and multiply it by the number of people employed in Irish industry we would find that in the development of Irish industry there has been a substantial infusion of capital but in Irish agriculture there has been no such infusion of capital.  Sops have been thrown out and they have helped us more or less to pedal along.  There has been no revolutionary change.</P>
    <P>We have farmed here very much in a tradition.  The pattern of our industrial development has been tending seriously in a direction in which none of us would wish it to go.  It has, to my mind, tended more or less to be the industrialisation of the rural population. The aim of industry here side by side with a well-developed agricultural economy should be to absorb our surplus population from the land.  The position is very much this, that some of our useful workers, people who should be and could be efficiently engaged in agriculture, have been lured into industry because conditions in industry are far more attractive. Wages are better and working conditions <Col N="479" /> are better.  There are better social services available to those engaged in industry.</P>
    <P>Everything tends to load the dice against agriculture.  If you live, as I do, adjacent to an industrial town, you will find that there is an absolute dearth of agricultural employees.  The big problem in the area from which I come is to find any worker at any price to remain on the land.  That is the problem.  I have always argued that if we could have basically improved the pattern of agriculture the tendency would be, if we could provide conditions on the land comparable with those in industry, that there would be a counter-pull which would to some extent arrest this inordinate flight from the land.</P>
    <P>This movement from the land; this movement into urban areas creates, as Deputy Maguire said, a very acute problem because if you look you will find that the rural school is empty and where four teachers had been employed 30 years ago the school is now amalgamated and you have two teachers.  You have a falling average and a demand for increased school accommodation in the towns when the rural school empties.  You have a demand for increased church accommodation in the cities.  The whole trend is the emptying at one end and the problem of trying to relieve congestion at the other.</P>
    <P>The solution is no short-term one. We have got to seriously examine the position with regard to agriculture. There is a number of basic and inherent problems to be got over.  There is the problem, of course, of the small uneconomic holder.  Sixty per cent. of the farms of Ireland slide down the scale from 50 statute acres.  Those of us who are old enough can cast our minds back and remember the time when families in rural areas kept together.  We saw what happened.  We saw them remaining there together as old bachelors and spinsters because they were never able in all the years they worked together to put by any wage.</P>
    <P>I have always maintained that if a boy or girl remains on the land the boy is at least entitled to the minimum agricultural wage.  If he could say to <Col N="480" /> himself each week that he had put by the minimum agricultural wage, then he had something.  If, on the other hand, the girl could say at the end of each working week that she had put by so much for her labour then she had something.  We know that this small farm economy has been a great asset in one direction.</P>
    <P>It has helped and has kept our economy from totally collapsing. The time has come when our people are better educated, and, given physical strength, they are prepared to go abroad, and are no longer content to remain at home.  The more adventurous will always go, and will find remunerative employment awaiting them.  We have not this old policy of helping families to remain together.  We can see in the small holdings in Ireland one thing done, and that is rearing families by toil and hard work.  Those small holders and small farmers can rear their children and give them an adequate education which will enable them to go out and fend for themselves. Even on the larger holdings&mdash; anyone who knows the pattern of rural Ireland is aware&mdash;there is room for two people, at least one boy and girl, and the other must go.  If they cannot remain they must find an outlet.  In fairness to those who remain they must go in time, but if the problem is to be solved we have got to develop and increase our output.</P>
    <P>We know, by comparison, that we are away down the line.  We know by comparison that our methods of production are in many instances stone age.  This is a problem which requires the most intensive study and concentration over a long period.  The solution is not a ready one, but we have got to begin and to examine the thing. If any solution is to be found it must basically be found in the development and the increased output of our farms. You can only develop industry in this country in proportion to our agricultural output.  Everyone knows that 80 per cent. of our exports consists of agricultural produce.  Everyone further knows that most of our materials and most of our machinery is imported, and also some tools, and in many instances <Col N="481" /> some of the technical skill.  Those can only be paid for in the main by our agricultural exports.  There are very few, even at this stage, exporting industries. Agriculture must remain the mainstay, and we know that unless we want to pack-mule Irish agriculture we can only increase our industrial output and our industrial development <i>pro rata</i> to an increase in our agricultural economy.</P>
    <P>Emigration has been for years and years a severed artery from which this nation is slowly but surely bleeding to death.  Fifty years ago somebody reckoned that every able-bodied man and woman exported from the shores of Ireland meant a capital loss of something like £500.  If at that time that was a reliable figure, what now would be the capital loss in our emigration with the increased social services? Every able-bodied man, or any boy or girl who has reached the age of 21 and leaves this country, goes at a time when he or she has returned nothing. There is a capital loss and there is something much more; there is a consequential loss.  They go to the countries to which they have emigrated and give them their toil, brawn, muscle and brain in the building of their economy. Here we find ourselves with an ever-growing and disproportionate number of old people.  I think this is a problem which should engage, over a long period, the best brains we could get to work on it.  I believe that fundamentally we have to go back and find a solution in the rehabilitation, reorientation and the revitalisation of our agricultural economy.</P>

      <P>The proposer and the other speaker to this motion so far have said so much with which I agree that I have no difficulty in dealing with their arguments.  I would like, however, to refer to the first point made by Deputy Moher the advisability of afforestation.  I put it to Deputy Moher that the first inter-Party Government in this country made more progress with afforestation than any other Government since 1922.  I agree with the Deputy that afforestation is one way of making long-term progress <Col N="482" /> in this country.  I agree also that the solution to the problem dealt with in the motion is no short-term one.  I think, on the whole, it is a bit late in the day for a person representing the Party which was in power for 20 years to speak to-night on the lines of agriculture, agriculture, agriculture.  To my mind, progress in agricultural methods did not occur since the year 1948.  To my mind, they were reasonably apparent in the years immediately prior to the war.  That is the period that the Party opposite&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is fair enough to make that point all the same.  Deputy Moher made one other point when he said that there was no progress in agriculture because of the lack of proper infusion of capital.  I have agreed with that view, not since I came into the House, not since I stood on this side of the House, but for a very long time; I have felt that progress in this country depended on a progressive policy of putting working capital into agriculture.  I believe that during a long period we concerned ourselves with that, and it may well be that in the circumstances at the time it was right; it is very easy to pass judgment afterwards, but we have for a very long period concerned ourselves with the development of industry. That is the sort of thing anybody could agree with.  We might all have differences of opinion as to the margin at which we might stop, but we would all agree that we should develop our industries, and again&mdash;to give the Party opposite their due&mdash;ensure the production at home of our requirements, as far as possible, of food, clothing and shelter.  These are reasonable objects for any Government in this country.  I feel, however&mdash;and I think it has considerable bearing on this motion&mdash;that there was not sufficient attention paid to the development of agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion is in three parts&mdash;first of all, that the Government should do something about the excessive emigration <Col N="483" /> of our people in recent years. Might I say that emigration of our people from this country did not start to-day or yesterday and it is not peculiarly an economic problem which Deputy Maguire seemed to make it entirely?  It is somewhat more complex than that.  The social factors involved are of considerable importance.  For example, it is well known that many more women emigrate than men.  That is believed to be due, in part at least, to the high average age of marriage in this country.  Apart from that there is a tradition of emigration.  The pull aspect of emigration rather than the push aspect, which seemed to be emphasised by Deputy Maguire, has frequently been referred to.  The Irish going abroad to the two main areas to which they went, to the United States until comparatively recently, had one great advantage over competing persons in those markets&mdash;they knew the language, which was English in each case.  The motion says that immediate steps should be taken. Immediate steps might be taken but, in the words of Deputy Moher, the solution is no short-term one.  Therefore, immediate steps would only have a marginal effect in the near future.</P>
    <P>The second point in this motion refers to the movement of our people from the countryside.  That has been a feature of Western civilisation for at least 100 years.  Many people would put it further back than that but if you take the growth of the City of Belfast it is now as a city about 100 years old and you may take it that the movement of the people from the countryside in every country in the world has taken place in the last 100 years.  The difference in Ireland has been that our people have tended to emigrate rather than to come into cities and towns in this country. Whether Deputies would agree with me or not that, in fact, has changed to some extent in the past 30 years because the population of this country has remained static in the past 30 years and whereas the population in the cities and towns has considerably increased, the number of the persons <Col N="484" /> in the countryside has decreased. That has some bearing on the agricultural problem to which I will turn later.</P>
    <P>The solution to this movement of our people from the countryside is not to keep them there compulsorily and I might say the same applies to the first part of the motion.  After all, if we are to have individual freedom you cannot stop people emigrating. Similarly you cannot stop people moving from the rural areas into the towns and cities.  Therefore, these two parts of the motion add up to a movement which is world wide.  It has occurred in all other countries in the world and there is no reason why it should not occur in this country with an improved standard of living.</P>

      <P>The third part of the motion refers to endemic unemployment in parts of the country.  That is the part of the motion to which I think Deputy Maguire paid greatest attention.  The Government representative of the Party of which Deputy Moher is a member, made a number of efforts, the most recent of which was the establishment of An Foras Tionscal, to create employment in any part of the country where industrialisation had least penetrated.  I personally have been rather astounded at the lack of success of An Foras Tionscal in the last couple of years.  It started off with a considerable flourish of trumpets and I think it is not unfair to say that on the whole it has been a comparative failure.  If the population west of the Shannon is to be kept at its present level, let alone increased, the only way in which it could be done is by increased industrialisation west of the Shannon, an increase in economic activity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Do you mind my saying that that is no solution although the Deputy may think it is?  What the Deputy has in mind is the problem of the small-holding that is uneconomic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>If you say that any alleviation of the problem is a help, I would be bound to agree with you. This is mainly a problem in so far as this country is concerned, if one considers an increasing population, of providing employment here.  How can employment be provided?  It can only be provided in two ways, by the development of our natural resources, the point that Deputy Moher makes, and by the development of new projects in industry and commerce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are really the only methods. Take, for example, agriculture.  There <Col N="486" /> seems to me to be in recent years, as for the past five or six years, a development in the direction that Deputy Moher and I would desire, that is, a greater amount of working capital available on the farms.  This has taken, in the main, the form of an improved supply of mechanical implements, and so forth.  I am emphasising entirely the private enterprise end of it.  I was very glad to see recently a reference to the importation of 250 combine harvesters of a particular make and the difficulty of storing them at the moment.  Is it not clear to everybody that this past year's harvest, in the circumstances which now exist in this country, could not possibly have been saved to the extent it was without these mechanical implements?  Is that not quite clear?  That is only a partial proof of the point on which we both agree.</P>
    <P>On the industrial side, I think other Deputies might disagree with me that the restriction of credit which we had in this country for a period had definitely deleterious effects.  It held up development for a period of time. I would hope that that particular period of the restriction of credit is over.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I say that during the past four or five months I became interested in this problem. Just before Christmas, I noticed that 3½ per cent.  British War Loan has declined from 92 to 85½ or 86&mdash;a drop of six points.  During that period, our most recent loan has gone up four points, from 96 to par.  That is an improvement in the credit rating of this country of ten points relative to the British credit rate&mdash;and that is a considerable achievement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>The only thing I regret about agricultural credit is the fact that the Agricultural Credit Corporation has so tied itself up in land mortgages that, a few years ago, very nearly 50 per cent. of the applications were rejected on first examination on the grounds that the title was not in order.  We all know what title questions are in this country.  I am not saying that that is the position at the moment.  I have reason to believe that, about this time last year, a change was made to some extent&mdash;I do not know the extent&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>That, also, I hope is a matter which might be attended to.  To come back to the problem that Deputy Moher posed as regards the immediate future, it seems to me that it is fairly obvious that sterling as a currency is running into a difficult period again.  The increase in the bank rate is now admitted in Britain to be mainly in defence of sterling. There was a suggestion that it was to prevent an increase in hire purchase, and so forth, and it will have effects in that direction but, on the whole, this change in the atmosphere&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Parliamentary Secretary could only divest himself of the political cloak and talk as an economist it might be easier for those of us who are listening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking for myself in this matter.  If, in fact, the bank rate should continue to increase in Britain, I would hope that in this <Col N="488" /> country we would not see a similar increase.  Moreover, if sterling is running into a comparatively difficult period, surely&mdash;following a year in which, contrary to expectations at one time during the year our balance of payments more than balanced&mdash; that is a period during which this country as a whole should go in for capital investment?</P>
      <P>Deputy Maguire said that the early Governments of this country overestimated the resources of the country. I do not agree with that.  I feel&mdash;and it is easy to be wise after the event&mdash; that the early Governments of this country&mdash;and I am not condemning them&mdash;underestimated the resources of the country.  We have the means to continue developing this country no matter what temporary difficulties may occur in any other part of the world, particularly when we are aware that there is a public opinion in this country which desires that we should bring back for investment here the assets invested abroad.  At least, if we are not going to run down the assets invested previously abroad, we should certainly not have a balance in the current years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that certain figures will be produced by statisticians showing that we had a slight credit last year, or something like that.  I feel, because the payments outwards are much easier to trace than the payments inwards and can be tracked down more accurately, that, in fact, the balance in our favour is a good deal more than is normally shown in the figures. Therefore, I think that this country&mdash; in relation to this motion and particularly in relation to this endemic unemployment in parts of the country &mdash;should make a particular effort during the coming years.  Might I say that there is some evidence of improvement at the moment?  The number of persons unemployed at the moment is 7,500 lower than it was this time last year.  The figure varies slightly up and down, but that is the information we have at the moment. In addition, I appear to notice in recent weeks a better position in the employment market in so far as I am <Col N="489" /> in a position to know it.  I think there is more activity and, of course, that is all part of what we would hope for.</P>
    <P>If I might return for a moment to a theoretical point, might I say that in the past it was frequently urged that &ldquo;society progresses on the backs of the unemployed&rdquo;.  When that was stated, what did it mean?  It meant that at certain periods the unemployed were the people who suffered because there was unemployment due to the introduction of machinery, or that kind of thing.</P>
    <P>As we know, all western countries nowadays believe in full employment. If we have not got full employment in this country since it is a country from which there is considerable emigration, surely it should be the objective of every Government&mdash;and it certainly is the major objective of the present Government&mdash;to create as far as possible full employment.  After all, we have what has been called the safety valve of emigration.  Whether or not you call it a safety valve does not matter a great deal, but at least it does help in the problem of creating full employment.  In addition, we have considerable assets abroad.  We have, moreover, the advantage which has developed recently again of a favourable balance of payments.</P>
    <P>These factors suggest&mdash;perhaps I am glossing over the technical difficulties which may arise about methods of finance&mdash;that for the moment we should concentrate on the real point of the problem.  Once we have these factors, I cannot see why it should not be possible within a reasonable time to create a situation in this country in which there would be no unemployment in the sense mentioned in this motion &mdash;that is to say, endemic unemployment in parts of the country.  Conditions here should be such that any person who is unemployed in one part of the country could move into work in some other part of the country.</P>

      <P>Deputy Maguire made a point which on the whole I do not think is true any longer.  I think it was true at one time but on the evidence at present and for some years back, I do not think that it is true any longer.  The Deputy made the point that the increased cost of living in this country was due to industrialisation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I do not mean it in that sense.  I meant to convey that it is due to some influences outside the country.  Since our currency is on a par with sterling, if sterling depreciates in value our currency depreciates in value also, and the cost of living goes up in monetary terms.  The main point I would make is that on the whole, since the outbreak of war in Korea in the middle of 1950, any increase in the cost of living or the main parts of the increases we have had in this country have been due to outside influences.  There was also, of course, as far as the cost-of-living index goes and so far as it impinged on the people in the towns and cities the abolition of food subsidies.  That is something with which I did not agree personally.</P>

      <P>One other suggestion made during the course of the debate was that the land rehabilitation programme was an excellent scheme and that it had been left in abeyance.

The Parliamentary Secretary in dealing with the question asked me what independent opinion I wanted over and above the independent opinion he had already given.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Question No. 81 we were told this was not a fair interpretation.  Now I have here a letter from the Inland Fisheries (Ireland) Lismore district, 19 South Main Street, Youghal, in which it is stated:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I have to point out that if the site at Ardsallagh is selected the bridge will be detrimental to the salmon fishing industry, on which over 400 fishermen and their families are dependent for a livelihood.  My board take a very serious view of this matter as, if the bridge is built at Ardsallagh, the fishermen will be unable to use their drift nets in the immediate vicinity above the new bridge and, in addition, the five-eighths of a mile between the new and the old bridge will be rendered useless for drift net fishing.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the opinion of the fishing authority in that area.  We have the position then that three consultants&mdash; we will call them that&mdash;have been approached.  Furthermore, the Parliamentary Secretary was wrong in his information as to any opinion expressed by either of the county surveyors of Cork or Waterford.  Both these county surveyors were wise enough to say that they knew nothing about bridge building and, unlike other engineers, they were not going to give an opinion on something they knew nothing about. That brings us back to the three engineers, or consultants.  An engineer was asked by the Cork County Council to give an opinion; he was not asked to give an opinion as to whether or not the bridge could be reconstructed; he was asked to give an opinion as to where the new bridge should be put. That was Mr. Roughan.  Secondly, there was the local government engineer, Mr. Bloomer.  Mr. Bloomer's inquiry was solely confined&mdash;and anyone can discover this for himself by reading the report of the inquiry&mdash;to where the new bridge was to be erected.  Again, there was no question of reconstruction and, therefore, the inquiry into Youghal Bridge was devoted to finding out what would be <Col N="495" /> the best place to erect the new bridge and was not devoted to any question as to the feasibility of reconstruction of the present bridge.  The question of reconstruction only arose when the Youghal Urban Council employed a consultant who gave an opinion and who, with all due respect to those conducting the inquiry&mdash;and I spent three full days sitting there listening to the proceedings&mdash;got such a badgering from the two legal professional men&mdash; we will call them that&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I was about to intervene to suggest to Deputy Corry that he is going too far in his qualifications of both people and inquiries. He may refer to the findings of an inquiry.  As to how the inquiry was conducted, that is a matter he may raise in another way if he so desires. It is not relevant to the matter he is raising here to-night.</P>

      <P>I shall take the merits of the case on two grounds.  First of all I shall take the question of cost.  One engineer said that the cost of reconstructing the bridge would be £350,000 and that it would take from six to ten years to get the work done during which there would be no crossing of the Blackwater.  The second engineer gave a figure of £360,000 and said the bridge could be reconstructed in two to six years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the schoolteacher should be able to tell us.  That was an unfair interruption.  There is no use in the Deputy trying to cut in on my profession.  I am trying to convey to the Chair that the matter is <i>sub judice</i> and that it is very unfair to comment on the evidence that has been given while I am still to adjudicate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my duty to give a decision as a result of the inquiry. I should like to say that I am sorry if I offended Deputy Cunningham in any way, but the position is that I am still in a quasi-judicial capacity.  I have still to make an Order as a result of the inquiry and I have explained to the House that the matter is <i>sub judice.</i>  I hope that if I have said something hastily hurtful to Deputy Cunningham he will accept my apology.</P>
