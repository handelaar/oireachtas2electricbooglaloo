      <P>A grant has been sanctioned by my Department towards the cost of the erection of a new national school to replace the present Killury National School at Causeway, Tralee, County Kerry.</P>
      <P>It is now a matter for the Commissioners of Public Works to make the necessary preliminary arrangements for the erection of the new building. These arrangements will necessarily take a considerable time to complete, but they will be dealt with as expeditiously as possible, having regard to the many other cases on hands which demand attention.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to erect new schools for infants, for senior girls and for senior boys in the Ballyphehane area of Cork City.</P>
      <P>A suitable site has been offered for the infants' and senior girls' schools, and sketch plans have been prepared by the reverend manager's architect and have been approved by my Department and the Commissioners of Public Works.</P>
      <P>The other arrangements preliminary to the sanction of a grant by my Department towards the cost of the girls' and infants' schools have been completed except that documentary evidence of title to the site which is required in order to enable the premises to be vested in trustees by a lease in the official form is not yet forthcoming, owing to the necessity for completing certain protracted formalities. My Department is actively considering whether there is any way in which the difficulty as regards title might be overcome.</P>
      <P>A suitable site has also been offered for the proposed new senior boys' school and sketch plans for the new building have been prepared by the Commissioners of Public Works. The Department is at present in communication with the reverend manager in regard to the other preliminary arrangements which will have to be made before a grant can be sanctioned towards the cost of the new school. Every effort is being made by my Department to have these arrangements completed as expeditiously as possible.</P>

    <Title>Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Women National Teachers' Retirement.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education whether, in view of the fact that the education of many children, especially those in remoter rural districts, is now being entrusted to untrained teachers to the detriment of the children concerned, he will reconsider his decision not to alter the rule requiring women national teachers to retire on marriage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have stated in reply to earlier questions on this subject the continuance in operation of the rule requiring women national teachers to retire on marriage is a matter of general policy involving considerations of a social and economic as well as of an educational nature. It would not be appropriate to rescind or modify this rule for the purpose of dealing with a shortage of teachers.</P>
      <P>Every effort is being made to ensure that an adequate number of trained teachers will be available for national schools at the earliest possible date. The following measures have already been taken:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  It has been arranged as a temporary measure that in certain circumstances principal, assistant and lay assistant teachers may be retained in the service until the end of the quarter in which they reach 68 years of age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  In addition to increased accommodation which it has been found possible to secure in St. Patrick's and Mary Immaculate Training Colleges, for men and women respectively, provision for the accommodation of 55 extra women students in Our Lady of Mercy Training College was made with effect from September, 1954, and accommodation for a further 65 <Col N="1206" /> women students will be available in that college as from September, 1955.</P>
    <P>(3)  As a temporary measure, from September next, pass university graduates (as well as honours graduates) accepted as training college candidates will be permitted to complete the training course in one year, instead of two as was the practice hitherto.  This will result in an increased output of trained teachers from the training college.</P>
    <P>The question of how the supply of trained teachers may be increased still further is being examined.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say whether or not he gave a definite undertaking to the Irish National Teachers' Organisation in 1948, when he was Minister in the previous Coalition Government, that he would alter the regulations in question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is simply making use of an opportunity here to say, or to suggest, what is emphatically an untruth; secondly, he cannot but know it, and he could not produce the slightest scrap of evidence to show that the suggestion in his remark has even a scintilla of truth in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he will state the number of women teachers who had retired on marriage and who were acting as substitute teachers in primary schools on 30th April, 1955.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that the Deputy's question concerns married women whose services are being accepted temporarily in primary schools where a qualified eligible teacher cannot be secured, rather than married <Col N="1207" /> women who are being recognised as substitutes for teachers absent owing to illness or other causes.</P>
      <P>The number of women teachers who had been compulsorily retired on marriage and whose services were being accepted temporarily in primary schools on 1st January, 1955, was 107. Figures related to the 30th April, 1955, are not available at present but can be supplied to the Deputy later if necessary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PhelimAlfredCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands if, in regard to his recent statement that there were plenty of holdings of 33½ statute acres available in the country for farmers willing to migrate, he will state (a) the number and location of such holdings, (b) the number of applications for transfer received from uneconomic holders in the rural districts of Ballina, Belmullet, Swinford and Westport, and (c) whether the Land Commission have considered the propriety of acquiring the holdings referred to in his statement, and, if so, whether the applicants from North Mayo will receive favourable consideration when allotment takes place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. Blowick) Joseph Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Blowick)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy appears to have misunderstood my statement.  The holdings I referred to were the holdings which the Land Commission are constantly creating out of untenanted lands already in their hands.  The question of acquiring them does not, therefore, arise.</P>
      <P>As to part (b) of the question, the time and trouble involved in segregating the applications on the basis of rural districts could not be justified.</P>
      <P>In any event, I would like the Deputy to realise that, of all such applications received, only about one in 20 comes from a really suitable applicant and no doubt the Deputy is aware that in selecting migrants the main consideration of the Land Commission is, and must be, the merit of the surrendered lands for the relief of congestion and rundale in the home locality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhelimAlfredCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood from the <Col N="1208" /> Minister's statement, as reported in the <i>Western People</i> of 30th April, that he has plenty of land in the form of small holdings available&mdash;is that correct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's question would appear to indicate that he understood from me that the holdings to which I referred were holdings not already acquired, whereas I was referring to holdings already in the hands of the Land Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhelimAlfredCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>But the Minister stated that he had plenty of such holdings?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that is quite clear and I do not believe the Deputy did misunderstand.  I think he is trying to pretend that he did.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PhelimAlfredCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lahiffe</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands (a) whether representations have been made to the Land Commission on behalf of local congests for the acquisition and division of the Cunningham lands, Coolsrahra, near Clarin-bridge, County Galway, (b) whether the owner is agreeable to such acquisition, and (c) if he will request the commission to treat the matter expeditiously.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>

      <P>Is not the Minister aware that these lands, comprising <Col N="1209" /> 300 acres, were offered to the Land Commission in exchange for approximately 50 acres nearer to this man's home, and surely this is an instance in which the Minister should bring his authority to bear on the Land Commission to acquire this land and divide it among the congests?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The Land Commission has under consideration at present eight applications from potential migrants resident in County Donegal. As these have not yet been fully examined it is not possible to say how many of the applicants are eligible for new holdings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister give to successful applicants from among these people some of the holdings that he mentioned on 30th April, 1955, as reported in the <i>Western People</i>, when, to quote his own words, there were plenty of excellent 33½ acre holdings <Col N="1210" /> available up the country for those willing to migrate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy aware that the work of the Land Commission has been brought to a virtual standstill in his constituency because nobody is willing to migrate?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands if he will state the lands in North Kerry, which the Land Commission propose to acquire this year for the relief of congestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>In North Kerry the Land Commission have proceedings in progress for the acquisition or resumption of four holdings comprising 302 acres and they are negotiating for the voluntary purchase of four holdings comprising 594 acres.</P>
      <P>These figures do not include several bogs which are also the subject of proceedings and which cover a further area of 381 acres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Owing to uncertainty of the outcome of acquisition proceedings, it would be quite impossible to forecast the particular holdings which may become <Col N="1211" /> available for the relief of congestion in any one year.  Furthermore, I have avoided giving details of the individual holdings involved because, in some cases at least, the negotiations in progress are of a confidential nature.</P>
    <P>For the Deputy's information I should say that last year the Land Commission had preliminary inspections made of estates totalling 2,577 acres for the whole of County Kerry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that there are few openings for forestry graduates in this country outside the State service. The rate of recruitment to the forestry service must be governed by the number of vacancies which occur each year and subject to that opportunities to enter the forestry service will continue to be offered to graduates in forestry as the requirements of the Department permit.  No guarantee of eventual employment in the service can, however, be given to graduates or prospective graduates in forestry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>If there are vacancies in the Forestry Department for these people, is it not reasonable to suggest that these vacancies would be filled by graduates from our universities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to tell the Deputy there are no vacancies at the moment.  There are 43 inspectors and of these 13 are graduates and 30 are not.  A certain percentage, in my opinion&mdash;and a liberal percentage&mdash;of non-graduates, that is, those who have joined as forestry trainees and worked their way from the bottom up, gaining practical experience that only comes with work in the field&mdash;that a certain number of these should be promoted as well as university graduates, with a certain amount of practical experience. I have not a closed mind at all on the subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody suggested for a moment that it should be a closed field.  Is the Minister aware that this country is losing the services of some of the finest forestry experts, who rise to great positions in other countries having been refused employment in Ireland?  The services of these experts are now being utilised to develop other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to take in as many forestry graduates as possible. I am not aware that there are any at the present time who cannot get employment.  I should like to see at <Col N="1213" /> least 50 per cent. graduates and 50 per cent. non-graduates; that is a rough figure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. O'Donnell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have informed the local authority that I approve in principle of the wage of £5 per week proposed by them but that I cannot approve of an increased rate being paid which would, having regard to the provision made by the county council for road works, lead to a reduction in the amount of work done and in the amount of employment given in the current year as compared with the last financial year.

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>According to the Mayo County engineer, the increase proposed would cost £9,000 in the present financial year.  No provision has been made in the Mayo County Council estimates for the year 1955-56 to meet this increase in wages.  In addition, the estimates for rates have been cut by the county council by £10,000.  They cut the estimates but they ask us to subsidise the increase out of State funds, thereby causing less road work to be done and less <Col N="1222" /> employment to be given.  If the county council were anxious to see that the road workers were paid this increase, they would make provision for it.</P>

      <P>When I moved to report progress last night I was making the point that the publicans of Dublin were disappointed and I was proceeding to quote from the <i>Cork Examiner</i> of May 10th a statement made by the Chairman of the Licensed Grocers' and Vintners' Association in which he said that it is most likely that the price of drink will be increased on the consumer in the near future.  He was referring to the Budget statement last week and said that, having consideration for the association's claim, it had created emergency conditions in the trade.  He went on then to state that they had looked forward to a lowering of costs in the trade and said that the least he had expected was that the same relief would be accorded them as was accorded in the previous Budget, even though that relief was small in itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would direct the attention of the Chairman of the Licensed Grocers' and Vintners' Association to the first act of the present Government when they brought in the Finance Bill of 1954 and <Col N="1228" /> when Deputy Lemass on this side of the House then challenged them with the windy promises they had made around the streets of Dublin regarding the poor man's pint.

      <P>Deputy Lemass set out these series of amendments to the Finance Bill of 1954 which had as their purpose&mdash;or which sought, I should say &mdash;bringing the Government to heel and at least bringing them to some realisation of the responsibility they had as a Government.  The front benchers had gone out and made specific promises to the publicans of Dublin and the country. One amendment Deputy Lemass moved in 1954 was in sub-section (1), lines 15 and 16, to delete 7/6 and to substitute 6/6 in the £ for income-tax. That not alone related to income-tax but it related to beer, spirits and tobacco as well.</P>
      <P>What was the reaction of the present Government to that amendment? Their reaction was to troop to the Lobby and endorse every tax we had imposed in the 1952 Budget.  Not alone did they endorse them then, but they still have the hardihood and the brassy countenances to say that they were just and necessary taxes and that the publicans of Dublin would get no relief and that the poor man could pay for his pint and that the cigarette smokers would continue to pay the increased price for cigarettes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1229" /> I mention these matters in the House in order to bring to the public a realisation of the new high low we have reached in public life, when men of alleged responsibility make specific promises and, when we remind them of them, merely sneer at us and say that we are play-acting.</P>
    <P>We said in 1952 that the taxes were necessary.  The Government who were then the Opposition complained that they were unnecessary, unjust and cruel taxes.  Yesterday, Deputy Dunne, in the course of a long statement, decried the Budget of 1952 but conveniently forgot that he trooped into the Lobby in support of every tax that we levied on the people that year.</P>
    <P>In their speeches on this occasion, members of the Government and their supporters were rather hesitant about the Budget.  They were apologising for it.  Some of them, when they heard the Budget statement, left the House and trooped out, or drooped out, I should say, like men out of a shower. It damped their spirits.</P>

Was not it the job of the present Government to remit that fat and to spread it among the population? When we remind them of that we are told we are play-acting.  We would be failing in our duty to our constituents and to the public in general if we did not remind the Government of their pre-election speeches and promises.</P>
      <P>I heard an argument to-day across the House about the rates.

      <P>They talked about controlling the price of this, that and the other.  The body that was set up at the expense of the taxpayer to adjudicate on prices has let prices run riot.  We knew that would happen before the Prices Advisory Body was founded.  We told that to the Government.  They were told that by the <i>Evening Herald</i> following the speech of the Minister for Industry and Commerce in the supplies and services debate.  I need only quote a paragraph or two from it:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Permanent legislation for the control of prices was foreshadowed in Mr. Norton's speech in Dáil Eireann on Wednesday last.  The subject is one which the Government should approach with extreme caution.  Undoubtedly there are many commodities in respect of which the public feels aggrieved because of the prices charged to consumers.  But it is by no means certain that direct Government intervention is a remedy.  Very often it can result in grave injustice.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;It cannot be asserted that it is wrong for the Government to control prices.  But it can be said that such a power should be invoked only in very exceptional circumstances, as in times of national emergency or acute shortages, and even then only if the normal forces of competition and the weight of public opinion have proved <Col N="1231" /> ineffective.  The public can scarcely have much confidence in the efficacy of State control over prices when the experiences of the war years are recalled.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It goes on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;At best&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I am nearly finished.  It says&mdash;I am summarising:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;At best any attempt at State control of prices can be only a partial success.  If it were to be logical the system should not begin at the end of the chain by fixing the prices to be charged for commodities; it should start much further back by controlling...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>&mdash;all the things that went to build up the price.</P>
      <P>The Minister was advised regarding the establishment of the Prices Advisory Body.  He waved that aside as an airy fairy suggestion.  He said that it emanated only from the mind of Fianna Fáil.  Now that he has failed and that the Prices Advisory Body have failed, the least he could do for the public is to take the Prices Advisory Body off the taxpayer's back and relieve the taxpayer of the cost of that body.</P>
      <P>Deputy MacBride, whom I could describe, I suppose, as the chief apologist now that his rôle is reduced to mere nuisance value in the House, belaboured Fianna Fáil, as usual, and talked about afforestation and emigration. He talked, as usual, with his tongue in his cheek, as loud and as long as junior who lost his Sunday sixpence down the grating but he did not get much comfort out of the present Budget.  Neither did he criticise it, because he is tied to the tail of the Government like an old tin can and can be dragged anywhere the Government want to bring him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Budget, which has been described by the supporters of the Government as a good Budget, can be <Col N="1232" /> roughly summarised in this way, that the taxpayer gets no relief, the public get no relief, the farmer stands to lose a good deal, the housewife gets no relief.  The housewife finds that the money in her purse is getting shorter and shorter.  The farmer finds that the axe fell on his neck and that his income is considerably reduced in face of rising rates and of increased wage demands from agricultural workers and increased overheads.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Government need not smile.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary need not laugh.  There is a demand on the farmers for increased wages this very month.  The Parliamentary Secretary purports to be an economist.  He should go to the Library and study this matter and it will extend his education a little.  The farmer finds himself at a distinct disadvantage, despite the anxiety of the Minister for Agriculture.  He used to talk with his hand on his heart about our 12,500,000 acres of agricultural land and how the living of every man, woman and child in this State depended on it.  I often heard him in Earlsfort Terrace at the Literary and Historical Debating Society telling his hearers about what could be done and should be done for agriculture.  The first thing that the Minister for Agriculture did for agriculture was to hit the farmer on the head with a mallet and say: &ldquo;You stay in your corner; if you come out again I will give you a further cut.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The great majority of wage-earners get nothing out of the Budget.  They find themselves paying the same rate of income-tax, more for their wearing apparel, more for their footwear, the same for their cigarettes, the same for their entrance into a dance hall, despite the talk we used to hear about the dance hall proprietors and the amount of money they used to contribute to Fianna Fáil.  I wonder is the boot on the other foot now and would the present Government be buttering up the dance hall proprietors <Col N="1233" /> in the hope that they might contribute to their coffers?  If they are, I hope they will not turn Turk on them as they did with the publicans of Dublin who contributed £20,000 to their war chest and then found that they got the axe in the neck.</P>

However, he is also tied to the tail of the Government like an old tin can and he cannot afford to choose otherwise.  Beggars cannot be choosers.  I think that is a fair summary of the Budget and that it will be the summary of the people in general.  We will probably see the reaction to it in the next 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to be very brief in my contribution to this debate because what I have to say to-day or what I should say has already been said in this House since 1948, whenever I spoke on the Budget introduced. Consequently, on this occasion I propose to confine myself to a few general remarks on the Government policy in so far as we can find a Government policy in the recent Budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all understand that the Budget speech gives an indication of Government policy for the following 12 months and that in the Budget we find a guide to our economic advancement for that period.  Let us go back to last May, June and July and what do we find? We find that the Ministers of the present Government made it quite clear that they had no hand, act or part in, or responsibility for, the 1954 Budget <Col N="1234" /> and that in so far as the Estimates which came before the House were concerned they themselves could not accept any responsibility for those Estimates; in other words, the Estimates and the Budget were a Fianna Fáil production.  I do not think that can be denied by any members of the present Government.</P>
    <P>However, when the present Minister for Finance introduced his Budget recently he pointed out in his opening remarks that, despite some setbacks such as a disappointing harvest, widespread flooding, etc., in the year 1954 the economic position was satisfactory. If that is the case, then it must be as a result of the 1954 Budget and the policy which this Government took over.  It cannot be denied that it was the policy enunciated in the 1954 Budget which has guided the progress of this country for the last 12 months.</P>
    <P>Admittedly, when this Government came into office they immediately and, I think, in a mistaken and hurried fashion, decided to prove to the electorate that they were prepared to carry out some of their promises, at any rate, and with a great flourish of trumpets a reduction was made in the price of butter to the extent of 5d. per lb.  All of us will rejoice at any action that will bring foodstuffs, especially butter, bread, and so forth, more within the reach of the poorer groups. Any action in that regard should receive acclaim from the public, but I felt at that time that a reduction of 5d. per lb. in butter was not going to bring butter within the reach of the lower income groups.  It was already far beyond their reach and if the Government examined the position carefully they would find that a reduction of at least 1/- per lb. would be necessary to ensure that those of our population who were not on a high salary basis would receive the due benefit.</P>
    <P>The real test of the advantage conferred by this reduction of 5d. per lb. lies in the statistics available.  By how much did the consumption of butter increase in the last 12 months?  To what extent did the consumption of butter increase within the State?  It is there we have the real proof of how little <Col N="1235" /> benefit was conferred by this reduction of 5d. per lb.</P>
    <P>It should also be borne in mind that while we were conferring this alleged benefit on the poorer sections by reducing the price of butter we were conferring that benefit to a greater degree on the large hoteliers and the large users of butter and that it was the large hotels in this country and the incoming tourists as well who really benefited rather than the poorer sections of our own community.  The reason I am criticising this is that I believe it was bad Government policy to take that step.  I am all for a reduction in the price of foodstuffs, but I think the reduction should be passed on to the most deserving sections of the community.</P>
    <P>Last May and June are not so far back that they cannot be referred to again.  I do not think anybody here can deny that the one issue involved in the last general election was the cost of living. Deputy Dunne made reference here last night to certain people who were at one time members of this House.  Four Independent Deputies here were held up to public odium and described as being responsible, and solely responsible, for the 1952 Budget. There was a continuous harping on these four men by the members of the present Government and by their supporters in the back benches.  No opportunity was lost, here or outside, of convincing the public that were it not for the fact that these four Deputies helped to keep Fianna Fáil in office the 1952 Budget would never have been imposed on the country; and, consequently, the high prices which are now being paid by the public for various commodities would likewise never have been imposed.  These four men were held responsible for what I described as a very harsh Budget.</P>
    <P>Now, in the last general election as a result of the propaganda of the Parties composing the present Government, these four men are no longer in this House.  The electorate believed the men who are now in Government. They believed the supporters of the present Government who pointed out <Col N="1236" /> to them that these four men should not be returned and the public acted as a jury in the sincere belief that the present Government would remedy the situation created by the 1952 Budget.</P>
    <P>What happened?  Other Deputies, now mainly members of the Opposition, have dealt at great length with the trail of broken promises.  Let us get down to realities.  In 1951, Fianna Fáil returned to office.  Prior to their return they said there would be no reduction in subsidies and no penalties would be imposed on the public; everything in the garden would be lovely.  But, on their return to office, after an examination of public expenditure it was decided to take the severe step of imposing the harsh Budget of 1952 upon the community. The promises they made prior to the 1951 election were not carried out.  In 1954 Fianna Fáil went out of office and the inter-Party Government returned. They tell us now that they find things were so bad on their return that they cannot carry out the promises they made prior to the election.  Is there not a great similarity between the two groups when it comes down to not even carrying out one's promises?</P>

      <P>I am dealing with the promises made by the major groups in this House.  We have arrived at the position where both groups make their specific promises and both groups, having examined the financial situation, find they are unable to carry out their promises.  If there is not a great similarity there between the two groups, I know very little about public life.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Davin points out that this Government has only been in office for ten months: should I say this is the 11 more months and ten more days type of thing?  I do not dispute that fact at all and I am not <Col N="1237" /> one of those who expect an incoming Government to work miracles.  I will leave it at that for the moment.</P>
      <P>After the last election, having listened to speakers on behalf of the Government Parties in my own constituency, I half believed they would do some of the things they promised to do in the course of that campaign. The serious thing is that most of the public believed that they would carry out their promises and, in view of public opinion, I felt constrained to give an opportunity in so far as it lay within my power to those Parties which promised these things.  I felt it was my responsibility to help by my vote in seeing that they got that opportunity.</P>
      <P>What do we get?  After 11 months they bring in a Fianna Fáil Budget.  I have never agreed with what I can only describe as the conservative view of the Fianna Fáil Party on financial matters.  Neither can I agree that it is fair for the present inter-Party Government to pursue in great measure a similar policy.</P>
      <P>To my mind this Budget is an orthodox conservative Budget, an extremely cautious Budget lacking in inspiration, as has been every Budget introduced here over the last 20 years.  In a speech lasting approximately an hour and a quarter the Minister devoted less than one minute to dealing with our two major problems to-day-unemployment and emigration. Some two months ago there was a motion before this House in the names of Deputy Maguire and myself calling on the Government to take immediate steps to deal with the problem of unemployment and emigration.  That motion was debated here at length. The Government refused to accept it. A very flimsy excuse for its non-acceptance was put up by one prominent Government spokesman: the Government could not remedy these problems by immediate steps.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our suggestion was that immediate steps would be taken to initiate a desirable policy which would have the effect of remedying the present situation. Though that motion was not accepted I felt it would at any rate <Col N="1238" /> have some influence on the Government. What do we find after two months have elapsed?  In the course of the most important speech of the year in this House less than one minute is devoted to the two major ills which beset this country.</P>
    <P>I blame the present Government for pretending to be different from Fianna Fáil.  The difference exists only in name and there is a desperate battle at the moment to preserve political identities.  But it is becoming more difficult with each day that passes to convince the people that there is a fundamental difference in the approach of our major Parties to our problems. The only difference lies in the matter of a few pounds.</P>

      <P>The only difference we can see at the present time between the 1954 and the 1955 Budget is the miserable increase of 2/6 per week to old age pensioners and to widows and orphans.  I do not intend to elaborate but I would like to be shown, and I would like it to be proved to me that there is a difference in the approach to industrial expansion, between the approach by the inter-Party Government and the Fianna Fáil Government to capital development.  I have always held the view that the policy enunciated by Fianna Fáil from 1932 was the right one, to develop our natural resouces, but where I criticised Fianna Fáil all through the years and still criticise them is for the fact that the rate of progress, in my opinion, was painfully slow.  Here, we have the present Government falling exactly into line, accepting the same outlook with regard to capital development and with regard to industrial expansion as their predecessors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that the time is fast drawing near when every Deputy in this House must be pinned down to one side or the other, that he must show himself in his true colours as either a progressive or a conservative.  If we are going to have our political Parties in this House, we must know what exactly those Parties stand for, whether they represent the progressive outlook or whether they are conservative.  If we <Col N="1239" /> can establish that then there will be some hope for development in Irish public life.</P>
    <P>To conclude, I believe that the 1955 Budget and the year 1955 will be remembered in a significant fashion in future years as far as Irish political development is concerned.  It has marked the year in which the difference between all Parties in this House has been brought to a minimum and it is from now on that we may hope for that change which so many people desire should be brought about in Irish politics.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is any Deputy who would not like to see Deputies in this House pinned down to one side or the other, I think that it is Deputy McQuillan, because if ever a person acted like Mother Machree's dog and went a little bit of the road with everyone, it is Deputy McQuillan. I think he will probably continue in that career in this Dáil as he did in the last Dáil.</P>
      <P>I want to say in relation to some of the other speeches made here to-day that there is something amusing about the air of injured innocence which we find on the benches opposite.  We find Fianna Fáil Deputies coming here posing as the poor innocent victims of hostile propaganda during the election; adopting the attitude that they were people with white hands and that gangs of liars and gangsters were put up against them in the election and that they beat down the honest Fianna Fáil patriots.</P>
      <P>I want to remind some of the Fianna Fáil Deputies of the particular type of electioneering which took place in the 1951 General Election and which was also carried on by Fianna Fáil Deputies in the 1954 General Election. I want to remind them that their deputy leader issued an appeal for funds to certain people in this city seeking funds for the purpose of bringing to bear on the election &ldquo;modern electioneering methods&rdquo;.  I would like if any of the Deputies opposite would tell me if some of the things I propose to recount now were the &ldquo;modern electioneering methods&rdquo; to which Deputy Lemass referred when he appealed for funds and supporters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1240" /> Remember in 1951 these poor innocents had spent three years carping against the inter-Party Government and they had spent the last six months before the general election, when due to the Korean war situation prices had begun to rise slightly, tub-thumping and condemning the inter-Party Government because the cost of living had gone up.  I am not going to attempt to argue what the implications of the speeches made by Deputies opposite were, but I am going to say that not only by implication but by specific, categorical, unequivocal assurances did Fianna Fáil tell the people what they proposed doing, on the one hand, and what they would refrain from doing on the other hand.</P>
    <P>The House may remember during that election campaign of 1951 Fianna Fáil underscored all the propaganda by posters which were placarded all around Dublin City and throughout the country with just four words on them: &ldquo;you can trust Dev&rdquo;.  Let us see what you could trust Dev to do or not to do. You could trust Dev, according to Deputy Lemass, Deputy MacEntee and according to some others, not to reimpose taxes on beer and tobacco which had been imposed in 1947 and which had been removed by the inter-Party Government.  You could trust Fianna Fáil not to interfere with food subsidies.  You could trust Dev.  There was no doubt about it as far as Fianna Fáil was concerned; they were making specific proposals and you could trust them.  Let me say this: Deputy Lemass in his constituency, apparently, did not like this adulation of one man. He took out the &ldquo;you can trust Dev&rdquo;, and in his constituency he made it, &ldquo;you can trust Fianna Fáil&rdquo;.  Apparently, he felt that he was rather near the throne and that the thing to do was to get the people's minds off the one-man Party idea because he was heir-at-law and, therefore, for his constituency, it was: &ldquo;you can trust Fianna Fáil&rdquo;.  Probably Deputy Aiken, as heir-apparent, made it: &ldquo;you can trust Fianna Fáil&rdquo; in County Louth also.</P>
    <P>What could you trust Fianna Fáil to do?  Deputy Lemass assured the electorate in 1951 again that Fianna <Col N="1241" /> Fáil could be trusted; that you knew where you stood with Fianna Fáil.  Just before that election he spoke in these terms according to the <i>Sunday Press</i> of the 13th May, 1951:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A Coalition Minister has said that Fianna Fáil, if elected, would increase the taxes on beer and tobacco.  Why should such taxes be necessary?  There is no reason why we should impose these taxes.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There was no implication there and there was no doubt about it.  Deputy Lemass told the electorate that if he got back to Government he would not reimpose those taxes and &ldquo;you could trust Dev&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEntee was even more specific about it.  This has been quoted here before.  I will quote it again very briefly.  According to the <i>Irish Times</i> of the 15th May, 1951, speaking in Rathmines Town Hall, Deputy MacEntee</P>
    <P>&ldquo;referred to rumours being spread by a number of persons in the licensed trade who were saying that if Fianna Fáil were returned to Government taxes imposed on drink in the Supplementary Budget of 1947 would be reimposed.  There was no truth whatever in that.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Quite definite, quite specific.  He pinpointed the issue.  He said that persons were saying that if he got back, those taxes would be reimposed.  He was standing up in Rathmines Town Hall to give the lie to that.  There was no truth in it.  We could trust Dev. To emphasise it even more, on the same occasion, he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The people were being asked to decide whether politics in Ireland were to be a dirty game played by confidence tricksters who were prepared to promise anything to dupe the people into voting for them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Could anyone doubt the programme that was being put before them?  They had Deputy MacEntee's assurances; they had Deputy Derrig's assurances; they had Deputy Lemass's assurances that &ldquo;you could trust Dev.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>All these assurances were given that there would be no reimposition of these taxes.  Lest anyone should think that this was just an irresponsible speech by Deputy MacEntee, or that Deputy Lemass's effort was just a speech which he did not think would be reported, I should like to point out that they went a lot further than that.  They all got together when the election was over &mdash;I should be very surprised if Deputy Derrig were not in on it&mdash;and they issued solemnly to every newspaper in this country a 17-point programme, carefully planned out.  In that 17-point programme they gave very definite and very specific assurances.  I say that Deputy Derrig was probably allowed in the door when the 17-point programme was being drafted.  I say to Deputy Derrig that in point 15 of that programme he assured the people that if he got back as a member of the Government he would maintain subsidies to control the price of essential foodstuffs.</P>
      <P>Let us just deal for a moment with these specific assurances given by the injured innocents opposite, the victims of hostile propaganda.  They would not, according to Deputy MacEntee, put back the tax on beer and tobacco which had been imposed in 1947 and which was taken off by the inter-Party Government.  They would not, according to Deputy MacEntee, reimpose this taxation.  They would not, according to Deputy Derrig and the rest of them, interfere with food subsidies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I think, with all respect, that Deputy MacEntee might feel offended if I attempted to paraphrase it.  The excuse tendered by the Deputy was that when he spoke it was not his intention to reimpose those duties; that, quite naturally, as rational men, the Fianna Fáil Party could not have that intention until they saw what the problem was and that, because he happened to say a certain thing in May, 1951, it did not follow that, in different circumstances and if the national interest required it, he should not depart from it&mdash;it did not follow that he would be bound by that promise in perpetuity.  &ldquo;In any event,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;what does anything I said in 1951 matter in relation to the problems which now confront the State, the Government and the people?&rdquo;  I want to put this to the injured innocents.  In effect, Deputy MacEntee's reasoning was: &ldquo;I can get up on the platform and give a definite and specific promise and assurance to the people that we have no intention of reimposing certain taxes.  If I reimpose the taxes at a later stage, how am I to be blamed?  Was I not honest in saying it was not the intention to do it?&rdquo;  I do not think that kind of excuse is good enough.  I am not talking about implications that can be taken from speeches by Fianna Fáil leaders or&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That was the Fianna Fáil campaign in 1951.  In 1954, those injured innocents&mdash;having gone back on what they had stipulated in 1951&mdash;had to think of something else with which to face the people.  We hear talk about election speeches made by present Ministers and by supporters of the present Government.  We are told about election pamphlets that were issued.  Was any more damnable pamphlet issued in the general election campaign than this one which was produced by Deputy MacEntee and his colleague in Dublin South-East, suggesting that if there was any change of Government&mdash;if Labour, Fine Gael or any group except Fianna Fáil had anything to do with the Government of this country&mdash;every Irish industry would be closed down, men would be thrown out of employment, wages would be cut, and so forth?

That is one of the pamphlets produced by the injured innocents.  Here is another pamphlet which portrays Deputy MacBride, the present Minister for Industry and Commerce and the present Taoiseach as a group of bank robbers endeavouring to raid the tills. <Col N="1246" /> Here is yet another pamphlet.  Is it necessary to add that this pamphlet also was produced by Deputy MacEntee and his colleague?  The heading of this pamphlet is: &ldquo;It is your money they are after.&rdquo;  That was the type of modern electioneering method used by the Simon Pures opposite me.

We felt we were committed and we did honour it.  I want to put this on record for the benefit of the House because I think it is time that Deputies opposite stopped this play-acting that has been going on.</P>

      <P>I think it is time the Deputies opposite stopped their play-acting about what were promises and what were commitments. The present Taoiseach made his position and the position of those supporting him quite clear to the electorate and I feel there is no need for anyone to apologise for the manner in which the issue was placed before the electorate by the present Taoiseach during the last general election.  I am not shirking for a moment the responsibility of saying that this Government and every Deputy behind this Government aims at reducing the cost of living, either by bringing down prices or by bringing up people's incomes to narrow the gap between prices and incomes.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach, during the last general election, made his attitude in the matter quite clear.  Even Deputy O'Malley would probably remember that the <i>Irish Times</i> issued a questionnaire to Deputy de Valera and to Deputy Costello and one of the questions put to those two Deputies was: &ldquo;If returned to Government do you propose in the coming year to reduce the cost of living by increasing food subsidies?&rdquo;  Deputy Costello's reply was:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1248" />&ldquo;An object of our policy is to reduce the cost of living and to relieve the burden of present prices by using all practical means of increasing the real value of people's money.  The extent to which, and the rate at which, revisions in subsidies combined with readjustments in taxation are possible cannot be determined in advance by an Opposition. Responsible decisions on these two matters require:&mdash;(1) access to all relevant facts concerning the condition of the Exchequer, (2) the ascertainment of the effect on the Exchequer of a fundamental reform of the financial policy.  I do not, therefore, propose to repeat the action of our opponents in 1951, when they made specific promises which they subsequently broke.  They failed to keep their specific promises to maintain subsidies and not restore certain taxes.  I am prepared to make only one promise&mdash;to provide good Government to the best of my ability.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I am reading from the Official Report, for the 23rd June, 1954, column 505, Volume 146. It was a quotation from an interview published in the <i>Irish Times</i> but I have not got the date of the issue of the <i>Irish Times</i> in which it appeared.  As I say, the position was made quite clear and the Deputies opposite need not think they are gaining any sympathy by the attitude they have adopted during this debate and during previous debates.  A number of Deputies have compared this Budget with the Fianna Fáil Budget of 1952. Deputy MacEntee stated that it was an as-you-were Budget.  The Fianna Fáil newspapers also made use of that phrase to describe the Budget.  I want to say straight away that I do not believe this is an as-you-were Budget. I do not believe it is the Fianna Fáil Budget of 1952.  In considering this Budget you have to consider not only the framework in which the Budget is brought in, but also the background of the last 12 months and what are the Government's hopes for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1249" /> The first claim I want to make, having regard to the work of the Government during the past 12 months, is that this is an Irish Budget, a Budget brought in to meet the needs of the Irish people as the Government see them and as the country can afford them.  It is not a Budget brought in to meet the wishes of Mr. R.A. Butler, the British Chancellor of the Exchequer.  That is the first distinction I want to draw between this Budget and the Fianna Fáil Budget of 1952.  I think Deputy MacEntee and Deputy Lemass&mdash;I am not quite certain about Deputy Lemass&mdash;met the British Chancellor of the Exchequer. They resent any suggestion that they were summoned over to meet him so I shall not make it.  We all recall how they met Mr. Butler and we can all recall how the Fianna Fáil Government then and the Tory Government in England stepped along cheek by jowl.  The Tory Government brought in their Budget for the first time in history about two months earlier than the traditional time.  When Deputy MacEntee came back here to Dublin he did the same thing.  We all remember the slashing of the food subsidies in Britain in 1952.  We remember how Deputy MacEntee did the same thing here.</P>

      <P>Probably Deputy Derrig remembers this.  At any rate, we remember how, when Mr. R. A. Butler went into the British House of Commons to present his Budget to the people there, he went waving a message from Deputy Seán MacEntee in his hand to say: &ldquo;Ata Boy, we are behind you&rdquo; and in the <i>Irish Press</i> of the 12th March, 1952, this appears in relation to Mr. Butler's speech:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. Butler said he had received a message from the Irish Minister for Finance expressing his Government's understanding of the gravity of the situation and their determination to play their part in the solving of it.  He understood the Irish Minister <Col N="1250" /> for Finance would make a statement to-day.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Before we become engaged in a discussion on devaluation, let me just, for what it is worth, draw for Deputy Derrig a picture of two Fianna Fáil Ministers, one the Deputy MacEntee of 1932 who made a speech on the link with sterling. This speech made in 1932 is quoted in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> of the 23rd February, 1947, as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I think it was the President (Mr. Cosgrave) said that we were anchored to the £ sterling and now the £ is a millstone around the necks of the people and is dragging them down to the bottom of the sea.  The financial and economic position of the country would be much better if we had an independent currency instead of being tied to the sinking £.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That was Deputy Seán MacEntee in 1932.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>They got together in Downing Street in 1952.  We know the result of that. I claim that the first essential difference between Mr. Sweetman's Budget of to-day and Deputy MacEntee's Budget of 1952 is that this is an Irish, Budget and it is not designed to suit the wishes of Mr. R. <Col N="1251" /> A. Butler, the British Chancellor of the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>There are, of course, other differences. I do not know if the House has ever obtained from Deputy MacEntee or from Deputy Lemass any light as to what happened during their discussion with Mr. Butler.  I would like to have some information on that subject even now.  In any event, that is what happened in 1952.  In 1955, I think I am correct in saying for the first time in history, an Irish Minister for Finance was able so to arrange matters that the Irish bank rate did not follow the British bank rate.  That is another factor which must be taken into account when considering the framework and the background of the present Budget.</P>

      <P>I think Deputy Childers had the right idea arising out of the 1952 Budget.  I mention this merely to show again one of the differences between the 1952 Budget and the 1955 Budget, between the position in 1952 and the position in 1955.  After Deputy Derrig, Deputy Burke and Deputy Beegan had passed the 1952 Budget through this House, Deputy Erskine Childers went down to Rath-downey, County Laois, to speak and is reported in the <i>Irish Times</i> of the 21st April, 1952.  He must have been a very shook man when he went to Rath-downey because he said that what the country needed was a feeling of confidence in the business of government so that those with savings would lend to an administration in which no crackpot financiers were permitted to delude the people by burning candles at both ends and pointing out what a grand light they would make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Childers felt, after the 1952 <Col N="1252" /> Budget, that the people needed to have confidence in their Government.  I am quite sure Deputy Derrig felt that the people had no confidence in the Government and that the Government had very little confidence in the people because they held on for another two years.</P>
    <P>What is the position this year? Deputy MacEntee, during that period, in order to raise his loan had to offer the people an inducement of a 5 per cent. interest rate.  In the first loan floated by the present Minister for Finance, the people had such confidence in the present Government that there was no difficulty in persuading them to lend their money to the present Government at a very considerably lower rate of interest than that which Deputy MacEntee required.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>That is another difference between the 1952 and the 1955 situations.</P>
      <P>Let us consider also that in bringing in this Budget the Government, in implementing their aim to get down the cost of living, before they were many months in office had reduced the price of butter by 5d. per lb. and had accepted responsibility for the subsidy which that entailed, costing something in the region of £2,000,000.  It is quite true that if that commitment was not honoured and if the commitment to the civil servants was not honoured, the Government would have £3,000,000 or so to spare.  We felt that £2,000,000 was well spent in reducing what is perhaps the most essential food for the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know what Fianna Fáil's view on that is to-day, but this much is certain that if Fianna Fáil had been returned to office in the last general election the price of butter would not have come down.  Not one of them will deny that.  It was not their policy to <Col N="1253" /> get down the price of butter, by subsidisation in any event.  The Government honoured the arbitration award and the Government held down the cost of tea.</P>
    <P>I know Fianna Fáil Deputies are under orders to sneer at what the Government have done in respect of tea.  I once more would like to ask them to answer honestly before this debate is over what would they have done.  Is not it true that if Fianna Fáil had been re-elected after the last general election they would have allowed the price of tea to go up and to continue going up without any effort to control it?</P>
    <P>The Government during the course of the year dealt promptly with the question of the floods which occurred. I have already referred to the bank rate and to the loan.  The Government have made it clear what they propose doing during the coming 12 months. They are continuing the butter subsidy. They have made provision for substantial increases to the old age pensioners and others.  They have given important income-tax concessions. They have provided for additional health services and, of course, they are continuing the reliefs which were incorporated in the Budget of 1954 and of which Fianna Fáil are so proud.</P>
    <P>Some Fianna Fáil speakers, including their last spokesman, Deputy Carter, have been gibing at the increase given to old age pensioners. Deputy Carter spoke about it as &ldquo;this mangy 2/6 per week&rdquo;.  I want to remind Deputies that when Fianna Fáil increased the old age pension by 1/6, in 1952, they did it as nearly as they could on a callous mathematical basis.  They worked out that the effect of the removal of food subsidies was going to cost something in the region of 1/6 per head and therefore the very maximum to which the old age pensioner would be entitled was 1/6.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke looks as if he does not believe me.  It is hard to believe, but that was the Fianna Fáil attitude in 1952.  There was no question of easing the situation for old age pensioners and others.  It was a question of giving <Col N="1254" /> them what the Government had decided was the bare minimum of what they were entitled to.  In fact, it did not measure up to the damage that was done in the Budget at all.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEntee, in his 1952 Budget speech, at column 1139, Volume 130 of the Official Debates of the 7th April, 1952, had this to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;On existing rations and at present prices, food subsidies reduce weekly expenditure per person on rationed foods by approximately 2/-. This 2/- per week has, of course, to be met by general taxation, that is to say, it has first to be collected from the general body of taxpayers before, by devious channels, it finds its way back to them: surely a wasteful and nonsensical procedure. The rise in retail prices consequent on the changes I have mentioned will not, however, amount to 2/-; in fact, on the average, it should work out at some 25 per cent. less, or almost 1/6 per head per week.  This, then, is the outside limit of the burden that will be imposed on any individual, and, therefore, of the compensation that need be given in necessitous cases.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then he goes on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;On this basis&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&mdash;on the basis that that was the outside limit and that it was compensation for the damage the Government were doing&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;&ldquo;the Government have decided to increase the old age pension by 1/6 a week...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was the Fianna Fáil attitude to the old age pensioners in 1952 and now they have the nerve to stand up here and talk about an increase of 2/6 given in this Budget as being a mangy increase. I suggest to Fianna Fáil Deputies that this Budget is a good Budget.  It is a Budget with which the people are satisfied.  Deputy Carter spent his concluding moments in reading out a list he had compiled of people who got no relief under the Budget.  The real people who got no relief from this Budget are the Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party because they cannot think of any <Col N="1255" /> argument to make against it.  They have not yet told the House whether they propose voting against the Budget or not.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Party organ anticipated what the people of the country wanted before the Budget was introduced and the <i>Evening Press,</i> having made a survey of what the people wanted, of what would be considered a good Budget, interviewed a person from Deputy MacEntee's constituency, who was described as &ldquo;Mr. Average Married Man&rdquo;.  He said he would like to see the £85 income-tax allowance for each child increased to £100.  In regard to the old age pensioners he said: &ldquo;These old people deserve more money.&rdquo;  He would consider that a good Budget.  The Fianna Fáil Party organ, having made their survey, gave that last opinion as what the average married man would consider a good Budget, and that was before the terms of the Budget were announced.</P>
    <P>The day after the Budget was announced the <i>Evening Press</i> made another survey.  They did not go back to &ldquo;Mr. Average Married Man&rdquo;, needless to say.  They knew his views and they were not going to go near him again.  They went around Dublin and they got some other views on the Budget.  They gave only three, so we can imagine that the views they were getting did not suit.  They gave this view, in any event:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am glad to see the old age pensioners, the blind and widows getting the money&mdash;I would like to see them getting a good deal more.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I think the Government did very well considering how little money they had at their disposal.  The increase of £85 to £100 in the income-tax allowance for each child is also good for people with large families &mdash;but it does not benefit me, as I am not paying income-tax.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>That was the result of a second survey carried out by the Fianna Fáil Party organ after the terms of the Budget were announced.  Is it any use for Fianna Fáil Deputies to keep arguing?  No one expects them to stand up and say this is an excellent Budget.  If Deputy O'Malley, Deputy Burke or any other Fianna Fáil Deputy says this is an excellent Budget he will be feeling the back of his neck for a week and wondering what hit him.  The fact is they know the people of the country are satisfied with this Budget and if they had any sincerity they would join with me in heartily congratulating the Minister for Finance and the Government on the Budget they have introduced.</P>

      <P>I am afraid I cannot join with Deputy O'Higgins in congratulating the Minister for Finance on this Budget.  One of the speakers on the Government side, my colleague from East Limerick, Deputy Carew, has suggested that 1955 will be a memorable year as regards the turning of the tide in regard to taxation.  Be that as it may, 1955 will be remembered particularly by the electorate of the country for two things.  In the first place, it is the second time they have been duped into electing a Coalition Government.  In the second place, there is the point that once they are given an opportunity, they are clearly resolved that for all time this system of Government will be done away with in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was admitted by all sides that the cost of living was the main issue in the last election and no one has denied that.  While quotations have been given here&mdash;mostly on this side of the House because it does not suit the Government supporters to give quotations at the present time&mdash;there is no shadow of doubt that the reason that we are sitting here in opposition and that the Government are over on that side of the House is due to the fact that there was a certain element, particularly in Dublin, who were convinced that with a change of Government and with the Coalition assuming office, immediately the cost of living <Col N="1257" /> would undoubtedly fall and the price of food would also be reduced.  That cannot be denied.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste asked Deputy Lemass did he want an election.  I am not in the position of either the Tánaiste or Deputy Lemass but I think it would be very interesting if an election were fought to-day.  The figures were more or less equal before the last election. If an election were fought in Dublin I have no hesitation in saying that Fianna Fáil would be returned with an overwhelming majority.  But we do not hear much talk nowadays about elections or by-elections.  We do not see the Lord Mayor of Dublin, Deputy A. Byrne, careering around with a loaf on top of a walking stick.  There is very little talk about elections.</P>
    <P>This time 12 months Deputy A. Byrne, as reported in the <i>Irish Press</i> of 21st May, 1954, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am going to support the inter-Party Government.  But I say to them that they must do something for the housewife and for the unemployed. Patchwork relief schemes are not remedying unemployment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If the housewives of this country get their hands on the Coalition in the next couple of months, when their rage is at its peak, the Coalition will not know what hit them.</P>

I notice that there was very little mention of expenditure and the cutting of the alleged wasteful expenditure of Fianna Fáil when Government Deputies intervened in this debate.

      <P>I am not Jimmy Henry.  The increase in pay to the teachers, the Gardaí, the Army and the civil servants came to £3,500,000. These increases arose out of the findings of an arbitration appointed by the Coalition.  The arbitrator was appointed in April, 1950, and he reported in May, 1951.  It was understood that the findings would apply as far as practicable to every class of public servant.  To meet the award in 1951 would cost about £3,600,000.  The Coalition knew these increases were coming, but they provided no money to meet them.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Social Welfare misunderstands me.  I am not talking about the retrospective payment.  I am talking of the failure <Col N="1260" /> of the Coalition to make provision for these actual increases totalling £3,500,000.  It was they who were mainly responsible for the deficit in the Budget of 1951.  Secondly, there was an interest payment of £477,000 in respect of C.I.E.  There was an operating loss of £823,000.  The total there was £1,300,000.  C.I.E. was bought out by the Transport Act passed in 1951 by the Coalition.  They knew the undertaking was bankrupt at that time because of their hostile policy adopted in 1948 and 1949.  They knew it was bound to lose money heavily in 1951 and they made no provision whatever to cover those losses, losses which, in fact, amounted to £2,250,000 in 1951-1952.  Thirdly, there was a small item of £3,000,000 in relation to increases in the cost of social welfare services, including increases in old age pensions and in benefits under the new Social Welfare Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Coalition introduced a Social Welfare Bill in 1951 and, under pressure, they agreed to grant an increase in old age pensions on the Committee Stage.  Instead of fulfilling this commitment, which would have cost over £1,000,000, they provided no money whatever for it in their Budget. They decided instead to abandon the Bill altogether.  They dissolved the Dáil and then Fianna Fáil had to come along and provide the full amount, which totalled £3,000,000.</P>
      <P>Fourthly, there was an increase in grants to health authorities.  All this bears on the reason why Fianna Fáil could not implement its 17 point programme. They made certain specific statements and certain specific promises before they returned to office after the first Coalition.  I am showing now why they were not able to honour those specific promises because of the commitments and the unhonoured obligations left behind by the Coalition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The increase in grants to health authorities came to <Col N="1261" /> £1,190,000.  At the instance of the Coalition, local health authorities granted substantial increases in pay to their employees while the general election of that year was on.  The whole cost of those increases had to be met out of State funds.  The Coalition made no provision whatever for this and the supplementary sum of £835,000 had to be provided and the actual amount then, in 1952, was £1,160,000. Other items in that service brought the total increase to £1,190,000.  Then the fifth item which the Coalition did not make provision for&mdash;the increase in interest and sinking funds for public debt, including interest on the Marshall Aid Loan, approximately £1,100,000 per year in 1952, and a half year's interest to be paid that year.  That came to £2,080,000.  Totalling all those five items up they come to a grand total of £11,070,000&mdash;all this huge amount of money, unprovided for by the Coalition, which Fianna Fáil had to make provision for.</P>
      <P>The total amount borrowed from the United States under the Marshall Plan was 128,000,000 dollars, and Deputy O'Higgins made reference to that.  No one on any side of the House as far as I can read back opposed that.  Where we differed with the Coalition was on the method of spending.  Most of it was spent on wheat and coarse grain, tobacco and petrol, paper and motor cars.  Although the loan was supposed to be raised for capital development purposes, only a small fragment of it was spent on machinery.  The serious part of all this is that this loan which has now to be repaid must be repaid in dollars and the interest on it must be repaid in dollars also.</P>

      <P>When the Coalition was formed in June&mdash;to get back to more relevant matters&mdash;they had ample opportunity of taking off immediately the tax on beer, stout and cigarettes.  It has been said by very many speakers on the other side of the House: &ldquo;What can we expect after only about ten months in office?&rdquo;  As a matter of fact the Minister for Finance qualified this further when&mdash;I had better give the quotation&mdash;speaking on the 15th June as reported at Volume 146, column 95, he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We inherited a situation which it was too late to change.  Two months of the financial year had gone and obviously the year would be far advanced before the Ministers had an opportunity of making a thorough study of the problems facing them in their respective spheres of administration.  By then it would be too late for different financial proposals to have a real operative effect in this financial year....&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1263" /> Yet, when they reassumed office in 1948, on the 18th February of that year, they found no difficulty at all in reducing the taxes on beer, whiskey and cigarettes.  However, ten months have elapsed now and in this Budget there is no indication whether these taxes will be remitted even in the lifetime of the Government.</P>
    <P>I thought there was one very pertinent remark made by the Tánaiste, Deputy Norton, when the Minister for Finance read his Budget speech. Deputy MacEntee replied briefly and then the Tánaiste intervened and said: &ldquo;You had that speech prepared.&rdquo;  I think that is most revealing, because how could Deputy MacEntee know what was contained in the Budget? Deputy MacEntee was writing on several sheets of foolscap long before Question Time was over or before the Minister rose and commenced to read his Budget statement.  The remark is a most interesting one which should be looked into very carefully.  Does it show that Deputy MacEntee was convinced that the Minister for Finance had at last been converted to the view that the economy and well-being of the country as a whole was far more important than the pressure and vote-catching tactics of certain other individuals, and possibly Parties, who may have tried to get at him on that occasion?  However, as I say, I refer to it only as a matter for the consideration of the House and because it is most interesting, in my opinion.</P>

      <P>The interjection of the Tánaiste.  I come now to the Budget itself.  At the outset, the Minister made the most interesting statement that receipts from abroad virtually balanced external payments.  It is a pity the Coalition did not worry about the deficit in the balance of payments when they left office in 1951.  It bears back again to one of the reasons why it became necessary for us to reimpose the so-called savage taxes.  In 1951, when the Coalition Government left office, the balance of payments showed a deficit of £7,500,000.  The deficit <Col N="1264" /> under what you might term a 1954 Fianna Fáil Budget was brought down to negotiable proportions&mdash;£5,500,000. As the Minister said, the receipts from abroad virtually balanced these external payments.  He continued by expressing the hope that our exporters, with the assistance of Córas Tráchtála, would increase their business.  Yet no concession has been given.</P>
      <P>In my view, that is one of the most unfortunate features of this Budget.  I am not dealing now with the increase for the old age pensioners, the blind and the widows and orphans.  I welcome these increases, such as they are. I am dealing now with a certain matter of Government policy which affects everybody in this House.  It is all right for a Minister to speak at a public dinner or to open a factory and to express the sentiment that it is only by increased productivity that we can improve the standard of living in our country.  There is no incentive whatsoever to industrialists in this Budget such as some tax concession. I am not speaking specifically now about the wear and tear allowance.  I have in mind some tax concession for those who might be engaged in industry in the export line.  I do not see any concession given&mdash;and the facilities of Córas Tráchtála are there and the co-operation of Córas Tráchtála is there.</P>
      <P>Where is there any remission in tax by the Government to exporters?  I say that such a remission could be given.  The Minister may say it would be a complicated issue to differentiate between the proportion manufactured by the concerns for home consumption and the proportion manufactured by the same concerns for export.  There is the hope that this body which is examining industrial profits, and so forth&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>All Governments are agreed that in this country it is necessary to bring down as much as possible the cost of commodities for export in order that we may become competitive in the export market.  I am suggesting that, in order to encourage <Col N="1265" /> exports, the Minister should give such a concern a reduction in taxation, or some such thing.</P>

      <P>No.  I have in mind a tax concession such as an income-tax concession for people manufacturing goods for export.  I have in mind something that will encourage export. I am not suggesting a dual price.</P>
      <P>A short time ago the Minister for Industry and Commerce made the very important statement that foreign capital would be welcome here.  As far as I know, that statement could have very far-reaching results because he did not qualify it at any time and explain what exactly he meant.  There are people in the country&mdash;chiefly industrialists&mdash;who looked with interest to the Minister's speech to see if, in fact, any reference was made to this matter &mdash;to see whether the Minister had in mind a change in the Control of Manufactures Act.  It is all very well to stand up at public functions and in this House and preach the old gospel of increased productivity, without planning accordingly.  There are too many of those clichés to the effect that &ldquo;steps are being taken&rdquo;, &ldquo;my Department is making an examination of the whole position&rdquo;, &ldquo;we hope in the near future&rdquo;, and that &ldquo;such and such a body are reporting to us and we expect to have their report in due course, when it will receive active consideration&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;We shall have to export more if we are to keep a reasonable balance in our external payments.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As reported at column 1215 of Volume 138 of the Official Dáil Report, the present Attorney-General&mdash;Deputy McGilligan, as he was then&mdash;speaking on the 1953 Fianna Fáil Budget, asked: &ldquo;How are we to achieve stability if <Col N="1266" /> no relief is afforded?&rdquo;  Is the Attorney-General suggesting that some relief has been afforded to the industrialists on this occasion?  Those were his words after the 1953 Budget.  After Deputy MacEntee had expressed himself on the desirability of increased productivity, Deputy McGilligan asked: &ldquo;How are we to achieve stability if no relief is afforded?&rdquo;  I now ask: how are we to achieve increased productivity if no incentives or reliefs are being given to those people?</P>
    <P>I should like to quote a statement made after the 1953 Budget by the present Minister for Industry and Commerce, then Deputy Norton, as reported at column 1221 of the Official Report, Volume 138.  Here is what he had to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Does the Minister live in the clouds?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&mdash;he was referring to Deputy MacEntee&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Does the Minister live in the clouds?  Is the Minister a citizen of cuckoo land, or is the Minister's passion for the main road such that he does not know what is happening in the small towns, villages, and rural areas throughout the country?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The same thing could be said to-day, but the Tánaiste has not yet seen the wisdom of making a statement.  Then, further on, the Tánaiste continued, at column 1226 of the Official Report:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is a weary, dreary, uninspiring Budget.  It is a Budget which takes no cognisance of the existing needs of the nation, of the need for a bold, forward, courageous policy of economic development and of wise spending in all fields of national endeavour.&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1267" /> Later on the Tánaiste said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If the Taoiseach would only take that course, I venture to say that in about three weeks' time he would be a wiser and a more realistic man, as he would then know the feelings of the country; he would clearly and unmistakably, by the vote given in the election, know that this is not the Budget that this nation wants, that they want a Budget which will hold out, as this does not, some relief for the 100,000 unemployed, some relief from the present level of high prices and some stopping of the haemorrhage on our manhood and womanhood by the exodus of our people to Britain.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Ní mar síltear bitear. The Minister then went on to say, at column 682:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;There was some falling off in local authority housing, but this was largely counterbalanced by a rise in private building.  The indications are that physical capital formation was about the same as in 1953.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I be permitted to quote from the <i>Limerick Chronicle</i> of the 15th March of this year?  We shall see from it if there was any falling off in local authority building which was counterbalanced by private building.  Here is <Col N="1269" /> the extract from the <i>Limerick Chronicle</i>, which is a paper not altogether in love with Fianna Fáil at times.  It says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Because of the falling off of various building schemes in Limerick there has been an alarming exodus of skilled tradesmen from Limerick. During the first week of this month 11 carpenters left the city bringing the total since December last to 51. Time and again we have had warning of a slump in the numbers employed in the building trades, and so serious has the situation become now that a special committee has been set up by the Mayor with representatives of the various trade union branches involved, to try and seek a solution.  Many of those unemployed have left for England, where they are assured of continuous employment but they are a loss to the city and the country and, undoubtedly, would not contemplate leaving if they had any assurance of consistent employment here.  Then it naturally follows that if there is no work for skilled tradesmen the unskilled labourer is equally affected.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I shall come to that in a few moments.  Before the Minister makes his departure in the manner of the skilled workers of Limerick I should like to make one point in connection with income-tax.  I should like to give particular consideration to this point.  The allowance for children has been increased from £85 to £100 for each child.  Under Section 21 of the Finance Act of 1920&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>1920?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Finance Act of 1920, sub-section (21), paragraph 3, there was no deduction of allowances granted in respect of any child who was entitled in his own right to an income exceeding £40.  The income-tax allowance for a child has been increased from £36 to £100 but no increase has been made in the <Col N="1270" /> income which a child can have in his own right without affecting the reliefs granted to the parents.  I should like to give a specific case.  Various Ministers for Finance have advocated investments in National Loans and some parents have put hundreds of pounds into these loans on behalf of their children.  I know of a specific case where a child had £20 a year coming in and the father invested in the National Loan on its behalf a sum which brought the income over £40. As a result, he cannot claim the allowance for the child.  Something should be done about that.  He has carried out the wishes of the Minister for Finance and the various Ministers before him, but he is losing money on the transaction.</P>
      <P>I will give another specific case.  A widower has one child with an income in his own right of £49 per annum.  As the income is in excess of £40 the father cannot get the child allowance against his income-tax.  Assuming he is paying at the rate of 7/6, such allowance would reduce his income-tax payable for 1955-56 by £37 10s.  If the child had not an income in excess of £40 the parent would be entitled to a housekeeper's allowance, which is £100, and that would reduce his income-tax liability by a further £37 10s.</P>
      <P>I am informed that Section 19 of the 1920 Finance Act states as regards a housekeeper allowance that &ldquo;child&rdquo; means &ldquo;a child in respect of whom a deduction is allowed under this part of the Act.&rdquo;  The taxpayer in question is affected both ways.  Because the income of the child is over £40 he loses the child allowance and, according to the Act, he will also lose the housekeeper's allowance.  I would ask the Minister to consider that point.</P>
      <P>There was a concession given in the Budget.  Any concessions are welcome. The hope was expressed by the Minister that the dairying counties would welcome the decrease in the tax on tractors from £31 10s. to £8.  I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach, Deputy O'Sullivan, can tell the Minister that, while it might be an inducement, not one out of 400 going to a creamery uses a tractor.</P>

      <P>I am speaking for East Limerick.  Deputy Carew can say the same.  Possibly the idea of the Minister was to encourage mechanisation. On the other hand, are we exporting horses and buying imported oil and is this in fact such an attraction? I understand that the Minister specifically stated that this applied to tractors used for the carriage of milk solely.  I was approached by farmers as, I am sure, all Deputies are approached by farmers from time to time, who asked me could they bring home anything from the creamery or the local store or take anything to the creamery or into the village or town other than milk or would one of these vigilant young Gardaí have them up under the appropriate section of the Road Traffic Act?</P>

      <P>I do not know what the implications would be or what the financial cost would be, but every Party is agreed that agriculture is the backbone of the economy and it would be a great incentive and inducement to further mechanisation of agriculture if it were possible to do away with the road tax or to reduce the road tax for tractors everywhere.  It would be a good thing to consider the point.  The cost involved might be a fantastic figure.  I have no idea.  The position is not satisfactory.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister dealt in his Budget statement with overestimation. As I have remarked, his speech was simple; it was easy to read but often when these things are very easy to read one could gloss over certain facts.  At column 700 of the Financial Statement the Minister said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In 1953-54 overestimation was £3.6 million and last year... £3.5 million.  In the light of the close scrutiny I have mentioned, I do not think I can safely put it higher than £3,000,000 this year.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister had previously stated:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The tendency, when framing Estimates of this kind, is to set the target of achievement as high as possible. Such optimism is, perhaps, natural but it needs to be moderated by realism if Estimates are not to promise achievements beyond what experience shows to be practicable. In making forecasts for the current year I have acted on this principle and, I hope, brought the Estimates into closer accord with the probable outcome.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, the Minister was talking of two different sorts of Estimates.  You know that?  One was in relation to the capital Budget, the other was in relation to the current Budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that all these Estimates have been gone through with a fine comb, what does the Minister mean by saying: &ldquo;By comparison with the actual <Col N="1273" /> figures&rdquo;?  If I am talking about two different things, I will drop the matter. He said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;By comparison with the actual figures for last year, the estimate of revenue shows an increase of £3.9 million, although last year's reliefs are costing £600,000 more this year.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He said at a later stage:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Unhappily, unlike my predecessor, who, last year, could draw on C.I.E. for &lsquo;£1,000,000 or so&rsquo;, I can invoke no similar fairy godmother to solve my problem.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Have not three fairy godmothers appeared on the horizon in increased revenue or has not the buoyancy of the expected revenue increased by some £3,000,000?  If that is not a fairy god-mother&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I never heard that fairy godmothers arrive as a result of hard work.  That buoyancy of revenue arises as a result of the hard work of this Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am no financial wizard.  I have no intricate knowledge of these things.  How the Minister can make that statement, I cannot see. The point I want to get from the Minister is, if all these Estimates have been gone through with a fine comb, how does he reconcile the fact that even then he has made a provision of £3,000,000 for overestimation.  I cannot quite understand that.</P>
      <P>We heard a great deal of talk about interest rates and external assets from the various platforms during the last election&mdash;all these high-sounding phrases such as &ldquo;the repatriation of external assets&rdquo;&mdash;but the Minister has made only very slight reference to this matter.  The Taoiseach is reported in the <i>Irish Times</i> on 26th April, 1954, as saying at Letterkenny:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The repatriation of external assets could safely proceed to a very much further point than had been reached up to the present.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know what the Minister has to say on that point, but I suggest that there is a complete divergence of views <Col N="1274" /> between the Attorney-General, Deputy McGilligan, and the Minister for Finance.  The Minister for Finance stated in his Budget speech that it was not by an increase in wages that the cost-of-living problem would be solved.  He said, at column 683 of the Official Debates of 4th May, 1954:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The cost of living may be affected by the rise in prices of imported materials.  We can meet this effectively only by exporting more, which means, in the first place, producing more and doing so more efficiently....  No real or lasting protection is given, in these circumstances, by increases in money incomes alone.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On the other hand, Deputy McGilligan is reported in the <i>Irish Press</i> of 27th April last year as saying:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The right policy was to increase wages and salaries and let the people spend the money for themselves on whatever they wished to spend it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There has definitely been a conflict of views there.  Now, the Minister for Agriculture and, indeed, the Tánaiste, Deputy Norton, made great capital on the subject of investment when speaking to what might be classified as the less politically acute section of the community. They had this cant that we have £60,000,000 invested in England that we lent to the British Government at 2 per cent.  We know it off by heart.  We were reminded of our last loan of 4½ per cent. and the loan before that where Deputy MacEntee paid 5 per cent. and the question was asked: Why do we not bring back these assets from Britain?  That is what the Tánaiste and the Minister for Agriculture said.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no quotation from the Minister for Defence, but I am surprised that the Minister for Finance in his Budget statement did not put an end to these misleading statements which are causing utter confusion and, indeed, they got quite a lot of votes for the Coalition.  The Minister for Agriculture said in Sligo, <Col N="1275" /> as quoted in the <i>Sligo Independent</i> of the 15th May, 1954:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It seemed to me quite ridiculous that they should charge their own people at home 6½ per cent. on loans to build houses for themselves when they were lending over £60,000,000 to Britain to build houses at 2 per cent.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Where is the £60,000,000 gone since this time last year at 2 per cent.?  It has been suggested by the Minister for Agriculture, the Tánaiste and evidently the Minister for Defence in various parts of the country that we are so tied up with Britain and the sterling bloc that we cannot turn around and do anything about it.  The Minister could have made reference to that.</P>

He used the words that the Minister &ldquo;made representations&rdquo; to the banks, which is a very different thing from what Deputy O'Higgins suggested and what no doubt will be suggested at a future date to the electorate of this country&mdash;that it was as a result of the action of the Government that the bank rate is as it is.</P>

      <P>It is, thank God.  At column 684 of the Official Debates of the 4th May, 1955, the Minister said that, due to the reduction in the rate of interest, the E.S.B. have effected a reduction in the rate of borrowing, and due to excessive rain the E.S.B. has saved coal and made a profit and as a result the board was able to defer some of its financial demands on the Exchequer.  At column 688 he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The provision for advances to the E.S.B. has been reduced to £4,000,000 in view of the power to borrow from sources other than the Exchequer which the board possesses under recent legislation.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>If the E.S.B. has saved so much money and if the rate of interest is going to be more attractive, the Minister has not indicated whether the consumer is to obtain any relief in the E.S.B. charges.  A quotation was read out wherein the Minister for Defence is alleged to have promised that in future rates would not increase.</P>

      <P>The Minister suggested that any alleviations should be given to that section of the community which suffered most.  I think he should have included in that category those in receipt of the disability allowance of £1 per week under the Health Act.  I <Col N="1279" /> would ask the Minister to consider that.</P>
      <P>There is another point in connection with allowances for rents.  The old age pensioners, the blind and the widows, particularly those living alone, should receive some allowance for rent.  There are three housing schemes in Limerick; in one case a widow living alone is paying a rent of 3/6; in another case, it is 8/6 and in the third case it is 11/-.  I am sure a similar position obtains in other local authority housing schemes.  The only answer I could get from the Limerick Corporation was that that was the amount decided by the local authority and nothing could be done about it. If the Minister would make some Order so that there would be a uniform rent of, say, 2/6, it would be some alleviation.  Even 2/6 would be too much.  These widows are getting only 24/- per week.  Why not have a flat rate for rents?  That could have been done under the present Budget for the entire country.</P>

I am sorry that places like Drogheda and Kilkenny could not benefit more because they, in fact, <Col N="1280" /> coincide with what the Minister had in mind, and would have benefited more, because this concession is only a drop in the ocean to very large firms.

      <P>I have that here, too. On 7th May, 1954, as quoted in the <i>Irish Independent,</i> the Taoiseach is reported as saying:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I may not be a mathematician but I am able to add up and I now challenge the Taoiseach to deny that the meaning of the fresh figures he has disclosed is that in each of the two years 1952 and 1953 the Government got an average of £50,000 a year less duty from the higher rate than we got when whiskey was 5½d. a glass cheaper in 1951 and 1952,&rdquo; said Mr. J.A. Costello at Wexford and Enniscorthy last night.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In 1953 and 1954 the Government,&rdquo; said Mr. Costello, &ldquo;only recovered £500,000 of the £600,000 they lost in 1952 and 1953.  What good did that extra tax do?  The Government got less revenue; the prices went up savagely to the consumer; the consumption dropped over these two years by 80,000,000 half-ones; the incomes of the publicans and distillers dropped and accordingly the income-tax they pay, fell; people in public-houses and distilleries lost their jobs and it has been calculated that the farmers got £150,000 to £200,000 less for their barley.&rdquo;</P>

It is not for me to say what the outcome of this is, but the Government certainly got a lot of votes &mdash;particularly for Fine Gael&mdash;on the last occasion, especially here in Dublin.

      <P>A lot of play has been made of the butter subsidy, bringing down the price of butter by 5d. per lb.  That, of course, is due to the Labour Party solely and everyone knows that on the Sunday before the Government was formed, the Opposition, particularly the Minister for Agriculture, complained very bitterly in the Catholic Commercial Club about the condition on which the Labour Party would take part in the Government.

As a matter of fact, a reduction of 5d. per lb. was given but, on the 8th May, 1954, before the election, the Minister for Social Welfare went so far as to suggest that the price be brought back to 2/10. According to the <i>Wexford People</i> of that date, he said:</P>

      <P>I am sorry that something more has not been done for the <Col N="1282" /> disabled persons and I hope that the Minister will see his way to do something for them because they got nothing.  After all, the half-crown is barely bringing the old age pensioners, the blind and the widows up to their previous level&mdash;compensating them in accordance with the increase in the cost of living.  The cost of living has increased two points and nothing has been given to this category.  I only hope that something better can be done for them in the near future.</P>
      <P>I cannot understand why, if a pension is given to an old person, a blind person or a widow, these people cannot come into the same category as regards the cost of living as workers who can claim, as is their due, for an increase in wages before the Labour Court if the cost of living goes up.  Why should it not be so?  Is there any reason?  The cost of living could go up an appreciable amount and yet by the time any Government got around to dealing with them they might suffer very grievously.</P>

      <Col N="1283" />&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;when compiling last year's Budget, was not very far out in his assumptions both for revenue and expenditure.  The new Government promised all kinds of reductions in this service and that but it is now quite apparent that it was unable to control the upward trend and that we will have the dismal position that, in one way or another, the Minister for Finance will have to devise means of getting in another £2,000,000.  It would seem that, at this stage of modern progress, it is very dangerous for any Party to promise reductions in expenditure.&rdquo;</P>

What followed on the morning after the declaration of the poll in Limerick?  About 60 workers in the C.I.E. depot, whose notices were withheld a week previous to the election, received those notices. That was what Fianna Fáil did for <Col N="1286" /> the workers in that depot at Limerick.  They withheld the notices, and obtained their votes.  I say that was dishonest.

      <P>I am not making any personal attack on Deputy Carew but I should like to clear up one point.  It was suggested by Deputy Carew that I failed to turn up as a member of a deputation to interview the Chairman of the C.I.E. Board to which I had been invited.  That is correct, but my reason for not turning up was that the Board of C.I.E. had definitely decided to establish in Limerick the maintenance repair depot for locomotives and, in answer to a question here in the House, the Minister for Industry and Commerce informed me that, due to representations which had been made to him, he in turn had made representations to the Board of C.I.E. My attitude was that it was not to the Chairman of C.I.E. the deputation should have gone in order to avoid the loss of this industry but to the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;I think these are sham reductions. I do not think they make any perceptible contribution to relieving the plight of the ordinary working people to-day and they make a less perceptible contribution in the circumstances in which they are offered.  I took the trouble of trying to calculate hastily what the reductions in the prices of tea, bread and sugar mean to a family of six people. That family will, under this <Col N="1289" /> emergency Budget, save 1/7½ in the week.  If they consume 4 lb. of bread per head per week, they will save bread per head per week, they will save 1/6, and if they consume three quarters of a pound of sugar each per week they will save 9d.  At the end of the week this family of six will have saved 3/10½.  That is the extent of the saving which this Budget will confer upon them.  One would think from these proposals that our people live on bread, tea and sugar and it would seem that this represents the Government's ambition from the point of view of the average person's diet.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasOHara" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot understand the attitude of Fianna Fáil here in the House saying that this Budget is a bad Budget and that it is an unpopular Budget.  I have been around the country quite a lot and I have also been around this city quite a lot since the Budget was introduced.  Naturally there is a big difference between Dublin and the rural areas; there is the difference in out look.  At the same time the many people I have come in contact with have told me they were quite satisfied that this Budget was a good one.  They appreciated, it seems, the many difficulties with which this Government was confronted on assuming office.  They appreciated that the Minister for Finance is a man of ability and that, in the short time at his disposal &mdash; during the short period of his <Col N="1290" /> term of office&mdash;and having regard to the fact that he is a new Minister for Finance, he has done a good job in such a short time.</P>
      <P>The people fully appreciate that the task of the Minister for Finance&mdash;any Minister for Finance&mdash;is a difficult one. It is a task that requires a good educational standard in many spheres, and the fact that the Minister has so distinguished himself on this occasion and has so gained the confidence of the people is a good omen for the present Government.</P>
      <P>The Debate on the Budget has been varied and has ranged over a wide number of topics.  One of the matters that were dealt with at length in this House both by the Government and the Opposition was the election promises. It is true that practically all Parties, during an election, engage in making certain promises, and perhaps sometimes the promises are drawn out a little bit too far and are, perhaps, a bit lavish.  I do say very seriously that any promising that was done by those on this side of the House certainly would not compare with what Fianna Fáil promised for the past 20 years. They are noted as the Party that excel from the point of view of promises. Having promised, they failed bitterly.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley expressed disappointment that the Government is an inter-Party Government, composed of various groups&mdash;Fine Gael, Labour, Clann na Talmhan, Clann na Poblachta and so on.  I do not see anything wrong in a group of Irishmen coming together, in the first instance having gone before the people and having made it clear to the people that, if elected, they would be prepared to form an inter-Party Government, that they would be prepared to continue where the inter-Party Government left off in 1951.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The bulk of the promises, so far as this side of the House is concerned, can be summed up in this way: I was not out in my constituency a lot during the last election campaign but I can truthfully say that the election promises in North Mayo were confined to saying that if we were elected as an inter-Party Government we would take up where we left off in 1951.  It is worthy of note that we got a mandate <Col N="1291" /> from the people, that we got authority from the people to represent them here and I am confident that we will continue for our full term.</P>
    <P>That being so, I think it is very wrong for a Party like Fianna Fáil, who were in office over a long period, to try to divide the groups here.  Unfortunately, Irish history is a history of Irishmen divided.  That was the case in the old Irish Parliament.  That is the case now.  If Fianna Fáil cannot set themselves to any better task than that, I suggest they should forget it and realise that there is no hope in the world that they will divide forces on this side of the House.  We are happily united on this side of the House.  Fine Gael have representation in the Government in the Taoiseach and other Ministers.  The same applies to Labour, Clann na Talmhan and every other group within the inter-Party Government.  They are all doing everything humanly possible for the betterment of the general body of people.  I tell Fianna Fáil very emphatically that they are wasting their time if they think they will divide our forces.</P>
    <P>A number of comments were made by Fianna Fáil Deputies that are worthy of note.  They want to try to convince the people that what the present Government has achieved in this Budget is not what they promised, that it is in fact no achievement.  From what I have heard in the past week, Fianna Fáil have certainly not succeeded in convincing the people along those lines.  They cannot deny that the present Government has stabilised the cost of living by increasing the subsidies on butter and tea and keeping tea at its present level.  Do Fianna Fáil Deputies appreciate that were it not for the action of the Government in coming to the rescue in the matter of tea prices the price of tea to the consumer would be 10/- or 11/- a lb.? Could the citizens of this State afford 10/- or 11/- a lb. for tea?  This country is one of the biggest consumers of tea in the world.  That being so, could the present Government allow a situation to arise where tea would cost the ordinary people 10/- or 11/- a lb. without <Col N="1292" /> any increases in wages to compensate for that increase in the price of tea, in many instances, without any hope of the Government being able to give increases in wages?</P>
    <P>We have not in this House control over private industries or private business concerns throughout the country.  We could not compel a shopkeeper or an industrialist in the City of Dublin to increase wages the moment the price of tea increased.  He could argue that it would be merely a temporary matter and that he could not afford to increase wages.  We could bring no compulsion to bear on that person to grant increases in wages. How would the people afford to buy tea at 10/- or 11/- a lb.?  It seems that the action of the Government was justified.  There are rumours to the effect that there will be reductions in the price of tea on the world market.</P>

      <P>It is actually happening. I think that justifies the action of the present Government in stabilising tea to cover what was, I sincerely hope, a temporary increase in the price of tea on the world market.</P>
      <P>It was very difficult indeed to drag out of the Fianna Fáil people in this House what their attitude would be with regard to that particular commodity. The Tánaiste, a few days ago, tried to drag it out of Deputy de Valera.  Although he put the question repeatedly: &ldquo;What would you have done?&rdquo; to the ex-Taoiseach, Deputy de Valera, he could not extract an answer.  He went on with the usual wriggling and just passed it off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">

      <P>Like you passed off the wheat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasOHara" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to tell Deputy Derrig that, so far as I am concerned, I am lock, stock and barrel with the present Minister for Agriculture in his attitude towards wheat.  I want to tell the Deputy, further, that I am a member of a Farmer's Party in this House and I am with the present Minister for Agriculture.  I hope he will put that statement of mine on all the newspapers in the country, because <Col N="1293" /> the people in North Mayo whom I represent have wheat growers among them.  They are an intelligent people.  Traditionally, they have had to go to England to earn their livelihood and to come back but they are the type of people whose forefathers, as Deputy Derrig knows, were evicted in the days of Davitt and the Land League Movement by landlords and landlordism.  Their fathers and grandfathers had a trying time.  They are an intelligent people.  They can tell when they have a good Government. They know well that a certain group of chancers came to this country and tried to cash in on the wheat prices that were being paid by Fianna Fáil.  Having regard to the fact that the ordinary taxpayer had to subsidise that price, was not it good policy on the part of the Government to reduce the price of wheat?</P>
      <P>Deputies like Deputy Harris can say in this House that £35 and £40 an acre was being paid for conacre.  Was not that proof positive to Deputy Derrig or anybody else that the price being paid for wheat in this country was fantastic and that it was time for somebody to call a halt?  Whether Deputy Derrig likes it or not, had not his own Government realised and awakened to the fact that there was too much wheat being produced in this country?  Had they not made a decision in regard to it, and did not the present Minister for Agriculture quote that decision in the House which is available to Deputy Derrig or any member of his Party?  If Deputy Derrig wants to discuss wheat here in Dáil Éireann, down in North Mayo or in any other part of Ireland, I am quite prepared to take him on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, we cannot set up special circumstances where we legislate for only one section of the community. When we do try to legislate, and legislate in the best possible way, surely it is not suggested we should legislate in respect of the price for wheat?  That is completely out of bounds and would knock the whole of our economy out of balance as has been proved by the figures available through the General Statistics Office <Col N="1294" /> and through the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of the 5d. a lb. on butter.  This has been mentioned so often that I hate to refer to it once more, but why is it that Fianna Fáil want to tell the people that a reduction of 5d. per lb. for butter, which is costing a colossal sum in subsidy, was no benefit to the average citizen?  We all know butter is a staple food in any household and being the important commodity it is, I think it was a very necessary step that the Government took in coming to the rescue of those poor people by subsidising butter to bring it within their reach.  So far as I am concerned butter is still not low enough in price, but there is a limit to what any Government can do in a short time.</P>
    <P>If Fianna Fáil were in office to-day, according to their own declared policy, butter would still be that 5d. a lb. more than it is.  When Fianna Fáil were in office had we not the spectacle of thousands of people on what we could describe as hunger marches to the gates of Leinster House?  These things have ceased since we became the Government.  Has anybody seen a hunger march on this Dáil since we took over office?  I certainly have not seen or heard of it.  I know of no unrest at the present time among the ordinary workers.  It is natural that workers would like to get increases. Everybody would like to get an increase in his salary or in his allowance. However, there is a feeling abroad among all sections of our people that each and every section of the community has representation in this present Government, that the ordinary labouring man has representation here through the Labour group and through the other groups.</P>
    <P>The same applies to our own Party as well as other Parties.  Each Party within the Government is pulling its weight in the right direction.  We have got rid of the undesirables from this side of the House.  It was no easy job to convince the people that an inter-Party Government was going to be a success because the last inter-Party Government had quite a lot of difficulty. <Col N="1295" /> There were a few undesirables who came into the last inter-Party Government.  They caused a lot of trouble and some people felt that it might happen on this occasion as well. Thank God we have got rid of those people now and things are working smoothly.</P>
    <P>That is exactly what is worrying those people on the far side of the House, that there is no trouble brewing, that things are working so smoothly and that the present Minister has succeeded in achieving what he has achieved, having regard to the fact that it is his first year in office.  If he had been in office for ten years&mdash; and I have no doubt he will be there in ten years' time&mdash;what he has done in the present year would have been quite an achievement.  He has achieved it in ten months.  One of the daily papers said that the Minister came into the House in a rather nervous condition on Budget day.  I was watching him rather closely and he was no more excited or nervous than he is this evening.  The Party opposite would like to give the people the impression that something is terribly wrong and that there is only one group of people that can run this country and that is Fianna Fáil.  With God's help we will live to give the lie to that sort of thing.</P>
    <P>When you consider that it was possible for the present Minister for Finance to subsidise butter and tea, to pay the award to the civil servants to which the previous Government had committed themselves and all the other things that were done during that time, I think they represent important achievements.  The man with an ordinary salary is able to get tax reliefs in regard to income-tax.</P>
    <P>Then, again, you have the blind person.  Fianna Fáil would like to convince the blind people and others that they have gained nothing at all as a result of the present Government's administration but they will not succeed in doing that either.  The blind are one section of the community that have my sympathy at all times and, I feel sure, the sympathy of every citizen.  If the Minister is prepared to <Col N="1296" /> give special concessions to anybody it is to that section I would like to see him give them.  We all talk generously in this House about what we would like to give and no doubt the Minister is just as anxious to give concessions if it could be done, but we have to live within our budget.</P>
    <P>We must have regard to the fact that we took over this country in a terrible condition.  For years and years the Party who were the Government showed a total disregard for agriculture, which is our main industry, and did everything possible to sabotage it by giving precious little by way of assistance to our farming community, by way of arterial drainage, which is one of the greatest needs in the country and by way of the land reclamation scheme by which the present Minister for Agriculture got the land out of the deplorable condition it was in.</P>
    <P>Who is so unreasonable as to suggest that agriculture is not our principal industry, and why was it the Fianna Fáil Party in their time did not introduce a lime scheme, a most necessary scheme so far as the farming community is concerned?  We all know that if there are cattle grazing on land continuously, or crops continuously taken out of that land, the lime content of the soil goes down.  What steps did the Fianna Fáil Government take to replace that lime content in the land of Ireland?  They took no steps.  It is true there were half a dozen lime kilns here and there.  Did Fianna Fáil expect that half-dozen to supply the entire needs of the country?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasOHara" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>I will pass from that but do they suggest that in that aspect of our economy alone they made any attempt to supply the lime deficiency in our soil?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want now to refer to the interest rates under the loans granted through the medium of the Small Dwellings Act.  We all know the shock the people got because of the desperate effort made by the Fianna Fáil Government to have the loan they floated fully subscribed, <Col N="1297" /> at a time when there was very little hope that they would get the money.  But they got the money by increasing the interest rates beyond all bounds.  What was the result?  In my constituency immediately many people were affected.  They had committed themselves to building projects under the Small Dwellings Act and they found themselves faced with increased interest charges.</P>
    <P>Their plight was a terrible one. They were paying £1 5s. per week but, as a result of the increased rates of interest, they had to pay an additional 5/- or 7/6 for which they had not budgeted when they started building operations.  They had gone to the limit of their resources to provide housing accommodation for themselves. I remember the phone ringing in my house as if we were in some desperate emergency.  Indeed, it was an emergency. There is no doubt about that. These people will have to meet these extra charges for many years to come as a result of the misguided policy of the Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    <P>There are a thousand and one instances I could quote here in condemnation of what the Fianna Fáil Government did.  I like to give any Government credit where credit is due. I give Fianna Fáil credit for some of the good things they did, but the good they did was outweighed by the bad&mdash; by the harm and the damage that they can never hope to repair.</P>
    <P>The Minister has expressed his thanks to the people for subscribing to his loan.  He also thanked the former Taoiseach for his co-operation in encouraging the people to subscribe. People who have money to subscribe to such a worthy undertaking should subscribe.  The Minister deserves our congratulation and our support for his magnificent handling of a difficult situation.  He controlled the price of tea.  He reduced the price of butter.  He gave increases to the old age pensioners, to the widows and the orphans.  He succeeded in having his loan fully subscribed.  That is a very creditable achievement for a Minister for Finance in his first year of office. Having moved around the country, I can say authoritatively that the people <Col N="1298" /> outside are very happy with the first ten months of inter-Party Government because they have been marked by such wonderful achievements.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Government (Mr. O'Donovan) John O'Donovan (Dublin South-East)">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Government (Mr. O'Donovan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate on this Budget has followed three different lines.  First of all, there were the political points which were raised; secondly, there were the points of comparison between the 1952 Budget and this Budget; thirdly, and I regret to have to say there was very little of this particular type of debate, there was an attempt to estimate the present position of the country in relation to this Budget.</P>
      <P>I propose to say a few words, first of all, about the political points raised. That situation was really summed up when, during the course of his speech, the Tánaiste suggested that it was inadvisable for anybody to argue with the Leader of the Opposition; he said the Leader of the Opposition would win in the end.  And, at column 872 of Volume 150 of the Official Report, Deputy de Valera replied: &ldquo;Because you were always wrong.&rdquo;  We all of us engage in arguments and discussions but I think very few of us think that the other person is always wrong.  That is my first political comment.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lemass came back, as he has done on a number of occasions during the year, to the question of the promises that were made during the election campaign.  For example, at column 844 of Volume 150 of the Official Report he was asked during the course of his speech:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Why then did the farmers vote against you last year?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>and he replied:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Because they were misled by the pledges and promises of the people opposite.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now during the course of that election campaign last year I took a busman's holiday one Friday night and I went down to listen to Deputy Lemass speaking at the corner of York Street. Strange as it may seem, I thought from the manner of his speech and even the nature of it that he realised <Col N="1299" /> the election was lost so far as Fianna Fáil was concerned.</P>
    <P>I have here a report of that speech appearing in the <i>Irish Press</i> of Saturday, May 15th.  It is a jungle of various points suggesting that the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party did not understand one another, that the people did not understand them and that Deputy Costello, the present Taoiseach, was making statements which he, Deputy Lemass, could not understand at all.  Now, as Deputy M. J. O'Higgins pointed out to-day, Deputy Costello, the present Taoiseach, really made only one promise to the people: he promised in so far as he could achieve it that the people would get good Government. That involved, above all, an attempt to lighten the burdens on the people. Since he came in here ten months ago Deputy Lemass has been singing a different kind of tune but that particular night at York Street, at any rate, he reminded me very much of a man trying to get out from inside a barbed wire entanglement with nothing to help him but his bare hands.</P>
    <P>During the course of Deputy Lemass's speech the other day, when he said that there was a danger, unless certain things were done, of killing the export trade in confectionery, I made a reference to the fact that the export trade in Jacob's biscuits was lost during a period when Deputy Lemass could have saved it.  He is reported as replying to me: &ldquo;The Parliamentary Secretary is talking through his hat as usual&rdquo;.  My recollection of what he said is very different from that.  It was not nearly as polite as that.  However, if it has been toned down by Deputy Lemass&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">

I think it is understood that if any Deputy makes a comment which he thinks is too strong he can tone down the wording while leaving the sense remain the same.  I think that is understood. But the question, at any rate, is whether I was talking through my hat&mdash;we will take the phrase of the Official Report.  This evening I examined the trade and shipping statistics, as they used to be&mdash;of course, they are now called trade statistics. I found our exports of biscuits were worth £503,000 in 1929; £231,000 in 1939 and that last year they were worth £137,500.  The particular period I was thinking of was the period immediately after the war and I find that there is a complete blank for the year 1947. The word &ldquo;biscuits&rdquo; in relation to exports does not even occur in the index.</P>
      <P>Now, how did that happen?  It happened in quite a simple way.  It was at the time when we had 100 per cent. flour here.  The Department of Supplies which was controlled by Deputy Lemass would not supply this company for export with flour which would enable them to sell their biscuits abroad.  In extreme circumstances that is quite understandable&mdash;perhaps in the years 1942 or 1943&mdash;but when it went on after the war, it was in my opinion quite improper, and every effort should have been made to get that export trade going again, but to make matters worse, in that particular year, 1947, we imported biscuits to the tune of £50,000 because there was white flour available for the manufacture of biscuits in England and we imported the bulk of them from Britain&mdash;I am wrong there: we got £12,000 worth from Britain and £30,000 worth from Canada.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lemass knew quite well from a phrase that was in the Budget that there was no danger whatever of a collapse in the export trade in confectionery. <Col N="1301" /> The Government had no intention of allowing the export trade in confectionery to collapse.  During the course of his speech, also, Deputy Lemass asked a fair-enough question. He asked what had the Government done here since it came into office to enable private enterprise to prosper? I take it we are all aware on every side of the House that the State end of enterprise and economy in this country has been very well attended to in the last ten years and what we would all be concerned with on both sides of the House is that there would be some developments which would help private enterprise.</P>
    <P>The present Government did one thing&mdash;and I think this is what they did primarily to answer.  Deputy Lemass's question&mdash;they restored confidence. There was a complete restoration of confidence once it was realised in the early autumn of last year that the Government had settled down in harmony and there were none of the difficulties which the Opposition had been sedulously suggesting would occur when members of the Labour Party and members of a strong Fine Gael Party got together.  That position has continued and that is primarily what the Government did.  They restored confidence amongst business people, confidence which had been previously shaken by the Budget of 1952.</P>
    <P>Coming up to the present Budget, I read what Deputy Lemass was forecasting about it and what I noticed was that when he was some little distance away from it, one day he said it was going to be most difficult for the Minister for Finance and the next that it was going to be most easy for him but when it came to the final analysis Deputy Lemass came down to it by saying that he did not see why the Minister would not be able to do something for everybody.  Of course, Deputy Lemass realised that it was not going to be easy for the Minister to foot his bill but, of course, it was right tactics, I think, from his point of view to suggest that the Minister could do something for everybody. Once the receipts and estimates of expenditure were published and once it was shown that there would be <Col N="1302" /> approximately £3,000,000 or £4,000,000 additional revenue without any increase in taxation, it was evident to Deputy Lemass that there was a position in which the Minister would be able to give something to everybody. These are the political points I wish to make.</P>
    <P>The second matter to which I wish to refer is the comparison between the 1952 Budget and the present Budget. There is this real, fundamental difference between the 1952 Budget and the present Budget: the present Budget is an attempt gently to push matters on to a better plane in this country.  The 1952 Budget was  radical surgical operation.  The difference of opinion was really on whether that operation was necessary or not.  It is suggested by the Opposition that the greatest tribute that could be paid to the 1952 Budget which, as we all know, was discussed backwards and forwards throughout this country for two years subsequently at various by-elections, and on various occasions in this House during the lengthy debates&mdash;it is suggested by the Opposition Party that the best tribute that was paid to that Budget was the fact that the Minister for Finance has carried on the tradition inaugurated by it.  In fact, of course, the Minister has not done any such thing.  The Minister has moved, in so far as he could, within the limits which were set out for him by the position he found when he came into office.</P>
    <P>I think that the Minister has shown considerable courage.  Suppose there should be a serious falling-off in trade or anything like that, would anybody say our yields of taxation would go up by £3,000,000 or £4,000,000?  I think that is unlikely for reasons I will give later, but still the Minister for Finance is the man responsible and it is on his shoulders that responsibility rests in introducing his first Budget.  I also say that we have not got the 1952 Budget with us still because when those increased taxes were made in 1952 wages were much lower than they are to-day and the only concession made to people like old age pensioners, the widows and orphans, and people of that sort, was the concession that they would get <Col N="1303" /> exactly the mathematical equivalent in compensation of what they had lost in the food subsidies.  To my mind, when you get a situation where there has been an increase in wages since that Budget&mdash;a basic increase of 12/6, and varying upwards from that&mdash;the Budget is not the same as it was when it was introduced.</P>
    <P>The primary criticism of the 1952 Budget was that it was designed to remedy a situation which no longer existed and that it was altogether the kind of operation that should have been carried out only if conditions were really serious in this country.  I take it that anybody who looks at the matter in a fair way will agree that conditions were not nearly so serious as the Minister represented them to be at that time.  Personally, I was perturbed about it for one serious reason.  I paid a great deal of attention to the Budget of 1952.  I hope the present Minister will not mind my saying that I read Deputy MacEntee's Budget a lot oftener than I read his Budget, and that I have a great deal more time to it.  What perturbed me in particular was the fact that I read in every line of that Budget a huge increase in unemployment.</P>
    <P>The Government of the day said: &ldquo;We did not deliberately create unemployment.&rdquo; That was what the former Taoiseach, Deputy Eamon de Valera, said.  It all depends on what meaning you attach to that phrase.  I would say that, if the Government of the day deliberately created unemployment, if they realised that what they were going to do would create unemployment, you might condemn them for it and say it was wrong and very harsh. If, in fact, however, the Government of the day introduced that Budget and did not know it would create large-scale unemployment then I would say they were quite unfit to be the Government. The extent of that unemployment in Dublin City was never realised because if they became unemployed they moved off to Britain after a week or a fortnight.  I noticed the change and another thing I noticed was that the Dublin people did not turn against the Government of the day at that <Col N="1304" /> time.  I think they were very fair about it.  It was not until late in the autumn of 1952&mdash;when they realised that what was being said by the then Opposition was true&mdash;that the Dublin people began to turn against the Fianna Fáil Party who were the Government of the day.  I think they were perfectly fair-minded about it.  I notice Deputy Corry is smiling.  Perhaps Deputy Corry is remote from the City of Dublin and thinks that what I am saying is not correct.  That was the situation as I read it at the time.</P>

      <P>Is the Deputy referring to the £24,000,000 out of the kitty?  There is one other suggestion in relation to the Budget of 1952 and that is that when the Fianna Fáil Government came back into office in 1951&mdash; and this is a suggestion made by many fair-minded people outside&mdash;they were unlucky that they ran into a bad period when the cost of everything was very high and, generally speaking, no Government could have done any better than they did.  I cannot help feeling that the particular views that were held by the then Government in 1951-52 were strongly reinforced by Deputy MacEntee's visit to Mr. Butler, which was referred to here earlier this evening.  I am very much afraid that Britain is running into a somewhat similar balance of payments difficulty at the present time as she was in at the fag end of the year 1951 when the dollar reserves began to go down.  The present Government have indicated, up to the present at any rate, one degree of independence: they did not raise the bank rate when it was raised in Britain a few months ago.  That was one degree of independence from that point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one other matter to which I should like to refer with regard to the 1952 Budget.  Yesterday, Deputy Aiken suggested many times that the excess profits tax in Britain was removed by the Labour Government in Britain.  I <Col N="1305" /> am only speaking from recollection on this matter but my recollection is quite distinct about it.  These taxes vary. As far as I remember, a large part&mdash;I think the whole of it&mdash;was removed by the present Conservative Government. What Deputy Aiken was putting forward was: Why did the Labour Party here not insist on the restoration of the excess profits tax when they got into office?  The fact of the matter is that it is a long time now since the excess profits tax was removed here and, in any event, in my opinion when you take corporation profits tax and add it to income-tax the taxation of companies is quite high enough here: I agree with Deputy MacEntee about that.</P>
    <P>In the earlier part of his speech this afternoon&mdash;I did not hear the latter part of it&mdash;Deputy O'Malley said that there was an element here in Dublin which was convinced that a change of Government would mean a reduction in the cost of living.  There is this much to be said about that.  If it has not meant a reduction in the cost of living it certainly has prevented it from going as high at it would be to-day if the Party opposite had remained in office.  They were on a good wicket there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a right good one. I will be thinking of that for the next month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will repeat it so as to make quite certain that the Deputy understands what I am saying. They were quite right in saying that it was a better bet to back Fine Gael and Labour than to back Fianna Fáil, because to-day they would be paying a higher price for butter&mdash;and God only knows what they would be paying for tea.  On the subject of tea, it might be no harm to say one or two words.  The Fianna Fáil Party had a major campaign ready about tea but the whole thing turned turtle on them. What did the Government do, on the other hand?  To give them credit, I think that, in the past, the Party opposite would have fought that campaign about tea but they have grown more wary with the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1306" /> What was done, in fact?  Everybody in this House knows that the Government started considering the price of tea last October and November&mdash;and the longer they considered it the worse the position seemed to get.  When it was at its very worst, the Government had sufficient courage to say: &ldquo;This is so bad it cannot last.&rdquo;  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, on behalf of the Government, announced: &ldquo;We are taking no decision on this until September.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Yesterday, Deputy Carter spoke in this debate.  He is one of the people who originally talked about tea on tick.  He mended his hand a bit yesterday, but he said the position was still in a bit of jumble and that we did not know where we were going.  I think everybody will agree that the auguries are very favourable at the present time.  However, if the Party opposite were in Government to-day, it is to be presumed that the price of tea would be the same as in Britain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Adjournment last night I was dealing with the position in regard to T.B. tested cattle and I am now suggesting to the Minister that under the present system what is happening is that a few cute people are quietly getting out.  The number of T.B. cattle in this country is not decreasing by any manner of means.  What I mean is that there is an exchange of T.B. reactors from one <Col N="1307" /> farm to another.  That is what has been going on all over the country as far as I can learn from others whom I consulted in this matter.</P>
      <P>Under this system a farmer can get his cattle tested free of charge: he brings in the veterinary surgeon, tests his cattle and so many of his cattle are reactors. There is nothing to prevent that man doing whatever he wishes with those reactors; he can do what he likes with them and naturally if a cow within a month or two of calving is found to be a reactor, the farmer waits until she is springing and he goes to the fair, sells the beast and somebody else is left holding the baby.  The same applies in respect of heifers and of practically every other beast that is there and I suggest to the Minister that in my opinion the proper thing to do would be to bring in one scheme, not for a county but for the whole country at large.</P>
      <P>If one is exporting cattle to-day the first thing asked about those heifers is if they have been T.B. heifers.  That, of course, applies to heifers which the purchaser wants to keep as cows.  But as I have said you have that kind of thing going on in this country and the Minister should make every effort to try and get rid of it.  Under the Minister's present wheat policy what will become of the farmers that have mechanised their holdings, and what is going to happen to the machinery on those farms?  In that respect the present Minister for Agriculture, on the 2nd April, 1952, when an increased tax was imposed on petrol, was very fluent on the matter and here was his statement as reported at column 1182, Volume 130 of the Official Report:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;How in the name of common sense can a Parliament, in one afternoon, declare that the economic survival of our people depends on reducing the cost of production and increasing the volume of production, and, in the case of production, declaring that, before the best farmer in Ireland will be allowed to catch up on the state in which he at present is, he must begin by contributing an additional 4d. per gallon on the fuel he uses in the only system of <Col N="1308" /> power and traction he now employs? He cannot draw back from his mechanisation because his capital investment is too substantial and is irrevocable.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was the position then and it was ruining the farmers then according to the present Minister for Agriculture. We all know that for the one tractor in 1952 there are ten there now and that for the one combine there was in 1952 there are now 50.  And now the Minister comes along here and says: &ldquo;Oh, yes, you will get 2/6 a barrel extra if you hold your wheat until after November&rdquo;.  In my part of the country at any rate we would consider that we were fairly late if we have not our harvest practically finished before the middle of August, and even when it is cut with the binder, drawn in and threshed, we would consider we were very late if we had not the threshing done by the first week in September.</P>
    <P>But now the Minister proposes to ask the farmers to hold that wheat from September when they thresh it until the end of November in order to get an extra 2/6 per barrel and he advises the farmer that the proper way to do that is to cut it with the binder, stook it, rick it, and then thresh it.  I think it is a very foolish thing even to dream of doing the job with the combine. I have heard various estimates given on this matter and I have heard that the difference in the returns between the combine and the reaper binder would be between one and a half and two barrels per acre.  I do not think I am very far out in that: the man who combines his grain has from one and a half to two barrels per acre more than if he cuts with the binder, stooks it, stacks it and then threshes it.  The estimate is that there is at least that much wastage.  I should like that the Minister would consider that point in connection with his offer of an extra 2/6 a barrel.  The farmer will get at least 75/- more per acre for his grain if he harvests it with the combine and sells it straight away than if he holds it until the end of November and does it with the ordinary thresher.  What I cannot understand is the whole attitude of the <Col N="1309" /> Minister towards the tillage policy of the country.</P>
    <P>What is the idea of endeavouring to wipe out by a penal tariff or a penal tax all the grain crops of this country? The only thing that has escaped up to the present is oats.  There is £4 a ton on feeding barley; 12/6 a barrel on wheat.  Yet, the Minister is very well aware that in his Department there are guarantees from farmers for the repayment of loans that were obtained for the purchase of farm machinery. What use has the farmer, who is put out of tillage by this penal tax, for a combine or for the reclamation machinery that he has bought for thousands of pounds and for which, in many cases, the whole future of the farmer and his farm is pledged?  What will become of it?  These are the things that I would like the Minister to consider.</P>
    <P>I noticed that Deputy Donegan was kind enough here the other night to thank the Minister for, as he said, introducing the contract system.  Deputy Donegan is very well acquainted with the firm of Arthur Guinness &amp; Son.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest to Deputy Donegan that if the Minister's contract system this year for the 20,000 tons of oats that are to be used by the flakemeal millers, is to be taken as the introduction by the Minister of a contract system, it is about ten years late. If we go back on our records, in 1942 and 1943, proposals were first submitted to Messrs. Arthur Guinness in regard to contracts for malting barley. When they accepted those proposals for contract in the autumn of 1948 they then admitted that they had lost a couple of million pounds by not entering into those contracts when first requested to do so by the Beet Growers' Association because, if they had done so, they would have had their contracts for barley during the emergency years which would have supplied them with plenty of barley to work their brewing industry here to the full instead of having to buy barley at what might be described as <Col N="1310" /> controlled prices and in many cases they did not get it at all.</P>
      <P>Definite contracts were entered into between the Beet Growers' Association, representing the malting barley growers of this country, and Messrs. Arthur Guinness away back in about August of 1948, at a period when the Minister came in here and announced a price of 50/- a barrel for malting barley.  The morning after that announcement was made, we met Messrs. Arthur Guinness and entered into a contract for the following year's barley at 57/6, 7/6 over the fixed price announced by the Minister the day before.</P>
      <P>As a matter of fact, we went further than that.  We inserted a clause in the contract ensuring that the farmer would get 2/6 per barrel more for barley than the average price Messrs. Arthur Guinness would pay in England for the barley they purchased there.</P>
      <P>When I hear Deputy Donegan thanking the Minister, in 1955, for introducing the contract system, I say it is just about as true as his introduction of the ground limestone.  One is as certain as the other.</P>
      <P>That is the way one finds little things shoved on, one bit to-day and another bit to-morrow.  One hears &ldquo;Deputy James Dillon, our Minister for Agriculture, is responsible for introducing something for you&mdash;a contract system under which you will get all your grain contracted for before you start to grow it.&rdquo;  I am very anxious that that condition of affairs should exist. It would be a great help to us.  It is rather a pity that we have not succeeded in securing that position in the case of feeding barley this year. The attitude of the Minister as regards the price of feeding barley is largely responsible for the fact that we did not get contracts for feeding barley this year.</P>
      <P>The Minister described the tax of 4d. a gallon on petrol in 1952 in these terms:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;...reduce your cost of production, while the Government slaps 4d. a gallon on the fuel you must use. <Col N="1311" /> I think this is a most loathsome performance.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was the Minister's statement on the 2nd April, 1952.  The same Minister comes along and imposes a 15 per cent. reduction on the grain the farmer produces.  I suppose that is not a loathsome performance.  The same Minister taxes the farmers of this country to the extent of £3,600,000 on grain alone and on the product of that grain.  He puts that load on the farmer's back and expects that the farmer will feel quite happy and will keep on tilling.</P>
    <P>Taking Messrs. Gouldings as the nearest step to the farmers, taking the people who we were informed in this House are responsible for the fact that the artificial manures the farmer must use are £6 higher here than they are across the Border, if they were told to-morrow that the price of their manure would have to be cut by 15 per cent. in order to give the farmer an opportunity of tilling, I wonder how they would feel.  I wonder also what quantity of artificial manures they would produce next year.  We all know that the stipulation in regard to the period was put in by the Minister for the purpose of getting the farmers to hold the grain.</P>
    <P>I am sure that the Minister is aware of the present rate collecting system in this country under which the first moiety of the rates must be collected before the 1st of October.  That is usually paid out of the farmer's harvest, but because the farmer will have to sell his grain in order to pay his rates, I wonder will the Minister issue a general direction now to the rate collectors not to close the first moiety of their warrant until after the 1st December so as to enable the farmer to get the extra half dollar.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesJBurke" hpid="Mr. J.J. Burke Mr. J.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.J. Burke</NameTxt>

      <P>If the Deputy would learn a little about agriculture he would be able to make a speech later on.  I do suggest to the Minister, if <Col N="1312" /> he is going to ask the farmers to hold their grain, to consider that point.  We all know that practically 50 per cent. of the wheat of this country is cut by combines.  In my County of Cork very little, if any, wheat is now cut with reaper and binder.  You could travel the whole side of the country and you would not see a stack in a field.  The reason is that, number one, the farmer gets more grain and, number two, he has less labour and less difficulty.  That is the position as regards wheat and I am wondering at this attempt by our Minister for Agriculture to prevent us from mechanising and at his attempt to put back the clock.  What is wrong with the Minister for Agriculture is that he believes in forcing the farmers back to the old method that was so aptly described by him some time ago when he told us the farmer was farming with a broom tied to a jennet's tail.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy had been out of his swaddling clothes and had been over here, he would be one of the people complaining because the inspectors were sent in.  I have looked at a few of the cases of these wheat ranchers we hear all the noise about. These very men were defended from these benches.  The owners of these <Col N="1313" /> lands were defended here against the then Minister and a protest made because the Minister was endeavouring to compel them to plough that land and grow wheat in it when this nation wanted wheat and the Minister for Agriculture was the very person who stood up here and protested against the prosecution of those people in an endeavour to compel them to till their land.  They are useful at this period because they can be alluded to as wheat ranchers and used as an implement to bludgeon the unfortunate farmers just because the Minister does not like wheat.</P>
      <P>I would like also to call the attention of the House to a statement made by the Minister here last week.  It was bad enough to have the Minister stand up here and announce solemnly that the farmer would get 40/- for his barley and that it would be taken from him at that, but the Minister came and told us quietly that it would not be taken in the harvest time.  The farmer was to keep the barley until the Minister wanted it and then it would be taken from him at 40/-.  It is rather a pity that the Minister did not make that statement when he was announcing the price.</P>
      <P>Any of us who knows the position of the ordinary small farmer to-day can very well wonder where that farmer is going to find storage for the feeding barley that is to be grown now at £4 per ton less than was guaranteed last year by the then Minister for Agriculture. I do not see how he can grow that barley now at £4 a ton less and hold it until the Minister finds some place to put it after the harvest is over or until the Minister requires it.  There is no proposal that there will be any increase in the price of feeding barley if the farmer holds it until 1st December. That is something we would like to hear a little more about.  Is it intended to hold the feeding barley or to pay the farmer something extra for the storage of that barley?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have heard a good deal in this debate about dairy cows and milk yields and all the rest of it.  I do not <Col N="1314" /> intend to go very far into that matter except to say that I pointed out to the Minister last night that under the policy that is carried out by his Department no premium is allowed to be paid by any county committee of agriculture for Friesian bulls.  That has been the policy of the Department right down the years, irrespective of what Government or what Minister was or is in office.  It is something we have never yet succeeded in breaking down.  The country would gain far more out of a premium Friesian bull than it will gain out of a premium Hereford bull or a premium Pol Angus bull.  What becomes of the progeny of the Pol Angus or the Friesian bull?  The bull calf becomes a bullock, is fattened and sold off the farm.  Is there any lasting benefit?  Is there anything conferred on the cattle through the use of either a Pol Angus or a Hereford bull?  There is not.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, with the dairy Shorthorn, as we have it, and with any of the milk breeds, the farmer will have the benefit of the heifers that will come from the bull.  For the life of me I cannot understand the mentality of a Department of Agriculture or a Minister who continues the present policy year after year.  What is gained by it?  Is there any lasting benefit to be shown out of the premium Hereford bull or the premium Pol Angus bull in any district?  The farmer is not allowed to keep the bulls from him because he is not allowed to license them; they are only mongrels. Now these premium bulls are generally mated to Shorthorn cows; and you cannot keep the heifer because you get no milk from her.  What good are they?</P>
    <P>We have a Department of Agriculture and we have thousands of pounds voted here each year for premiums for Hereford bulls and Pol Angus bulls. I pointed out last night the difference between the average milk yields here and the average milk yields in countries where the Friesian is kept as the general purpose cow.  I wonder would it be possible to break down this Department of Agriculture of ours to the point of allowing a few herds of Friesians to be imported direct from Holland or Denmark.  Let us have a fair trial.  If one wants a good red <Col N="1315" /> store, and I must say that my experience has proved this to be correct, one gets that store out of mating a Friesian cow with a Hereford bull; one gets both the bone and the meat.  If, on the other hand, the idea is to increase the milk yield then let us import cattle from those countries where the average milk yield is somewhere between 800 and 1,000 gallons per cow.</P>
    <P>It took us 25 to 30 years to breed down the old 500 gallon Shorthorn to the 350 gallon Shorthorn cow under the best policy that could be implemented by the Department of Agriculture.  It will take us another 20 years to get back to even the 500 gallon cow if we do not take steps to remedy the position. If we import high milk yielding herds that will shorten the period.  I tried to get the Department of Agriculture to do something a few years ago and I must say the answer I got was not very hopeful, though I was prepared to subject myself to any quarantine regulations considered necessary.</P>
    <P>I think it is foolishness on our part not to adopt a different policy.  Now, it would be worth the Minister's while to have a check up on dairy heifers. He has a very simple way of carrying out a rough check up through the artificial insemination stations.  The results will amaze him.  He will be amazed at the number of beef bulls that have been mated with our herds as compared with either the Shorthorn or the Friesian.  I suggest we are rapidly approaching the time when we will have a very grave shortage of dairy heifers.  The temptation is there; the price is there and you cannot blame the farmer for endeavouring to make up for his losses on wheat by getting something out of meat.  That is what he is doing.  Those are briefly some of the matters I would like to bring to the Minister's attention.</P>
    <P>There is another&mdash;a small&mdash;matter but it has a very serious effect on dairy farmers generally and that is the absolute disappearance from the markets of this country this year of Marston kale.  Kale seed cannot be got from any merchant in this country to-day or it is practically impossible <Col N="1316" /> to get it.  I have seen very small quantities of it black-marketed in my county at anything from 12/- to 15/-per lb.  I called the Minister's attention to that some months ago but apparently he was unable to do anything about it.  But it is a serious matter for many who are keeping large dairy herds and who are very largely dependent on kale and have to look after the feeding of those cattle for the winter months.  I wonder would the Minister be able to inform us whether there is any hope even yet of any of that kale seed being imported?</P>
    <P>It is not my intention, as I said, to go back over the statements that were made here on mincemeat and other things.  All I can do is to deprecate the tendency.  I have the utmost sympathy for the Minister in the awkward position in which he finds himself.  I know the Minister, if he could avoid it, would not come along and scarify the tillage farmers to the extent to which they have been scarified.  I know he would not.  I know very well he has, after all, some soft corner in his heart for the old farmer&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I would love to have heard what case the Minister put up to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, for instance, as to why he should not be allowed to increase the price of offals by £4 10s. a ton as <Col N="1317" /> stated by him here in his opening statement on his Vote for the flour millers to the detriment of the pig-feeders for whom I know the heart of the Minister for Agriculture was bleeding when we met him here last harvest on the price of barley.  But why allow the pollard that those unfortunate men need to be increased in price and why allow the Minister for Industry and Commerce to come along and extract out of that pollard practically £500,000?  I had hoped we would see it exhibited with the £1,900,000 that has been extracted from wheat.</P>
      <P>The hearts of the speakers opposite were bleeding so much regarding the bread subsidy the other day that I thought they were going to give that back.  However, I hope to have an opportunity of dealing with that particular aspect of the matter to-morrow. Why should any Minister of this State who is responsible to the farmers of this country for looking after their interests allow himself to be jockeyed by his comrades on the Executive Council into the position of scarifying the unfortunate people whom he is supposed to protect?  That is my complaint.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister made an honest confession here in his opening statement when he said that we were priced out of the egg market, out of the milk market and out of the bacon market, and the cure that has been suggested for the farmers in order to get back those markets is to increase the price of the feeding stuffs by £4 10s. a ton in order to bolster up the butchers! I suggest to the Minister that he should again seriously consider the opening statement of the Minister for Industry and Commerce on his own Estimate.  He will see there how so much was obtained by the reduction in the price of wheat and that it was expected to get more by allowing the price of offals to be increased.  That is the position.  What was the Minister doing while that situation was being created?  Where was our Minister for Agriculture, this protector of the farmers, on the evening that the Minister for Industry and Commerce decided to increase the prices of pollard and of offals?  These are matters on which I <Col N="1318" /> would like to hear from the Minister, and which are responsible very largely for the fact that we are being priced out of the egg market, out of the butter market and the bacon market.  As the Minister said, the unfortunate small farmer in the West of Ireland with ten acres of land and a wife and six children feeds pigs&mdash;do you want me to increase the price of feeding stuffs on him?</P>
    <P>I have a certain amount of sympathy for the unfortunate Minister when he scarified us down to 40/- a barrel and had to come along and pay 60/- a barrel for Iraq barley.  I could have a certain amount of sympathy for him in that that was responsible, I suppose, for the increase of £4 10s. in feeding stuffs since he came into office but what I cannot understand is why by deliberate action of this Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is in office long enough now to rectify these things himself.  That is what the Minister is there for.  The Minister has come in here as a free trade Minister to tell us farmers: &ldquo;Look, I can get my wheat in from abroad at a cheaper price than you are charging me here for it. Therefore, I am scarifying your price.&rdquo; The Minister comes in here and says: &ldquo;Look, even though I have to pay the Iraquian £10 a ton more for his barley &mdash;or his muck&mdash;than I pay you, it is good enough for you, old farmer.  You take £10 a ton less here.&rdquo;  That is the policy that comes from the Minister&mdash; and then we are to have more production. The prosperity of the country <Col N="1319" /> depends on more production by the farmer.</P>
      <P>Those are the conditions under which the farmer is to produce more. Those are the conditions under which we are going to stop the flight from the land.  Those are the conditions under which the empty Labour Benches are going to find more employment for agricultural labour on the land.  Those are the conditions under which they are going to find all those things&mdash;by scarifying the tillage policy of this country and by a vendetta against the man who dares to use a plough.  That, undoubtedly, is the definite policy under which the Minister is starting his campaign in this country.</P>
      <P>I am sorry to hold up the time of the House but I have endeavoured to be as brief as I could and to put the case as I see it.  I deprecate the attitude of the Minister.  As I have said, I might have some sympathy with him if I knew what kind of an argument he used with his colleagues.  I hope that the next time he is going to have an argument with them he will come over to me first for a few tips and I will help him out.</P>
      <P>As I said here at the start, the whole agricultural situation has changed. Some years ago, that Minister stood up here and pointed his finger across at the Labour Party and said: &ldquo;You Labour, you have to keep as mute as a mouse.&rdquo;  Now, Deputy Norton, the present Minister for Industry and Commerce, says: &ldquo;You Dillon, you have to keep as mute as a mouse while I scarify and wreck the agricultural community in this country.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister would be very wise to go for advice on bluff to Deputy Corry.  Each year since 1948 Deputy Corry has come into this House and repeated the same story about malting barley.  He talks about what the Grain Growers' Association did in 1948 and of how they got us a price of 57/6 a barrel for malting barley from Messrs. Guinness. However, Deputy Corry always omits to say that from 1940 to 1947 the price of malting barley was £2 a barrel&mdash;and Deputy Corry's Party was in office during those years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If Deputy Corry was so concerned <Col N="1320" /> about the grain growers of this country it is a wonder that, during the term of office of the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash;down through all those years&mdash;he did not do anything when the price of barley was deliberately kept down by his Government. Messrs. Guinness were paying over £3 a barrel for imported malting barley at a time when the barley growers of this country had to grow barley at £2 a barrel&mdash;just to force the farmers at the time to grow wheat.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry referred quite a lot to the additional scale price on wheat from the 1st November to December and again from January until the end of July.  He makes the case that this policy is against mechanisation.  It is not.  I believe the Minister had no idea, in settling that scale, that the man with a combine harvester would make use of it at all.  He could not, because the man using the combine for his corn must get rid of his corn immediately.  The inducement to keep the grain over the winter was for the purpose of spreading it out on the market, and to help the man who was not using the combine&mdash;and there are quite a number of those in some districts.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to see that, in the grain growing districts, the bulk of grain to-day is being harvested by the combine: the combine harvester is being extensively used.  That is a great advance and help to the country.  However, in quite a large part of the country the old method of the binder and the threshing machine is still in operation. In some of those districts the grain is not threshed until into November and those people will get the benefit. That is the meaning of it all.</P>
    <P>The mechanised farmer in the grain growing districts handles a large amount of grain.  He could not store it.  Very few of the farmers have the facilities to store it.  They would have to dry the grain and, if they dried it, they would not be compensated at all. Therefore, Deputy Corry is, as usual, trying to misrepresent the whole arrangement.</P>
    <P>As was to be expected in this debate, the price of wheat has been very much to the forefront.  Of course, all the political capital possible has been made by the Opposition on the matter. <Col N="1321" /> As a grower of wheat, I should naturally be delighted to see a price of £4 but we ought to face the situation as it is.  I have not yet heard one Deputy from the Opposition Benches put up a case for what could be done. We had over-production of wheat in this country: we had more wheat than we required.  Our maximum acreage of wheat here cannot exceed 400,000 acres.  Our requirements are in the neighbourhood of 350,000 acres and we must have a percentage of foreign wheat.  That has been accepted, even by Fianna Fáil.  An additional 50,000 acres would be required for seed. However, 400,000 acres are the maximum we could have.  Last year, we had 490,000 acres.</P>
    <P>What was to be done?  Would some of the Fianna Fáil Deputies, who seem to be so sincere about this, tell us the solution in regard to this excess of 90,000 acres?  Are we to subsidise it at the old price?  The subsidy will amount to 30/- a barrel.  Are we to subsidise wheat at 30/- a barrel to feed animals?  One must remember that you must be very serious when you think of feeding wheat to animals; you must be very, very careful.  I think the people of the country realise all this; that they realise this was bound to happen about wheat.  Last year even supporters of Fianna Fáil who were wheat growers were saying that it was the last good year of good wheat growing and that actually there had been a cash in on wheat growing.</P>
    <P>If we go back on the history of wheat growing we will realise that Fianna Fáil introduced it.  Yes, I will give Fianna Fáil that much.  But under what conditions did they originally encourage growing wheat?  It was after they had tried to kill the cattle trade and after they had gone around the country saying: &ldquo;Thanks be to God the British market is gone&rdquo;.  The farmers at that time were forced to grow wheat because they had no other market.  At the beginning they grew it at a very low figure but as it continued it became the main plank of the Fianna Fáil policy. They used to think that if we grew all our requirements of wheat we did not want anything else: we had no need to raise live stock.  What happened <Col N="1322" /> then was that mechanisation began to develop in the grain growing areas and it became a very simple matter for farmers to grow large areas of wheat. In 1947 or 1948, when the tractor made its appearance after the war, in the grain growing districts, farmers were making enough to get machines and to introduce the combine which brought up the yields by about five or six barrels to the acre.  That is a fact, and that made the problem of growing wheat a very simple and a very profitable one.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil were not disposed to watch this development and advanced the price of wheat.  This made wheat growing so attractive that everyone jumped into it.  There were denials from the other side of the House about this ranching having taken place.  I know it has taken place.  I know some large farmers in my constituency all of whose lands have been ploughed up for years and I do not think Deputy Moher would disagree with me.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think Deputy Moher would agree that that is good farming.  I know a farm not far from this city on the main road which has been growing wheat for the fourth time in succession.  Is that good farming? Is that the type of farming we want?  It had to be stopped.  The price of wheat should never have been £4 a barrel.  I say that as a wheat grower.  It has made immense difficulties for the Minister in his efforts to bring back wheat to its present position.  There has been a lot of talk about this thing and I should like to make one more point on it; can any Deputy tell me what means of disposal we would have for the surplus wheat because we were facing that situation? We would have been facing it this year were it not for the fact that a great deal of wheat never got to the mills because of the bad harvest.  We had 90,000 acres of wheat and we did not know what to do with it.  Our whole tillage programme had gone lopsided. Naturally, I would be in favour of retaining the £4 per barrel, but that <Col N="1323" /> could not be continued as any honest Deputy from the opposite side will not deny.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>There had to be a reduction in the price of wheat.  It had to come.  There are, apart from that, some matters of detail about wheat into which the Minister should look. One of them is the variation in bushel weight.  At the moment you have the same scale from 57 to 60 and again from 60 to 63.  I think that should be changed so that you would have a system under which the price would be fixed at a rate of 60 and then scaled down for each point reduction in the bushelling weight.  The jump from 57 to 60 is too great because you will find people whose corn bushels 59½ getting the same price for a much better and a much more valuable crop as the man whose corn bushels 57.  The man whose wheat had bushelled 59½ has corn which is much better for the mill and much more valuable.  There should be a change there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to compliment the Minister on what he did last year about the adjustment in the moisture clause because the harvest was so bad and because farmers could not keep the moisture content at the standard to which they had been accustomed. The Minister, because of these difficulties, had the moisture clause modified. That was a very reasonable attitude and in an exceptional year like last year it should always be done.  In any year when, through no fault of the farmer, the moisture content of his corn is unduly high, the moisture regulation should be modified.  I hope we shall never have the ill luck to <Col N="1324" /> experience another such harvest as last year but if we do I think the same attitude should be adopted with regard to the moisture content of corn.</P>
    <P>I want to refer now to the land Project.  I think it has reacted very favourably and very considerably in the last year or two.  We see the results in the increased acreage of land under the plough; a great deal of this land was absolutely valueless.  That land has been reclaimed now and in most cases has been ploughed up in order that it might be brought into proper shape.  Some of it has been put under grass.  That is going to reflect considerably on our production. In my constituency a great deal of work has been done and in practically every case the farmer has ploughed up the land immediately the drainage work had been completed.  This land is growing back into wonderful shape and, as I have said, in nearly all cases it was land which was practically valueless.</P>
    <P>However, there are one or two problems concerning it facing the people who are operating the scheme. One of the worst difficulties they have to face is that they are meeting old drains.  The average drain being put in under the project is 2½ feet deep and some of the old drains which they are meeting are down as far as 4½ feet. The people do not know that these old drains have been in existence, they put down the new drains at the new depth and when the work is done they can see the effect of the old drains leaving spots in the fields.</P>
    <P>That is a serious problem and something I should like to see examined and remedied if possible.  One solution I would suggest is that the chief drains along the fences which carry the main run of water from a field should be done first and the other work left over for a period.  Eventually the old drains will show up in the field in spots.  By doing it in that way there is a possibility of surmounting the problem of the wet spots.  They will know they exist and they will tackle them.  It is an awful job to have to go back after 12 months and rip up where they have put in a complete drainage system. That has been happening.  I do not know whether it is generally the case <Col N="1325" /> in the country, but in my area these problems have arisen and it is not easy to solve them.</P>
    <P>Various views have been expressed by Deputies on the policy of the Department in regard to the live-stock industry.  I believe that all the Deputies who have spoken have been sincere in their views.  They are very valuable views.  We are inclined to compare this country with Denmark and Holland in the matter of milk production.  Of course, this country cannot compare at all.  One point is missed, that is, that the people in these other countries are not interested in beef production.  They are not interested in the British market for beef.  That makes all the difference in the world.  The two economies can hardly be compared.  In Denmark and Holland they are all out for milk and want nothing but milk.  They set no value at all on beef production whereas we are in exactly the opposite position.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Our position is that we are trying to hold our footing on the British market.  At the present time our position as far as beef is concerned is serving the country very well.  It has been suggested that the Department should give premiums to Friesian bulls and milk breeds.  I hold my own view on this.  It may not be worth very much.  I think the Department has been wise as far as it has gone in that respect. If we went in completely for dairy herds we could not produce beef. There would be so many Friesians in the country that it would be at the cost of our live-stock industry.  There is no question about that.  The beef cattle, the Aberdeen Angus and the Hereford, are to-day making top prices on the British market.  That is how we are holding our position there.  There is no other country able to compete against us.  What we want is to go further in that direction.  With the high price of live stock to-day, our problem is to maintain the numbers and to increase the numbers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been said that if we are unable to maintain our cow population we will not be able to renew our stock.  There <Col N="1326" /> is a way out of that difficulty.  By allowing a number of our heifers to produce one calf and to rear that calf and then fattening off the heifer as a young cow heifer, the numbers will be increased.  That has been done in some parts of the country very successfully. The difference in value is very slight. That is one way in which we can tackle the problem.  It is a big problem.  If the position of the British market remains as it is, as it appears it will, it is very important to increase the numbers of young stock in this country. If we can do that, our position will be secure.</P>
    <P>It is the anxiety of every Deputy that production in every sphere should be increased.  One of our big problems is the number of small farmers in the country.  The larger farmers have kept pace with the times.  They have mechanised.  They have a certain amount of capital.  They have a fair amount of up-to-date knowledge and are making full use of their lands. Twenty years ago, the large farmer was in no better position than the small farmer as far as the production of crops or live stock was concerned. To-day that position has changed.  The smaller farmer has not the capital to buy equipment.  He is not in a position to fertilise his land properly and, therefore, is not getting the same return. We have so many small farmers that this is a very big problem.  I have not a solution for it but a solution must be found.  The smaller farmer must be put in a position to produce more and must be put on the same footing as the larger farmer.  The smaller farmer will have to get equipment by some means and be put in a position to obtain modern machinery and scientific knowledge of how to fertilise the land and get it up to the mark.</P>
    <P>One direction in which tremendous headway must be made is in pastures. As far as tillage is concerned, we can compare favourably with most countries; we are getting fair yields and fair returns, we are as good, or nearly as good, as most countries and better than some.  In our grasslands we have made no progress.  Driving through the country, one can see the <Col N="1327" /> extent of poor pastures.  It is at this time of the year that they shine out. Fields are starting to produce grass now when they should have been producing it two months ago.  That is due to the condition of the land, to the lack of fertility and the type of grasses produced.  Most of this land must be ploughed up and put through rotation and put down in proper grasses.  If that is done, the land will carry double the stock that it is carrying at the present time.  That is one direction in which we should face.</P>
    <P>The Opposition will say, if we talk in that way, that we are all out for grass.  We need not be all out for grass.  Tillage has come to stay here. Fianna Fáil or the present Government or anyone else is not responsible for the fact that there is a big acreage under the plough at any time.  That is the result of the development of mechanisation.  The more mechanisation there is, the more tillage there will be, because tillage will become a simpler job to the farmer and, if it pays, he will put his land under the plough.</P>
    <P>There is a policy advocated in England of taking the plough around the farm.  I believe that is an excellent policy, that there should be no old pastures.  Possibly in the very good land in Meath it is not necessary to put down new grasses for a considerable time but the average land in the country requires to be looked after and to be ploughed up and put through rotation, fertilised properly and new grass seeds put down.  In that way you can increase production. There is a tremendous field for development there.  We can do quite a lot in that direction.  It will not be a big job.  I hope the Department and the Minister will consider that and see what can be done.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which has not been publicised sufficiently, that is, the activities of the Department in various fields of development.  The information obtained is not passed on to the people to the extent that it should be.  Quite a lot of things are done by the Department from time to time and the average man in the country does <Col N="1328" /> not know of them.  Of course, with the increase in the number of agricultural instructors, the position can be rectified but more publicity should be given in the Press to what is being done so that the farmers can be educated in that way.  With the introduction of the parish plan that the Minister is launching at the present time, assistance will also be given in passing on the information.  There are many farmers in the country who want this information.  It is a big problem to double the agricultural output of a country but I hope that farms here are heading in that direction, and that it will not be very long until we see that situation brought about.</P>

      <P>This Vote on Agriculture is one which occupies the attention of a great number of Deputies in the House.  That is as it should be seeing that it is of such great importance to the country. Years ago the Minister was responsible for introducing the land rehabilitation scheme.  In that regard he showed courage, enterprise and a belief in agriculture generally.  While it cost the country a great deal of money I have no doubt that it was one of the soundest propositions on which money could be expended by the State.  That scheme has had difficulties, disappointments and occasional setbacks but that is only in accordance with the ordinary expenditure of human effort.  It is a sound investment which will pay dividends and bring about national prosperity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All of us have not the same outlook in regard to the resources of this country.  Opinions are divided over many years as to the best lines to follow.  A strong viewpoint prevailed that industrial development was the solution for our economic problems. Others clung hard to the idea that agriculture was the soundest basis on which to build our economy.  It is true that those who placed their faith in industrial projects and who were prepared to mortgage the country by subsidising new ventures have found from experience that those new ventures were not justified to the extent that the public were led to <Col N="1329" /> believe.  Again, accordingly, mistakes were made.</P>
    <P>Looking into all this in retrospect, we must assume that somewhere in between lies the key to our prosperity. We must not underestimate the importance of agriculture.  No scientist has yet introduced any alternative for the fruits that are produced from the land. Therefore, I do not think there is any danger in the present or in generations of the near future that the product of the land will become a secondary thing in the ordinary course of living.  As I say, somewhere in between must lie the solution to our problem, but it is on the thing we know best that we must expend the greatest amount of our resources, and that is on agriculture.  I have paid the Minister the compliment that his scheme was a bold and generour one, and even those who may have been doubtful as to whether it was based on sound lines need have no fear as to the wonderful results it will achieve for us.</P>
    <P>On the question of tillage, a lot of discussion has taken place this evening and on previous occasions, but I am afraid that on this question I must strike a discordant note.  I am not at all in agreement with those people who speak here very strongly on the inefficient price paid for wheat, barley and beet.  Deputy Hughes has referred to a section of the community, the small farmer.  He believes that the problem in this respect could be solved by the provision of facilities from the Government to enable the small farmer to mechanise his farm, to have modern machinery, modern manures so as to enable him generally to step up his production.  I speak for a section of the small farmers.  The solution that Deputy Hughes finds suitable for his small farmers would be of no avail to mine.  You can do what you like as regards providing our small farmers with modern machinery and manures, but you will not alter the natural condition of the soil, and that soil is quite unsuitable for wheat, beet and barley.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>What about grass?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenMaguire" hpid="Mr. Maguire Mr. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to that. There is a great deal of what the <Col N="1330" /> Deputy said with which I am in agreement. Particularly in the West of Ireland where the moisture is very extreme, the quantity of grass that can be grown there is very great, much larger probably than on other, better soils.  However, the quality of the grass, completely neglected as it has been over the years, is poor.  Suggestions have been made to the Minister to improve conditions in that respect by taking advantage of the natural proliferation of the grass.  That cannot be done on poor land that is unsuitable for tillage.  It can be done by the application of artificial manures. I will couple myself with Deputy Hughes in the suggestion he made. The Government should assist in developing the grasslands in the West of Ireland that will not yield to the plough and in the sowing of suitable grass because the soil in a lot of cases cannot be ploughed.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenMaguire" hpid="Mr. Maguire Mr. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>It cannot.  If you have soil of merely two or three inches in depth and then a bad sub-soil, and you expose that sub-soil in the course of ploughing, you poison that land and turn it into a worse condition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenMaguire" hpid="Mr. Maguire Mr. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>That is all right then. We are in agreement there.  I ask the Minister to give us some system whereby we can improve the grass that grows naturally.  By improving the grass we will improve the output on the farm and benefit the farmer who owns it.  I know that every Deputy advocates those improvements he considers to be the best.  Asking the Government to subsidise this, that and the other must in the long run become nauseating even to those who support the principle of subsidy.  The time has come when we must make practical suggestions which will give practical results and improve the prosperity of the country generally.  It is not right that the entire country should live on one section of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the years repeated requests <Col N="1331" /> have been made for increased prices for wheat, best, barley and so on. Now all these prices are subsidised by the State because all these prices are guaranteed.  What is the result of each new application for an increased price?  The result is that those farmers who are fortunate in having land suitable for the growing of these crops benefit to a considerable extent while the unfortunate farmer less happily placed on unsuitable land reaps no benefit of any kind and has to pay an increased price for the product of the beet, the wheat and the barley grown by his luckier brethren in order to maintain himself and his stock.</P>
    <P>Deputies come in here and complain that the price of wheat is not economic. On whom are the farmers who grow wheat leaning?  Who pays the extra money so essential, according to most speakers, to keep those farmers in production? Is it the Minister for Agriculture?  Is it the Minister for Finance?  It is nothing of the kind. The people who are paying that increased price are the poor of Dublin City and the poor farmers in the West of Ireland who are compelled to buy these products.</P>
    <P>It is time that there was a proper understanding of agriculture and other aspects of our economy essential to the well-being of the State.  It is time there was more solid thinking and a more solid grouping of ideas rather than mere criticism of the other man's actions.  I remember when the present Minister for Agriculture waxed eloquent in his denunciation of wheat. To-day he is an advocate of wheat. That is no condemnation of the Minister; he was wrong then; he is right now.  Do not all of us welcome the convert?</P>
    <P>I remember a time when I was a strong advocate of all sorts of reforms. I believed that industrialisation would be the solution to emigration.  I wanted protective tariffs on everything.  I now realise from experience that that policy has an adverse effect on those who are not fortunate in living in an industrial area or who have no industries in proximity to them.  In the West of Ireland we are wrongly placed geographically <Col N="1332" /> speaking.  No industries come down to the West of Ireland but we have to pay the additional cost of protecting industries centred in Dublin, Cork and elsewhere along the SouthEast coast.  We reap none of the benefits of industrialisation.  Those who have industries available to them have some form of employment.  At whose expense?  Is it at the expense of the Minister for Finance who gives the protection? Is it he who pays?  Not at all.  It is the poor children of the West of Ireland who have to wait until they are 17 years of age before they can emigrate to find a livelihood elsewhere.</P>
    <P>For many years past industrialisation and protection has been regarded as sound national policy.  I do not blame this or any other Government for that.  It was thought that the solution lay there.  The idea was that if we had our freedom and complete autonomy we would in time be able to build up industries which would absorb our young people and offer opportunities of employment to them. Experience has taught us that that has not been the result.</P>
    <P>The only sound industry on which we can build economically is the agricultural industry.  We will have to put more into it in the future.  Remember, that every time a price is fixed for barley or anything else the West of Ireland is becoming more and more disorganised because the land is unsuitable for growing those crops necessary for the production of stock, of pigs, of hens, of cattle and so on without some subvention of some kind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>My colleagues in the Fianna Fáil Party, or anywhere else, will bear me out because they understand the needs of the locality for which I speak.  The West of Ireland has been forgotten.  What has been done to improve conditions in the West? The Congested Districts Board disappeared in 1923 as an entity.  The people for whom it catered are fast disappearing because they are compelled to emigrate and the forestry inspector to-day is marking out for <Col N="1333" /> trees the land where human footsteps trod a few years ago.  That is the result of 20 years of native Government.</P>
      <P>I wish the Minister would turn his eloquence to describing conditions in the West of Ireland.  People are living there on land that is not fit to maintain the snipe or the vole.  By their energy, their enthusiasm, their courage and their determination they have succeeded in wresting a living from the soil and they have built up a grand population of intelligent people who year after year have made a name for themselves in other lands.  I wish the Minister would bend his mind to the problems that exist there and evolve some scheme to save that grand community from extermination.  The problem has nearly solved itself through emigration but there may be a few years left in which something can be done.  Every day the trains leaving Leitrim carry whole families or members of families away to foreign lands.  The Minister can sit there with his arms folded.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BenMaguire" hpid="Mr. Maguire Mr. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>I am telling the Minister what he can do to develop and improve conditions in the West of Ireland.  He can improve the quality of the grass.  That is the only thing he can improve.  The soil is poor; the climate is harsh.  By improving the grass, an important step forward will be taken in the right direction.  The Minister knows quite well how dependent the small farmer down there is on mixed farming&mdash;so much milk, so many calves, so many pigs, so much poultry, and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is known that the price of eggs, which was the main income of a number <Col N="1334" /> of small farmers all over the country for generations, went bang last year and that meant a reduction in the means of living to a large number of our small, mixed farmers.  The price of feeding stuffs was not reduced, the bad harvest inflicted further penalties on our people and the result was the almost complete elimination of eggs and poultry.  I do not believe I am exaggerating when I say that as regards the average small holder of £10 valuation and under&mdash;and they represent a very big section of the whole of my area&mdash;their incomes, from that source represented not less than 25 to 30 per cent. of their total income.  That part of their incomes was cut off.  The people had to go without it, adding further to the depopulation problem.</P>
    <P>What would happen if the wheat growers or the beet growers were subjected to a cut like that or to a reduction in the price of their goods to that extent?  They would raise a storm here and all over the country; they would get newspaper reports and big headlines to show how their interest in the community was being victimised and to insist that something should be done to save the country from disaster. Suppose that a similar cut was made in the profits of the shopkeepers or in wages or in official salaries, what an outcry would take place!  Yet in the Minister's own section of the community, the section for which he is responsible, he saw these things happen last year, perhaps not through his interference, but I think he was entitled to seek some protection for these people for whom it represented the loss of a quarter or one-third of their ordinary means of living.  They should be protected against such a happening.  An inquiry should be held and an effort made to provide for them since the land they own cannot provide the necessary foodstuffs for the production of eggs and poultry.  The land should be subsidised to the extent that it would leave their production economic.</P>
    <P>I say that that is due to us because we have to pay for the protection which is being given to beet growers, barley growers and wheat growers over the years.  We are also paying increased prices for industrial products <Col N="1335" /> because of the protection they are given and we must buy these products if we are to live.  Surely there should be similar protection&mdash;even if it would be on a much smaller scale&mdash;for people who have been robbed and driven out of production through no fault of theirs.  It is only right that the Government should come to their aid and keep them in production because it is not through laziness or lack of effort that they are out of production, but through circumstances outside their control, some of those circumstances intiated by the Government of this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Maguire</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BenMaguire" hpid="Mr. Maguire Mr. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>It need not necessarily beggar the Minister.  This section of the farming community for whom I speak has in the past subsidised the other sections of the community and has subsidised industries producing industrial goods, but in our part of the country we are never able to get any benefit from any of them.  We cannot get a return for any of the things we have given in the past.  We ask for justice and if the Minister wants to have a reputation in the days to come he should have courage enough&mdash;and I believe he has&mdash;to stand out and say that as a large area of Ireland has suffered in the past, let us now give them fair play.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister asks us who is to pay. I have asked that question in my argument this evening.  I say I only know we have been paying for the beet grower, the barley grower, the wheat grower and for industrial protection. There was a period when we did pay for the beet grower.  We paid more for our sugar.  There is no question about it, it is clear as daylight for <Col N="1336" /> anybody who wants to look on it in an impartial way.  The congested areas are entitled to relief.  After all, Balfour thought conditions were so bad there compared with the areas in the country which were then very bad also, that he introduced a certain Bill and set up a board known as the Congested Districts Board to deal with them.  He also subsidised it.</P>
    <P>Is it not an extraordinary thing to record that that subsidy still continues to be paid in but not for the congested areas of Ireland for which it was intended and which were mentioned in the Bill that was passed through the British House of Commons?  It does not go to them but into the general revenue of this State by Order of an Irish Government many years back It is still being drawn in and utilised towards the general revenue to subsidise other sections in this country.  It is being stolen from the poor citizens in the areas where conditions were so depressed that even a British Prime Minister found it necessary to give them a subsidy.  The Government is in possession of that money&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The congested districts grant for £46,000 first paid by the British Prime Minister and it is still payable and is drawn into the funds of this State.  That is a fact.  It is like robbing a poor man or a widow. It is an outrageous piece of conduct. It shows the injustice and it shows the amount of interest that is taken by the different Ministers in the most necessitous people living in this country.  Is it any wonder that part of the country is being cleared out week after week?  Is it any wonder they are losing their affection for the Motherland and are turning their minds to foreign countries?  You can talk as much as you like about your schemes but if you drive the people out of the country all your schemes will be of no avail.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BenMaguire" hpid="Mr. Maguire Mr. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>I am tired of listening to all this twisting of words and figures.  Will the Minister tell me how much additional money may be spent now in respect of the Congested Districts Board?  Will the Minister further tell me how many millions of an increase in respect of agriculture generally has there been since that grant was made available?  There has been no increase for the improvement of agriculture in the areas I have in mind.  The Minister can be very quick in his remarks.  He can also use words to favour his own line of argument. What he has said would imply that there is some twist in my statement. This country has been committed for a considerable time past to the giving of grants for the agricultural industry. I now ask the Minister to examine what proportion of these grants, if any, has been given to the congested districts that I have been talking of and to the other areas in my constituency.</P>
      <P>I come now to the subject of dairying. From time to time the complaint is made that the price of milk is not economic.  To my own knowledge, the price of milk is indeed uneconomic.  If a farmer keeps 12 or 20 cows and if he can afford milking machinery then, no doubt, he can make some profit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the average farmer who has maybe three or five cows, or as many as ten or 12, cannot install the mechanised plant and the cows will have to be milked by hand.  A <Col N="1338" /> cow has to be milked twice a day on seven days of the week and every day of the year.  The cow has to be milked on Saturdays and Sundays, in addition to the ordinary working days, and she has to be milked on holydays and on Christmas Day.  If one thinks of the amount of labour involved in all that milking of cows, day in and day out, one must come to wonder about the value of that labour.  In addition to milking, cows require care and stallfeeding for six or eight months of the year.  To ask people to attend to these cows and give them the necessary care and then to offer one shilling or 1/6 a gallon for the milk produced just represents dark slavery.  That type of farming is going out.  The children on those farms are no longer prepared to accept such conditions.  They realise that that system has been built up and developed on slave conditions.</P>
    <P>Milk production in this country is declining according as people in the dairying areas remove themselves from such slave conditions&mdash;and it will continue to decline unless we take action immediately.  The Minister may be able to find some solution to that problem, but he must bear in mind the importance of preserving the small producer. These small producers have the idea now that they can take up alternative employment, with better conditions all round, and live a less slavish existence then they lived in the past.</P>
    <P>I suggest the Minister and his Department should consider the question of suitable animals for the breeding of different types of cattle in this country.  In my view, the Minister and his Department could do no better than consult the average experienced farmer as to the best type of bull that would be suitable in different localities.  I fear that people who lack experience decide theoretically the best type of animals that can be produced.  There are certain parts of the country where such inexperienced persons insist on putting in maybe a Shorthorn bull or a whitehead, and so forth, and refuse to put in the Polled Angus bull which may have been requested by people living there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

For years past, the Department of Agriculture have turned their back on the various applications by the poorer type of man for Polled Angus bulls. They have turned their back on the provision of Polled Angus bulls in areas where they are very suitable.  I invite the Minister to consult the records in his Department and get an idea of the number of applications from such poorer families in certain parts of the country for these bulls. Now, to-day, the Minister's Department are realising that there is something to be said for the Polled Angus bull.  Now we can see the ill-effects of theoretical planning by the Department of Agriculture which, instead of helping our farmers, almost ruined them and put them out of business.</P>

    <P>I remember talking to a farmer who lived in depressed conditions for a number of years.  He told me of a <Col N="1340" /> conversation he had had with a man who was good at figures.  The farmer wanted some extension of time to pay his annuity.  The man told him that he could not be in any jeopardy.  He asked him the price of the various stock he had on his farm and told the farmer that the position was excellent. The farmer said no, that the position was not excellent.  Then the man spoke about pigs and mentioned the prevailing prices for them.  The farmer then pointed out how much it costs to keep a sow and feed her, and later to rear the bonhams and rear the pigs. The farmer told me that to hear the man argue about the profitable basis of producing pigs made him feel completely disgusted and that when he saw this smart Alec showing a profit where he, as a pig producer, knew there was none, he could not restrain himself from saying: &ldquo;Do you know, it is men like you who have this country in the condition in which it is &mdash;feeding pigs like pencils on paper.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is the same everywhere.  The farmer has it in his blood to do things in a practical way.  He realises the futility, generally, of theoretical solutions as to the best types of animals to produce different strains. The average farmer knows the best type of animal to yield him a profit and until the Minister gets the advice of the average practical farmer, and considers that advice in conjunction with the theories advanced by his Department, we shall make no progress.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to bear in mind the points I have made about the poorer parts of our country.  I urge him to give us a subsidy to increase production from our land.  I urge him to give us artificial manures at a price which we can afford to pay&mdash;manures which would improve the fertility of our soil by as much as 100 per cent.  I urge that, where necessary, the Minister will make provision for drainage and for land rehabilitation so as to bring about increased production and prosperity in the poor and depressed areas of which I have been speaking.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said he would like to hear from some of the <Col N="1341" /> critics what should be done.  I shall try to reply to him as far as I can without any reference to past policy. I know it is hard on the Minister at this stage when he might have been hopeful, but I think the most important decision the Minister has got to make is in relation to the dairying industry.  The dairy cow, it seems to me, is the centrepiece of our agricultural economy.  Our success in every other sphere is promoted or adversely affected by the success or failure of the dairying industry.  The Minister has said: &ldquo;We have priced ourselves out of the dairy produce market&rdquo;.  If such is the situation it denotes a very grievous error in policy. It seems to me that both the Minister and the general body of farmers have given up the idea of going into the dairy produce export market again.  I think such an attitude is fatal not alone to our agriculture but to our national economy as a whole.</P>
      <P>The Minister's first responsibility irrespective of any predilection he has or of opposition he may meet it to set the dairying industry on its feet by getting into the dairy produce export market again.  It can be done and I am quite sure it should be attempted. I realise with the Minister that we cannot put all our eggs into one basket.  Competition in the dairy produce market is keen and it may well become keener if we add our quota of deliveries to it.  No market is inexhaustible, and while we should give premier place to the dairy cow we must consider it in relation to the whole scheme that makes up our agricultural economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The statement made by Dr. Haagedoorn in his work on animal breeding, to which the Minister's friend from Cambridge, Dr. John Hammond, has written a laudatory preface, says that the only head of superiority in domestic animals attaches to the conditions of agriculture into which the breed must fit.  I have no technical knowledge that would enable me to decide which is the best breed of cow we should have.  As far as any inquiry I have been able to make leads me, I have been able to gather that if we are concerned with milk production <Col N="1342" /> alone there is no question that the Jersey cow is superior.  There is a conflict of opinion on this question and considerable controversy on the relative merits of the Friesian and the dairy Shorthorn.</P>
    <P>Two former members of this House, Mr. Ted O'Sullivan and Mr. Tim Quill, who both represented Cork, have shown amazing results from their Friesian herds but I have met men equally progressive who claim that they have made just as much progress, and produced as much from their Shorthorn herds as the other two have from Friesians.  I think, in relation to that argument, that the Minister should not strive to impose any restriction on any farmer in respect of the cow he wants to keep.</P>

      <P>Consideration of all the factors of the problem indicates to me that the preponderance of the Shorthorn cow in the dairy herds of Ireland makes its reappearance as a highly productive dairy cow a much simpler matter than the introduction of a foreign breed.  I believe that foot and mouth disease is endemic in the countries renowned for their dairy produce and unless we had some peculiar system of getting the cattle in, and I would not suggest over the Border, you cannot avoid the endemic of foot and mouth disease here.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately most people praise the dual purpose cow and some do not realise that we have among our dairy cows a no-purpose cow which is good for neither beef nor milk.  The Minister pointed out that we have two milking economies in this country.  I am concerned with only one of those.  It is on that economy that any dairy exports can be based.  That is the economy of the area served by the creameries.  We must assume I suppose, for the moment, that the Shorthorn, <Col N="1343" /> with all her alleged faults, is the animal on which we must depend.  By a beter fed and a better sustained dairy Shorthorn we definitely can increase the amount of the milk produced.</P>

      <P>Deputy Moher spoke about the influence of various breeds of cattle and I think his suggestion was very proper.  I see people here with price cattle which give tremendous amounts of milk and I know how it was got.  It could not be got in the ordinary farm in County Cork in that fashion.  If the extra milk is to be at the cost of the purchase of concentrates, we had better let the problem alone.  I do think that by proper grass, ensilage and properly made hay we can get the results.  I was very glad to hear Deputy Hughes to-night coming over to the Fianna Fáil point of view in regard to grass.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>What point of view?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy heard me. Deputy Donegan a few days ago made reference to a field of 11 acres which was of more value to the owner of an extensive farm than the rest of his land.  There are very valuable fields in the country.  I have seen them down in the South, deep soil, but even the fertility of those fields could be exhausted and, certainly, American <Col N="1344" /> farmers, to my knowledge, have exhausted such fields.</P>
      <P>The reason I refer to Deputy Donegan's 11 acres is because I am tired of hearing about permanent pasture. Permanent pasture is very impermanent and I wonder if Deputy Donegan's farmer with the extensive holding would not realise that the other fields might produce an equally rich and valuable crop if they were properly treated.  The land of County Meath, so highly praised by Deputy Donegan, is not carrying to one-third capacity and anyone familiar with grass going through County Meath will see that much of the grass there is fibrous, without any nutritive value. Deputies in County Meath, apparently, do not realise that under-grazing is just as damaging to grass as overgrazing.</P>
      <P>The idea was prevalent on those benches over there a few years ago that land once ploughed recovered slowly and did not develop a proper mat of grass until about 20 years.  I heard that statement from authoritative sources, and I can tell the Minister who they are.</P>

      <P>We cannot have increased milk supply without better feeding, and it is not surprising that the 400-gallon cow is our average milk <Col N="1345" /> producer when most of them, again to my knowledge, have been starved on poor non-nutritious hay in the winter months.  I have seen it happen time and again throughout the countryside.</P>
      <P>We want to be clear on what a grass policy is so that the term &ldquo;Minister for Grass&rdquo; will not be a term of obloquy.  I think it ought to be a term of honour if we really understood what the term meant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by successful dairy farmers in my constituency that you cannot run a successful dairy farm except, to use the words of Deputy Hughes, you carry the plough around the farm.  I believe that to be true.  Successful dairying means tillage, not ranching, as some of the exponents of a grass policy seem to believe.  The Minister should ask himselk if the slogan adopted: &ldquo;One more cow, one more sow,&rdquo; and so on has not become a catch cry, completely unrelated to agricultural practice and policy.</P>
      <P>Feeding is not the whole solution.  If we are to help the dairy industry, some attention must be paid to breeding. I was in a part of the country where there is very barren land, nothing but rocks and ditches&mdash;not in my own constituency&mdash;and to my amazement I heard that the only thing that was wanted in that area for the betterment of the locality was a Polled Angus bull.  I was surprised again to hear Deputy Maguire.  I could not, from the time I started from a certain city until I got to this place 60 miles away, see anything that might co-habit with that bull that would be bigger than a goat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The bull licensing scheme in England has been a complete failure.  The bull licensing scheme here has been a complete failure&mdash;absolutely.  What happens? Every Deputy in the House knows what happens when you have bull inspectors being selected.  When Fine Gael have the authority the Fine Gael Deputy goes to the Minister and says: &ldquo;There is a good poor devil in <Col N="1346" /> my constituency who ought to be appointed a bull inspector.&rdquo;  When Fianna Fáil was in power the same thing happened, if there was any room.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe that these people had any better information or knowledge about bulls than the average farmer.  The Minister says he has complete confidence in the farmer. He said there was no desire on the part of anybody in this House to coerce the farmer.  I think the Livestock Breeding Act as administered is pure coercion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a Coercion Act, no doubt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course it is.  Surely the farmer is a better judge of his own interest and what constitutes his interest than any individual who comes into an area judging bulls.  That individual has no statistics, no information in regard to the productive qualities which the bull might transmit. I would suggest that the farmer himself is a far better judge of the type of bull he needs than any bull inspector.  We all know the old story, which is not untrue, that one of these famous bull inspectors passed a bullock.</P>
      <P>I do desire to promote and develop the beef trade as far as possible.  I realise its value.  But I wonder if the operation of the Live Stock Act of 1926 has made it more valuable and I wonder if we did not have a very valuable beef trade before that Act came into operation.  The latest statistics available to me says that in 1953 we exported 455,931 cattle of all kinds and in 1924 we exported 942,908 cattle.  This does not indicate a wonderful improvement.  I know that the Live Stock Act is not the only factor.  Certainly, it must have some bearing on the numbers.</P>
      <P>I believe that we cannot have a profitable beef trade if we have not an expanded dairy industry.  You cannot get the raw material for the beef trade if you have not an expanded dairy industry, particularly at the present moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1347" /> The farmer may be devoid of all scientific knowledge and he may be affected by prejudice but he has a sound knowledge of his job; he has long experience and knows his cows and a lot of that experience is very often set aside by the scientists as old wives' tales and the scientist very often lives and learns that there was a grain of truth beneath the old wives' tale.  I think it would be far better for the Minister to allow the diary farmer to utilise his own knowledge and to select his own bulls.</P>
    <P>One thing I was very glad to hear the Minister referring to, that was, the mongrelisation of cattle.  The production of and from hybrids is a growing danger.  I think it is going to damage our herds.</P>
    <P>If we have priced ourselves out of the dairy produce export market, our problem is to devise methods whereby we can recover our share of that market.  The report of the Milk Costings Commission is only of academic interest to me.  When all the costs of production are computed, when all the difficulties associated with the dairy industry are assessed I am under no illusion that a higher price is needed.  I do not say this to embarrass the Minister but because I believe it to be the truth.  When the price of farm produce is too low and when only a very insubstantial profit is derived from it, farmers draw into their shells.  They adopt a subsistence method of farming.  I know that the dairy farmers down the country are afraid of increased production because they believe the profit that will be derived from any increased production will be entirely incommensurate with the risks and the money involved.</P>
    <P>Our business is to attempt to recover our share of the dairy export market and I assert here that it can be done. We ought to try to teach how it can be accomplished and we ought to offer the incentive for doing so.  It is very sound economics to sell your surpluses overseas at the best world price you can obtain for them and it is poor economics to say of the sale of such surpluses that you are supporting the foreigner at the expense of the nation.</P>
    <P>We should try to produce a surplus <Col N="1348" /> and so adjust the price of the product as between what we use and what we export as to offer a proper incentive to production.  Whatever opinion we may have about 1/- a gallon for milk I suggest that whatever the Minister offers should be over a five-year period. We have spent a good deal of money in foolish ways and a little help to the dairy industry&mdash;but only if the dairy industry is going to help itself&mdash;is very necessary at the present time.  The Minister should, as he offered to do a few days ago, go into consultation with the dairy farmers to try to find some method whereby we can utilise this great potential we have.  I have been listening to platitudes about the dairy industry for a long time and expressions of ministerial concern for all types therewith.  If the Minister has real concern, as he must have, for the dairy industry, he will realise that investment is wise when it is put into a sound business and there is a better chance of making a sound business of dairying in this country than of anything else.</P>
    <P>One essential piece of equipment on a dairy farm, indeed on any farm, is a water supply system.  This equipment is just as essential on the farm as a milking machine, a plough or a tractor, and it should be regarded as equipment. But my information is that when a farmer takes advantage of the grant scheme for the installation of a water supply system, the rates go up and in a few years he has paid more than twice that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is not, people in my constituency have been mulcted very much by the council.  I think the Minister should make sure because the whole idea would be a failure if the rateable valuation is raised to a substantial extent.  Let me say to the Minister that the general aim of the parish plan is to be applauded. However, I deprecate the introduction of new methods when the old methods have not been fully tried.  The present scheme of things&mdash;county committee of agriculture&mdash; chief agricultural officer, and the agricultural advisers&mdash;is a very well designed scheme.  While it has drawbacks I believe it can be brought <Col N="1349" /> a good deal closer to perfection than any other plan.</P>
      <P>There is a story about the ancient spinster that the more she saw of men the more she liked dogs.  I am like the ancient spinster: the more I see of cranks who come with their problems and their solutions for those problems to the Minister, the more I like politicians.  I think the politicians on the county committees of agriculture are just as good Irishmen as any of the cranks that might come to a Minister and they have the seal of public approval on them, no matter how they got it.  The present system is a good one provided that it is given what the Minister proposed to give to the parish plan, a sufficient supply of agricultural advisers.  I would, however, create a system of inspection and direction attached to the Department of Agriculture.  Vocational education committees in County Meath particularly are rather a nuisance to the Department of Education now and again; nevertheless, without their aid in the work they have been doing, vocational education, which I believe to be very valuable, would not have made the strides it has made, and if men who are elected county councillors can be so valuable as they are on a vocational education committee, I do not see why we cannot make use of the same men on the county committees of agriculture.</P>
      <P>However, I would superimpose on the present system some form of inspection and direction in the hope of doing away with a good deal of the office work which agricultural advisers have now to undertake.  The pen may be mightier than the sword but in the hands of an agricultural adviser it may become an awful nuisance and may become habit-forming.  I do think a short and concise report of work done on a farm, of suggestions made ready for examination by an inspector on the farm would do away with a good deal of the unread reams, the writing of which takes up so much of the time of the agricultural adviser.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The success of any advisory system depends on the character and personality <Col N="1350" /> of the adviser.  One bad adviser can do more damage by creating a lack of confidence than six good men can remedy.  I would like to give these young men, when appointed, all the emoluments and privileges of permanency.  I would include the initial three years for pension purposes, but I would make those three years, years of trial.  I am very interested in getting good men because I know how much damage a bad man can do; and we will not be so poor in resources in the future that we will have to put up with bad men in this vitally important work.  Now the land of Ireland is our only resource and its effective use is our greatest problem; we will not solve that problem by scoring debating points here on the question of agriculture, but I hope that between us we will find a solution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFanning" hpid="Mr. Fanning Mr. Fanning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fanning</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been listening to this debate for some time and I am amazed at the turn Deputy Hughes has taken.  He changed his opinions when he went over to that side of the House.  When he was talking about wheat he said it was only right that the price of wheat should be reduced. The present Taoiseach stated here that farmers were getting money for wheat to which they were not really entitled. That is an amazing statement coming from the head of the Government.</P>
      <P>We are continually listening to the cry that we cannot keep the people on the land because the farmer cannot pay the same wages as the industrialist. Are we getting any help from the present Government towards increasing the workers wages on the land? It is hardly likely that we will seeing that the Minister is taking at least £10 or £12 per acre off the price of wheat. That would not seem to indicate that we will be able to keep more people on the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Maguire upbraided the tillage farmers to some extent because he said that they were being subsidised for wheat and beet and barley.  As far as I know we are not subsidised for beet.  But despite his complaint about subsidies, he nevertheless asked the Minister to subsidise grass for animal feeding.  We are asking for <Col N="1351" /> subsidies to enable us to produce food to feed the people.  There is a vast difference there.</P>
    <P>It is only natural that every man should speak for his own area.  I represent a tillage area.  The farmers in my area were fairly badly hit in the last harvest but, if they were hard hit, the Minister hit them twice as hard. It is all very fine to talk about ranchers and chancers.  I come from an area in which they are few ranchers and chancers.  Farmers' sons in that area have gone out and taken conacre to make a living from the land of Ireland.  Does the Minister call these ranchers?  I have known instances where young fellows started with about ten acres and I am proud to be able to say to-night that they have since been able to purchase farms for themselves.  Only for tillage they would have no hope of ever doing that because they could not afford to keep cattle.</P>
    <P>It is astonishing to hear people say that the growing of wheat does not give employment.  From my own experience I know that extra labour is required and must be kept on the land when wheat is grown.  Bouquets are being thrown at the present Minister. I do not think any would be thrown at him in the county I come from.  Only yesterday we had a meeting of the County Committee of Agriculture and I can tell him that his own supporters are very dissatisfied with the price of pigs and with the decline in the pig population.  He cannot deny that during the last six or eight months he has allowed the price of offals to go up by £4 10s. per ton while pigs have gone down by 5/- or 10/- every week.</P>
    <P>The time has come when bacon has almost to be rationed.  The price is increasing day after day.  During the last couple of months pigs were bought at round about £7 10s. to £7 15s.  Now these pigs will be released from the factories as bacon and the consumers will have to pay an extra 2d. or 3d. per 1b. for their bacon.  Both the producer and the consumer are being hit.  Why not let the bacon now in storage in the factories be sold at the price at which it was purchased?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1352" /> The Minister asks us to produce more.  What encouragement will he give us?  If we produce barley, dearer barley will be imported.  I cannot see why that should be permitted.  We were told we would have a surplus of wheat last year but the bad harvest saved the Government having to pay a subsidy.  Why not have a whiter loaf with more offals for animal feeding and stop the imports of maize at a prohibitive price?  Would not that solve the difficulty of the surplus wheat?  It is all very fine to ask the farmers to keep the wheat for three or four months and they will get an extra 5/- or 10/- per barrel.  In that way the Minister would inevitably cater for the ranchers and the men who could afford to hold on to the wheat for three or four months.  Most of our farmers want to get rid of their wheat the day they thresh it.  They are waiting to get paid by the millers and, when they are paid, there are ten pairs of hands waiting for their share.  There is very little use in asking us to increase production when that increased production will entail a loss.</P>
    <P>Every time cattle are mentioned in this House there is an immediate outcry about the slaughter of the calves. At that time I can remember two elections being fought in the one year; the economic war was at its worst and in the second election Fianna Fáil were returned to power in far greater numbers than in the first.  There would have been a big decline in our cattle population had there not been a change of Government in 1951.  What happened in the period 1948-1951?  In-calf cows were going to the factories to be slaughtered because of the low price for milk.  Would there be as many cows in the country to-day if farmers had accepted the then Minister's price for milk&mdash;1/- per gallon for five years? Would there not be a decline in our cow population and in our cattle population? I think that the price given for milk, the encouragement that the farmer got from Deputy Walsh when he was the Minister for Agriculture was the first uplift that the dairy farmers got and it encouraged all farmers to get into cows.</P>
    <P>The licensing of bulls was another question which was debated here.  We <Col N="1353" /> all know what happens at bull inspections. There is one breed, the Shorthorn, which to my mind is not getting fair play.  One cannot show a Hereford bull by inspection unless one has a certificate from both sides whereas if you wish to show a Shorthorn if he is nicely made up and in good condition he will pass.  You cannot have the right breed or class if that is happening at ordinary bull inspections.  If one has just a nice calf at times, it is the feeding and condition that pass him.</P>
    <P>There is another thing I would like to refer to and that is the transfer of loans from the Department of Agriculture to the Credit Corporation. Everybody knows how hard it was to get the loans from the Credit Corporation whereas you had not half that trouble with the Department of Agriculture. There is not a Deputy in this House but who can be approached by applicants and get two of the best securities that can be found in the neighbourhood and still they are turned down.  That will be the case now.  It is only an easy way of saving at the expense of the unfortunate man that wants a loan.</P>
    <P>Deputy Maguire referred to the small farmers.  The small farmers in my area do not want a grass subsidy. With ten, 15 or 20 acres they must live on tillage and tillage alone.  It is poor satisfaction for them to be told: &ldquo;You are being subsidised for everything you grow.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is very hard to understand the attitude of a farming Deputy like Deputy Hughes, who comes from a tillage area.  I remember when he was on this side of the House he was demanding a higher price for the growing of beet when to my mind beet was fetching a good price at that time.  He said that he himself had grown 20 acres but was down to one.  Are we not entitled to look for a decent price at least?  I think the biggest mistake the Minister for Agriculture ever made&mdash; of course as Deputy Corry said he may have been forced to do it&mdash;was the reduction of 12/6 per barrel for wheat because the price of manures, rates and all the rest is going up and at the same time the Minister was one of <Col N="1354" /> those who urged the farmers to mechanise their holdings and to use the combines.  What encouragement is he giving them now?  If they are to cut the wheat with combines how are they to keep it over?  They will be at a complete loss.</P>
    <P>There is not very much more that I have to say.  Much has been said and there is no use in covering the same ground.  They can say from the far side of the House that the present Minister is the best Minister that ever sat in the Department of Agriculture but what is said down my way is that if he is running agriculture he is ruining us.  He could tell use here to grow oats in 1948 when he accused a Deputy from a certain area of telling the farmers to make sure and sell or otherwise they would be at a complete loss. But it is all very well to say: grow it and walk it off the land, but the farmers whom I represent are only waiting for a chance to walk the present Minister out of his position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Egan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, in opening this debate, devoted a good deal of his speech to cattle, and he eulogised again the dual-purpose cow, the Shorthorn cow, as the foundation of our cattle industry.  The Minister very often pays homage and respect to this animal and on one occasion since I came in here I heard the Minister say: &ldquo;The Shorthorn cow and the Land League were the greatest benefactors of the Irish farmer.&rdquo;  He would almost have us believe that the Shorthorn cow is An Druimfionn Donn Dílís herself, while on the other hand Deputy Moher would wrap the green flag reverently round the Dutch Friesian. I believe that the dual-purpose Shorthorn cow is the best cow for this country as the foundation for our stock.  Nevertheless, I am not a doctrinaire Shorthorn man.  I believe Deputy Moher has made a case for the Friesian which requires to be examined.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Egan</NameTxt>
      <P>I prefer to take his case for the Friesian.  He quoted the results of experiments which seem to prove, so far as they went, the supremacy of the Friesian over other breeds tested <Col N="1355" /> under the same conditions.  These conditions were good conditions and, perhaps, ideal conditions, and it remains to be proved whether the Friesian would beat the Shorthorn over a long period or over a reasonable period when subjected to all the varying conditions and hardships which the Shorthorn has stood up to here.</P>

      <P>In any case, it is up to the Minister or whatever Minister is in charge of agriculture for the time being, and his Department to provide proper facilities and testing grounds to settle this question once and for all as to which is the best breed for this country.  It is extraordinary that the Americans have come over here and have told us how to do almost everything. I grant they were generous with grants and that they were entitled to give us advice, anyway.  The latest news we have is that they are lending us an Army man to advise us on drainage, but with all the progress that has been made in America and with all the experiments&mdash;and surely they have not been behind in experiments or in regard to the expense of experiments even with the hydrogen and the atom bombs&mdash;it is extraordinary that they have no Shorthorns.</P>
      <P>Only the other day the Minister mentioned that fact, that there were practically no Shorthorns in America. If the Shorthorn is the breed we think it is, it is an extraordinary thing that the Americans have not discovered it, or perhaps climatic conditions may have something to do with it.  I should like the Minister to tell us when he is replying&mdash;perhaps he has more information on the matter than I have&mdash; why the Shorthorn has been neglected almost entirely in America.</P>

      <P>I should like to pay a tribute to the way in which Deputy Moher put forward every argument he made.  Deputy Manley from the <Col N="1356" /> Government Benches paid a very generous tribute to him&mdash;a tribute which, of course, was deserved.  Deputy Moher's speech was the type of speech which will set farmers, and agriculturalists generally, thinking&mdash;and that is one of the best things that could happen.</P>
      <P>Deputy Allen made a suggestion about premiums.  He suggested that the premiums for Hereford and Aberdeen Angus bulls should be stopped. I entirely agree with that suggestion and I am glad the Minister received it favourably.  The Aberdeen Angus and Hereford bulls will be purchased irrespective of whether or not they carry a premium&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and they will get plenty of cows.  On the other hand, it is 100 per cent. more difficult to get people to take the Shorthorn.  I hope the Minister will receive my suggestion as favourably as he has received Deputy Allen's suggestion.  It is that no Shorthorn bull be licensed unless it is pure bred and purchased at a recognised bull show or sale.  Nothing has done more harm to the Shorthorn breed generally than the type of bull that has been passed at what we call the crossroads inspections or, as Deputy Moher puts it, the crossroads beauty contest.</P>

If a man goes to any fair in Leinster he will find there Shorthorn bullocks which are inferior in quality to the Shorthorn bullocks of 30 years ago. That is mainly if not entirely due to the &ldquo;yokes&rdquo; that have been passed at these crossroads inspections.  Therefore, I suggest to the Minister that he could not do anything better for the Shorthorn breed than insist that every Shorthorn bull which is licensed must be pure bred and that he should be bought at a recognised bull show or sale.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>On Wednesday last, May 4th, I asked a question of the Minister for Local Government as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If he is aware of the grave dissatisfaction that exists among ratepayers in Buncrana because large sums of money allocated for the repair of the houses at Maginn Avenue were not utilised to the best advantage, and, if so, if he will have the matter investigated.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary, Mr. Davin, representing the Minister, made the following reply:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;I am aware that some dissatisfaction has been expressed by the ratepayers in Buncrana regarding the cost of acquisition and repair of houses at Maginn Avenue, Buncrana. I have received no evidence of unnecessary <Col N="1360" /> or wasteful expenditure from local funds on this project, which would warrant a special investigation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>First of all, I should like to give a history of these houses.  There are 26 houses concerned altogether and they were built 56 years ago.  The cost of erecting 11 of those houses was £50 each and the other 15 were erected at a cost of £75 each.  The urban district council purchased the houses for a sum of £70 apiece.  In that regard I do not agree with the Parliamentary Secretary's suggestion that there was dissatisfaction at the purchase price of the houses.  There was no such dissatisfaction. Nobody could be dissatisfied at the expending by the urban district council of £70 apiece on houses.</P>
    <P>The trouble did arise, however, when the urban district council carried out a programme of repairs to these houses.  I am not quite sure of the total sums expended on the repairs, but I do know that the amount of money was very high.  I also know that the same amount of repairs was not done to each house&mdash;there was more money spent on some houses than on others.  The tenants thought that as the amount of repairs done was small the amount of an increase in their rents would also be small, that it would be in relation to the sum expended per house.  It is also suggested that full value was not got for the amount of money that was put into these repairs.  I know of one case where a tenant ensured that as little as possible would be done to his house in the line of repairs; he went to the trouble of seeing to it that his own range and fire places were put in because he thought that would keep down the total cost of the repairs to his house.</P>
    <P>When the rents were being assessed they were in three categories and in one of these categories there was only a house or two, with the result that we had two classes of house and the total sum expended on repairs to these two classes was averaged over all, irrespective of whether the repairs had cost much or little.  The cost was evenly distributed over all the houses in these two classes.  One of the <Col N="1361" /> tenants whom I know can vouch for it that the sum expended was much more than what he reckoned it would be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Was he an engineer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but he is a tradesman who watched the work going on and who watched every item that went into the repairs of these houses. One does not have to be an engineer to arrive at the figure for the work and the materials when one knows the cost of these items.  That is our grievance and I am trying to get the Minister now to settle the responsibility for the wastage of money on these repairs. That is why I put down this question and that is why I went to the trouble of having it raised on the Adjournment. I want to see that the ratepayers of Buncrana are not saddled with a debt for the incurring of which they had no responsibility.</P>
      <P>The original rents of these houses were 2/- and 2/6 per week before these repairs were carried out.  The rents now, after the repairs, are 11/-, 14/-and 16/- a week despite the fact that a meeting which took place between the urban councillors, the county manager and representatives of the tenants decided to settle for what amounted to a reduction in rent of 4/-per house.  The nett result is that not alone have the tenants to pay rents which are out of all proportion to either the purchase price of the houses or the amount of money which properly should have been expended in repairing them, but the ratepayers are saddled with a burden which amounts to 8d. or 10d. in the £ because a job was badly done and money was spent which should not have been spent.</P>
      <P>Everybody in Buncrana, ratepayers, tenants and the general public, will tell you that this was a useless and wasteful spending of public money.  I am asking the Minister now to investigate this matter with a view to placing the blame wherever it should lie.  In the Local Government Act of 1953 a clause was inserted to deal with any cases of this kind that might arise.  I do not know whether that clause was inserted before this particular job was done.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>This clause in the 1953 Local Government Act prevents the tenants going into court and having a fair rent fixed in court.  Up to this they had been legally advised that they had a very good case and that they could have a fair rent decided.  Now they cannot.  They are prohibited from doing so.  I want the Minister to hold an investigation, to have the sums of money which were expended on each house looked into and to have assessed from the present appearance and structure of each house the sum that was likely to have covered that. He certainly will find a very big gap between the amount which is said to have been expended and the return given for that.  I think it is unfair that the same sum should be levied on houses the repair of which did not cost <Col N="1363" /> the same amount of money as the repair of other houses.</P>
      <P>This may not seem an important matter but there are 26 houses involved, 26 families.  If those thrifty people buy out these houses, which they are anxious to do, the sum they will have to pay is excessive.  It will be in accordance with the rents.  There would be no inducement to them to buy houses which cost the urban council originally £70 but which will now cost the tenants £700.</P>

      <P>It is but right that I should give the history of this housing scheme.  There were 26 houses at Maginn Avenue, Buncrana, and they were owned by a private individual. As Deputy Cunningham rightly stated, they were built a good many years ago. The rents were practically nominal, again as Deputy Cunningham says, amounting to 2/- to 2/6 per week.  Unfortunately, the landlord effected very little repairs to the houses down through the years and they had fallen into a very bad state of disrepair.</P>
      <P>Some time in 1948 a notice was served on the landlord, in accordance with Section 19 of the Act of 1931, requiring the landlord to carry out certain repairs to the houses.  The landlord refused to carry out the repairs. She said the rent was not an economic rent, that she could not carry out the repairs.  Here the council were faced with a dilemma.  They had no authority to carry out the repairs themselves.  The only thing they could do was to serve a demolition order and, if the houses were not pulled down, they could pull them down and charge the cost to the landlord, who did not reside in the locality&mdash;I say that subject to correction.</P>
      <P>If the council had served a demolition order and had pulled down the houses they would be faced with finding accommodation for the 26 tenants. In other words, they would have to build 26 houses at an approximate cost of £1,000 to £1,250 per house.</P>

    <P>I am a believer in democracy.  I am a believer in leaving it to the local authority to decide.  In December, 1948, the local authority decided that the best thing to do was to buy the houses at a nominal value from the <Col N="1364" /> landlord and to effect the repairs themselves. They sought permission from the then Minister to buy the houses at a nominal value of £70, I think it was, and they sought permission to put the houses into a fair state of repair.  This sanction which the local authority, the elected representatives of the people of Buncrana, sought, was gladly given and freely given to them by the then Minister for Local Government.  They proceeded to execute what they considered were the repairs necessary to put the houses into a proper state of repair.</P>
    <P>I am glad to know that Deputy Cunningham took no exception whatever to the purchase of the houses, and I agree with him.  It was a cheaper method than building new houses.</P>
    <P>The local authority proceeded to put the houses into what they considered was a reasonable state of repair.  Some person had to pay for the repair of the houses.  As the law stood at that time, the tenants' rental could not be increased.  No matter what repairs were carried out, the rent had to remain at 2/- to 2/6 per house and some person had to bear the cost of the repairs.</P>
    <P>My predecessor, Deputy Smith, introduced a Bill which became an Act which permitted the increase of the rents, thereby saving the ratepayers. As I said, that Bill went through this House.  The House did not divide on the particular section and it became law and the rents were then increased or proposals to increase them were made, bringing the rental up to a differential of 10/10 to 17/3 plus poor rates.</P>
    <P>In or about that time, Deputy Cunningham, who had the ear of Deputy Smith, then Minister for Local Government, supported the ratepayers in demanding then what he now demands from me.  Despite the fact that he was a yes-man for the Minister&mdash;he admitted himself a few moments ago that he voted for the section and the Bill without knowing what was in it, as he was a yes-man for the Minister&mdash; the Minister in his wisdom refused to listen to his pleas and refused him a public inquiry and refused an investigation, <Col N="1365" /> because we are believers, or rather I am, in democracy.</P>
    <P>I believe that if the local authority want to do a thing and if they are the freely elected representatives of the people, then they should be permitted to do it.  That is the reason why I introduced into the House the County Management (Amendment) Bill to enable local authorities to get away from the restrictive control of both managers and Ministers and to do what they want to do.</P>
    <P>I must say, in fairness to my predecessor, that he introduced a Bill in or about the same time giving to the local authorities some of the powers which I am now giving to them in the Bill before the House.  Despite that, Deputy Cunningham wants to have it hot and cold.  Whenever an action of the local authority hurts he holds up his hands and says: &ldquo;Minister, intervene and hold an investigation.&rdquo;  But as soon as the Minister intervenes in some cases he holds up his hands again and says: &ldquo;Keep out.  Why not leave it to the local authority?&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Yes, or frustration as it is usually called.  I am sorry for the unfortunate tenants.  I am sorry for the ratepayers but I would be more sorry were the ratepayers saddled with the cost of building 26 new houses at a cost of £1,000 or £1,200 apiece.  I would be very sorry indeed to see not only the local authority, but the State saddled with the building of new houses to house these unfortunate tenants.  Remember Buncrana is not a precedent.  The buying of old houses has been carried out in other towns, in Portlaw, in Waterford and in Gorey and carried out satisfactorily.</P>

      <P>Does he not know they were built by direct labour?  Does he blame the decent workmen?  He does.  He blames the decent workmen of Buncrana.  I am surprised because we have as fine workmen in Buncrana as there are in any other place in Ireland.  I am ashamed that Deputy Cunningham would come in here and blame the decent workmen of that place for doing an inefficient job.</P>

      <P>Is the Deputy a contributor to the <i>People's Press?</i>  I congratulate him.  It is the best read paper in Donegal.  Whom does the Deputy blame?  Remember your predecessor, the man whose ear you had, refused to inquire into this matter.  Do you blame these decent workmen?  The job was done by direct labour, there was no contract.  Do you blame the decent engineer who was in charge? I pose these questions to the Deputy, but he will not answer.  I am afraid I cannot go further.</P>
