      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. T. Lynch</b> asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that travel agents from London, Wales and North England are reported to be touring No. 4 <Col N="475" /> Limerick, Kerry and Cork escorted by officials of Bord Fáilte Éireann, and, if so, if he will recommend to the board that this party visits Wexford and Waterford, where the entry ports of Rosslare and Waterford are situated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>This tour, which ended on 11th March, 1955, was arranged by Fógra, Fáilte in discharge of its function of publicising Irish tourist attractions, and I do not intervene in detailed administration of this kind. I understand, however, that the board was not unmindful of the claims of Counties Waterford and Wexford, that those counties were included in a previous tour, and that it was the intention to consider them for inclusion in the itinerary of future tours where appropriate or feasible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the tour, in which Wexford and Waterford were included, took place about five years ago, that there have been four parties of travel agents in Ireland since, and that none of them came to Wexford, Waterford or Donegal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The details of the tour are a matter for Fógra Fáilte which is an autonomous body in matters of this kind, but I should like to point out to the Deputy that the primary consideration in a matter of this nature is the wishes of the visiting agents. If they express a wish to see a particular area, their wishes must, of course, be respected.  In this particular case, the majority of the agents expressed a definite desire to see Killarney, the Ring of Kerry and Blarney Castle, and, as a matter of courtesy, they were taken there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he has further considered the position of Irish Tanners, Limited, Portlaw, where workers are week by week being laid off in large numbers because of cessation in the production of heavy leather, and, if so, what steps he proposes to take to restore normal production in the factory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOrmonde" hpid="Mr. Ormonde Mr. Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will curtail the importation by our boot factories of substitute soling material, which is so largely the reason why Irish Tanners, Limited, Portlaw, are ceasing production of heavy leather and has resulted in the dismissal of large numbers of workers, or, alternatively, if he will consider the possibility of having the substitute material produced by Irish Tanners, Limited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 8 together.</P>
      <P>I have nothing to add to what I said on the 9th March, 1955, on the occasion of a question by the Deputy about the same tannery, except to say that I have decided to limit the quantities of substitute soling materials which will be admitted under duty-free licences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="477" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnOrmonde" hpid="Mr. Ormonde Mr. Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, on the occasion on which I put down the former question, said he was taking definite steps to protect the workers in Portlaw tannery.  Will he now state why, in view of the steps he states he has taken, these workers continue to be disemployed week by week?  Even up to last week quite a big number of them were laid off and is he aware that many of these workers, seeing no prospect of work at home, are making preparations to leave for England and that, unless the Minister's steps have immediate effect, these experienced workers will be lost to the tanning industry entirely?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have explained to the Deputy, as I explained to the workers and to the owners of the Portlaw tannery, that this is a problem which cannot be solved in any simple way. Portlaw tanneries have a 12 months' supply of leather in stock without making any additional leather.  That very fact would make it unnecessary to employ additional staff now even if there was an increased demand for leather.  That is No. 1.  No. 2: this particular industry has lost a substantial export trade.  No. 3: the public taste in footwear has changed.  As I explained on the last occasion, substitute soling material which represented about 14 per cent. of the soling in 1942 has increased to 37 per cent. at the current date.  All these difficulties have impacted on the tanneries as they have impacted on the tanneries in every other part of the world.  I am endeavouring to meet the situation as far as it is practicable to do so, namely, by a certain restriction on the importation of substitute soling material.  The quantity which I am letting in is the quantity which was agreed to by the tanners concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOrmonde" hpid="Mr. Ormonde Mr. Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister state if it is his belief that the provision of employment by the establishing of an industry in one area is justified if by so doing unemployment is created in a similar industry in another area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>What I believe is that the tanners ought to recognise the trend of public taste and they ought to adjust their selling organisation <Col N="478" /> and their manufacturing organisation accordingly.  There are other uses for this leather besides putting it on footwear. The tanners ought to recognise what tanners recognise elsewhere, namely, the desirability of finding alternative uses for leather material. I have pointed that fact out to the tanners and I hope they will take a leaf out of the books of their vocational associates in other countries where they have been able to find alternative uses for leather and an alteration in the type of leather manufactured in order to meet in these other countries the precise difficulties which are now confronting Irish tanners.</P>

      <P>The saving to the Exchequer resulting from an increase in the price of wheaten offals will depend on the length of time during which the higher price is maintained. <Col N="479" /> As the home production of wheaten offals is about 7,500 tons a month, a rise or fall of £1 a ton in offal prices involves a decrease or an increase of about £7,500 a month in the cost to the Exchequer of maintaining flour and bread prices at existing levels.</P>

      <P>On the best estimates available of the amounts to be paid for interest charges, storage rents and other expenses incidental to holding wheat in store, it is calculated that the total cost on the mill-floor of native wheat of the 1954 crop will be equivalent to an average cost of £40 16s. 0d. per ton.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state the statutory authority under which the E.S.B. is entitled to increase its charges under the rural electrification scheme consequent on the withdrawal of capital subsidy, and if the Government intends to introduce proposals for legislation to amend the Electricity <Col N="481" /> Supply Acts so as to limit the board's discretion in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 14, 15 and 16 together.</P>
      <P>The views of the E.S.B. were obtained and considered before it was decided that the subsidy from the Exchequer towards the cost of rural electrification should be discontinued. I do not consider it to be desirable that the views of the board on this matter should be announced.  I am of opinion, having regard to the financial resources of the board generally, that the full cost of the rural electrification scheme should be met from the funds of the board and that it will not be necessary either to curtail the programme of development or to increase the charges made to consumers under the scheme.</P>
      <P>The statutory authority under which the board is empowered to fix charges is Section 59 of the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1927.  It is not proposed to amend the statutory provisions in relation to the fixing of charges by the E.S.B.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that there would be no justification whatever on the part of the board either in increasing the charges or slowing down the rate of development because of the fact that they are now required to bear the State portion of the rural electrification charges.  Their funds and prosperous financial position will enable them to do that without the slightest difficulty and without in any way necessitating an increase in the charge or slowing down the rate of development. If at any stage the board endeavours to increase charges or slow down the rate of development that will be an entirely new situation and it will be dealt with.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state (a)  the total of the capital grants made to date from the Exchequer to the E.S.B. for the rural electrification scheme, (b) whether the Government intends that the board should now repay these grants to the Exchequer, and, if not, if he will explain the exact effect of the proposal to make no provision in this year's Estimate for the repayment of advances for rural electrification, and (c) whether legislation is considered to be required to legalise the proposed arrangements.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 17 and 18 together.</P>
      <P>Under Section 41 of the Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Act, 1945, half of the moneys advanced to the board from the Central Fund for rural electrification is repayable to the Central Fund from the Vote for Industry and Commerce.  The total amount of capital advanced from the Central Fund for rural electrification to date is £13,600,000.  The E.S.B. was, hitherto, liable for the repayment of half of this sum, while the other half was repayable from voted moneys.  Taking into account payments already made from voted moneys, the additional capital liability which the board will assume in respect of the latter half of the advances is £4,825,600.  The annual interest and amortisation charge on this amount is £245,263 16s. 6d.  I am not in a position to state what the final capital cost of rural electrification will be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The exact effect of the proposal to terminate rural electrification subsidy is to make the board liable for the full charges on capital for rural electrification except on capital which has already been repaid to the Central Fund from voted moneys.  Amending legislation will be required to give <Col N="483" /> effect to this proposal and such legislation is in course of preparation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In effect, therefore, the E.S.B. is now being required to repay to the Exchequer the amounts already given to it by way of free grant for the rural electrification scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The E.S.B. will be required in future to meet the full cost of rural electrification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not asking about the future but I am asking what is the position regarding the free grants already made?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I will explain to the Deputy.  The E.S.B. was hitherto liable for the repayment of half this sum while the other half was repayable from voted moneys.  Taking into account payments already made from voted moneys, the additional capital liability which the board will assume in respect of the latter half of the advances is £4,800,000 odd.  The board will not be liable in respect of advances already made where the State has already paid half the cost; but, for the future, the board will be liable and there should be no difficulty in their meeting that liability in view of their prosperous financial position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I put this question down to the Minister for Finance and it has been transferred to the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  There is no provision in the Estimate for this year for the payment of the annuity, which represents the repayment to the Exchequer of the amount of voted moneys advanced to the E.S.B.  From what source will the Exchequer get repaid the advances made if it is not from the E.S.B. and not from voted money?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I assumed the Deputy's question was related to the future liability of the E.S.B. in respect of rural electrification advances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is more than that.  May I put the question again? Money was advanced to the E.S.B. to meet half the capital cost of the rural <Col N="484" /> electrification scheme.  That money was repaid to the Exchequer by way of an annuity voted each year by the Dáil when the Estimates were being passed.  There is no provision for any annuity this year and that means that the Exchequer will not be repaid out of voted moneys in respect of moneys already advanced.  From what source will the Exchequer be recouped if not from the E.S.B.?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not understand that to be the direction of the Deputy's question but, if he wishes to repeat the question, I will endeavour to have that information procured for him or, if he so wishes, I will send the information to him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>In each of the last six years during which the Deputy sat in <Col N="485" /> Kildare Street as Minister for Industry and Commerce the E.S.B. yielded a surplus, as it yielded a surplus last year and as, I have no doubt, it will continue to yield in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am worried about is that I got from the E.S.B. an assurance in writing that increased charges which I sanctioned in 1953 would not produce a revenue surplus. Either I was misled or their calculations were wrong.  The question that arises now is: Will this revenue surplus be given back to the people who created it, the electricity consumers, or be put to relieving an Exchequer liability?  However, we will discuss it all later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Deputy not agree that with urban and metropolitan electrification developed to such an extent and rural electrification proceeding at its present rate, we have now reached a stage in which the taxpayer is no different from the E.S.B. because one is now virtually the same as the other, and in which the moneys paid by the State to the E.S.B. will have to come from the electricity consumer because he is now virtually identical with the taxpayer, and it does not matter which pocket one takes the money out of?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that there is an agreement with the E.S.B. under which they undertake to sell electricity to rural consumers at less than its economic cost?  The Government has unilaterally broken that agreement by leaving the E.S.B. free to take whatever action they think fit.</P>

      <Col N="491" /> Owing to the shortage of qualified teachers it has been necessary in addition to accept temporarily the services of a number of persons who do not possess the qualification as teachers prescribed by the rules, and who are replaced by qualified teachers according as these latter become available. It is made clear, however, in all these cases that the unqualified persons are being accepted for only a limited period and that no claim to recognition as teacher is involved in such acceptance. In the circumstances, these persons cannot be regarded as having been appointed as primary teachers.</P>

    <P>I am having the question of the temporary arrangements for carrying on the work of the school pending completion of the proposed scheme of enlargement and improvement examined in the light of the fact that the Conna Parish Guild of Muintir na Tíre has given notice to the reverend manager that the guild's hall at Conna will not be available for use as a classroom after the coming summer school term.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education whether, in view of the fact that the preparatory colleges examination and the Donegal County Council scholarship examination are held on the same dates and that, as a result, students eligible to sit for both examinations must forgo one or the other, he will arrange to have these examinations held on different dates in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The county council scholarships examination is based on the programme of Standard VI in <Col N="494" /> national schools and the upper age limit for competitors thereat is 14 years on the 1st August of the year of the examination.  The preparatory college entrance examination is based on the programme of Standard VII and the upper age limit for competitors is 15 years on the 1st August.  It would not be warranted, for administrative and financial reasons, to hold these examinations at different periods of the year, but as even in present circumstances it is open to a candidate to compete at both examinations in successive years I am satisfied that the existing arrangements are in themselves reasonable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not take into consideration the fact that competing in successive years at these two examinations may mean pupils will have to stay an extra year in the national school to bring them up to the 15-year limit, and surely that is a consideration worth bearing in mind in deciding this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy probably has an idea of the arrangements that have to be made for the holding of these examinations and to duplicate those would involve considerable administrative difficulty both for the schools and the Department, not to talk of the doubling&mdash;at least&mdash;of the cost of holding the examinations for a very, very small number of cases, and the reasonableness of doing anything like that seems to me to be very questionable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that were it possible for the children to do both examinations in the same year, is it not likely that there would be very many more doing them? Since it is impossible at the moment, <Col N="495" /> surely it is not an argument to say there would be very few cases?</P>

      <P>In relation to the importance of the examination in question, and particularly to the importance of the preparatory colleges examination, I would not like to encourage more two-way attempts on these examinations.  I think the purposes of these examinations are very specific and very difinite and the programmes and age limits are selected very definitely for that.  I do not see at the present moment any particular reason why, to convenience a few pupils or a few teachers who would like to spread their net a little bit wider, a very, very complicated scheme which would be administratively very difficult and onerous and also fairly costly should be evolved or why there should be a doubling-up of difficulties to meet what I think must be a very small problem, if it is a problem at all.</P>

      <P>That would entail a great deal of the time of Land Commission inspectors and a certain amount of expense.  A survey such as the Deputy has in mind may not reveal a true picture, for this reason, that the Land Commission have instructions to proceed first with the places where congestion is worst.  It very often happens that a particular townland which is congested at the moment may not be congested in two or three years' time because some of the tenants there may have purchased land that was for sale in the locality and, if I may use the expression, thus relieved their own congestion.</P>

The nearest offer to Carrigart is 159 acres, 80 acres of which lie near Mulroy House.  In Downings, there was no offer.

The Land Commission really are the owners of these hills at the moment.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The usual procedure of a survey for the establishment of a forestry centre is that an inspector <Col N="503" /> inspects the area first, having ascertained from the local tenants whether they are willing to sell.  If they are so willing they are supplied with a form in which they offer the land, state where it is and give a rough estimate of the price they expect.  I take it the tenants in this particular instance got the application forms in the usual way, but that they failed to complete or return them, and, of course, we took that as an indication that the tenants were not willing to sell.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Cosgrave)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the Agreement on North Atlantic Ocean Stations, signed at Paris on 25th February, 1954, a copy of which was laid on the Table of Dáil Éireann on the 2nd March, 1955.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The agreement referred to in the resolution was drawn up at a conference held in Paris in February/March, 1954, under the auspices of the International Civil Aviation Organisation. The ocean stations scheme was established by an international agreement signed in 1946 and was continued in a modified form under an agreement signed in 1949.  Ireland was a party to both agreements, contributing £5,000 <Col N="513" /> a year under the 1946 agreement and £1,000 a year under that of 1949.  Invitations to attend the conference were issued to the Governments of Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Iceland, Ireland, The Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Sweden, Great Britain, United States of America, Columbia, Cuba, Israel, Italy, Mexico, Spain, Switzerland and Venezuela.  The first 12 of these were parties to the 1949 agreement; the other eight, although not parties to the agreement, were at the moment or had been at some time during the currency of the agreement operating air services over the North Atlantic.  Of the 20 States Ireland and Portugal were the only two that had not at any time operated such air services. Portugal, like Ireland, contributed £1,000 a year under the 1949 agreement, but the Portuguese Government had announced their intention of discontinuing this payment.  All the States invited sent delegates to the conference with the following exceptions: Portugal, Columbia, Cuba, Mexico and Venezuela.  Venezuela sent an observer and in addition there were observers from a number of interested international organisations.</P>
    <P>Aviation and meteorological experts agree that the establishment of ocean stations in the North Atlantic has been a notable advance in the development of international civil aviation in that area.  The meteorological data which they provide make possible improved meteorological forecasts which in turn are of great value for air services. The stations also provide known points to which the captain of an aircraft threatened with a forced landing can direct its flight.  One of these ships was responsible for the rescue of the passengers and crew of the <i>Bermuda Sky Queen</i> which had to land on the ocean in October, 1947.  A report from Great Britain to I.C.A.O. lists 17 cases during the first half of 1954 in which overdue aircraft that had lost communication with shore stations were located through communication with the station vessels.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus derives benefit from the ocean stations in relation to its services. Inaccurate weather forecasts for airports lead to last minute postponements, cancellations, diversions or <Col N="514" /> returns whilst en route.  These disruptions of operations lead to appreciable loss of revenue.  The regular and prompt receipt of weather data from these ships permits a higher degree of accuracy in forecasts and thereby facilitates Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>The 1949 agreement made provision for the operation of ten ocean stations. The number of ships necessary to maintain a station varies from two-three depending upon the distance to be travelled to base, the speed of the vessels, and other factors.  The new agreement provides for the operation of nine stations; the station removed in the change being that located between Bermuda and U.S.A.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Norton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £250,000 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1955, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, including certain Services administered by that Office, and for payment of certain Subsidies and sundry Grants-in-Aid.</P>
      <P>This Supplementary Estimate is required to meet the increased costs of the flour and wheatenmeal subsidy, £372,000, and additional grants to Mianraí Teoranta for exploration work at Avoca, £15,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the flour and wheatenmeal subsidy is to enable the millers to sell flour and wheatenmeal at controlled prices.  In calculating the subsidy account is taken of receipts by the millers from sales of flour and <Col N="515" /> wheatenmeal at these fixed prices and also of receipts from sales of wheaten offals which vary from time to time in accordance with changes in import prices.</P>
    <P>It was originally calculated that the reduction in flour and bread prices as from the 1st May, 1954, would add approximately £900,000 to the bill for subsidy for the financial year 1954-55. In actual fact, the reduction will cost £927,000 against which, however, can be offset items amounting to about £555,000, leaving a balance of £372,000 to be provided for under this sub-head.</P>
    <P>The chief offsetting items, of which I shall give details in a moment, are:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  increased receipts by flour millers from sales of wheaten offals over and above the amount originally estimated;</P>
    <P>(b)  savings accruing from changes in the millers' grist; and,</P>
    <P>(c)  the fact that milling costs proved to be lower than was thought when the original Estimate was prepared.</P>
    <P>Increases in the price of offals, from £20 to £23 per ton in September, 1954, to £24 10s. in December, 1954, and to £26 a ton in January, 1955, account for increased receipts by millers of approximately £170,000.  These increases followed similar increases in the prices of imported offals reflecting changes in the world price.  The changes in millers' grists, whereby more imported wheat than anticipated was used at various times during the financial year, account for savings of £260,000, because imported wheat costs less than native wheat.  The third item, namely, the reduction in millers' costs, accounts for a further sum of about £120,000.  In addition, a small item of £6,000 provided in the original Estimate to remunerate services to be rendered by the importer-distributors of wheat, will not now fall for payment in the financial year 1954-55.</P>
    <P>The net result of the changes affecting subsidy in the course of the financial year 1954-55 is, therefore, to increase the cost of maintaining flour <Col N="516" /> and bread at their present prices, from £7,681,000 to £8,053,000, an increase of £372,000.</P>
    <P>For some years past Mianraí, Teoranta have been conducting a scheme of exploration on minerals deposits at Avoca, County Wicklow. The aim of the scheme was to establish the existence at Avoca of sufficient quantities of copper ore of a grade suitable for commercial development. This aim has now been achieved and negotiations are at present going on with a number of mining concerns to see whether they will be interested in undertaking the development of the deposits.  It is too soon to say, at this stage, whether satisfactory arrangements can be made for development by a commercial concern but preliminary proposals have been received from one company of international repute.  It has been decided to continue exploratory work at Avoca on the present scale until 30th June, 1955.  It may be possible to make arrangements to have the deposits exploited commercially by that date, but, if not, the exploratory work will cease and the mine will be put on a care and maintenance basis.</P>
    <P>When the original Estimate of £74,000 for grants to Mianraí, Teoranta, was being prepared it was visualised that the exploratory work would proceed on a decreasing scale and with a diminishing labour force during 1954-55. Furthermore, Mianraí, Teoranta had arranged that most of the exploratory work during 1954-55 should be by means of diamond drilling from the surface.  This is a cheaper method of exploration than underground work. However, due to technical difficulties the company had to undertake more underground exploration than they had planned for, and there was no substantial reduction in the labour force during the year.  As a result Mianraí, Teoranta had, by 31st December, 1954, incurred commitments for expenditure up to the voted limit of £74,000 and a further £15,000 is required to cover the cost of work between 1st January, 1955, and 31st March, 1955.</P>
    <P>The gross total of the Supplementary Estimate for the two services is, therefor, £387,000.  Savings amounting to £137,000 are available on other subheads <Col N="517" /> of the Vote so that the net sum required is £250,000.</P>

      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1955, for certain Transport Services; for Grants for Harbours; for the Salaries and Expenses of the Marine Service (Merchant Shipping Acts, 1894 to 1952, and the Foreshore Act, 1933 (No. 12 of 1933)); for certain protective Equipment for Ships; for certain payments in respect of Compensation, including the cost of medical treatment (No. 19 of 1946); and for the Coast Life Saving Service.</P>
      <P>The original Estimate of £350,000 provided only for payments to the G.N.R. Board towards operating losses and revenue charges and did not include any provision towards capital expenditure. No proposals for such expenditure had been made by the board when the Estimate was prepared.  Capital expenditure has, however, been incurred by the board on such items as additional omnibuses and lorries and special cement wagons, as well as on the capital content of the board's renewal and replacement work.</P>
      <P>Section 33 of the Great Northern Railways Act, 1953, provides for advances to the board for capital purposes. The agreement scheduled to the Act provides that capital expenditure on rolling stock and on the Dundalk works is met equally by the State and by the Ministry of Commerce, Belfast. Capital expenditure on other assets provided in each area is met in full by that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The State's share of the board's capital expenditure from 1st September, 1953, to the 31st March, 1955, is estimated at £258,000 and a Supplementary Estimate is required to authorise the payment of this sum. Expenditure on operating losses and revenue charges is estimated at <Col N="518" /> £183,000.  The additional expenditure of £285,000 brings the total charge against sub-head A (3) to £441,000, and will cause an excess of £91,000 on the original provision of £350,000.  The excess can be met from savings on sub-head A (2) (C.I.E.) so that only a token Vote for £10 is required.  The ambit of the sub-head has been expanded in the Supplementary Estimate to cover payments for capital purposes.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £5,371,560 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1956, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, including certain Services administered by that Office, and for payment of certain Subsidies and sundry Grants-in-Aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In considering the Estimate for the Department of Industry and Commerce for 1955-56, Deputies will have regard to the Supplementary Estimate for 1954-55 amounting to £250,000 which was issued after the Estimates volume for 1955-56 had been printed.  The Estimate for 1955-56 thus shows a reduction of £1,182,680 as compared with the total Estimate for 1954-55.  The principal decreases in the Estimate are in the provisions under sub-head J (1) for food subsidies, sub-head L (1), mineral prospecting and sub-head M (2), grants to Bord na Móna for housing.  A sum of £84,650 was provided in 1954-55 for the repayment of advances for rural electrification.  For reasons which I <Col N="519" /> will explain later, no provision is being made for this item this year.</P>
    <P>Taking into account the Supplementary Estimate for 1954-55, the reduction in the food subsidies for the year 1955-56 amounts to £1,053,000.  As explained by the Minister for Finance, when presenting the Vote on Account for 1955-56, the decrease in the food subsidies arises from the reduced prices for home-grown wheat which have been fixed by the Government.  Notwithstanding the reduction in the price the amount per ton paid for Irish wheat is in excess of the price at which foreign wheat can be imported.  Another factor contributing to the reduction is that it is anticipated that the flour millers will obtain increased receipts from the sales of flour offals.</P>
    <P>When speaking on the Supplementary Estimate I explained the position which has been reached concerning the exploratory work by Mianraí Teoranta at Avoca.  The total provision for grants to Mianraí Teoranta in the year 1954-55, including the Supplementary Estimate, amounted to £89,000.  The provision for 1955-56 is £40,000 representing a reduction of £49,000.  The 1955-56 provision takes account of the fact that exploratory work on the present scale will continue only until 30th June, 1955.  I have already referred to the possibility of arranging for the commercial exploitation of the deposits by that date.</P>
    <P>Allowing for the Supplementary Estimate, there is a reduction of £39,410 on sub-head M (2)&mdash;Grants for housing erected by Bord na Móna. This reduction is due to the fact that the schemes undertaken by Bord na Móna for the erection of a number of houses for workers on the bogs are nearing completion.  The amount of £11,400 provided in 1955-56 is estimated to be sufficient to pay all commitments which will be likely to arise during the year on these schemes.</P>
    <P>Having dealt with the main features of the Estimate for the Department of Industry and Commerce I propose to give a general review of the operations of my Department.  As regards industrial development, Deputies may be <Col N="520" /> interested to learn that, during the last year, 82 firms came to notice as having begun business or as having extended their production into one or more new lines.  The number of new industrial approaches made during the same period was about 240.  The total number of industrial proposals at present before the Department and the Industrial Development Authority is about 215.  These proposals cover a wide range of industries and are at present in varying stages of consideration and examination.  Some of them have reached an advanced stage and may reasonably be expected at an early date to result in the setting up of new factories or the extension of existing factories.</P>
    <P>One of the more important industrial developments to which I wish to make reference is the recent development in regard to the setting up of an oil refinery.  This is a matter which has engaged the attention of the Government for many years.  Some years ago the Industrial Development Authority were asked to investigate the possibility of having a refinery established here.  Within the last couple of months the authority have reported that the three major distributing companies, Caltex, Esso and Shell, had agreed to form a company for the erection and operation of a jointly owned refinery. Detailed proposals from the companies are now awaited.</P>
    <P>Petroleum products are our largest single imports item, imports in 1954 being almost 241,000,000 gallons of oils and spirits at a value of over £12,500,000 and over 600,000 tons of other items, such as tar and bitumen mixture, at a value of over £900,000. It is not expected, however, that every one of the imported commodities will be produced by the new refinery&mdash; aviation spirit is one that may not, for instance&mdash;but we may expect that the bulk of them will be produced.</P>
    <P>The advantages to the country of an oil refinery are many.  Firstly, this is practically the only country in Western Europe without its own refinery and we are, I think, entitled to have one established from the point of view of national prestige alone.  Apart from this, however, it would be bound to be <Col N="521" /> of value in time of war, since we would be relieved of our dependence on the refined product&mdash;a vital commodity&mdash; which, at such a time, would obviously be more difficult to obtain than crude supplies.</P>
    <P>It will create considerable employment both in the erection of the plant and later in its operation; it should also provide openings for a number of science and engineering graduates.  It should provide the nucleus for the development of chemical technology and might, possibly, provide the basis for a small petro-chemical industry, or the manufacture of other specialised products.  It should lead to the establishment of an Irish tanker fleet and it would certainly be of considerable benefit in our balance of payment.</P>
    <P>Representations have been made from many quarters regarding the suitability of particular locations for the refinery, but I have refrained from making approaches to the companies in this regard as I consider that the matter of location is primarily one for the parties who are putting up the capital, particularly in view of the technical complexities involved in the erection and operation of an oil refinery.  When matters have reached a more advanced stage I hope to make a further announcement.</P>
    <P>Apart from the proposed establishment of an oil refinery in the country and other projects which are under consideration, industrial progress still continues.  A few official figures will illustrate the progress that has been made in recent years.  In the year 1938 the census of industrial production showed a net output of £35,500,000 in all industries and services and a total employment of 166,000 persons.  Net output increased to £75,000,000 in 1948, £84,000,000 in 1949, £93,000,000 in 1950, £101,000,000 in 1951 and £106,000,000 in 1952; employment was 197,000 in 1948, 206,000 in 1949, 219,000 in 1950, 226,000 in 1951 and 221,000 in 1952.  The census of production figures for the years 1953 and 1954 are not yet available but the provisional figures of the numbers engaged in industry and services amounted to 224,000 in 1953 and 228,000 in 1954.  The net output of <Col N="522" /> industries engaged in the manufacture of transportable goods was £25,000,000 in 1938, £53,000,000 in 1948, £60,000,000 in 1949, £67,000,000 in 1950, £73,000,000 in 1951, £76,000,000 in 1952, an estimated £84,000,000 in 1953 and an estimated £86,000,000 in 1954.</P>
    <P>The number employed in these industries during the same period was 100,000 in 1938, 123,000 in 1948, 129,000 in 1949, 137,000 in 1950, 144,000 in 1951, 140,000 in 1952, an estimated 142,000 in 1953, and an estimated figure of 147,000 in 1954.  The numbers employed in each quarter of 1954 were 144,000 in March quarter, 147,000 persons in June quarter, 148,000 persons in September quarter, and 150,000 persons in December quarter.  Allowing for the changes in the value of money, the index figure of the volume of production in industries producing transportable goods increased from 99 in 1938 to 131 in 1948, 174 in 1951, and to an estimated figure of 192 in 1954.  Taking all industries and services together, the corresponding figures are 105 in 1938, 134 in 1948, 176 in 1951, and 194 in 1954.  These figures are most encouraging but it is my hope that figures for the years to come will show still better results.  We must rely to a large extent on industrial progress to help to reduce the amount of unemployment in the country. I must, however, sound a note of warning that, in many industries, we have reached the position that home production is sufficient to meet the full requirements of the home market.  In those industries further development can only come if an export trade is developed.</P>
    <P>I feel confident that, given the necessary zeal, drive and enthusiasm, we can export successfully.  In view of the highly competitive conditions which obtain, however, it is essential that firms anxious to get an export market should ensure that their productive organisation is highly efficient.  One of the most satisfactory methods to ensure this is the engagement of experts in the particular industry to make a detailed study of production techniques, lay-out, etc.  If the industry finds itself unable to meet the total cost of such expert advice, the State <Col N="523" /> will be prepared to give assistance in paying for suitable technical assistance projects.</P>
    <P>I desire to take this opportunity of bringing to the notice of industrialists the facilities that are available.  Under the agreement between this country and the Government of the United States, in connection with the Counterpart Fund deposited by this country under the Marshall Aid programme, a sum of £350,000 has been set aside for the financing of schemes of technical assistance for industry and agriculture.</P>
    <P>A technical assistance project should, as far as possible, cover a whole industry so that all the firms in that industry may be in a position to benefit from the advice received.  This would enable them to take steps to remove any defects in their organisation which may be revealed by expert examination. I would appeal particularly to associations of manufacturers to give serious consideration to the formulation of technical assistance projects for the industries which they represent.  I address this appeal not only to associations representing industries interested in the export trade, but also to associations representing industries which are still concerned chiefly with production for the home market.</P>
    <P>While technical assistance projects in which industry-wide participation is not proposed, may be considered, such projects will normally be considered only where the remaining firms in the industry have failed to show any interest in such a project.  It is hoped, however, that such cases will be exceptional and that every firm in a particular industry for which a technical assistance project may be planned will be alive to the importance of participating in it.</P>
    <P>Apart from the function of general industrial development by my Department, special provision has been made by the Oireachtas to encourage the establishment of industries in the undeveloped areas.  This provision was made under the Undeveloped Areas Act 1952, which established An Foras Tionscal with power to give grants to <Col N="524" /> persons for the purpose of establishing industry in these areas.  Grants approved by An Foras Tionscal to date in the current financial year amount to £232,000.  This brings the total grants approved so far under the Act to £496,000.  The projects for which these grants have been approved represent a total capital investment in industrial project of approximately £1,500,000. Some time necessarily elapses between the approval of grants and their payment, as it is the practice of An Foras Tionscal to make payment only when the factories have been almost completed. For this reason, payments to date by the body amount to only £109,000.</P>
    <P>Projects assisted by An Foras Tionscal which are already in production include woollen yarns, berets, garment labels, clay drain pipes, electrical plugs and sockets, clay tiles, buttons, knitwear and leather gloves. Other projects, covering a fairly wide field of manufacturing activity, are in various stages of development and there continues to be a steady flow of inquiries to An Foras Tionscal, which indicates that there is likely to be continuing progress in the development of industrial activities in the undeveloped areas.  The progress made to date has not been spectacular, but it must be remembered that the problem of securing industries in the undeveloped areas had previously been intractable.  Consequently, the progress made must be regarded as satisfactory in all the circumstances.</P>
    <P>In addition to the special assistance available for undeveloped areas, industrialists all over the country can avail of assistance from the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Acts.  These Acts enable firms to obtain loans, the repayment of which is guaranteed by the State.  During the year, the demand by industrialists for assistance under these Acts to enable them to expand their output continued to grow and it was necessary to provide by legislation for a further £1,000,000 for trade loans.  I do not propose to deal at length with this aspect as there was a very full discussion on the matter when the recent Trade Loans Act was under consideration by the Dáil.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="525" /> During the year, a particular group of manufacturers were concerned at the prospect that imports of low-priced articles from Far Eastern countries would damage their industry.  I informed them that it was my intention to provide adequate protection for Irish industry against unfair competition in the form of low-priced goods from Far Eastern countries.  I should like to make it clear that, if it is established that any Irish industry is threatened by imports of this kind, I will be prepared to recommend to the Government that adequate measures be taken to protect Irish investment and employment.  I think it is only fair to warn importers handling these goods that, if it is necessary to introduce special protective measures, import facilities will not be granted for such goods, whether or not the orders placed by them have been backed by letters of credit or otherwise.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the industrial progress which has been made, there are certain fields of manufacture in which we still have to depend entirely on imports.  In order to have many of these items manufactured at home, considerable investment of capital and particular technical skills would be required.  I have already referred in public statements to the need for attracting investment of foreign capital and more especially technical skills in Irish industrial enterprises so as to expand industrial production into these fields.  Subject to national safeguards, however, it is, in my view, essential that the investment of foreign capital and technical competence in our economy should be given more active encouragement than was considered necessary in the past when opportunities for industrial expansion were more readily available.</P>
    <P>This country has very special advantages to offer to the external investor. Our geographical situation is favourable for easy access to markets in Britain and on the Continent and we have trade agreements with most European countries.  Goods of Irish origin are, in most cases, exempt from customs duties on entry into Britain and they receive preferential tariff treatment in British Commonwealth <Col N="526" /> countries.  I am making arrangements to have these and other obvious advantages brought directly to the notice of manufacturing interests in the United States and in European countries.</P>
    <P>I have had discussions with the Industrial Development Authority on the question of visiting countries abroad to discuss the possibility of interesting foreign industrialists in establishing industries in this country. At the moment, two members of the authority are visiting Sweden for this purpose, and arrangements are being made for a similar visit to Western Germany in the near future.  It is expected that other European countries will be visited later on, and the question of a visit to the United States of America has been the subject of consideration and discussion.</P>
    <P>Production of industrial alcohol by Ceimicí Teoranta is being continued at the Cooley and Carndonagh factories and the former alcohol factories at Labbadish and Corroy are being converted for liquid glucose production, which is expected to commence during the coming summer.  Efforts to find an alternative use for the Carrickmacross factory have not so far been successful. Ceimicí Teoranta have completed their investigation of the possibilities of establishing an industry for the production of nitrogenous fertiliser and their report is being examined by the various Government Departments concerned.</P>
    <P>In addition to industrial development, every effort will be made to discover minerals which are capable of commercial development.  A technical assistance project for minerals exploration has been in operation for some time past.  This project is intended to cover three mineralised areas in the country, and exploration has already been completed in two of these.  One of the areas was Abbeytown, County Sligo, where there are State-owned deposits of lead and zinc. A drilling programme on these deposits had satisfactory results which enabled the operating company to undertake a development programme to exploit the further deposits which were discovered. The second area was Murvey, County Galway, where there are State-owned <Col N="527" /> deposits of molybdenite; the material is the principal source of the metal molybdenum which is used in the manufacture of high-speed tool steel.  The drilling programme carried out at Murvey failed to establish the existence of the minimum quantity of ore of a grade which would be suitable for commercial development.  However, traces of molybdenite have also been found in an area adjacent to Murvey and a preliminary examination is being undertaken in this area to determine whether a drilling programme there would be justified.</P>
    <P>A final decision has not yet been taken as to the third and final area to be selected for investigation under this technical assistance project.  It had been hoped to start exploration work during the year, but this did not prove possible.  I hope, however, that it will be possible to start exploration work at an early date.</P>
    <P>In pursuing industrial progress, we must be careful to ensure that the interests of the workers are not neglected.  For this purpose, there is at present before the Dáil a long overdue Bill to codify and extend the Factories and Workshops Acts.  The object of the new legislation is to bring the protection provisions of the law more into line with modern thinking on this vital subject.  It is scarcely necessary for me to make any further reference to this point; it was discussed at some length during the debates on the Bill, and doubtless will come up for discussion again during the stages of the Bill which yet remain to be taken.</P>
    <P>Deputies will remember that during the Second Reading of this Bill, I undertook to examine the possibility of providing similar protection for workers in offices.  Office workers are the only large class now left unprotected by law.  Shop workers enjoy the protection of the Shops (Conditions of Employment) Act, and it may be that our first step towards putting an end to the kind of working conditions that some office workers have now to endure will be a simple extension to offices of the provisions of the Shops <Col N="528" /> Act or of provisions of the same general kind.</P>
    <P>The subject, however, will require extensive examination, and, although a good deal of work has been done, I would not like to give a definite date for the introduction of legislation.  In the interval between now and the enactment of the legislation associations of employers and associations of workers can do much to put an end to the abuses with which the legislation will deal and I hope that they will do so.  It should, I think, be the aim not only of associations of workers but of associations of employers as well to secure that in every place where people are employed, whether in factories, in shops or in offices, working conditions are as healthy and comfortable as they can be made.  It does not cost much to keep an office clean, to keep it resonably warm and properly ventilated or to provide washing facilities for the staff, and it is a reflection on the outlook and attitude of those responsible that legislation should be needed to secure that these things are done.</P>
    <P>The reforms which are necessary should be introduced in advance of the legislation, and if, during the next two or three months, the different associations in which employers are organised give a little attention to the subject of accommodation for office workers, it may be that, when the legislative proposals are brought before the Dáil, many of the associations will be able to say that the proposals are not coercive in effect since the standards obtaining in offices are at least as high as the minimum standards which it is proposed to prescribe by legislation.</P>
    <P>A full delegation, representative of the Government, employers and workers in this country attended the International Labour Conference which was held in Geneva, in June, 1954, under the auspices of the International Labour Organisation.  The conference approved a recommendation on holidays with pay for industrial and commercial workers generally.  The principal feature of the recommendation was a proposal for a minimum annual paid holiday of a fortnight for these <Col N="529" /> workers.  These provisions are being examined in my Department in conjunction with other proposals for the amendment of the Holidays Act, 1939, made to my Department by representatives of workers.</P>
    <P>The European Regional Conference of the International Labour Office was held in January, 1955, and Ireland was again represented by a full delegation. The problems discussed at this conference were the role of workers and employers in programmes to raise productivity in Europe, the age of retirement, and the financing of social security.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the protection which is given by the State to industrial enterprise, it is obviously necessary that there should also be an effective system for controlling the prices and the profits of those enterprises so as to ensure that the consuming public gets a fair deal.  There was a full discussion on prices and the cost of living during the recent debate on the Supplies and Services Act, and I do not, therefore, think it is necessary again to refer to the subject at this stage.</P>
    <P>With some fluctuations, world prices show a slight tendency to harden since the end of 1953.  The import price index for December, 1954, was 289.9 as compared with 286.3 for December, 1953.  The internal wholesale price index, however, shows a decline over the same period, the average for 1954 being 293.6 compared with 299.1 for 1953.</P>
    <P>During the year 1954 the Prices Advisory Body held 41 private meetings and eight public sittings.  I am satisfied that the Prices Advisory Body performs a very useful and, indeed, essential function, by turning the searchlight of publicity on the reasons for suggested price increases.  As I have already indicated, it is my intention to introduce permanent legislation for the control of prices as soon as possible.  I have not yet arrived at final conclusions as to the nature and extent of the improvements which it would be desirable to make in the existing machinery of price control.</P>
    <P>The work of the Fair Trade Commision is complementary to the work of <Col N="530" /> the Prices Advisory Body.  I feel that the House will agree that the Fair Trade Commission has done very useful work in the short time since it was established.  It has turned the spotlight on the question of restrictive practices and has also intervened in individual cases, as a result of which traders who had previously been excluded from regular channels of supply are now receiving supplies.  The commission has completed its public inquiries in relation to the supply and distribution of radio sets, building materials and motor cars.  I have received reports of the inquiries relating to radio sets and building materials.  I hope to present these reports to the Oireachtas and to have them published at an early date.</P>
    <P>A fourth inquiry into the supply and distribution of proprietary and patent medicines, infant foods and medical and toilet preparations, has also been initiated by the commission, but has not yet been completed.</P>
    <P>The commission recently announced its intention to hold an inquiry into the supply and distribution of grocery goods and provisions.  The commission has also made fair trading rules in relation to a number of commodities or groups of commodities.</P>
    <P>The work in progress on the development programme of Bord na Móna has been well maintained.  Despite the very adverse weather conditions which we experienced in the 1954 season, the board's output of turf amounted to about 600,000 tons.  The board's development programmes are coordinated with the plans of the E.S.B. for increased electricity generating capacity based on native resources. Two power stations (one at Clonsast and one at Allenwood) are already in full operation on sod peat.  The first of the bog power stations at Ferbane, Offaly, designed to burn milled peat, is due to come into operation this year. Several more are planned in the major bog areas which were once derelict wastes.  By the year 1960 Bord na Móna expects that its total annual output of sod peat will be about 920,000 tons, while output of milled peat will be over 2,800,000.  Five hundred and <Col N="531" /> eighty thousand tons of the sod peat will be used in the electricity generating stations and the remaining 340,000 tons will be available for industrial and domestic consumers. With the exception of 130,000 tons which will be used for the manufacture of briquettes, all of the milled peat produced will be used for the generation of electricity.</P>
    <P>The operations of Bord na Móna afforded employment to over 6,200 men during the peak production period last year.  It is expected that peak employment will rise to a figure of 9,000 men in 1960, while constant all the year round employment will be available for nearly 5,000 men by that time.</P>
    <P>Progress has also been made in the erection by the E.S.B. of four small electricity generating stations which will operate on hand-won peat.  These stations are designed to use 30,000 tons each annually and will ensure a market in the areas concerned for hand-won turf produced surplus to local needs. It is expected that the stations in Counties Clare and Galway will be ready to come into operation in the early part of 1956 and that the stations in Counties Donegal and Kerry will be ready later in that year.</P>
    <P>There is also a provision in the Estimates for a grant towards the work in the experimental and research station conducted by Bord na Móna.  The station has made a valuable contribution to the more efficient production and utilisation of turf and turf products.</P>
    <P>In the Estimates for the year 1954-55 a sum of £84,600 was provided for the repayment of advances for rural electrification.  No provision is made in 1955-56 for a payment of this nature as it is considered that the need for State assistance from voted moneys in pushing forward with the work of rural electrification has passed.  It is intended that the E.S.B. should in future meet the total cost of rural electrification from their own resources. The financial position of the board is sound and expanding sales of <Col N="532" /> electricity will ensure that this position will be maintained.  The board's financial position is such that they will be able to meet the cost of rural electrification without impeding the rate of progress of the scheme.  It is hoped to extend rural electrification to all areas by about 1959.  Sixty areas were developed in 1953-54, but the rate of development has been increased substantially and work is now proceeding at a rate of 100 areas annually.</P>
    <P>The decision to terminate State assistance from voted moneys for rural electrification will necessitate amending legislation which is being prepared at present and which I hope to introduce at an early date.  Provision will also be included in this legislation for additional capital which will be required for rural electrification over the next few years.  Investment in rural electrification will reach £16,000,000 this year and it will be necessary to provide for such sums as will enable the scheme to progress for the next few years.</P>
    <P>Total investment in the electricity undertaking is expected to increase to between £130,000,000 and £140,000,000 by the year 1961.  The demand for electricity is increasing steadily as will be evident from the fact that in the year 1939 total output was 378,000,000 units, while in 1954 total output had reached 1,295,000,000 units.  Total employment is afforded by the E.S.B. to approximately 8,600 persons, of whom 2,400 are engaged in rural electrification.</P>
    <P>The need for developing our native resources of fuel is demonstrated by experience during the past winter. Supplies of coal were well maintained over the greater part of the year but owing to the disruption of British shipments there were some shortages in the early part of 1955 aggravated by the poor hand-cut turf harvest last year. These deficiencies were adequately met by drawing from the stocks of American coal held by Fuel Importers, Limited, but it is clear that the maximum development of our turf resources is not only good national housekeeping but is essential as an insurance against such dislocations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="533" /> Deputies will have noted from the trade returns that the upward trend in the value of exports continued during 1954.  The value of exports in 1954 was £115.1 million, an increase of £1,000,000 over 1953.  Apart from the rise in value the volume of exports in 1954 was 3 per cent. higher than in 1953.  Imports for 1954 were £179.9 million as against £182.7 million for 1953, and, as a result of these movements, the adverse balance of trade fell from £68.6 million to £64.8 million.</P>
    <P>With a view to providing markets abroad for Irish goods it has been the policy of the Government to make and maintain trade agreements with the countries to which our exports are mainly directed.  In pursuance of this policy our trade agreement with France was renewed during the year. Under trade agreements, already in existence with Germany, Finland, Spain and Norway undertakings were obtained for the grant by these countries of special import facilities for goods still subject to import control.  It must be understood that the value of any trade agreement depends on the ability and willingness of Irish manufacturers to exploit to the full the opportunities for additional trade so provided.  Trade fairs and exhibitions abroad afford a useful opportunity to expand exports and Irish manufacturers are encouraged to participate to the maximum extent possible in such fairs.  A permanent Irish pavilion is maintained at the Frankfurt Trade Fair at which many Irish manufacturers exhibit their goods.</P>
    <P>The cost of such participation to the manufacturer is low.  An Irish exhibitor at the recent Spring Fair at Frankfurt informed me that he anticipates a substantial expansion of his exports to European countries as a result.  This experience confirms the experience of other manufacturers who exhibited at the Canadian International Trade Fair at Toronto in June last, and which led to a noticeable expansion in our dollar exports.</P>
    <P>During the year it was decided to authorise Córas Tráchtála Teoranta to extend its activities to cover other areas.  Córas Tráchtála Teoranta was originally set up to promote exports to <Col N="534" /> the dollar area, but it was considered that the experience it has acquired in promoting exports to the American market would be of considerable value to exporters to other countries.  In view of the special circumstances which govern trade between Ireland and Great Britain it was not thought necessary to include trade with that country within the scope of the new arrangements.  It is worthy of note that since Córas Tráchtála was established, exports of manufactured goods to the dollar area have increased substantially. There has also been a noticeable increase in the export-mindedness of our manufacturers due in no small measure to the activities of Córas Tráchtála Teoranta.  It must, of course, be borne in mind that the success of this organisation, Córas Tráchtála Teoranta, cannot be judged entirely on the amount of immediate increases shown in exports.  The fruits of the steady work which the company is performing will not be evident for some time.</P>
    <P>It will be recalled that in November last there was a full debate in the Dáil on the possibility of finding export markets for Irish whiskey.  In general, I think it was agreed that the best prospect for an immediate increase in Irish whiskey exports lay in the production of a suitably blended whiskey and, at that time, I expressed the hope that it would be possible to increase the exports of Irish whiskey.  I have taken a keen interest in expanding our whiskey exports and Deputies will have seen the recent Press announcement of the formation of a new Irish company which will undertake, in association with American interests, the production of a blended whiskey specially suited to the American taste.  A particularly welcome feature of this most recent development is that, as well as the production of the whiskey itself, the bottling and packing of the product will be undertaken here.  Additional employment will also be provided in the ancillary industries producing the bottles and cases.</P>
    <P>As I have stated on earlier occasions, it is not intended, nor would it be desirable, that the new product should displace the traditional Irish product <Col N="535" /> which, with adequate advertising of its quality, can find an expanding sale in the American market.  I see no reason why it should do so.  On the contrary, there is reason to believe that the publicity associated with the introduction of the new Irish product to the American market may lead to increased sales there of the traditional Irish potstill whiskey, as well as of the other blended Irish whiskeys, the export of which has developed in the past few years.</P>
    <P>With the object of encouraging exports it is my policy to remove all emergency controls on exports as quickly as possible.  There was a further substantial relaxation of export controls during the year.  The few controls which now remain are necessary either to ensure that certain raw materials required by home industries will continue to be available to them or to comply with international obligations in regard to strategic materials. These controls are kept under constant review and as circumstances permit they will be abolished.</P>
    <P>The control of exports is at present exercised mainly under powers conferred by the Supplies and Services Act.  It is my intention to present legislation to the Dáil in the near future which will put these powers on a more regular basis and so render reliance on the Supplies and Services Act unnecessary.</P>
    <P>The Estimate for Aviation and Meteorological Services amounts to £323,000, showing a decrease of £91,530 as compared with last year.  £55,400 of this represents an expected increase in revenue mainly from aircraft landings and from the catering service at the Shannon Airport.</P>
    <P>It will be observed that there is no provision in the Estimate for subsidy to Aer Lingus.  I am hopeful that it will not be necessary to make provision at any time for such a subsidy provided Aer Lingus continues to progress. As I pointed out last year, the British Government had indicated that they were anxious to have the bilateral air agreements amended.  There have been informal talks and correspondence <Col N="536" /> on this subject with the British Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation during the past year.  I expect that the formal discussions will be resumed soon.  I cannot at this stage make any statement as to the possible outcome but I am hopeful that it will not be such as to interrupt the progress of Aer Lingus.  It was necessary last year to sound a warning about problems that were arising in connection with the financial position of this company. At that time the company estimated that they would lose £105,000 in the year 1953-54 and £220,000 in 1954-55.  This picture, however, has undergone a change for the better.</P>
    <P>Losses for 1953-54 were £62,000 as against the estimate of £105,000. Present indications are that the loss for the year 1954-55 will be less than £62,000 as against an estimate of £220,000.  This change is a very welcome and encouraging one.  The energetic and efficient way in which the directors and management of the company and their staffs have worked during the past year has helped to bring about the improvement in the company's financial position.</P>
    <P>During the summer of 1954 Aer Lingus operated a regular service to Lourdes for the first time.  It proved so popular that it has been decided to expand it next summer by extending some of the flights to Barcelona.  On some of the flights Biarritz will be a transit stop.  Aer Rianta continue to manage Dublin Airport.  In the year ended 31st March, 1954, they showed a surplus of £24,201 on the management of the airport and a surplus of £20,900 is expected for this year.  These surpluses are surrendered to the Exchequer but they do not indicate that the airport is being run at a profit. The management account does not carry the cost of the various technical services provided by the State.  Neither is there any provision in it for depreciation and interest on the State's capital investment in the airport.  The actual deficit on the operation of the airport for the year ended 31st March, 1954, when the cost of various services provided by the State is taken into account, was £64,038.  The additional charges for depreciation and interest <Col N="537" /> on the State's capital investment and pension liability would bring this figure to a total of £206,871.</P>
    <P>The number of aircraft landing at Dublin Airport increased from 9,108 in 1953 to 9,256 in 1954.  The total number of passengers using the airport increased from 303,997 in 1953 to 342,890 in 1954.  Proposals for extending the airport buildings to cope with increased traffic in Dublin have been under consideration.  At first it had been thought that a very extensive and costly scheme of reconstruction would be necessary.  On further close study of the matter, however, by Aer Rianta and my Department it was found that a comparatively modest scheme would meet requirements for many years to come.  Certain parts of the scheme have already been carried out.  Some further work on the extension and adaptation of the buildings will be carried out during the coming year.</P>
    <P>Shannon Airport continues to be one of the main airports on the North Atlantic route even though bigger and faster aircraft which are capable of flying non-stop from North America to Europe have been introduced in increasing numbers by the operating companies.  In 1954, 8,208 aircraft landed at the airport as against 7,111 in 1953.  Passengers passing through the airport numbered 304,540 in 1954 as against 262,767 in 1953.  There is no sign that the future of the airport will be endangered by any developments that may take place in the foreseeable future.  There is evidence now, in fact, that even when the operating companies may not have technical reasons for bringing their aircraft into Shannon they have to take account of the attractions which Shannon Airport provides for passengers.  It is understood that many passengers express a desire to make a stop at Shannon on their journey to or from America.  This is a very satisfactory state of affairs.  The scheme introduced in 1951 for the sale of duty-free wines, spirits and tobacco to passengers in transit is proving increasingly popular.  The total dollar receipts from the sales made by the catering comptroller at Shannon Airport during the year 1954 amounted <Col N="538" /> to $1,048,350 as compared with $806,062 in 1953 and $585,063 in 1952.</P>
    <P>The existing accommodation in the terminal building at Shannon has been barely adequate to cope with the traffic passing through in 1954.  In order to cope with the expected increased traffic it will be necessary to expand the restaurant and other facilities provided there.  A beginning is being made on these extensions almost at once.</P>
    <P>There is a reduction shown in the Estimate of £40,000 for constructional works at Shannon and Dublin Airports. This is not to be taken as an indication of any lack of interest in the development of the airports.  As I have already indicated it is my intention to effect extensions both at Dublin and at Shannon Airports.  Experience has shown, however, that payments arising out of constructional alterations do not fall due for some time after the alterations have been undertaken.  Accordingly, the Estimate makes provision only for the payments which it is anticipated will arise during the year 1955-56.</P>
    <P>The cost to the State of operating Shannon Airport is, of course, very heavy.  The net deficit on this operation for the year ended 31st March, 1954, was £102,327.  If depreciation and interest on the State's capital investment and pension liability are taken into account this figure would be £362,348.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that apart from the benefits derived by travellers and by those who are exporting or importing goods by air the community in general is receiving very substantial benefits in return for the heavy expenditure on Dublin and Shannon Airports.</P>
    <P>The Estimate for Transport and Marine Services shows a reduction of £384,770 as compared with the year 1954-55.  The reduction is due principally to a reduction in the provision for C.I.E.  The board of C.I.E. estimate that as a result of the change to diesel traction and the general reorganisation programme C.I.E. will within a few years be in a position to meet from their resources revenue charges other <Col N="539" /> than interest on transport stock.  The prospects for complete solvency within a few further years appear to be good. Accordingly, the Government does not think it necessary that C.I.E. should continue to receive subsidy from the Exchequer to meet operating losses. The relatively small sums likely to be needed to cover losses within the next few years should be found by shortterm borrowing.  These borrowings will be guaranteed as necessary by the Minister for Finance under the Transport Act, 1950.  Accordingly, no provision has been made in the Estimate this year for the payment of subsidy to meet operation losses.  The provision that was made in the Vote for 1954-55 for this item will not be utilised. It is clear, however, that C.I.E. will not be able for some time to come to meet the interest on transport stock. It will be necessary to meet this cost from the Central Fund and the Central Fund must be reimbursed for this expenditure.  The Estimate contains provisions for the repayment of stock interest met out of the Central Fund in 1954-55 to the amount of £602,000.</P>
    <P>Deputies will recall that in the Budget statement last year reference was made to a pending financial adjustment between C.I.E. and the Exchequer in respect of apparent over-payments of subsidy in the years 1952-53 and 1953-54.  This adjustment was expected to be of the order of £1,000,000 or so and arose out of the charging of certain expenditure of a capital nature against subsidy rather than against the £2,500,000 stock issue made by C.I.E. in May, 1953.  Details of this adjustment have since been settled, the figure being agreed at £829,000 and C.I.E. have repaid this sum to the Exchequer out of the unexpended proceeds of the stock issue.</P>
    <P>The position of the G.N.R. Board is not as good as that of C.I.E.  The G.N.R. Board assumed responsibility for the operation of the G.N.R. railway system on 1st September, 1953.  The first accounting period ended on 30th September, 1954.  Owing to an inevitable delay involved in settling details of the scheme for ascertainment and apportionment of profits and losses <Col N="540" /> and, secondly, the form in which the accounts should be published, the audited accounts and annual report for the first accounting period are not yet available.  Estimates, however, indicate that the losses on the operation of the system from 1st September, 1953, to 30th September, 1954, amounted to £677,000.  Of this amount £188,000 being our share of the loss will have to be defrayed from the Exchequer.  In the year ended 31st December, 1952, which was the last full year of operation by the company prior to its acquisition by the G.N.R. Board the losses were £671,000.  Of this amount approximately £225,000 fell to be met from the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Capital expenditure by the board up to 30th September, 1954, amounted to £243,000.  Of this sum £195,000 will be met by issues from the Exchequer.  The capital expenditure includes a sum of £150,000 for road vehicles which will be used exclusively in the State.  The heavy losses incurred by the board in both areas have convinced the board that the only hope of operating the railway without substantial losses lies in changing to diesel traction and modernising rolling stock.  As part of the reorganisation the purchase of 24 diesel rail cars has been authorised.</P>
    <P>The operation of the railway as a joint undertaking involves regular consultation between my Department and the Ministry of Commerce in Belfast. This applied particularly to the past year when the settlement of the scheme of ascertainment and apportionment of the profits and losses of the board and other matters pertaining especially to this initial period necessitated frequent discussions and considerable correspondence.  I myself had discussions with the Minister of Commerce during the year.  I am happy to say that these consultations were conducted in an atmosphere of mutual co-operation.</P>
    <P>The Estimate includes a provision of £390,010 for grants to improvement works at harbours including approximately £50,000 for dredging.  This is less than the sum voted in 1954.  The reason is that many of the larger improvement schemes have been completed <Col N="541" /> or are nearing completion. Payments from the Vote for 1954-55 amounted to £429,000 approximately.  I should emphasise that the reduced provision does not mean that there has been a curtailment in the degree of assistance for the improvement of harbour works.  The reduced provision represents the amount which in the light of experience over a number of years is likely to be actually spent during the year 1955-56.</P>
    <P>As regards mercantile shipping, I wish to mention that the present fleet of Irish Shipping, Limited, numbers nine vessels of 56,684 tons dead weight. During the year the company took delivery of two vessels; one a tanker of 3,350 tons, and the other a collier of 1,397 tons.  At present there are nine vessels being constructed for the company. These vessels consist of four dry cargo vessels of 9,500 tons each, two similar vessels of 9,000 tons each and three coaster vessels of 2,000 tons each. One of these coasters is on order from Liffey Dockyard.  It is expected that the last of these vessels will be delivered before the middle of 1957. When the deliveries are completed the company will have 17 dry cargo vessels of 115,334 tons total cargo capacity, together with a coastal tanker of 3,350 tons.  Irish Shipping, Limited, at my request are at present examining the possibilities of entering the transatlantic passenger trade and of extra Irish participation in the cross-Channel trade.  Proposals for the acquisition of deep-sea tanker tonnage are also under consideration.  These matters require very careful and detailed examination and it will be some time before I will be able to make any further statement on them.</P>
    <P>The amount of cargo carried by Irish Shipping showed an increase for the year ended 30th June, 1954, as compared with the previous year.  Owing, however, to a decline in certain freight rates and because of increased operation costs the profit for 1954 was only £107,420 as compared with £193,396 in 1953.  Ocean freight rates fell steadily through 1953 and the first half of 1954 but have since returned to 1952 levels. The higher rates will be reflected in due course in the trading results of the <Col N="542" /> company.  The company provides employment for approximately 500 personnel ashore and afloat.  During the year its vessels travelled as far afield as Australia, Cuba, Canada and Western and Central American ports.</P>
    <P>Whilst the Tourist Traffic Bill, 1955, was under consideration in the Dáil there was a very full discussion on all aspects of tourism.  Accordingly, I do not propose to traverse the same ground on this Estimate.  The Estimate for 1955-56 provides a sum of £400,000 as compared with £478,000 for 1954-55. This, however, does not mean that the Government is endeavouring to economise on the expenditure on tourism.  The actual expenditure in 1954-55 is estimated to be less than £400,000.  The provision for 1955-56 is, therefore, greater than the actual expenditure this year.  Moreover, the main object of the recent legislation was to amalgamate the two existing tourist organisations.  It is expected that this amalgamation will promote greater efficiency by eliminating the overlapping of functions and the duplication of staff, transport and premises.  I am satisfied that the provision of £400,000 will be adequate to enable still greater progress to be made with the development and publicising of the tourist industry than was made in 1954-55.</P>
    <P>I am not satisfied that in the past the potentialities of the Irish tourist industry have been exploited to the full.  An essential prerequisite to the further expansion of the industry is the appointment to a new board of persons who will work together as a team and who will display drive and imagination in the discharge of their functions.  I hope to get together a board of persons who will have these qualities.  I will make it clear to the persons whom I am appointing to the new board that I will expect them to make an all-out effort to expand the tourist trade and to encourage the provision here of the amenities which are necessary to attract tourists and to encourage our own people to spend their holidays at home.</P>
    <P>Considerable public interest was aroused last year in the possibility of developing river passenger services on the Shannon.  I asked C.I.E. to investigate <Col N="543" /> the possibilities of such services being provided by the board. I now understand that the board have acquired a vessel for this purpose and are negotiating for the acquisition of a second vessel with a view to inaugurating holiday and tourist services on the River Shannon during the coming summer.</P>
    <P>When the Tourist Traffic Bill was being debated in the Oireachtas I made it clear that An Tóstal had my full support and the full support of the Government.  An Tóstal is however essentially a communal effort and if it is to be fully successful every section of the community must co-operate wholeheartedly with the official tourist organisations in preparing a colourful programme of events for the festival.  I would, therefore, urge local Tóstal councils, hoteliers and business people generally to do their utmost to ensure that An Tóstal in 1955 will be even more successful than it was in previous years.</P>
    <P>I explained the position about vessels on the Dún Laoghaire-Holyhead route very fully during the course of the debate on the Tourist Traffic Bill. Officers of my Department have had further discussions to-day with officials of British Railways so as to ensure that a really adequate service will be provided on the route during the coming summer.  The question of improved facilities for the transport of tourist cars on the Dún Laoghaire-Holyhead route is also being discussed with British Railways.</P>
    <P>It is scarcely necessary for me to refer to the Vote for the Industrial and Commercial Property Registration Office.  There are no major changes in the Vote as compared with last year but there is a slight decrease of £510 in the provision, which is due to recruitment of officers at lower points on their salary scales.</P>
    <P>I think that covers a review of the activities of my Department for the past 12 months, but if there are any points which require elucidation or clarification during the course of the debate I shall be happy to try and <Col N="544" /> assist in providing the necessary elucidation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>At the beginning of his statement the Minister referred, with an air of complacent satisfaction, to the reductions which are anticipated in expenditure under various sub-heads of the Estimate.  May I say, straightway, that there are very few of these reductions that I, as Minister, would be happy to announce to the Dáil?  In so far as they are an indication of policy they are to be deplored.  Apart from the reduced provision for flour and bread subsidy, the reductions to be made in the main Estimate come under the following headings: provision for mineral prospecting; housing grants to Bord na Móna; grants to Foras Tionscal for industrial development in western areas; technical assistance, and rural electrification.  Some of these reductions are, no doubt, due to the termination of works started previously or to a reduction in their scale. But there is, I think, little ground for satisfaction that the activities of the Department are likely to be curtailed under any of these headings.</P>
      <P>The main reduction, however, is in respect of the provision for flour and bread subsidy, and that reduction is achieved in two ways: firstly, by cutting the price to be paid to Irish farmers for wheat delivered to flour millers, and, secondly, by increasing the price which the farmers have to pay for wheat offals.  We have discussed already at some length the justification for reducing the guaranteed price for Irish wheat in the circumstances of this year and I do not want to go over that ground again.  I think the Minister should give the House a division of the figure under the two headings: How much of the reduction is to be attributed to the lowering of the guaranteed price for wheat?  How much of it is to be attributed to the increase in the price for offals?  The figures which he gave for last year would suggest that the saving due to the increased price of offals is quite considerable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister in his statement passed with unbecoming haste over the question of prices.  I do not think that the Dáil will fail to bring him back to that <Col N="545" /> subject again during the course of this debate and force him to deal with it at somewhat greater length when he is replying.  He thinks it is not necessary to refer to it now but when he was introducing the Estimate last year, his first effort as Minister for Industry and Commerce to secure the approval of the Dáil for the Estimate of the Department, he said it was his policy to take all possible steps to reduce the cost of living and he added, in particular, to effect a reduction in the price of essential foodstuffs.  A year has gone since then and will the Minister tell the Dáil what single action he has taken to reduce the cost of living or to bring down the price of any essential foodstuffs?  Last year with his election speeches fresh in his memory he was eloquent about his policy.  This year he skips over it with a casual statement that it is not necessary to refer to it.  I think it is very necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Had we not a fort-night's discussion on it?</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing with the Minister's Department and the Minister's policy and his failure to reduce the cost of living.  If that policy is not a failure why is it that, notwithstanding the expectation of the Minister last year, the cost of living went up, the consumer price index number is now two points higher than it was this time a year ago.  Last year he told us he had under consideration the need for introducing legislation to establish on a permanent basis the Prices Advisory Body with wider powers.  This year he tells us he still has it under consideration.  I do not know whom the Minister thinks he is fooling, but it certainly is not the members of the Dáil.  They know that nothing has been done by him as Minister to alter in the slightest degree the operations of the Department of Industry and Commerce in respect of price control, to effect the reduction of a single price which would not have gone down of its own accord, or to bring to a stage fit for presentation <Col N="546" /> to the Dáil proposals for legislation dealing with price control.  There was a Bill dealing with permanent arrangements for price regulation in the Minister's Department when he entered it and with that there as a basis upon which to work there should not have been a year's consideration necessary to enable the Minister to announce that here to-day, the preparation of the Bill is still being examined by him and his officers.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>You will see a Bill from this Government in due course, but it will not be a Fianna Fáil Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In due course we will have a Bill.  You told us last year it was under consideration; it is still under consideration and no doubt next year it will be still under consideration. If ever it is produced we will see the amazing difference between a Labour Party Bill or a Coalition Bill and a Fianna Fáil Bill.  I know the proposals which I left for the Minister's consideration were effective proposals, and I shall be surprised if he can improve on them.  I do not know whether he is trying to improve on them or not. We have here before us, however, a Minister who when presenting the Estimate for his Department last year said it was his policy to bring down the cost of living and particularly to effect reductions in the price of essential foodstuffs, and who this year skips hurriedly over that question with the casual observation that it is not necessary to refer to it.  Now if there are Deputies opposite sitting behind the Minister who have any concern at all for the people whom they represent, the people to whom they themselves as individuals made promises of a reduction in the cost of living, they cannot let the Minister away with that. Before this debate concludes they must join me in pressing the Minister to put into operation the policy which he <Col N="547" /> announced last year and has forgotten since.</P>
      <P>The main function of the Department of Industry and Commerce is to promote the development of industry, to secure the progress of our industrial development.  The Minister's speech was extraordinarily uninformative in that regard.  Last year he mentioned that a number of tariff reviews were about to be undertaken by the Industrial Development Authority.  Have these reviews been undertaken?  What particular tariffs were reviewed?  What was the result of the review?  One would have thought the Minister would have felt obliged to give some information on that point to the House.  This year he did refer to some particular projects to which I want also to refer. He forgot to refer to a number of others to which I think he should have referred.</P>
      <P>The Minister did, however, make a statement about the need for attracting foreign capital under certain conditions into Irish industry.  It was a very vague statement.  If there is one thing upon which the Minister for Industry and Commerce should not be vague it is matters of that kind.  A vague statement which leaves the Minister's intentions uncertain is bound to produce a feeling of insecurity amongst those who are engaged in industry, to produce speculation which may have undesirable consequences, or may even operate to deter particular projects promoted by private enterprise until the Minister's intentions are better known.</P>
      <P>If the Minister believes that foreign capital should be given more active encouragement he should give the House as definite an indication as possible what type of encouragement he has in mind.  Is it going to be the encouragement of a tax concession?  Is it going to take the form of an amendment or the repeal of the Control of Manufactures Act?  Does he contemplate that foreign capital coming into Irish industry will be better treated than native capital?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Questions will be asked and the Minister cannot avoid answering them. Vagueness in matters of this kind is <Col N="548" /> the worst possible course for the Minister to adopt.  He says that foreign capital is to be encouraged subject to national safeguards.  What does that mean?  What are national safeguards in relation to investment of foreign capital in Irish industry?  These platitudes in an important matter of this kind where the Minister's statement will affect, one way or the other, decisions of numerous people regarding investment in industrial projects, should be avoided.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the oil refinery.  Earlier, in this House, I criticised the Minister for what I regard as a premature announcement regarding that particular project.  This idea of establishing an oil refinery in this country is an old one.  I was associated with a project of that character before the war.  That project went so far that not merely was a company formed, but the construction of buildings for the purposes of the refinery was undertaken.  That project met with the bitter opposition of those companies who are now going to be associated with the establishment of a refinery here.  It met with opposition from other quarters, including many Deputies in this House, and some of the Parties represented in this House. At that time there was a policy generally followed by the great oil companies to establish refineries as closely as possible to the oil wells.  They saw that if this country succeeded in establishing a refinery here, and making a go of it, other European countries would insist on following suit.  They fought our proposal bitterly with every tactic at their disposal, including personal attacks upon the individuals who were associated with it, some of whom were, I believe, forced to withdraw from commercial life because of these attacks.  It was the outbreak of war that eventually defeated it.</P>
    <P>After the war, however, there was a change of policy.  Oil companies began to realise that there were advantages in investing in refineries in the countries of consumption rather than in the countries where the oil wells were located.  The council of O.E.E.C. recommended to all European countries <Col N="549" /> that they should promote and encourage refineries within their areas. Developments at Abadan finally sent these oil companies in a flurry to get the refinery plants away from the troubled areas in which the oil wells were located, and into the countries of Europe, and other countries where the products of the oil refineries were being consumed.  When I came into office in 1951 the Industrial Development Authority was instructed to go again into this matter of the establishment of an oil refinery here.  Considerable progress was made.  There were, however, outstanding questions left to be settled: whether these companies would act in concert with one another in the establishment of the refinery, the size of the refinery, the agreement with the Government as to the amount to be invested, and the prices to be charged for its products.  I considered it wise to refrain, even during the election campaign, from making any reference to the progress which was made, because I felt that any announcement would commit the Government, and thereby weaken its bargaining power in negotiations with the oil companies when the agreement was being negotiated.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister should have withheld this announcement until that agreement had been concluded, or at any rate he should keep in the field the other parties who are interested in the establishment of a refinery here. There were other people who were prepared to put up proposals to the Industrial Development Authority in that regard.  The effect of his announcement was to clear the other parties away, remove the competitive element from the bargaining, and commit himself, because everybody knows that he will be in political difficulties if this project does not proceed, in a way of which these oil companies will take full advantage in the negotiations, unless they have changed their character completely since I had dealings with them.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the desirability of directing, encouraging and assisting Irish Shipping, Limited in acquiring deep sea tanker tonnage.  This is a matter in which I have been interested <Col N="550" /> for a long time.  Might I say that the acquisition of tanker tonnage is independent of the oil refinery project. No doubt the prospect of commercial success in the operation of tankers by Irish Shipping, Limited is greatly improved by the prospect of a refinery here, but the successful operation of tanker tonnage could be contemplated even if there were no refinery development. It is far more important from every point of view, including the point of view of national security, that Irish Shipping, Limited should get into this tanker business, rather than they should waste time examining the preposterous idea of getting into the transatlantic passenger trade.  Why does the Minister persist in pretending that is a serious proposition?  He knows there is not the slightest prospect of the successful operation of passenger tonnage by Irish Shipping, Limited.  Is it not fantastic that the Government which killed the Irish transatlantic airline development should now be talking of getting into the transatlantic shipping business? I presume the Minister is not talking about sailing boats or paddle boats.</P>
    <P>Is there a Deputy in this House who does not believe that air transport will be the normal method of meeting transatlantic traffic in the future? Why are they, at this stage, having killed the transatlantic air company, talking of getting into transatlantic passenger boats?  I suppose a passenger boat would cost about £200 per ton to build, and a small transatlantic boat, one that would only take the cheapest type of tourist traffic, say, a 10,000 ton boat, would cost, therefore, a couple of million pounds to build apart altogether from the cost of operation. The Minister should stop talking about that matter, and see that the time of the board of the Irish Shipping Company is given to the far more important and urgent business of developing its tanker fleet.</P>
    <P>The Minister made a somewhat misleading reference to the project for the manufacture in this country of nitrogenous fertiliser.  He said that the Board of Ceimicí Teoranta had completed its investigation of the possibilities <Col N="551" /> by 1953, and had reported to the Fianna Fáil Government upon these possibilities.  Its report was accepted and approved by the Fianna Fáil Government.  They reported that the most suitable type of nitrogenous fertiliser to be manufactured in this country would consist of a granulated mixture consisting of 60 per cent. nitrate of ammonia and 40 per cent. limestone.  The advantages, they said, of planning for the production of that type of nitrogenous fertiliser were: first, that all the raw materials were available within the country; secondly, that it could be located in an area which would facilitate its distribution and keep down distribution costs; thirdly, it could be manufactured here at a lower price than we were then paying for imported fertiliser.</P>
    <P>On the basis of that recommendation, the Fianna Fáil Government felt obliged to give an expeditious approval of the project and allocated to Ceimicí Teoranta a grant of £15,000 to cover two further investigations they had to make: (1)  an investigation to enable them to decide on which particular process of gasification would be used and (2) the preparation of a detailed plan for the works themselves.  Ceimicí Teoranta got that £15,000 before the change of Government and presumably has expended it for these purposes.  The report on the possibilities was received long ago.  What should now be available to the Minister is a detailed plan for the establishment of that important new industry which the Board of Ceimicí Teoranta recommended should be located generally in the area of Banagher or Shannonbridge in the Midlands.  There was a recommendation that the plant should be established with a capacity of 100,000 tons per year.</P>
    <P>In this country we do not use 100,000 tons of nitrogenous fertilisers: we should but we do not.  However, there was confidence in the minds of those responsible for the preparation of the plan that by judicious propaganda amongst farmers&mdash;and bearing in mind the experience of other countries&mdash;the bringing up of the <Col N="552" /> utilisation of nitrogenous fertilisers to 100,000 tons could quickly be achieved. Every Deputy familiar with the problem will appreciate its importance. To manufacture nitrogenous fertilisers in this country from native materials so as to provide them at lower costs than we have been paying for the imported nitrogenous fertilisers is very desirable and there is no reason why the project should be delayed.  The plans are there and the approval of the previous Government to the plans was given.  So far as I know it requires only the green light from the present Government to enable the project to proceed.</P>
    <P>We have had a number of questions to-day as to the position in the leather trades, in the tanneries and in those factories which use leather as raw material.  The Minister has announced that he is placing restrictions on the importation of substitute soiling.  That is all right as far as it goes, but so far as I know there is no power in the Minister to prevent anybody in this country from manufacturing this synthetic soling&mdash;and I do not think there is any difficulty in doing it.  Any effect of the restrictions on the importation of substitute soling can only be very short-lived.  Our Irish tanners and boot factories established quite significant export trades during the years when we controlled the price at which Irish hides were sold to them and placed restrictions upon the export of hides.  The policy of restricting the export of hides and regulating prices of hides to the tanners was frequently attacked here, so frequently that I felt we could not maintain it.  Eventually, arrangements were made which resulted in the termination of the operation of that policy some time towards the end of last year.  I think, however, it is a policy we should reconsider.</P>
    <P>There is no justification in economic theory or in fact for the assertion frequently made here by the present Minister for Agriculture and others, that the effect of restricting the export of hides and regulating the price of hides is to lower the price which the producer of cattle gets.  Having regard to the present price of cattle, it <Col N="553" /> would not worry him very much, anyway, even if it were.  We can avoid any such loss to the producer of the cattle or the person handling the hide if we will reopen the question of the elimination of the warble fly.  We had a compulsory scheme for its elimination in operation before the war.  That scheme was attacked vigorously at the time by Fine Gael.  It had to be dropped when the war started as the officers and organisation responsible for the operation of the Warble Fly Order were required for other work. We did not take it up again after the war.</P>
    <P>Reliance has been placed by the Department of Agriculture on some voluntary committee that undertakes, spasmodically, some propaganda work amongst farmers in regard to the desirability of dressing their cattle so as to kill the larvæ.  This country is losing over £1,000,000 a year in the value of hides handled by the tanners by reason of the operations of the warble fly.  If we can do what every other country in Europe has done by applying the policy which we had attempted before the war, we can eliminate the warble fly altogether in two or three years.  Any losses that might be felt by the producers of cattle or the handlers of hides by reason of controlling their export could more than be compensated for by the higher value of these hides after we had eliminated the warble fly. All my colleagues may not agree with this view that it is now and always will be good policy to this country to concentrate upon exporting whatever products we are capable of manufacturing from native materials in the most highly processed form and that it is far better for us to export leather or boots made of leather than to export hides.</P>
    <P>Whatever offsetting disadvantages there may be in controlling the export of Irish hides and in getting the price of Irish hides to a level that will permit of the development of our tanning and footwear industries, we should do it for the reason of the increased value of our exports and for the reason of the increased employment which we can give to our people. It is wrong to think that the problem of our tanners and boot factories is due <Col N="554" /> entirely to the emergence of this synthetic soling material.  There have been synthetic soling materials on the market for many years.  The real problem has been the loss of the competitive advantages they had during the period when that control over hide exports was in operation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>And the result is what I have said&mdash;a narrowing down of the number of tanners, the disappearance of the export trade in footwear and the disemployment of hundreds of persons in our footwear factories.  From the viewpoint of national advantage, which is the better?  Is it better that we should have market value&mdash;whatever it may be&mdash;for a warbled hide or that we should try to increase the value of the hide by eliminating the fly and securing the raw materials for these industries?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not affect the producer to the extent of one halfpenny. Is the Deputy seriously trying to suggest that when somebody goes to a fair to buy a beast his calculation is based upon the price the hide will realise?  Not at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>However, there is the suggestion which I am putting forward &mdash;and it is a constructive suggestion&mdash; for handling what will be a very serious problem in a number of important Irish tanneries and footwear factories.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know what significance is to be attached to the reduction in the grant to An Foras Tionscal under the Estimate.  Is it that An Foras Tionscal have told the Minister they do not expect to get new projects for their consideration during the year which will involve expenditure upon a higher scale than that provided by the Estimate? Or are they being told they must not consider projects which will <Col N="555" /> involve grants on the same scale as last year?</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that why the Estimate is down £25,000?  Which is the explanation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Because they found they could not spend the money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The explanation, therefore, is that they do not anticipate that new proposals for industries in western counties will come forward at a rate which will enable them to spend the same sum as was provided last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Or because projects had not developed sufficiently to enable them to pay out more.  I wish they would develop more quickly.  If they do, it is all to the good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked which was the explanation?  I am told that is the explanation now, that it is expected there will be a slowing down of industrial development under that Act in the western counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  It may take longer to enable the schemes to mature, as it took longer in the last two years than was anticipated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Anyway, the House is entitled to some explanation of why the Minister thinks it necessary to provide £25,000 less this year than was provided last year for grants to An Foras Tionscal.  That is the explanation which he has given now.  This policy of industrial development in the West is one to which the whole House attached considerable importance. When I brought that Undeveloped Areas Bill here on Second Reading, I was very much impressed by the fact that it received support not merely from Deputies of Parties, not merely from Deputies representing the counties likely to benefit from it, but from Deputies representing every part of Ireland, all of whom realised that there was a national advantage to be gained, apart altogether from local advantages, in encouraging the movement <Col N="556" /> of industry west of the Shannon. We deplore very much any lack of enthusiasm for that policy, or the placing of any unnecessary barriers to the activities of An Foras Tionscal in securing the emergence of proposals of that character.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>No barrier is being placed in their way.  I wish they could absorb more money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you.  What is the position concerning Minfhéir Teoranta, the statutory company set up to reclaim virgin bog in Bangor-Erris and develop it for the production of grass meal?  I have said already&mdash;and I want to repeat here, for the purpose of getting a statement from the Minister&mdash; that I have heard perturbing accounts from that district.  The initial capital development contemplated there was completed some time ago&mdash;and it was completed, I am told, at about 75 per cent. of the estimated cost; but since then no further progress has taken place.  The workers have not been disemployed, they are being continued in employment, doing unnecessary capital development work, adding unnecessarily to the capital burden of the undertaking.  What is the intention of the Government in that regard?  Are they trying to discredit it by loading it down with unnecessary capital charges, or are they going to allow it to proceed?  The policy of the Government in relation to that industry should be clearly stated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred here to coal supplies and some Deputy asked him a question to-day concerning the American coal still held in the dumps. It is quite obvious that this year but for that American coal we might have had to ration coal.  Difficulty was experienced, and is still being experienced, in getting adequate supplies from Britain.  It is quite clear that those difficulties are going to grow instead of lessen in the future.  Not merely is the cost of coal from Britain going to increase but the volume of British coal available for export is going to decrease and year by year&mdash; as I attempted to foretell here two or three years ago&mdash;we are going to find increasing difficulty in getting our coal <Col N="557" /> requirements met from British sources. That is going to place some problems at the door of the Government.  The dump of American coal, which is at present being used to help, was very largely accidental.  It was coal that was ordered when we were unable to get even our minimum requirements from Britain and it was still in the pipeline when suddenly the British changed their policy and made plentiful supplies available to us.  The coal which was in transit, or loaded at the time, had to be taken and was put into dumps here.  It is being drawn to a substantial extent this year to meet current needs.  I think that the Government will have to consider the desirability of maintaining reserve supplies of coal somewhere every year. Even the British have to do it; even the British in their own country are constrained to accumulate reserve stocks during the summer to meet the heavier winter needs; even the British are arranging to import coal from America.  We may be forced to supplement our imports from Great Britain by coal from other sources, but we cannot be certain of getting it when we need it.</P>
    <P>The coal trade of this country was built up on the assumption that supplies of coal would arrive daily from Britain.  Every coal merchant here has only that yardage accommodation and those trading methods which are suitable on the basis of that assumption. In any circumstances under which coal from Britain could be cut off, there is no commercial organisation which will ensure that, nevertheless, the requirements of Irish industry and Irish coal consumers will be met.  It is that special circumstance attaching to the coal trade which made it essential for the Government, during the war and post-war years, to create an organisation for itself and by itself, to hold reserve stocks of coal against the danger of occasional interruption due to labour troubles or other causes in Great Britain and against the known difficulties of meeting our full requirements during the winter periods.</P>
    <P>I think the Government will have to think again about the need for establishing such a reserve somewhere, <Col N="558" /> by creating an organisation to maintain a reserve stock of coal against next winter&mdash;since the experience of last winter is likely to be repeated next winter and we are likely to have then, perhaps, a more acute problem than we experienced this year.  It was fortunate for the country&mdash;even though it was an accident&mdash;that we had these reserve stocks of American coal held on Government account this year.</P>
    <P>The Minister has referred to the financial position of C.I.E.  It was a matter of considerable amusement to me&mdash;and I am sure it will be eventually to all Fianna Fáil Deputies&mdash;to hear the Minister's reference.  Last year when Deputy MacEntee, then Minister for Finance, came here to the House with his Budget statement and said he was deleting the provision from the Estimates for meeting the operating loss of C.I.E. and was proposing to ask C.I.E. to repay £1,000,000 which they had charged against revenue, having previously charged it against a capital issue, Deputies of the Coalition Parties waxed eloquent in denunciation of that proposal.  During the election campaign, I happened to be driving through the town of Cavan and I passed the outskirts of a meeting addressed by the present Taoiseach, Deputy Costello, and I could hear him cry: &ldquo;Where is C.I.E. going to get £1,000,000?&mdash;haw, haw, haw.&rdquo; His laughter rang round the streets when he was ridiculing this suggestion that C.I.E. could help to meet the Budget situation by repaying £1,000,000.  They did it&mdash;and the man who made them do it was the present Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>He and his colleague, the Minister for Finance, went into the position and found it was correct, apparently, that C.I.E. had charged capital expenditure against revenue, thereby inflating the amount they drew against subsidy, and that they owed that money to the Exchequer and accordingly the money has been repaid to the extent of £820,000.  Despite the fact that there was no provision in the Estimates for meeting operating losses, no Supplementary Estimate was required for C.I.E. and there is no provision in this year's Estimate for C.I.E. operating <Col N="559" /> losses.  If there are losses, they are going to be met by short-term borrowings and carried forward as a liability of the undertaking.</P>
    <P>I had the idea at one time that that would be a practical arrangement, but the C.I.E. Board made a strong case against it, so strong that they convinced me that the weight of argument was on their side, and C.I.E. convinced my colleagues on the Fianna Fáil Government.  It had been my idea at one time that these present losses should be capitalised, but we dropped that proposal in the light of the case made by the board of C.I.E., which seemed to demonstrate that all these economies which they are proposing to make and the expansions of revenue which they expect to get under their new programme will merely balance one with the other and that there will be no surplus to offset against past losses.</P>
    <P>I am, however, very much surprised by the fact that the Minister has not found it necessary before this to produce legislation relating to C.I.E. finances.  I am not at all convinced by his statement, in reply to a Dáil question, that C.I.E. is in no difficulty by reason of the delay in producing that legislation.  They must certainly have entered into capital commitments far in excess of the present statutory limit.  There was, under the old Act, about £2,500,000, if I remember correctly, of unused borrowing power, of which £1,000,000 has now been absorbed in repaying this amount due to the Exchequer.  The order for diesel locomotives alone amounted to very close on £5,000,000.  I think it is very wrong that C.I.E. should be allowed to enter into commitments beyond the limit fixed by the Dáil, without the Dáil being informed of it and without proposals for amending the legislation being brought here for debate.  I do not believe that that situation can be allowed to continue without creating real difficulties for C.I.E.</P>
    <P>One of the problems which naturally concerned the Government when this reorganisation scheme for C.I.E. was being considered was the possible effect on employment and we were <Col N="560" /> greatly relieved when, on an examination of the position, we found that C.I.E. could certify that there would be no unemployment due to redundancy, provided that, simultaneously with the capital reorganisation, the construction of these turf and oil locomotives was proceeded with and provided they were able to undertake the manufacture at their works of parts of locomotives and wagons and carriages which were then imported; and if C.I.E. have not got, as they cannot have in sight, the capital resources to enable these things to be done, then I think that in that fact is to be found the explanation of the redundancy about which some Deputies have been asking questions during the present year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been no redundancy of any permanent employees at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I mean what I say. There is no need for anxiety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>What I say is that this Dáil, on the proposition of another <Col N="561" /> Coalition Minister, placed a statutory limit on the borrowing powers of C.I.E., and C.I.E. has, in effect, exceeded that limit by the process of entering into commitments which it cannot meet unless the Dáil agrees to raise the limit.</P>
      <P>The position of the G.N.R. is also going to cause the Minister concern. I do not know if he saw the recent press references to the possibility of a policy being adopted in the Six Counties of closing down all but the main railway lines there.  If that policy is followed&mdash;and presumably it is entirely a matter, subject to certain provisions of the inter-Government agreement, for the Ulster Transport Authority what policy is followed&mdash;it will have its repercussions upon the output of and employment in the Dundalk workshops.</P>
      <P>The main feature of that agreement from our point of view was the retention of the Dundalk workshops as the main workshops of the system and any curtailment in scope of railway working in either area is bound to have an effect there.  I think that consideration should be given now to the possible effect on Dundalk of the operation of any such policy by the Ulster Transport Authority, with a view to minimising or offsetting any ill effects, if necessary, by arranging for the doing at Dundalk by the G.N.R. of work for C.I.E. under contract.  The big capital development programme which C.I.E. has undertaken is likely to utilise its productive capacity to the limit and there may be some surplus which can be transferred to Dundalk.  Alternatively, the introduction of a dieselisation programme on the G.N.R. system could also be utilised for the benefit of Dundalk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has stated that 24 diesel railcars are being acquired by the G.N.R.  I told the Board of C.I.E. that when sanction was given to them for the purchase of, I think, 60 or 70 railcars for the C.I.E. system, they were to produce proposals and proceed on the assumption that, after they had been initially equipped with that number, the construction of future railcars should be carried out in their own works and I think it is undesirable that we should continue to import these <Col N="562" /> railcars completely manufactured from abroad.  We can do it here, and certainly if the two companies operate a similar type of equipment, the present requirements and annual replacement demands should be sufficient to permit of economical manufacture, either at Dundalk or in Dublin.</P>
    <P>Now I want to say a few words about this amazing decision of the Government in regard to rural electrification. I do not know if Deputies understand the full significance of what is taking place.  The E.S.B. was invited by the Government many years ago to prepare a scheme for rural electrification. They prepared a scheme which was submitted to and accepted by the Government and eventually brought by the Government to the Dáil.  The basis of that scheme was this, that, subject to the Government providing half the capital cost of erecting the rural network, free of interest or repayment charges, the E.S.B. would supply electricity to rural consumers under the scheme at its recognised rural tariff rates.</P>
    <P>It was clear that, without that capital subvention, the cost of current to consumers under the rural electrification scheme would make it prohibitive and would make the scheme impracticable from the start.  That scheme which was submitted in detail to the Dáil was approved of by the Dáil without opposition from any Party and the E.S.B. was told to proceed with the rural electrification scheme, on the assurance of the Dáil that it would receive from the Exchequer a capital grant equivalent to half of the cost of erecting the network.  Now, of its own decision and apparently without the concurrence of the E.S.B., the Government has not merely reneged upon that agreement, but it is attempting to do so retrospectively.  It has not got the power to do so&mdash;it will have to seek that power by legislation from the House.</P>
    <P>It is proposing to go to the E.S.B., as I understand the position, and to demand from the E.S.B., the repayment to it of the £5,000,000 approximately already given to the board as a free grant.  The exact amount is £4,825,000.  That sum of £4,825,000, <Col N="563" /> which was given with the authority of the Dáil by the Government to the E.S.B. as a capital grant for the erection of the rural network is now being recalled.  The E.S.B. is being required to repay it and in order to enable the E.S.B. to repay it, the E.S.B. revenue is being taxed to the extent of £250,000 a year.  That is what the Government has done and I want Deputies to understand the significance of what the Government has done in relation to all the circumstances.</P>
    <P>The E.S.B. was established by an Act of this Dáil as an independent authority.  In particular, it is independent in regard to its charges.  There is on it an obligation under the law so to regulate its charges that, taking one year with another, its receipts from the sale of electricity will balance, and no more than balance, its lawful outgoings. That law has not been changed, although the Minister told us that if the E.S.B. attempted to increase its rural electricity scheme rates, because of the withdrawal of the capital subsidy, he would get into a fret about it. That is not good enough.  Not merely is it preposterous to suggest that there is a sufficient safeguard but it is asking the E.S.B. to ignore the law under which they were set up.  Under that law their obligation is to so fix these charges that the revenue from the sale of current will meet their outgoings.  It would be, I think, a very retrograde step at this stage to take that power and discretion away from the E.S.B. and bring them back again under the close thumb of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>This repudiation of an agreement entered into with the approval of the Dáil by the Government of the day lawfully in office to the detriment of the rural electricity consumers in this country is one of the worst things the Government has done so far. Eventually, it is certain to mean higher charges to rural consumers and consumers generally.  It is certain to mean a slowing down of rural development. It is certain to mean that all those borderline areas into which the board is reluctant at the present time to <Col N="564" /> bring the rural electrification scheme at all will now never be developed and will never get the benefit of that well-conceived scheme.</P>
    <P>For what purpose?  In order to produce a false impression in the Book of Estimates that economies have been made.  The arrangement under which the advances from the Exchequer for rural electrification were being paid was that in each year the Dáil was asked to vote a sum representing one-thirtieth of the advances to date.  I think one-thirtieth was the amount. The aim was to repay to the Exchequer out of voted moneys the grants to the E.S.B. over a period of 30 years.  No provision has been made at all this year.  In future, in respect of advances already made the E.S.B. will have to repay them.</P>
    <P>The Government gains both ways.  It eliminates from the Estimates of expenditure the £85,000 that appeared there last year to repay these advances for rural electrification and they will get from the E.S.B. over £250,000 in interest and repayment charges.  That is a mean trick.  It is a matter which will have to be reconsidered when there is a change of Government.  It is certain to mean that the benefits of rural electrification are going to be denied to wide parts of the country where they are certainly required. Nobody can compel the board to take rural electrification into any areas where it does not pay.  There are many areas, even under the old scheme, into which the E.S.B. were going with reluctance.  They are out of this permanently because of this welshing on undertakings, demanding the repayment of money that was given as a grant just because the Government has the power to do so.  No wonder the Minister was reluctant to tell the Dáil what the E.S.B. said.  I do not know what they said.  If they are fulfilling their duties properly as directors of that undertaking they should not have minced their words when speaking to the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to Aer Lingus. There is nothing very much that I want to say in that regard.  The discussions with the Ministry of Civil Aviation concerning the future of the Air Agreement <Col N="565" /> have apparently not proceeded very far.  The Minister has nothing to report in that respect.  The financial position of Aer Lingus has proved to be, as I forecast, not nearly as serious as the Minister suggested last year and there is no reason to be talking in terms of a subsidy.</P>
    <P>What is the position of the Cork airport?  Is that project dead?  As the House is aware, the proposal for the establishment of a civil airport at Cork was approved by the previous Government and arrangements were made for the necessary site survey before work on the construction of the airport commenced.  That site survey should have been completed by July of last year.  When I last dealt with the matter, I think it was in the month of March, it was assumed that the site survey operations would be completed in four months from that date.  The Minister has got the result of that survey.  Everything was ready to start work upon the construction of a civil airport at Cork unless the Government has decided there is going to be none.</P>

      <P>So far as I am concerned, I secured an agreement for the establishment of an airport in Cork in 1939, and if the Minister looks up the matter he will find that there was even held out at that time a prospect of contributions <Col N="566" /> from the local authorities in Cork.  Work was suspended during the war.  After the war, a new survey was carried out and that took a great deal longer than I expected.  The survey in regard to the incidence of fog lasted about three years and those conducting the survey were not prepared to give an authoritative opinion without three years' experience.  As soon as we got the result we took our decision and made arrangements to have that decision carried into effect.  Is it dead or not?  That is all I want to know. Have the Cork Deputies conspired with the Minister for Industry and Commerce to kill this project, or is it going to proceed?</P>
      <P>The traffic survey carried out by Aer Lingus established that the operation by Aer Lingus of air services from Cork would be quite profitable.  The Minister will find available in his Department the report of Aer Lingus upon the practicability and profitability of the operation of services from Cork to centres in Britain and ultimately to centres elsewhere.  The only thing required to enable these services to be provided is an airport.  That airport has to be provided as a State airport just as the airports in Dublin and Shannon.  One would have thought that the Minister would have given some hint on the position in that regard in his opening statement.  I am asking him to give a hint in his concluding statement to allay the Cork Deputies' anxiety.</P>

      <P>The Minister and I are both due to speak at a function of the Dublin Vocational Committee on the subject of apprenticeship training. Therefore, I do not want to forestall either what he or I will say on that occasion by referring to the need for apprenticeship legislation.  It is clear that we need in this country apprenticeship legislation.  The existing Apprenticeship Act is very largely ineffective. I had taken steps to secure the preparation of that legislation in consultation with the Trade Union Congresses and the Employers' Federation. <Col N="567" /> The Congress of Irish Unions asked me to postpone consultations with them pending the outcome of the negotiations for unity in the trade union movement.  I agreed to that course but the preparation of the heads of legislation was undertaken in the Department and should be available to the Minister.</P>
      <P>I do not know what the position is regarding these unity negotiations, whether there is any prospect they will come to an end soon or what the attitude of the Congress of Irish Unions is at the present time to the need for doing something in the matter of improving our apprenticeship legislation. I think it is one that should receive the early attention of the Minireceive the early attention of the Minister.</P>
      <P>There is another matter in that Labour Court was set up under the Industrial Relations Act for the purpose of minimising, and, if possible, eliminating trade disputes.  It was set up without powers.  That was done deliberately in the belief and expectation that in the process of time it would develop a moral authority which would be far more effective than any legal power the Dáil could give it; and it seemed to me that the Labour Court was building up that moral authority very successfully, so much so that in only a very small proportion of the cases which came under its attention did a stoppage of work ever eventuate. In the great majority of cases its recommendation was accepted, whether with a good grace or a bad grace, by the parties to the dispute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now that position of the Labour Court was created only when it was made clear to everybody likely to be concerned in trade disputes that there was no appeal from the court; that neither the Minister, nor the Lord Mayor, nor any other authority would intervene after the Labour Court had dealt with a dispute and issued a recommendation in regard to it.  I advise the Minister to maintain that position because he knows better than I do that no trade union leader can stand up against a demand from his members, who have had an adverse recommendation from the Labour Court, to use <Col N="568" /> other channels if there is the slightest prospect that by going beyond the Labour Court to a Minister, or to any other authority of any sort whatsoever, a better award can be secured.  The only way the Labour Court's awards can be made effective is when it becomes clear to everybody that it is the final word and that its findings have either to be accepted or there is a situation which nobody can resolve or which cannot be resolved without a stoppage of work.</P>
    <P>If there is any appeal, officially or unofficially, from the recommendation of the Labour Court that appeal will always be availed of and there will always be pressure by trade union members on their leaders before finally acquiescing in any proposal relating to their conditions of employment.  I was concerned to notice that a tendency to take a case from the Labour Court on appeal to somebody else was developing during the last year and, unless the Minister sets his face against that, it will eventually mean the disappearance altogether of the utility of the Labour Court.</P>
    <P>The Minister has spoken recently about unemployment and has shown what I have already described as a certain complacency in that regard.  I think there is reason to be very much concerned about unemployment statistics.  It is true that the total number on the live register is less than it was last year but the number of those who have become recently unemployed and who, because they were recently unemployed, are entitled to unemployment insurance benefit is significantly higher than it was last year.  That indicates that something is happening in the employment situation that requires attention.  The total number on the live register is not a figure of any very great significance at all: it is the number of men who are in receipt of unemployment insurance benefit, the men who have recently lost their jobs, that is the significant figure.</P>
    <P>Now the Minister has said that we have got to rely upon industry mainly for an expansion of employment here. I have been at some pains to try to discredit that idea, unless we can get in relation to industry a new approach <Col N="569" /> which will give results far exceeding anything that we have secured up to this.  Go through the trade and shipping statistics and pick out the manufactured commodities which are now being imported and which could in any conceivable circumstances be manufactured here on the basis of supplying the home market requirements, give the most optimistic interpretation to economic practicability here and I think you will find that the total value of all the goods that are now being imported which could conceivably by some means be manufactured here on the basis of home market sales will not exceed about £50,000,000 per annum; roughly speaking, £2,000 in gross output represents one man employed; consequently the utmost we can hope to get by way of additional employment in manufacturing industry through an extension of industry based upon the home market is 25,000 new jobs.</P>
    <P>If we did that in ten years it would be a tremendous achievement but it would mean an increase of only 2,500 jobs per annum and, indeed, employment in industry has been increasing at roughly that rate.  But we need about 15,000 new jobs per annum to hold our natural increase in population, to eliminate abnormal unemployment and to reduce emigration; it is clear that merely developing industry on the basis of the home market alone will not achieve a sufficient expansion in jobs to enable us to cope with that problem.  The main task of the Government, whatever Government is in office, is to organise the resources of the country so as to get that expansion of 15,000 a year in the number of jobs available for our people, whatever kind of jobs they may be, whether jobs involving wages or employment for people working on their own account.</P>
    <P>It is far more important that the Government should recognise how far short we are of the minimum necessary to give us security in that regard than that the Minister should be going around talking complacently about how satisfactory the employment position is.  It is far from satisfactory.  It was not satisfactory last year or in the previous year.  I had responsibility as <Col N="570" /> Minister for Industry and Commerce and I often had to speak here in relation to these unemployment figures; I never pretended at any time that there was in that situation something with which one could be satisfied.  I always tried to make the Dáil appreciate how much further we had to go, no matter how far we had come, before we could be justified in being complacent about the unemployment situation. However important industry may be, and industry can make a very big contribution no doubt, it alone cannot give us the expansion we require in employment.  That is something which needs a co-ordinated Government policy stretching over every field of Government activity, and that is one thing a Coalition Government cannot give us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>In the Estimate presented to us the Minister has covered in very great detail all the activities of his Department and expressed his opinion as to what may be the position in the coming year.  Following on the Minister's statement we had the advantage of listening to Deputy Lemass, who was himself Minister for Industry and Commerce for many years.  I have no intention of following the line adopted by Deputy Lemass because repetition will get us nowhere. Recently we spent a considerable time here discussing the question of prices. The views of the Labour Party were made very clear.  Let me say now to Deputy Lemass and to those who sit behind him that, to say the least of it, it is a bit of cheek for him to come in here and seriously suggest that those of us on these benches should share with him, as he said himself, in his insistence on the Minister doing certain things.  It is very important that we should, as it were, have it out with Deputy Lemass and those who sit behind him on this question of the introduction of foreign capital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of the members may not have been listening to Deputy Lemass at that time and some of them may not have heard the remarks made by the Minister when speaking on this important problem, but as Deputy Lemass concluded on the note of the importance of the industrialisation programme <Col N="571" /> we also must be prepared not to take it up piecemeal.  Let us examine the whole position, because I can recall&mdash;and it is not so long ago&mdash; when Deputy Lemass said something with which I personally agree, and that was that he was considering the urgent necessity of examining the whole position regarding industry and the question of tariffs.  With Deputy Lemass, there are people outside this Chamber who hold the same views. They lift their eyes to heaven in horror, as it were, if anyone is going to suggest the introduction of, or the asking of foreign capitalists to come to this country to help in the industrialisation of it.  Apparently, that is a sin for which no penance imposed can be heavy enough to make up for the suggestion of this terrible crime, but at the same time we are entitled to ask one very fair question: If, as a body, Irish industrialists strongly object to the introduction of foreign capital, are they in turn prepared to take the advantages offered to them by each Government in this country and are they in turn prepared to take on themselves the responsibility of the extension of Irish industry?</P>
    <P>That is a question that I believe must be answered and the sooner it is answered the better for everyone concerned. After all, where the Irish industrialist is concerned, no section of the community, none of our people, had ever objected to protection, because we all realise the importance of protecting Irish industry.  I am sure that with the introduction of this system to enable Irish industry to be built up&mdash;a notable development at the time, and one well worth advancing in&mdash;nobody believed at that time that it was going to be a system which should be kept in operation in every way possible by the continuance of tariffs all over the place.  Deputy Lemass has expressed his views on this and he made it quite clear at one stage that he was not satisfied that in return for the advantages and the protection given that every section of the Irish industrialists' community was in turn giving a fair return for that important measure of protection.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="572" /> As well as the important feature of protection that is being given by tariffs there is also, as mentioned by the Minister in great detail, the question of technical assistance.  Technical assistance in itself, while it may not cost an enormous amount of money, has never been objected to inside or outside this Chamber and the importance of providing this, whether for the home market or for export trade, has been generally recognised.  We understand full well that it is of great assistance that such technical advice can be offered.  Coupled with that, of course, the Minister has made it quite clear that he will not stand for any system of dumping of foreign articles, manufactured or otherwise, from the Near East or from the Far East which may interfere with industry in this country. That in itself is an indication, whether it comes from a Minister of the present Government or in the past Government, of the general view and of the fact that it is the view of members of this Chamber and of all Parties in it that we are particularly anxious to see that Irish industry is protected.  But coupled with all these protections we are still confronted with the appalling fact that even while, as mentioned by the Minister, the number of persons engaged in industrial pursuits has increased greatly, the increase has not yet got us out of the problem with which we are confronted, not alone this year but through all the years, the problem of unemployment.</P>
    <P>If Irish industrialists refuse to extend industry or take advantage of any assistances offered why should it be that the same people will insist that we do not offer any facilities to outsiders? God knows it is a hard thing to have to say, but surely it is true that, if we are to go through the various statistical records and see the large amount of money provided for necessary imports, imports of materials or manufactured articles that could have been manufactured here all the time, there is a question suggested which demands an answer from our own industrial group here.  It is fantastic, and it is utter rubbish for Deputy Lemass to try to suggest here naïvely with a depth of political insincerity in my opinion, that behind <Col N="573" /> this is a danger that the present Minister and the Government are, as it were, ready to sell out the Irish industrialists, but we do want a reasonable return for the assistance given and if Deputy Lemass is prepared to admit now as he said himself some time ago that that 100 per cent. return for assistance given is not forthcoming surely we will have to say to those people: &ldquo;We will have to go out and encourage others to come in if you are not going to throw your weight in fully&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Speaking on the question of the overall picture of tariffs, I believe it is well known that while many of our industrialists are undoubtedly in a strong position and are not hanging on to the old system of trying, as it were, to fleece the public, unfortunately there are some, I believe, still who seem to imagine that with the introduction of the tariffs and protection which they got at their infancy some 25 or 30 years ago was a right reserved for them and for them alone.  They seem to imagine the consumers must be told to endure a system of incompetency by some industrialists at the expense of the community as a whole.  It is important that the Minister would consider this and it is important that we all realise, as did our predecessors, that it is time to examine this whole position regarding tariffs.</P>
    <P>These industrialists who will give a good return, who will benefit the country, are entitled to the protection which undoubtedly we are prepared to continue to give them so long as they are doing their utmost to face their responsibilities and give in return a fair measure of satisfaction to the community but we must come to the time of admitting that some of the factories &mdash;I do not care whether set up under the inter-Party, Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael Governments&mdash;that we heard of being established in the past, are nothing but small sweat-houses in small lanes in Dublin and elsewhere, employing a handful of people, protected by tariffs and at the same time charging the consumer-community as a whole exorbitant prices for any stuff produced in these so-called factories. Must it not be admitted that it is a <Col N="574" /> condemnation of our present industrial system generally speaking when the present Minister must come here and say that it is urgently necessary for him to proceed with the Factories Bill to provide legislation to make sure of adequate and proper protection for workers in these factories?  Is it not a shocking state of affairs to say that we have to admit that clerical workers in these factories are expected to work under conditions which, I am sure, would not be tolerated in any other country?  I move to report progress.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not delay the House.  I have given reasons on a number of occasions for my belief that the present method of appointing rate collectors is most unsatisfactory.  I am speaking strictly from experience as a member of the local authority in County Roscommon.  For the information of Deputies, it might be no harm to outline what took place there recently in connection with the appointment of two rate collectors.  For 12 months before the appointments were made every member of the local authority was haunted by potential candidates.  The county councillors were canvassed not merely by the candidates but by their friends and their friends' friends.  I had not ease or peace for at least six months from people begging me to support this, that and the other candidate.  Two appointments were made.  I have no objection to either of the two men selected but I think that, when the council arrived at a decision, these people were appointed because they were able to use stronger political pull than the other candidates.  I do not think that is a fair basis on which to make any appointment in the public service.</P>
      <P>I would like to see a standard of education established, that every man appointed as rate collector will have to fulfil.  As far as I can see, there is no standard at all at the present time except that the successful applicant must be in a position to obtain the support of the majority of the members of the local authority.</P>

      <P>I do not think it would be a very difficult matter to have a written examination and to have an interview board set up to examine each candidate to see that an applicant is able to read and write and bless himself. I understand that for appointments as clerical officers to county councils or for appointments to the Civil Service political pull plays a very small part.  I hope that is the case. A man who has to handle accounts and <Col N="577" /> finance should have a good standard of education.  There is only one way of finding whether he has or not and that is by giving him a test.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want the position to be clarified and made uniform in all counties.  It may be that in some counties they go through the formality of testing each candidate's ability to read and write.  When that is over, the pressure begins.  It is quite possible that ten or 15 candidates could be interviewed by a board set up by a local authority, all of whom would pass the test and the man who got the lowest marks could be appointed by the local authority.  I think that is wrong.  The test only serves as a cover up.</P>
      <P>I was interested in Deputy Murphy's interjection.  I am sure Deputy Murphy would not like to see staff officers, home assistance officers or any other such local officers appointed because they were able to get the support of ten or 15 county councillors.  If regulations are laid down for the appointment of such officers, I do not see why similar regulations should not be enforced with regard to the appointment of rate collectors.</P>
      <P>I commend the amendment to the House.  I hope it will be accepted, because the present system is most unsatisfactory. I am sure there are other Deputies with views to express on this so, in conclusion, I will remind the House that when the Managerial Act came into force one of the functions left to the local authorities was this appointment of rate collector and I, for the life of me, cannot understand why that function is left to them.  It may be uncharitable to suggest that the people in the Custom House, or the top dogs if you like, felt that it would be desirable, while the county manager and his officials were guiding the destinies of the particular counties, that it would be better to have the councillors occupied in something else.  It would remind you of a crowd of dogs around a bowl&mdash;this situation in connection with the appointments of rate collectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is wrong that councillors' <Col N="578" /> minds should be occupied with such appointments when they should be on the more important issue of striking the rate and making every possible effort to reduce the burden of rates. It should not be necessary for them to devote their minds or occupy their time listening to the stories and the pleas of potential rate collectors.  I think it is most unfair that this function should have been left to them. It is not a question of asking Deputies or members of local authorities to shelve their responsibilities.  I think that such functions as this and as the selection of tenants for houses, which is a matter in which the county medical officer of health rightly has a very strong hand, should not be left to local authorities.  Certain Deputies may suggest that this amendment, instead of giving back power to the local authorities, would take powers away from them.  I am quite willing to accept any such criticisms because I feel that this is one power which the local authority should not have.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to endorse everything Deputy McQuillan has said in regard to this amendment. The amendment which stands in my name is intended to achieve the same purpose, but I am not sure whether we have accomplished the best types of amendment possible.  I feel quite sure, if the House and the Minister agree generally with the sense of the amendment and with the purpose behind it, that the Minister would be able on the Report Stage to introduce an amendment which would cover the purpose more fully and adequately.  As Deputy McQuillan pointed out, this is the only form of political patronage that was left to county councillors when the County Management Act was introduced, and one can see very little reason for it.  It has as we know&mdash; and I am not saying this by way of criticism of any Party in the House or in the country&mdash;to do with the appointment of rate collectors, and we know that such appointments have been regarded as being political.  In fact, they have been the breeders of the worst type of political patronage that could exist.  We should have enough courage to face up to that position and to put an end to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="579" /> I am quite certain that every responsible county councillor in the country would himself welcome a position where the county council was relieved of that responsibility.  I am not a member of a local body, but inevitably in the course of my political activities I have a good deal of contact with members of public bodies and I know the very serious problems created for them by these political appointments. We know that in certain cases where certain political majorities exist on county councils the tendency would be to appoint all the rate collectors from the members of that Party.  That is extremely bad.  It does not matter what Party happens to be in the majority; it is equally bad and has a demoralising effect on the public life of the country generally.</P>
    <P>One of the worst evils of this present position arises from the fact that, psychologically, it creates the impression in the minds of the public that wire-pulling and near-bribery are the effective methods of securing an appointment. That leaves a very bad odour.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether other Deputies in the House have had the same experience as I, but every day in my mail I am approached to use political influence in order to secure something for somebody, something to which a person is usually not entitled, on the grounds that that person is, and always has been, a close supporter of my political viewpoint.  I imagine others have had the same experience.  I imagine that many of those who write these letters to me, write letters couched in similar terms to influential Deputies in all Parties assuring every one of them that they have always supported them politically and have always voted for them or their Party.</P>
    <P>I think we would be doing something very useful if, as far as the appointment of rate collectors is concerned, we adopted this amendment or something along its lines, because I think no clearer example of political patronage exists than does in this.  I think that, on the whole, an amendment of this kind would be welcomed by members of public bodies throughout the country&mdash;at least by responsible members <Col N="580" /> of public bodies.  In the final analysis, of course, even the Party that have a majority on a public body and are in a position to give appointments of this kind to their supporters&mdash;even such a Party lose by it in the end because for every appointment they give they invariably make ten enemies.  Obviously, if they had the appointment of four or five collectors out of 20 candidates, the 15 or 16 not appointed become sworn enemies of the Party who did not appoint them, so that there are not even political advantages to be gained by the appointments.</P>
    <P>For these reasons I urge the Minister very strongly to accept this amendment.  I do not know whether Deputy McQuillan or myself have successfully framed the best type of amendment to deal with the situation we have in mind.  I think there is a slight difference in the amendment tabled by Deputy McQuillan and that put down by Deputies O'Connor, Tully and myself, but Deputy McQuillan's amendment would leave the option to the local authority whether or not to ask the Local Appointments Commission to make a recommendation for a certain appointment. According to the amendment which we have tabled it would become mandatory on the council to refer the appointment to the commission.  I am not quite satisfied that my amendment meets the situation as fully as would be desirable.  However, if we could discuss the question in principle then it would be an easy matter to frame an amendment that would deal with the position.</P>
    <P>We did discuss among ourselves whether the Local Appointments Commission would be the best body in whom to vest responsibility for making recommendations for these appointments. There are many arguments against it and there would be many arguments suggesting that some form of local board would be more suitable. But then you are up against the difficulty as to who is going to appoint the local board and as to whether or not the members of the board would be known locally.  Of course, if they were known locally their lives would be a hell to them because they would be the object of the canvasser.  But again <Col N="581" /> this is a matter upon which, I am sure, if the Minister agreed with the general purposes of the amendment, we could easily find the most satisfactory method of dealing with the situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies McQuillan and MacBride have severely indicted the system of appointing rate collectors by the county councils.  They have in mind, of course, the system which some councils operate of appointing rate collectors by a majority vote of the council.  I agree with a good deal of what they had to say in the matter but there is nothing mandatory in any sections of the Act to compel county councils to employ rate collectors or appoint them by vote of the council.  I have opposed that system myself for the reasons outlined by Deputy McQuillan, and the majority of the members of the Cork County Council believe that it is a bad system.  I am rather surprised, in view of the statements made particularly by Deputy McQuillan, that the Roscommon County Council has not viewed it in the same light and got rate collectors by some other system.</P>
      <P>I believe a more satisfactory system is collection through the office.  It is fair to everyone.  Down in Cork&mdash;I am sure what obtains in Cork obtains in every other local authority area in the country&mdash;we are informed by the manager and the county accountant that collection through the office costs somewhere in or around 40 per cent. to 45 per cent. of collection through the system of rate collectors no matter how they are appointed.  The council has adopted that method for some years back with very good results. Collection through the office is, in my opinion, more satisfactory than collection through the rate collectors and I think we have arrived at the stage when there is no need for rate collectors. Let the rates be collected through the office.  If it means extra staff in the office this staff will be recruited through competitive examination which means that a few extra boys and girls will get employment and will get it on a competitive basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Undoubtedly the statement made by Deputies McQuillan and MacBride is quite correct, that you cannot possibly <Col N="582" /> get an appointment by vote of the council unless you have very strong political pull and in many counties you would have to have support in two or three Parties in order to secure the appointment.  This is unquestionably a bad method and so far as Cork is concerned I believe it is a method that will never again be employed.  It is not that I am reflecting in any way on the integrity of individual county councillors but they are placed in an impossible position when applicants come to them, strong political supporters. It is rather difficult not to toe the Party line and vote for whoever the Party nominates.  In every county where appointments are made in this way the Party as a whole decides who they are to support and the members have to fall in line.  I am just making the suggestion&mdash;whether the Minister could give effect to it on the Report Stage or not, I do not know &mdash;that the vote system in regard to the appointment of rate collectors should be wiped out completely.</P>

      <P>I am not too favourably disposed towards handing over the appointments to the Local Appointments Commission because a rate collector is a somewhat different individual from other people.  I would be fearful that if the Local Appointments Commission had the making of these appointments they might possibly appoint what to them would seem the best man but when he would go down to his collection area he might not be the most suitable type of person for collecting rates.  We have a number of instances where undue pressure has been brought on certain ratepayers <Col N="583" /> to make them pay, as it were, forthwith. If the rate collectors had adopted a broader outlook and given those people a chance, perhaps until the next fair day, for a month or six weeks, they would have been able in many cases to meet their commitments.</P>

      <P>If we could find a system where counties would adhere to appointing rate collectors by getting some person with local knowledge in a particular collection district it might be of advantage.  Probably 70 per cent. of the people in an area might be in a position to pay their rates in one sum and you might have another percentage who, due to financial circumstances, might not find it so easy to pay in one sum and might require a little leniency from the rate collectors.  I am sorry to say that that leniency has not been extended in Cork by some of the collectors but so far as I can judge it has been extended by the office.  Where the collection is made through the office, if any member of the council approaches the office and explains that <Col N="584" /> so-and-so is not in a position to pay his rates for another few weeks he gets an opportunity&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that they should not be appointed by the vote of the council, but then there is a third danger if they are appointed back stage by some kind of anonymous selection board.  Is there any danger that there might be an approach by some back avenue to the personnel of the selection board?  I think it is a bad line to take to think that all these selection boards are infalliable, that they are above reproach.  I think it is quite in order to say that approaches have been made to the personnel of selection boards and possibly have had good results at times.  The Minister should bear that in mind.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I wish to say that the Minister should, if possible, make a law compelling councils to collect the rates through the offices, and the personnel would then be employed on competitive examination which would give satisfaction to people, to the Deputies who are moving these amendments, and every council in the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite obvious that Deputy Murphy has no confidence or faith in human beings.  He does not want rate collectors appointed by human agents, or rates collected by human agencies.  He wants a machine that is invisible.  That is all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A certain agitation has gone on for the amendment of the Management Bill, and for more powers to be given to local authorities.  I take it that is why the Minister brought it in, otherwise the machine was working reasonably and satisfactorily.  There is room <Col N="585" /> for amendment.  Every Act in this country could probably be amended in certain respects, with advantage. There was a cry during the last general election, and which had gone on for years: &ldquo;Give back the democratic control to the local authorities.&rdquo;  That cry was repeated and repeated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>And this is the answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>All over the country the cry came: &ldquo;Give us back our democratic control.&rdquo;  With a change of Government, the group most insistent for the giving back of democratic control was one wing of the present Government, the Labour Party.  There was a pleading and whinging cry which has gone on for years: &ldquo;Give back the democratic control to the local authority.&rdquo;  Now the Minister comes in with the Bill to give back some control to local authorities in some respects, not taking any more from them.  Deputy Murphy supports this amendment.  He objects to the amendment and he supports it.  He wants to take from the local authority the democratic control they have of making one appointment out of all the appointments of the other people in their employment.  Local authorities have a direct responsibility for electing one officer or a set of officers.  Those officers have collected the rates in a democratic way.</P>
      <P>Deputy MacBride and Deputy McQuillan must know quite well that local authorities have power, at the moment, to collect through the post. They must ask the Minister's sanction to depart from the system.  The Minister has power to waive that, for the Minister makes a case why it should be waived in each particular instance. They are appointed by examination, and the local authorities would have to ask the Minister to agree to allow them elect rate collectors by direct vote.  Every council has that power. It needs no amendment of the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some councils, in the exercise of their democratic rights, are determined that they will elect and select rate collectors by the direct vote of their council.  By and large they have succeeded admirably in getting suitable <Col N="586" /> personnel to collect those rates.  The Minister for Local Government knows quite well that the returns from almost every county council area where this law operates are reasonably satisfactory. The numbers of defaulters are infinitesimal, and now we have proposals from Deputy McQuillan and Deputy MacBride to do away with this and to hand over the few remaining powers and put them into a machine, an unknown machine and, as Deputy Murphy pointed out, with an unknown personnel.  That machine will, if the Dáil so decides, select rate collectors, and will send down to Deputy Murphy's area or my area people of whom we have never heard. They may come from any other part of Ireland.</P>
    <P>There is no power in law to compel the Appointments Commission to select personnel.  Every Irishman, no matter where he comes from, has a claim to be appointed by the Local Appointments Commission.  I believe that the present system in operation is not bad. It gives a certain amount of responsibility to every local authority.  It may make members slightly annoyed because they are canvassed, or because their door is knocked on a dozen or five dozen occasions, where there is a vacancy for a rate collector in a particular county.  Why should any of us offer ourselves as members of a local authority if we are not prepared to take a joke, so to speak, to do the business of a council and to take a responsibility in our hands?  The main complaint was that members of the council were being canvassed.  We do not object to our doors being knocked on on numerous occasions.</P>

      <P>There were a number of posts filled within the past year or two, and the group I represent did not get any of the appointments.  It was quite all right.  There were farmers' sons, workingmen's sons, selected who were good, useful men.  We had no grouse <Col N="587" /> whatever for not getting any of the appointments because the majority groups on the council made their appointments from other than those we voted for.  I have no objection to that. They were good, useful Wexford lads, quite capable of doing the work.  I am certain that if the Local Appointments Commission had made those appointments, not one of those Wexford boys would have got any of them.  Some careerists who studied for them would have walked in and got them.  Those neighbours of mine who are politically opposed to me would not have got them.  I am glad that the system was there, and that these lads from the country areas who are quite capable of doing the jobs got them.  An effort is being made here to-night, by the sober democrats who wanted to have more power given back to the local authorities, to get these few remaining jobs, where men can earn £400, £600 or £700 a year, into a machine, in order to fill them.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will oppose this amendment and leave this bit of democratic power in the hands of the local authorities.  It is not being abused in any way.  It is in operation now for a great number of years.  Each local authority have at the moment the power to elect, by competitive examination or otherwise, people to these posts.  I suggest that no amendment whatever to the Bill is necessary.  We believe it is good to see, for instance, County Longford men, County Meath men or County Westmeath men collecting rates in their own counties and appointed directly by votes, if the council so desire, in their own particular county.  It is humbug to say that there is anything wrong with the system or that politics enter into it, and so forth.  I have known men who went to politicians when a vacancy existed and yet they very quickly told their friends who appointed them, that they had a right to change their politics if they chose.  That is as it should be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe the House should reject these amendments and leave the local authorities this one bit of democratic power of selecting men or women in their own counties to fill a few £400, £600 or £700 a year jobs.  These jobs <Col N="588" /> are the only remaining jobs offering any kind of a decent livelihood that are filled by a democratic system in the hands of the local authorities.  I submit they will make fewer mistakes than the Local Appointments Commission or any other body that may be set up.  Whatever their politics may be I have full confidence in them.  If persons who support me politically are elected by my council then all to the good but, if they are not, I have no objection if someone who is opposed to me in politics gets the job.  The fact is that I am glad to see a person getting a job and I would prefer this system to any other system that could be devised.</P>

      <P>I am glad of this opportunity of putting our ideas on this amendment before the House.  I support the amendment.  Three years ago, the Kerry County Council advertised for 29 rate collectors.  We had not rate collectors in our county: we had what is known as a central system. On three successive occasions the auditor in his report recommended the council to consider the appointment of rate collectors.  We acted on the advice of the auditor and proceeded to appoint 29 rate collectors.  Needless to say, there was a mad scramble for 29 fairly good jobs in the county.  I suppose you could not blame the people.  They went head over heels in a mad scramble for the jobs and made life a misery for everybody concerned. Luckily enough, the Department stepped in and said: You cannot appoint 29 rate collectors: you can only appoint 26.  I submit there was no freedom there.  In my view it was a glorious opportunity to abandon the whole idea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Allen seems to take the matter very lightly&mdash;in fact, as a joke. As far as I am concerned, it is very far from being a joke.  Deputy M. P. Murphy seems to favour a central system.  As against that, the auditor recommended us on three successive occasions to appoint rate collectors.  I take it that the central system is a failure for this very simple reason. Why do the income-tax people not tell people to send them their income-tax and thus avoid having income-tax <Col N="589" /> collectors?  It must be obvious that it would involve a colossal saving to the Exchequer if the people could be persuaded to part with their money and send it in.  The same thing applies to rates.  Again, take, for instance, insurance companies.  Why do they not get people to send in their premiums? The reason is that the system would not work and, for that very reason, I believe the central system is a failure. Some people who have not experience of it think it is all sunshine, but it is not.</P>
    <P>The central system is devoid of all sympathy or understanding so far as people who are in difficulties are concerned. The rate collector who is conversant with the position in his area can have a sympathetic approach and adjust himself to the position as he finds it.  At times, terrible hardship is inflicted on ratepayers and that is especially so under the central system. People working under that system become bureaucrats in one or two years and they are immune from any attack from any public representative or anybody else.  They sit behind a desk in their office and plot their course.  Deputy Allen seems to think we are surrendering the last vestige of democratic right&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I hope Deputy Allen is.  I advise very strongly against the central system, in view of my experience of it.  It is a bad system. As I have already said, a local rate collector is surely approachable whereas if you have a rate collector for a county cloistered in an office he becomes a bureaucrat.  He works through a legal adviser.  He issues civil bills or prosecutions, as the case may be, without due regard to the capacity of the persons concerned to pay and irrespective of whether or not they are in difficulties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KathleenOConnor" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe the present system should be abandoned, even though it be a surrender of a democratic right, the last vestige of democratic right that is retained by a local authority.  A system whereby the advertisement for rate collectors can be confined to a county, confining it to Kerry men or Wexford men as the case <Col N="591" /> may be, would obviate any possibility of people coming in from Longford or Mayo to grab up the good jobs.  That work can be done by the men of the county, by confining the advertisement. It would be much happier for everybody. There are plenty of other powers which can be confined to a local authority and they will probably come up in the course of this discussion.  I would strongly recommend that some system like that of the Appointments Commission be devised for the appointment of rate collectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am inclined to agree with the point of view of my colleague, Deputy Allen, on the question that the integrity of local bodies and the powers which they had in the past are involved in the amendment. Time and again we had complaints from different parties&mdash;probably we had complaints ourselves&mdash;but we had not sufficient power in certain ways under the managerial system.  The general purport of this Bill is to widen the scope of the individual powers of elected representatives on local bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Against that background it is difficult to see how we should come to this House, as members of a local body, to complain about powers that we retained when the managerial system was introduced.  It is difficult to understand why we should complain that that power&mdash;the simple power of appointing rate collectors&mdash;was not taken from us along with other powers. In fact, it must be tremendous vindication of the Managerial Act generally. The first thing I would ask myself as a member of a local body is this&mdash;has the system tended in the past towards getting us a bad type of rate collector? What type of rate collector have we appointed under this system?  Are our collectors capable of doing their work or have we appointed men who were not qualified, who have proved to be duds and who have not been successful in their jobs?  I can speak only for my own county and the Minister will bear me out&mdash;and I am sure it influenced him in the drafting of the Bill&mdash;when I say that we have been very fortunate and have neither corruption nor incompetent <Col N="592" /> or unsuccessful collectors.  To advocate here now a change in the system would be a reflection on those we have appointed in the past.  It would mean telling the House it has been an unsuccessful system and that through it we got unsuccessful rate collectors.  We have no such thing.</P>
    <P>I do not know a single instance&mdash; or that any member of a council ever could put on record a single instance&mdash; where there was any corruption or undue political bias used in the appointment of a rate collector.  We certainly have had our share of people soliciting our support, but to say that the objection to the system is that the preponderance of political influence one way or another in a council is used to get a particular political appointee successfully installed in office, is simply saying that any council will use its political majority and use every power in that Bill when it becomes an Act to force through decisions in favour of friends or political favourites.  It is merely a question of whether the particular local body will use its political influence or not, if it has a majority, using the different powers that are given to councils under this or any other Act relating to local authorities.</P>
    <P>I simply apply the test as to whether we have got a suitable rate collector in the past or not and I must agree that the system has worked quite well.  We may at times have incurred the displeasure of certain candidates.  A local representative cannot support everybody, but a local representative who is worthy of being appointed to represent his people on a local authority should be able to stand on his feet and take a decision on behalf of someone he thinks is a suitable candidate for the job and support him.  If he does that, he will find that his actions will be commended eventually and that he will be looked up to.  I do not know if the system lends itself to corruption in other areas or not&mdash;possibly it does&mdash; but I will say&mdash;in favour of a council which has had many vicissitudes with regard to political majority&mdash;that by and large this system as I know it has worked reasonably well, and has given us reasonably good men in the job who have carried out the work successfully. <Col N="593" /> For that reason, I would not like to cast any reflection on the work we have been doing under the system in the past, by condemning it here now.  I would be satisfied to maintain the <i>status quo</i> so far as the system is concerned and for that reason I do not fully agree with the proposed amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>This discussion undoubtedly can be very helpful to us on all sides.  As Deputy MacBride mentioned, even the amendments may not all tend towards being perfect, but surely we can discuss them without any commiserations or cross-talk.  It is well known that Deputy Allen cannot understand our situation.  Deputy Allen has a colleague here at present, Deputy MacCarthy, and it would be well for him to understand that in Cork his whole Party decided on a certain line of action.  If we are going to discuss this, let us try to forget the cheap gibes as to whether we are speaking about the honesty or dishonesty of the successful candidate.  We are only discussing the system of appointment. Surely if we believe&mdash;as many of us do believe&mdash;that the present system is not all that it could be, we will not get any further towards improving it by cross-talk or cheap gibes about honest or dishonest political Parties or political rate collectors.  Let us forget that.</P>
      <P>In order that one may get a fair picture of the whole problem, I would mention the system we have in operation, instead of what Deputy O'Connor calls the central system.  Every two and a half or three years, there is an examination to admit boys and girls into the service.  Our system has been by a majority vote, members of all Parties expressing their views.  The system put into operation was that by collecting through the office there were automatically jobs for boys and girls, who by their ability in the written and oral tests passed the examinations and were put on a panel.  While the amendments suggested by Deputy McQuillan and others are not all that we would wish them to be, my opinion is that the best system would be through the appointment of boys and girls who have proved their ability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I consider that these amendments <Col N="594" /> make provision for a better system than the system in operation.  There is no use in our indulging in argument as to whether members, in giving their votes, were honest or dishonest in their political outlook, nor is there any use in our speaking of the merits or demerits of candidates on the basis of their political convictions.  We simply concern ourselves here with the problem: Is there a better way of appointment of rate collectors than the present system?  Some of us believe that there is, and it is because we believe there is a possibility of a better way that we support these amendments.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, with regard to the viewpoint expressed by some Deputies that members of local authorities should accept the responsibility of voting, that is all very fine, but, as a member of a local authority, I am entitled to put this consideration before myself.  There may be a vacancy for a rate collector in an area 90 miles away from the area I represent.  Would I be in a position to say that I could examine the merits and demerits of all the candidates in an area so far away?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but the qualifying examination is not always put into operation and, as we have seen, the results of these examinations have not been an overriding factor in the selection of candidates in many instances. As the nearest approach to what we consider to be a better system than the present system we&mdash;Deputy Murphy and I&mdash;are in favour of these amendments.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;or the filling of vacancies as district justices.  We all know that, in civilised democratic countries, where you have rule by a majority, the majority can, in their wisdom, pick qualified people from their own supporters&mdash;and I say &ldquo;qualified&rdquo;&mdash;to fill these vacancies and nobody questions the qualifications of these people.  The fact is that there is this exercise of the power of dispensing this kind of favour, if you like, as one of the plums of office, of being a Government or the majority Party in a local authority.  I am therefore very amused to hear Deputy MacBride approach this matter as he did when he came into the House first when he wanted every member of the House to be in his seat all the time the House sat, doing nothing but legislating.  He even wanted a law passed preventing Deputies from having access to the Departments of State.  Now he has changed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The argument which Deputy MacBride made in favour of his amendments was to the effect that canvassing by applicants&mdash;he did not say so, but I assume that he meant qualified persons&mdash;was in itself a distasteful act and almost in a sense an act leading to corruption. I am in agreement with Deputy O'Connor in the argument he put forward, except that the argument which he makes for the amendment is the argument I would make against it. I agree with most of what he says.  It would be a fatal blunder to have what is called a central office for the collection <Col N="596" /> of rates.  I believe that what he says is correct, that the rate collector who goes from house to house and who knows the circumstances of the moment, can exercise a certain leniency, can help the people over stiles by taking the rates on an instalment basis.  If he is the humane person Deputy O'Connor describes him as, that part is easy enough, but he must be somebody from the area who knows these people and dealing almost with his own neighbours.  Generally speaking, the collection of rates particularly where this form of appointment operates is always very high and very satisfactory.</P>
      <P>The only fault which the movers of these amendments find with the system is that they do not like the method by which these people are appointed, but they have not said a word of adverse comment on their effectiveness as rate collectors, notwithstanding the method of appointment. I am a member of a local authority and I have more confidence in open appointment to a position by the councillors than I have in an appointment made by a selection board, the members of which nobody knows and the members of which in many cases do not know the applicants as well as do the public representatives and who have no further responsibility, once their recommendation has been accepted.</P>

I hope we will have the right to appoint a city manager and I hope it will be done openly and above board, because I believe that Deputy O'Connor and I, if we have the responsibility of appointing a person for a specific job, will give more consideration to his capacity to do the job than to his friendship with either of us or his political allegiance.  I have more confidence in the responsibility that local representatives have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that Deputy MacBride should consult a little bit more fully with some members of his own Party who are members of local authorities. <Col N="597" /> You have the position where a local authority may opt to fill these positions by one method or another, by having the collection made by themselves in the office or by rate collectors. The whole trouble is that we are thinking of the distant past.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy always uses the word &ldquo;twist&rdquo;.  If there is a division on these amendments, I certainly <Col N="598" /> will oppose them because I think what Deputy Allen says is correct.  The Labour Party in particular demanded full restoration of all the powers of democracy to the local authorities.  It was one of their planks on the platforms during the general election.  One of the things usually thrown at Fianna Fáil as a Government was why they did not do this.  The present Minister said he was going to do it.  It was one of the 12 points, I believe.  Every move that is being made is taking away from the local authorities the few little rights they had under the managerial system.  I hope the House will not take seriously, as a reason for supporting the amendments, the arguments made either by Deputy McQuillan or Deputy MacBride.</P>
      <P>I have yet to hear of county councils appointing rate collectors who are unsatisfactory.  I think it was Deputy Allen who pointed out that the only persons for whom a canvass can be made, if there is a canvass, are those who will have qualified beforehand.  If there is any doubt, surely to goodness the local authority can say that only those who have properly qualified and passed the test may apply for consideration and election by the local authority.</P>
      <P>Deputy MacBride referred to the situation which confronts all of us in regard to the constituent who writes a letter and says he is exercising his political affiliation as one of the rights he has to demand.  I get a number of letters and I get an occasional letter like that too.  If the Deputy and I in times of an election invoke the aid of a number of voluntary people to help us&mdash;sometimes some of them are unemployed persons&mdash;and if they believe in our policy and if afterwards a particular post arises in a factory or anywhere else and if this man is capable and unemployed and anxious for the work, surely to goodness he has the right to ask us to give him some support?  I am amazed at this heavenly, almost supernatural, attitude of life that Deputy MacBride is trying to introduce into ordinary modern politics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. MacCarthy Mr. MacCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposed to these amendments because I think there is sufficient discretion in the <Col N="599" /> existing law for the exercise of common sense by any local authority in making the appointments referred to.  They can in the first place get the manager to appoint an interview board which will insist on a certain standard.  They can have the appointments made by the council on a fulltime basis.  We have two or three such men in Cork.  I am in favour of promotion of men who justify themselves in working for the public authority once they get by the recognised channels through competitive examination. They are placed on a panel or they are placed by the manager in the health offices, the rates offices or the roads offices or wherever he may place them. Having had experience there, the council selects the most competent man or the manager selects him from the rates department to act in the office as a rate collector.  It is just the same as if he were travelling from house to house.  He came from the public and as a result of his own merits he gets promotion to that particular office without any influence whatever.  He has risen to that position.  If there is occasion to go to a fair or a market he is the man who is in charge&mdash;he will have two or three others with him &mdash;to meet people whose circumstances perhaps are such that they cannot meet their demands readily.  He is not so inhuman that he is not prepared to do that.  That is the second system.</P>
      <P>The third system is election by the public authority itself.  An advertisement is issued and a certain number of names come in.  Perhaps the different Parties decide on a candidate.  Surely they will have to justify themselves to their own supporters and followers for the selection they make.  They go before the council and a vote is taken and, if the council approves, somebody is appointed.  No Party in Cork has a majority on the council and it is ridiculous for anybody to say that this Party or that Party are in a position to appoint a rate collector there.  They are not.  The man has to stand his chance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have all three systems applied in Cork.  We have a few permanent men who were appointed by interview <Col N="600" /> boards some years ago.  We have a number of districts done by office collection. They cost exactly half of what it would cost if you appointed rate collectors as such.  At the same time, the big majority of the districts are collected by rate collectors who were elected by the vote of the council.  Now there are only two rate collectors in the whole county who did not qualify for the special bonus awarded for a 95 per cent. rate collection last year. That shows that competent men are appointed.  Regardless of what their politics may have been, they were certainly fitted for the job.</P>
    <P>With these three alternatives before us, I fail to see how anybody can look for a fourth.  The Appointments Commissioners are there for the purpose of filling key positions.  That is their only purpose.  Local men know best the needs of their own particular areas. They know the people who are likely to serve most efficiently and who are likely to have due consideration for all their interests.  I do not think these amendments should receive the support of the House.</P>

      <P>I have never heard anything against Wexford, Donegal or Cork.  I am in sufficiently close touch with the workings of public bodies to know what I am talking about; we have representatives on most public bodies throughout the country.  I know the problems with which they have to deal.  I know how often these problems are put before us from different parts of the country.  I wish that Deputies, instead of trying to pretend that appointments of that kind are made purely on merit and that every county councillor has the right approach, would face the difficulties and, irrespective <Col N="602" /> of Party affiliations, get together in an attempt to remedy the position. I think that would make for much healthier public life.  Deputy Briscoe complained that I had objected in the past to members of the Dáil interfering in Government Departments.  I did object, I still object and I think the Dáil would be a much better place if Deputies limited themselves and their activities to legislating here.</P>

      <P>Possibly the reason why this attitude to appointments on public bodies has arisen is because of something that happened in the past. The fact that there is a wrong approach to appointments on public bodies arises, I think, from historical reasons to a certain extent.  For a long time public bodies were the only bodies composed of Irish people&mdash;fully national bodies&mdash;and the result of that was naturally that an effort was always made to appoint people who had national views.  Probably that was quite a good reason at the time.</P>

We have got rid of that domination now and surely we should aim at trying to set the highest standard we can in public life.  I think that would benefit all Parties.</P>

If they examine the position seriously I think they will realise that the present system is a bad one and appreciate that, even if a particular appointment has operated to their temporary advantage in a particular case, ultimately it has had adverse reactions on their own organisation.

      <P>I do not know enough about it.  I trust Deputy O'Connor's judgment and Deputy McCarthy's far more in relation to these matters because they are familiar with the particular problem. I am not so much concerned about particular appointments.  The fact that 100 <Col N="604" /> or 200 rate collectors are appointed on a political basis may not be good for public administration, but the country can survive that.  What is particularly bad is the psychological outlook which that type of political appointment breeds in people generally.  It is that situation I would like to see remedied. I appeal to Fianna Fáil Deputies, many of whom I am sure in their hearts agree with this proposal, to support this amendment in the realisation that it will make ultimately for much healthier public administration if it is carried into effect.</P>

      <P>Three attempts have been made to amend the County Management Acts. The first attempt was made some seven years ago by one of my predecessors, the present Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, Deputy Keyes, when he was Minister for Local Government. He made the first attempt.  My immediate predecessor, the present Deputy Smith, made the second attempt, and in I am making the third attempt, and in no case did either of my two predecessors consider or insert in their Bill a section to amend the law as suggested by these particular amendments. So far as I can recollect it was never even discussed despite the fact that those Bills had reached Committee Stage.  Prior to the preparation and introduction of this Bill, I interviewed all the local authorities in this country, or rather their representatives. I put the specific question to 20 of them&mdash;did they wish to denude themselves of the sole&mdash;of that power which they had left of the appointment of rate collectors?</P>

I put that <Col N="605" /> question to representatives of 20 county councils and 17 of them begged me for God's sake not to denude them of that power.

I carried out the same procedure in the case of Donegal as I carried out in every other county, and I had the full co-operation of every other local authority.  In the case of Donegal, I understand the chairman omitted to inform the vice-chairman of my proposed visit.  I will go further&mdash;I discussed the objection Deputy Blaney has now mentioned and said: &ldquo;I am prepared at a later date, and before I introduce the Bill, to have you discuss it and forward to me your representations.&rdquo;  I must say there was a full discussion in Donegal County Council; they forwarded suggestions to me, and I accepted them <i>in toto.</i> I do not think it is fair for Deputy Blaney to suggest that I did not get the views, or that the views that I was given were not those of the local authority as a body.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>

      <P>So far as I understand I gave sufficient notice to each local authority of my proposed visit, and I requested them to call a meeting of their local authority and discuss the matter and let me have their views.  I <Col N="607" /> think those are the terms of the circular I sent out.  I gave each and every local authority an opportunity of meeting and, through their chairman and vice-chairman, giving me the view of the majority.

      <P>I see no reason why I should not give them.  The counties which suggested that there should be no change, and that they should retain the power of appointing rate collectors were&mdash;Wexford, Laois, Sligo, Waterford, Longford, Galway, Mayo, Cork, Carlow&mdash;that is the administrative area&mdash;Kilkenny, Monaghan, Louth, Meath, Tipperary (North Riding), Limerick, Offaly and Tipperary (South Riding).  I am giving only the names of the counties which suggested there should be no change in the method of appointing rate collectors.  There were a few counties which ignored the question such as County Donegal and made no recommendation whatsoever on that particular point and I am not including them.  Neither am I including them as against the present system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Speaking as one of the representatives of Wicklow County Council, previous to your visit we had no discussion whatsoever and I do not believe that view represents the feeling <Col N="608" /> of the council.  I believe the feeling of the council is that they should have the appointment of rate collectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to that, I must, in fairness, say that Wicklow County Council was the very first council I visited and I am afraid they had no opportunity of even knowing what my visit was about.  It was only when I explained to them and took them through the Act section by section that we came to a decision and with regard to taking them through the Act section by section, it may be we did not fully consider the section on rate collectors.</P>
      <P>I am putting it this way&mdash;I want to be fair to the movers of the amendment&mdash;I am giving them the maximum number of counties that could possibly be said to be in favour, namely, three. I have no positive reply from Wicklow so I am putting it in that way that it is one of the &ldquo;No's&rdquo; but I am not holding that as being the expressed view.  I am merely giving you what I found out.</P>
      <P>Deputy McQuillan, in amendment No. 5, suggested that the matter should be left to the Local Appointments Commission.  I think it is agreed that the Act of 1926 applied to the more important posts under local authorities.  It was never intended to cover minor appointments such as this. That amendment as it stands would cover appointments down to the lowest appointment of rate collectors for the smallest urban area.  In fairness to Deputy McQuillan, I think Deputy MacBride said that it possibly was loosely drafted but we will not discuss the drafting now; we will discuss the broad principle.  Deputy MacBride, Deputy Tully and Deputy O'Connor have a similar amendment in amendment No. 6 but they go further and say that the Local Appointments Commission when making recommendations for the appointment of rate collector shall take into account local knowledge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, local knowledge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Who will give them the local knowledge?  Where will they get the local knowledge?  Surely, the only place is from the county council <Col N="609" /> and if the county council has to supply the local knowledge they must set up a priority list which they will forward to the Local Appointments Commission and if the Local Appointments Commissioners are to follow the priority list sent up by the local authority we are back to the very same position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>We will leave it at that then.  Then amendment No. 31 is an amendment in which there is a broad distinction as to who should appoint rate collectors.  In that amendment, it is suggested that the powers should be taken out of the hands of the local authority and given to the county manager.  There is a broad principle there.  There is a big difference between that and amendments Nos. 5 and 6 and if I am pressed on that amendment I am prepared to leave it to a free vote of the House.</P>
      <P>I have given the House, first of all, the views expressed to me by the local authorities and I am prepared to accept the views of this House by taking off the Party Whips and leaving it to a free vote but let us remember that in this Bill we set out to restore to the local authorities some of the powers of which they allege they were denuded by the introduction of the County Management Act and if we are going to restore some of the powers to them it is rather difficult to do it by taking from them this power they have of appointing rate collectors.</P>
      <P>Deputy McQuillan would like the House to believe that local authorities spend their days wrangling over the appointment of rate collectors.  On an average a local authority appoints a rate collector once every year.  On an average all over the country a county council has the appointment only once per year of a rate collector.</P>

      <P>It is ridiculous to suggest that the entire time of the local authority is taken up in discussing the appointment once per year of a rate collector.  It is just carrying it a little too far to make that suggestion.</P>
      <P>Deputy MacBride referred to the receipt of letters by Deputies and he was certain that members of local authorities would also be inundated with letters canvassing their support for various applicants.  Of course, Deputies are inundated with letters from their constituents and sometimes Ministers are inundated with letters, not from their constituents, but from Deputies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>But no person takes any exception to that.  It is the duty of a Minister to reply to letters and it is the duty of a Deputy to write to Ministers because it is much better sometimes than interviewing because you have something concrete which you can pass on to your constituents.  I do not think it would be a very strong argument against taking from a local authority the appointment of a rate collector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am inclined to agree with the Minister that amendment No. 5 is not exactly the best way to meet the difficulties some of us see in connection with the present method of appointing rate collectors and, as an alternative, I am sure a further amendment could be included, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, that is amendment No. 31, that instead of the appointment being made by the Local Appointments Commission it would be a function reserved to the county manager and this appointment in future would be made by a board set up within the county.  That system is in operation at present for many appointments to officerships under a local authority and I see no reason why this type of board should not function in respect of the appointment of rate collectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister more or less took me to task.  I think he took me up wrongly. He suggested that I maintained that a considerable amount of the time of local authorities was taken up discussing <Col N="611" /> the appointment of rate collectors. I did not say any such thing.  I do not believe that much time is taken up. The actual appointment may not take much more than 20 minutes.  It is the preliminaries that I am interested in, and they start about 12 months before the appointment is made.  I know for a fact that in several counties, about 18 months before a rate collector is due to retire, potential candidates investigate his age to find out when he is due to retire.  I see them doing that two years before the rate collector retires. From the moment they discover the date of his birth, they get into full stride and annoy and pester the county councillors and the relations of county councillors and their relations again.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and that it would be wrong to deprive the county councils of the privilege of making these appointments.  Have we reached the stage when the only prestige attaching to being a county councillor is the privilege of puffing out your chest as a local little commissar and saying: &ldquo;I have a big say in the appointment of the rate collector&rdquo;?  Is it suggested that a man will offer his services on a public body for the purpose of setting himself up as a little local great fellow about whom the people of the locality may say: &ldquo;He is a county councillor.  He can do this, that and the other with regard to appointments&rdquo;?  I have seen this happening with regard to the preliminary canters, as I describe them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Within the last few months Roscommon County Council had a meeting to strike the rate and every Deputy who is a member of a local authority knows, that is a very important day in the council as regards <Col N="612" /> its functions.  I met two gentlemen that morning on my way into the meeting and they said: &ldquo;The big day is on to-day.&rdquo;  I presumed they were talking about the striking of the rate and I was astonished to find out that what really was interesting the two was that two rate collectors were to be appointed on that day.  That had been the subject of conversation for months in every farmhouse within the constituency concerned.  It was discussed who the likely winners were to be in the coming derby of the rate collectors.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to get this cleared up once and for all.  Deputy Allen and the other Deputies who spoke and supported him have produced no evidence in support of their contention that the present system should be retained.  I do not want to be taken as casting any aspersions on the individuals already appointed; I am not interested in their politics but I can see no real argument against the suggested amendment that I am putting forward.  All I want to ensure is that it is the most deserving and the most qualified people who will be appointed in the future.  I am not saying a word against those who have been appointed but at times perhaps far more deserving candidates could be and should be appointed but they had not got the political influence necessary.  Deputy Brennan was very fair about the whole thing but it is not quite as simple as he suggests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sometimes a candidate has come to me and I have asked him how he is getting on in his canvass.  I have been told that he has interviewed various councillors and that some of the councillors had told him that they were not in a position to give any promises until their political Party had held a meeting.  That meant that the Party meeting was the preliminary canter. It was the place in which it was decided what horses would get nominated in a particular area.  As I have said that was the first gallop.  When the candidate is selected by one Party his next step is to try to get the support of the other councillors belonging to other Parties.  In the end he must have <Col N="613" /> the support of at least three Parties&mdash; he must have a leg planted in each of three.</P>
    <P>I want to get back again to the origin of the whole thing.  When all other powers were being stripped of local authorities why was this function of the appointment of rate collectors left to them?  So far I have not got any Deputy to answer that.  Why was that particular power left to the local authorities?  In dealing with amendment No. 5, I should like to ask the Minister why it became necessary in 1926 to bring in the Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Act?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of lack of suitable candidates in the locality&mdash;for lack of suitable candidates among doctors and engineers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>That would, of course, be part of the reason and I accept it as part of the reason.  It was decided in the national interest that it would be the best system.  Later, again, when the Managerial Act came in in 1940, powers that up to that had been fixed in the local authorities were stripped from them&mdash;the appointment, for instance, of tenants to council houses and so forth.  These powers were taken but one power left was the power to appoint rate collectors and, seeing that the Minister was good enough to answer my question with regard to the 1926 Act, I will now ask him another: Why was it necessary in 1940 to leave this power to the local authorities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course I cannot tell the Deputy what was in the mind of my predecessor but I understand the excuse offered&mdash;perhaps I should not say excuse; reason would be a better word&mdash;was that the local authority was responsible for striking the rate and that they should be given the opportunity of appointing the best men to collect the rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I must thank the Minister for his reply, but I am suggesting that in the visits he made to local authorities within the last 12 months he has not satisfied this House that he has got the actual views of the <Col N="614" /> majority of the members of local authorities on this question.  I am not criticising the Minister or his visits but he has made statements in the House with regard to various county councils and within a few moments Deputies have denied that these were the views of the particular local authorities in question.  I am personally of the opinion that most Deputies will agree with me that the system I have outlined as having been in operation in my own and other counties is a wrong one and one which should be got over. Deputy MacCarthy has said that in Cork they were quite satisfied with the system as it operated there, and that in his opinion it should be adopted in Roscommon.  I would like to assure Deputy MacCarthy that I tabled a motion in the Roscommon County Council three years ago and, in support of my motion, I got the necessary evidence from Kerry in order to convince the council.  But I was beating the air.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>That was democracy at work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Allen has said that is a form of democracy, but I believe that the Deputies here, including Deputy MacCarthy, will agree that the system as I have shown it is wrong. It is in order to remedy that wrong that I have tabled amendment No. 31. The question of giving power to local authorities is an important one.  I think it was never envisaged that a local authority would be able to set itself up as a separate unit within the State and decide on itself to make appointments in this particular method while the council in the county beside it was entitled to adopt another method.  I do not see why such scope should be left to local authorities at all.  There may be individuals in the House to say it is extraordinary that when this Act is being brought in with the purpose of restoring some powers to local authorities there should be a motion such as this to take powers away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not make any bones about it that I think personally this is a power that local authorities should not have; that there should be a decision on it either one way or the other.  If the county councils are to have the power <Col N="615" /> to appoint rate collectors why not also give them power to appoint tenants to houses, to appoint county managers, home assistance officers, and others? Give them the power to appoint every other official in the county as well as rate collectors.  Why just give them this power to appoint rate collectors only?  Be reasonable in your approach; give them all or take all from them.  I should like to say that I am not interested in pushing amendment No. 5, but I would be interested if the House would accept the principle of it as I have tried to envisage in amendment No. 31.  I understand we are discussing amendment No. 31 as well as amendments Nos. 5 and 6.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>It will save us discussing it at a later stage, and I should like to get the sympathy of the House to see that a fair system is put into operation in all counties for the appointment of rate collectors.  Neither myself nor a few other individuals who are members of particular local authorities in Roscommon can persuade the other members to see our way of thinking and I would like that it would be made possible by this House that we would ensure that as far as the appointment of rate collectors is concerned that merit comes first and not the old idea that is abroad in people's mind at the present time, that the necessary qualification to secure appointment is not what you know but who you know and how well you know him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the attitude of the Minister in this matter and I will certainly withdraw my amendment in favour of amendment No. 31 so that it can be left to a free vote of the House.  I feel sorry, however, that when the matter is being left to a free vote so few members of the House <Col N="616" /> have been present during the discussion to hear the arguments for and against.  I hope, notwithstanding that, the House will be prepared to accept amendment No. 31.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>During the course of this discussion, the Minister admitted what I suspected was, in fact, the position in so far as his tour through the country was concerned and his contacts during that tour with the chairmen and vice-chairmen of the different local bodies whose areas he visited.  I suspected that in many of these cases he was really getting, not the view of the local authority or a majority view of that body but the personal opinion of the individuals whom he met.  I would not have the slightest hesitation in saying, notwithstanding what has been said here, that if this matter were left to the decision of the members of county councils, they would naturally, and in my view rightly, by a majority decide in favour of retaining the powers which they now have.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am inclined to agree, but that is not the only county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Anyhow, I am thankful to the Minister for his generosity towards the area that naturally is the most important place in the world to me.  At the same time he has interfered with my line of thought, if I really had any serious thought at all, so to that extent I am not a bit grateful to him. I said I would venture to guess what those local bodies by a majority would do and rightly do.  Let me say more. When we of this Party were discussing <Col N="617" /> the question as to whether this power should be left with local bodies, I happened to be at the time a member of a local body and as far as I can recall, my own view was against the decision that was made then.  If I am convinced now that the course that was taken was right, it is because I have had a good deal of experience since then.</P>
      <P>What I cannot understand on the part of some Deputies is this.  They are greatly concerned about what members of county councils will do. They seem to regard them as a lot of irresponsibles.  But let anyone here go into a council chamber, meet these men at a conference table or listen to them discussing the affairs of their area and he could not reasonably come forward here and show all this concern as to their incapacity to appoint a few rate collectors, as the Minister has stated, one each year for each county council in the country.</P>
      <P>It is only a few weeks since the present Attorney-General, addressing a Fine Gael Convention in County Galway, drew attention to the fact that this piece of legislation was designed to give to local bodies a greater power. He expressed the hope, and he expressed not only the hope but the conviction, that as a result of the extension of the powers that were contained in this Bill, a better type, moryah, of representative or candidate would present himself to the electorate.  You cannot merely talk this away by trying to anticipate the argument of those who are in favour of the present position.  You cannot meet the case by saying: &ldquo;I know you may charge me with criticising and complaining over the last nine, ten or 15 years because you have deprived members of local bodies of this power&rdquo;, You will say to me: &ldquo;Those who were carrying on that campaign are now asking the Legislature to relieve the local body of the one substantial power they have.&rdquo;  You just cannot justify the inconsistency you show by making that case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the present Attorney-General made these remarks at the meeting to which I have referred, he had in mind, of course, that judges are appointed on <Col N="618" /> a political basis, that briefs are distributed on a political basis.  There is no use in any member of this House, whether he is in Fianna Fáil or any other Party, pretending that the public cannot see this.  When we stand up here and express our concern for democracy because of the way in which these powers will be abused by the elected members down the country, the people must say: &ldquo;Surely they have their tongues in their cheeks,&rdquo; and they must have a good laugh at us.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies here have suggested all kinds of methods by which these appointments could be made.  Some of them do not look too kindly upon the machinery of the Local Appointments Commission, and not being satisfied with that machinery, some of them suggested that it should be some form of local committee, or some form of interview board.</P>
    <P>It was on a previous stage of this measure that I made reference to the powers exercised by the managers all over the country in that regard, and I expressed my doubt and my fear and suspicion of that system, and I will express it again, because there are dangers in that system ten thousand times greater than the danger that a local body&mdash;a county council&mdash;might decide to appoint the son of a member of that body, or a brother of a member of that body.  What is that system? Is it not the bringing together by some officials of a number of men within the area of the council itself or outside the area&mdash;in all cases mainly outside the area?  Is it not apparent to any person who wants to look at the thing squarely that that system is full of dangers, and that the activities of secret societies and secret organisations of all kinds can come fully to play on it?  As far as I am concerned, I would prefer a thousand times to have these minor appointments made by a free vote of the council, even though in a few cases they were not just perfect, rather than made by a type of machinery that some people seem to think might look well on the outside and which would be satisfactory to all concerned, and would be a source of protection to democracy. That is the very thing that would undermine it, that will produce a complete lack of confidence and trust. <Col N="619" /> In fact, I would say, even the extent to which the power which managers have at the present time has been exercised through that system, has tended to shake considerably the confidence of many people who are watching it closely and intelligently.</P>
    <P>As I say, when this proposal was first mooted I was not openly hostile to it.  But when you give them that responsibility it is not out of the way to say: &ldquo;Well, having given that responsibility we will allow you to devise the machinery by which you are going to collect rates&rdquo;.  I did not intend to intervene in this discussion at all.  My own mind was completely clear.  As Deputy Allen and Deputy Brennan have said, it is natural, where members of a political Party have a majority, that majority will exercise its power.  No matter how you appoint officials, are they not going to have political views anyhow?  Take the Civil Service and the Local Appointments Commission.  Did you ever hear of an official&mdash;I do not know of any&mdash; appointed through any machinery you may think of, who will not have a political view both before and after? What harm will it do him?</P>
    <P>Deputy Allen said that the rate collectors do their work well.  Deputy Brennan, from a different part of the country, said likewise.  I come from more or less the same sort of area as Deputy Brennan.  I have some experience of the work of rate collectors everywhere, and have met quite a few. I must speak of the general standard of intelligence and behaviour of these men from the point of view of appearance, conduct and capacity to do their work, irrespective of whether they were appointed because of a political ticket or not.  They do their work well.  The rates are brought in.  If they do not take them in they pay the penalty. They have to provide an insurance bond.  There is no danger to the local authority, no danger to anybody.</P>
    <P>Here we are trying to pretend that we want everything raised above the political level.  If the public could see those of us who are making that case they would know that we do not mean <Col N="620" /> it, and that even in our own lives we do not mean it.  I think if we gave, by example, more evidence of our support for that type of machinery, than by just a mere uttering of words in this House, it would be of far more benefit.</P>

      <P>As the statements made by the Minister for Local Government, and the ex-Minister for Local Government, have thrown a completely new light on this discussion, I would like again to intervene in the debate.  Deputies who have favoured the amendments have been indicted as having no faith in local authority representatives, and that they more or less regard those representatives as irresponsible people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is, I admit, more an interpretation from the ex-Minister's statement than from yours. Let us examine the position.  Deputy Smith has stated his faith and confidence in the elected representatives of the people.  What did Deputy Smith and his Party do to uphold the assertion he has made to-night?  Is it not true that the Party to which he belongs, Fianna Fáil, have robbed the elected representatives on local authorities of every piece of power, with the exception of the power of appointing a few political hangers-on in counties where they have majorities?  Is that not the only function Fianna Fáil left the local authorities?  Is it not true, also, that the reason they left that function to local authorities was that at the time the County Management Act was brought in, Fianna Fáil had a majority on almost every county council in the country?  That was the reason this section was left in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McQuillan wants to know why this particular section was left in the measure.  I hold it was because of the pressure of Fianna Fáil Deputies who knew they had a majority vote on the county councils when this measure was brought into being in 1940.  There is no use in Deputy Smith standing up in this House now and trying to make a case to uphold the rights of local authority representatives because a <Col N="621" /> few years ago he had an opportunity, when he was Minister for Local Government, of bringing in a measure that would give back to local representatives the power, to which they are entitled, to direct policy.  What, however, did he do?  He brought in a penny-farthing City and County Management Bill and, while we are on this subject, I might say I would value the present Minister's measure at about twopence-halfpenny. That is not my opinion alone: it is the opinion of the general public.</P>

      <P>A new field has been opened up here to-night as a result of the discussion of these amendments. In view of the statements by the present Minister and by the former Minister that they have great faith in the elected representatives on local authorities, what about scrapping this measure and bringing in some worth-while one to give back to these people the powers they are entitled to hold?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Great play has been made about the appointment of rate collectors.  One of the strongest reasons why I support the amendment is that it would lead to the abolition of rate collectors, because in my view they are not necessary.  In some counties, rates are collected through the office, as I have already stated, at not more than 40 to 45 per cent, of the present cost of collection.</P>

Deputy Smith has no such concern for the public purse.  Possibly he has a majority on Cavan County Council and may be able to get a few of his henchmen or members of his family appointed rate collectors.</P>

      <P>I wonder if it was within the past month or so that they found this new faith in local representatives?  In my opinion, it must be.  When Deputy Smith introduced his amendment to the City and County Management Act in 1954 he had no such belief because he stated here that he was not going to give them back any worth-while powers, good, bad or indifferent.  He gave them no responsibility.  It was specially set out in the measure which was introduced by Fianna Fáil and in the measure introduced by the present Minister for Local Government that no elected representative would have any say, good, bad or indifferent, in regard to the work of any employee of a local authority.  It was made quite clear that a member of a county council, a corporation or an urban council could not question staff matters and could not question how employees of their council carried out their duties.</P>

Fianna Fáil and, to put it bluntly, Fine Gael, agreed that the elected representatives on local authorities should have no say whatsoever on how the employees of local authorities carry out their duties but they make one exception, and that is where rate collectors are concerned. They are the only people in regard to whom they will allow the county councillors to have a say.</P>

      <P>When addressing the House, Deputy Smith stated that in my itinerary round the country I merely obtained the views of individuals and not the views of local authorities. There are 27 county councils in this country and 19 of them held special meetings to provide me with recommendations for the amendment of the County Management Act.  The following counties held special meetings and I received the recommendations&mdash;Donegal, Dublin, Wexford, Sligo, Waterford, Westmeath, Longford, Mayo, Cavan, Cork, Kerry, Kildare, Carlow, Kilkenny, Monaghan, Meath, Tipperary North Riding, Limerick, and Tipperary South Riding.  In addition to that, I met a very large number of the members of the county councils in Leitrim, Laois and Roscommon.</P>

      <P>At the risk of suffering the wrath of Deputy Smith, I wish to say I am entirely opposed to political appointments of any kind, whether they be High Court Judges or rate collectors.  It has been my experience through various councils that it depends entirely on whether Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil or Labour have the majority, as to who will be appointed rate collector.  It is a terrible thing that a man is appointed because of his political ticket and not because he needs the job and is able to do it.  We <Col N="626" /> had an experience quite recently of one county where three rate collectors were being appointed and, as Deputy McQuillan mentioned, for months before the appointments were made there were midnight raids on the houses of all the county councillors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not.  I am not quite aware of the way some of the Deputies opposite canvassed their votes but when I am a little longer in the House I will learn some of their methods.  County councillors have been pestered by potential rate collectors and in many cases it is not the ideal person who is appointed.  Deputy Smith says they do the job well.  Of course they do.  Their pay depends on whether they do it well or not.  If they do not do it well&mdash;they are paid by poundage&mdash;they do not get their salary, so they must do it well.</P>

It is a pity that the Minister, instead of taking off the Whips for the vote on this particular amendment, could not take the Whips off the political Parties in the counties when these appointments are being made&mdash;and then this amendment would not be necessary.</P>

      <P>I had no intention of intervening in the debate on this amending Bill, as I have never been&mdash;and do not think now I ever will be&mdash;a member of a local body.  Seeing that this is a free vote, we are now confronted&mdash;by the decision taken by Deputy McQuillan, to my surprise&mdash;with the simple issue of deciding by our free vote whether we are going to have rate collectors in <Col N="627" /> the future appointed by the members of the local authority or by the county manager.  That is the simple issue confronting us, through Deputy McQuillan selecting amendment No. 31 as the issue upon which this whole question should now be tested.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>If, on a free vote of the House, amendment No. 31 is accepted in principle, is it possible that the Minister on the Report Stage would have a suitable amendment brought in, that would preclude the county manager from making the appointment directly, by setting up a suitable interview board?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that can be done by regulation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Not being a member of a local authority, I have always listened to the members of local authorities whenever they came to discuss this particular matter.  The Minister read out in the list of local authorities the two for my constituency.  One of those two authorities, with all the members present, after due consideration, requested the Minister to allow them to retain their right to appoint rate collectors in the future as they have done in the past.  I was one of the most attentive listeners to Deputy McQuillan when he was making the case for amendment No. 5 and I personally would take the risk of selecting, if I were a juryman on this matter, amendment No. 5 as much more suitable than the amendment No. 31 that he now relies on and asks us to vote on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Looking at the whole position as a Deputy for 34 years, my whole attitude to the question of rate collectors has been this, that if I were a member of a local authority and free from Party affiliations to give a vote, I would look at the selection of a rate collector from the point of view of the suitability of the man and suitability of the man would depend upon his knowledge, his intimate knowledge, if necessary, of the people of the area.  I have seen collectors act in the most callous fashion, without any consideration, at the wrong time, and hand their collection to the sheriff's bailiff to go and seize the property <Col N="628" /> of decent ratepayers at a time when it should not be done&mdash;and, whenever it was done, done to the disadvantage of the individuals concerned. Any decent self-respecting rate collector who knew his job and who was a good man for the job would give due consideration to an appeal from a ratepayer for sufficient time to enable him to dispose of his live stock or other property in order to pay his rates before the end of the financial year or half-year as the case may be.  That is the way the position should be looked at.</P>
    <P>Having listened attentively to this discussion, I think that in present circumstances the members of a local authority, with their responsibility to the local ratepayers, are better judges of the most suitable man than a county manager who in nine cases out of ten or 19 cases out of 20 has no personal knowledge of the people of the county. The county manager is generally a man brought in from outside and in some cases, unfortunately, they have no experience in the working of local authorities.  From my knowledge of the county councillors in the two counties in my own area, I would prefer at this stage&mdash;if there is a vote on it&mdash;to trust their judgment as councillors or the judgment of the members of the incoming council, to make the wiser selection, rather than hand over the power, as is now proposed by Deputy McQuillan, to the county manager to do that either on his own or by a selection board selected by himself.</P>

      <P>I was not able to follow the reasoning of Deputy Murphy when he seemed to infer that because councillors have not power in other ways this power should be taken from them also.  It does not follow at all particularly if, as we are led to believe, there are some extra powers given to us in this Bill.  Why should we sacrifice any of the powers we have enjoyed? I will be guided by one principle and I think every Deputy should apply it in his own case.  If <Col N="629" /> elected representatives of local bodies are not capable of simply appointing collectors, they are not capable of being members of a local body.  They are not capable of discharging any of the duties pertaining to local bodies if they cannot trust themselves to take part in the simple selection of rate collectors.  I am prepared to take responsibility for that and any other responsibility pertaining to membership of a local authority.  If I felt afraid of myself and wanted to deprive myself of powers in relation to a simple matter like that, I would not offer myself to the people for election as a representative on a local body.</P>

      <P>The appointment of rate collectors is a matter which is always very interesting to politicians.  Not alone is it a great thing for a political Party in a local authority to get a henchman selected as rate collector, considering that he is paid, roughly, from 10d. to 1/- in the £ on his collection, but&mdash;and I know it from my own experience and to my regret in my native North Galway&mdash;the appointed rate collector also controls the register of electors, that is to say, he is the individual who goes around an area and is in a position to determine who has reached the age of 21 and should be on the register, and who had died and should be put off the register.  The result in my constituency was that on a certain day a certain Party with a slender majority in my county council assembled behind closed doors at a caucus meeting and, as Deputy MacBride pointed out, there decided who the seven should be.  I am delighted that Deputy Bartley is listening to me and I am sorry that Deputy Killilea is not in the House. There they decided who the seven should be.</P>

      <P>It is my honest opinion that the Minister should reconsider the position as regards this amendment.  He should look into it again.  There is too much politics played in councils.  That is my honest view.  I believe Fianna Fáil were responsible for that from the first day. I believe that the political rate collectors are the worst type that ever existed.  The job of Fianna Fáil rate collectors is to put voters off the register and put some on that are for them as they tried to do in North Galway.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two points I want to get clear in my mind.  One was raised by Deputy Smith and the other by the Minister.  Deputy Smith stated he would like to see a free vote of the council exercised in connection with the making of an appointment of a rate collector.  I see nothing wrong with that statement.  If that is the Deputy's belief he is entitled to the democratic right of expressing that view by voting whatever way he feels like.  The Minister emphasised on a number of occasions to-night the fact that he got the views of members of local authorities and that he is satisfied to adopt the views of those <Col N="634" /> people with whom he had discussions. At the risk again of being misrepresented I suggest that members of local authorities may like to hold on to this power or privilege.  The fact that they may like that power does not mean this House should decide to leave it to them.  The fact is that these individuals of local authorities may not be right. I may not be right but at least I make my views clear.  I am a member of a local authority and I am not afraid to make up my mind on a decision as to who I will support.  I am personally convinced that the system in operation at the moment is not the correct or right one.</P>
      <P>Since I am talking now as a member of a local authority, I do not think the views of the members of local authorities should be the final decider.  It is not a question of taking away their democratic rights.  On the question of Lenten restrictions the butchers are not consulted about regulations for the use of meat.  We know perfectly well what they would do with regard to Lenten regulations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to get this clear.  The emphasis here is that the majority of the elected members of the local authorities want to hold on to that bit of power.  I am not so much concerned with the actual members of the local authorities as the general public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I forget it, I want to express my appreciation of the manner in which the Minister has met this amendment.  He has taken the democratic step of leaving it to a free vote of the House.  It is an awful pity that we could not have a good many more free votes in the House. I only wish that other Ministers would follow the example of the present Minister for Local Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Smith suggested he would like to see the appointment left to the free vote of the council.  In other <Col N="635" /> words, each councillor should be entitled to make up his own mind.  No matter how much we may deny it in this House or outside I want to say publicly that very few councillors have the opportunity of making up their own minds.  I think Deputy Allen will agree with me when I say that the northern end of my own constituency is 80 miles from the southern end and councillors in the south are not in a position to know the qualifications of the individuals in the north.  I would say to Deputy Briscoe that they might be guided by the political friendship or association of the particular councillors in that area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>They may from the point of view of the political party to which they belong.  I am sorry this discussion has become rather acrimonious but it cleared the air from my point of view.  A number of prominent members of this House who are also prominent members of local authorities seem to have the idea that it would be a terrible blow to the prestige of the local authorities if the power to appoint rate collectors was taken from them.  I am not satisfied that would be the case at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Smith more or less suggested &mdash;I do not think he did it purposely&mdash; that some of us who spoke on these amendments have no confidence in our comrades or colleagues on the local bodies.  I do not think that was a fair comment on his part.  Neither do I agree with the suggestion he throws out&mdash;it was alleged to have been made by the present Attorney-General&mdash;that you are going to get a better type of councillor as a result of the amended legislation.  I think the type of councillor will be the same all through. I am not saying a word against the type of councillor.  The type I come across are 100 per cent.  What I want to make sure of is that in respect of any human weakness there may be we will take the opportunity of ensuring that the councillor is not subjected to the tremendous pressure of friends and <Col N="636" /> relations to force him to support a particular candidate.</P>
    <P>The ex-Minister stated that he is rather uneasy about the system in operation with regard to managerial appointments.  I quite agree.  He is afraid that it is quite possible that the secret hand is there.  We have secret organisations giving advice and working behind the scenes.  We know also they work on the boards set up by county managers.  They are also working on committees formed by county councillors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>The political barrier is broken.  I saw myself in the past three months where an appointment was made in my own constituency. It was the secret hand that made the appointment.  The hand of friendship was held out by two completely opposing groups to the complete mystification of all concerned and the worst possible candidate was selected.</P>

If the Parliamentary Secretary thinks that Section 50 is a more suitable one to accept I certainly do not see eye to eye with him on that.  However, that is the democratic outlook and I regret the fact that the parliamentary Secretary, if this goes to a division, will not be with me; I will not have the privilege of having him on my side.</P>

In other words, the county manager can make the appointment but he sets up an interview board and generally that board consists of local authority officials from other counties.  That system may not be perfect, but it is the one I would like to see in operation in connection with the appointment of rate collectors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>All the water in the Corrib would not wash out some of those appointments.  I think the Minister for Local Government is to be congratulated on the position on which he finds himself in relation to this Bill. Some of us commented on it adversely on the Second Stage in the light of certain public pronouncements by Government Ministers.  One was a comment made by the Attorney-General when he indicated at a meeting in Sligo that decentralisation meant giving back powers to local authorities, powers which were now being operated by civil servants.  In reply to a question last week I was told by the Taoiseach that the Minister for Local Government was to introduce a measure to restore democratic rights in respect of local government by amending the County Management Act and giving to local authorities a greater autonomy and effective power in local affairs.  One or two members of the Labour Party have indicated in no uncertain terms what they think of the Minister's effort to restore these powers.  Deputy M.P. Murphy said he had nothing but contempt for this measure; it was an insult in view of the promises made on the highest authority.</P>
      <P>The Minister, as I say, is to be congratulated on the fact that, notwithstanding the milk and water nature of the measure, he has in fact some of the Parties supporting his Government asking him to take away some of the powers that the councils have at the moment.  In all my life in Dáil Éireann I have never known such a Gilbertian situation to arise.  I cannot for the life of me understand what Deputy McQuillan wants in his amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think it is sufficient to say that county councillors are pestered for 12 months before an appointment falls due.  I do not think that is a sufficient reason for taking away this power from the county councils.  It is a substantial reason, I suppose, but it is not substantial enough.  I was a member of a county council in pre-managerial days.  I was chairman of a finance committee.  I have had practical experience of what it is to be a county councillor when all the powers now <Col N="640" /> performed by managers and by a much increased staff of officials had to be performed by the elected representatives. It was the county councillors then who carried out all the functions that are now carried out by delegated authority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>On the authority of the Minister, I understand that county councils can appoint rate collectors by various methods.  They can delegate the appointment to some other agency. Is that correct?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a strange request to ask Dáil Éireann to put a provision into a County Management Act asking that that discretion be removed from county councils and that these bodies should shed their power in that respect?  Is it not sufficient to have the power in county councils to delegate the making of these appointments? If they feel unequal to making public appointments, what is simpler than to follow any of the procedures that have been set out by various Deputies? Deputy MacCarthy from Cork set out how it is done there and that method of dealing with the collection of rates is open at all times to all councils and I do not think any case at all has been made to ask the Minister to remove one very important power from councils in a measure which has been lauded for the past six or eight months as being one which was going to restore to councils the democratic rights that were taken from them in the Fianna Fáil Managerial Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister can preen himself that he has the democratic Labour Party asking him to remove this right from the measure.  As I say the request, coming as it has, from the smaller Parties, is in itself enough to make any sensible member of this House think twice about its merits.  I think <Col N="641" /> that the Minister should not have allowed a free vote on this measure, but apparently he is feeling satisfied that the amendment is going to be defeated; otherwise I could not see him taking the risk of allowing such an issue to go to a free vote.  I am sure it is the first time&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We adopted a line there which we are adopting here in dealing with this amendment and the insinuations of Deputy Bartley will get us nowhere, because his own colleagues, Deputies Corry and MacCarthy, will admit openly and honestly, I know, that these were very far from our opinions when we were dealing with a problem just like this one here before us now.  It was far from our views to use our power to decide who was going to get anything or what was going to be got.  We approached it from the same common viewpoint as we are approaching this amendment to-night.  We voted then in company with Fianna Fáil, and I had hoped that if there were to be a free vote&mdash;as we know now there will be&mdash; Deputy Bartley's colleagues from Cork would be in our company voting for the amendment.  It would be but consistent to do here what we have been doing outside.  It would surely be the height of political hypocrisy for us to express our views in one way down the country and come in here and say something different.  If the views of my colleague Deputy M.P. Murphy, and my own views are something that <Col N="643" /> others do not wish them to be&mdash;well and good.</P>
      <P>I tried when speaking on this point at the start to explain that we can all have different problems in different counties.  I did not go so far as to mention once my views about the political strength of Parties or the political aspirations of candidates applying for rate collectorships.  All I want is to see the best possible system and in spite of the remarks of Deputy Bartley he can take it although we are a small group we are doing here what we have done outside and in supporting this amendment we are far more consistent than members who apparently voted outside otherwise than they are going to vote to-night here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>In approaching this amendment I should like to say one thing at the start&mdash;that we have examined this problem of rate collectors from all angles and some extraordinary things happen from time to time even in county councils as the Minister is probably aware.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>In dealing with this matter, I would like to point out that I am a member of a local authority for some 30 years now and one of the first jobs that we did as the old Sinn Féin Party in the Cork County Council was to bring in a standing order that all offices or emoluments in the gift of the county council would be filled by competitive examination. That disappeared out of the standing orders some ten or 12 years ago.  Since then the appointment of rate collectors has been left to county councillors.  I cannot see what all this controversy about the appointment of rate collectors means.  A large proportion of <Col N="644" /> the rates for Cork County are collected through the office, without any rate collector, at a cost of 3d. odd in the £ to the ratepayers and where rate collectors are operating we pay 7d. to 8d. to the rate collector.  The particular concern of any county council or any county councillor should be to get the work done in the cheapest possible manner.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I will say one thing about that, Sir, and I said it a long time ago, and the longer I am in public life the more I am convinced of it, that is, that the Local Appointments Commissioners, to whom it is proposed to send this thing, compared to the old rural councils would be only running a very tight second.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order. I understood at the time that we were to have a vote on amendment No. 31 and treat that as an issue.  I understand that some Deputies would like to have a vote on amendment No. 5 or 6 also.  I think we had better leave the two proposals.  Whether it is No. 5 or 6 does not matter.</P>

Yet I would not be prepared, knowing what has happened and knowing the results of the selection boards and selection committees set up by managers to inquire into matters, Youghal bridge not excepted, to surrender any powers possessed by the county council.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>To be quite frank, I do not think I deserve that from Deputy Murphy.  We tried all those things in Cork and, if I am not very much mistaken, the Deputy helped me, about six months ago, in getting rid of all this question of rate collectors, as far as Cork was concerned, and turning the collection over to the office.  According as rate collectors retire, the areas go into the office for collection, with a <Col N="647" /> consequent saving of 2½d. or 2¾d. in the £ to the ratepayers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well.  These are proposals to take away a certain amount of power, even the power that we exercised when we turned rate collection over to the office because, and handing over that power to the Appointments Commissioners, about whom I was about to say, when I was interrupted by the Minister some few minutes ago, what I said many years ago when other Ministers were there, that, to my mind, they are as corrupt as the old rural councils.  I have no hesitation in saying it.  I always say in this House what I believe to be true and that is my opinion of the Appointments Commissioners, if he wants it. I do not know what particular organisation is running them now.</P>
