      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I said last night that when the representatives of the Licensed Vintners' Association left this House on 6th May their faces were telling a tale, a tale of disappointment. They have, of course, a great concern for the organisation to which they belong and of which they are the leaders.  They are intimately aware of the present position, a position that has come about because of trade recession and for other reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They were gravely disappointed because the Minister had not continued what was known to the licensed trade as the &ldquo;MacEntee formula&rdquo;.  When Deputy MacEntee was Minister for Finance he was, according to the Parties constituting the present Government, supposed to be public enemy <Col N="1634" /> No. 1 of the licensed trade.  That is what we were given to believe both here and outside by Fine Gael and other Parties.</P>
    <P>When Deputy MacEntee was Minister for Finance not alone did he realise, but he fully appreciated the licensed trade needed some help, and he gave that help.  If the present Minister had continued to give to the licensed trade the same help as Deputy MacEntee gave it in last year's Budget, the representatives of the licensed traders would not have gone away with long, almost unrecognisable faces, but with the clear understanding that the position of the licensed trade was properly appreciated.</P>
    <P>Licensed traders play a very important part in the life of our community. They collect many millions of pounds for the Government.  Their hours are long.  There are many things they have to put up with in the ordinary way of their business, things to which other businesses are not subjected and with which other business people in different spheres of activity have not to contend. Had they got a continuation of what I call the Deputy MacEntee formula that would have shown a clear appreciation of the difficulties confronting the licensed traders.  I am not saying that Governments are responsible for their difficulties; they are not. Had the present Minister continued that relief the faces would not have been so long.  I think Deputy Murphy interjected last night and said: &ldquo;How did they look in 1952?&rdquo;  I did not see them in 1952 but I can assure the Minister that their wives would not have known them or recognised a photograph of them when they were leaving Leinster House after the Budget had been introduced.</P>

      <P>Would it surprise the Deputy to learn that I saw some of them leaving Leinster House and I would not be prepared to accept his description at all?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>We will agree to differ. I said last night that Mr. Hedigan makes a very fine photograph and I would seriously suggest to Deputy <Col N="1635" /> McGilligan, the Attorney-General, that he could not compare with Mr. Hedigan in the matter of photographs. Let him take on somebody who is more of his own build.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>It might do Deputy McGilligan good to know that Mr. Hedigan takes a beautiful photograph.</P>
      <P>We read in the <i>Cork Examiner</i> of the 10th May, 1955, that Mr. J. O'Connell said that &ldquo;their supposed friends who were in opposition in 1952 asked to be given a chance.&rdquo;  We know now that Deputy McGilligan's little pamphlet sold well in Dublin because they asked to be given a chance. &ldquo;They got that chance last year and the trade waited for last week's Budget only to get a complete disappointment.... He personally said: &lsquo;Thank you&rsquo; to Mr. MacEntee who at least realised he had inflicted hardship that was too great for them to bear.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>Members of the licensed trade are disappointed, particularly disappointed, because of the great investment they made in the Fine Gael Party and they now consider that the £30,000 they gave as a subscription to Fine Gael might as well have been thrown into the Liffey.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>And thrown into the Liffey it might as well have been as far as Fine Gael were concerned because no £30,000 was ever received, nor one-tenth, nor one-thirtieth of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>Nevertheless, that was <Col N="1636" /> in or about the total subscription to the Fine Gael Party.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>Every one of the publicans became an organiser for the Fine Gael Party, believing that their friends were on the other side, believing that this &ldquo;savage, cruel&rdquo; Budget of 1952 which was also &ldquo;unnecessary&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>This year presented a very favourable opportunity for the Minister to give relief to the licensed trade.  When the present Minister took office, he did not have to take over what Deputy MacEntee had to take over in 1951, a State almost on the verge of bankruptcy.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Davern must be allowed to make his speech without interruption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a sum of £15,000,000 which the Coalition Government had not taken into consideration in the 1951 Budget although they had been crowing like the proverbial cocks around the country.  They had been going about like cocks with two combs telling of all they had done for the civil servants but they had not budgeted for the implementation of the <Col N="1637" /> arbitration award.  That and many other things resulted in a deficit.</P>
      <P>Again, they had brought in the Social Welfare Bill in 1952, but using the old political trick they did not pass it. They spent three years dangling that Bill before the people of the country as one would dangle a carrot before a hungry ass.  It became Fianna Fáil's task to introduce and pass that Bill and provide for it in 1952.  That was some two or three months after the Budget of 1951 had been passed in this House.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil had to face up to all these responsibilities.  That is more than the present Minister had to do. He is very fortunate in becoming head of a Department with a clear sheet and with revenue increasing by almost £4,000,000.  With that increase it was only natural for certain sections of the community to anticipate that they would get some relief in this Budget. They did not get it, and the section that needs it most I believe is, as I said, the publicans of the country. They have been anticipating it more than anyone else because every Deputy that ever stood up in this House for the Fine Gael or Labour Parties and even the Minister for Lands with his pioneer badge&mdash;and I am glad to see it&mdash;held up his&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>No, they did not know you.  You are a bad man for publicans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not as bad as your Minister for Finance was when he was in power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, you are condoning it now.  The licensed trade had more reason to anticipate a reduction or relief than anyone because they heard from every member of the Opposition and every &ldquo;satellite&rdquo; they had in the country that the poor man's pint must come down; that it was a savage action to increase it.  If it was savage to increase it during the period of danger to the national finances, surely it must be a damnable thing now to continue that same taxation and not to continue the MacEntee formula of <Col N="1638" /> giving relief to the licensed trade as he gave it last year?</P>
      <P>I think it was the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce who told us last night that this Government have solved the unemployment question.  I wish they could solve that problem.  I can assure the Government that if there is anything we can do or say which will help them to solve that terrible problem we will gladly help.  We were told, also, that this Government have solved the emigration problem.  Again, I wish that that were true and if there is anything that any of us can say or do to help in that matter then, without a doubt, we in the Fianna Fáil Party will gladly help the Government.  What, however, is the truth?  The truth is that more people have emigrated in the past five or six months than in any such period of time in my recollection.  I am speaking now for South Tipperary and never before have we had such terrible unemployment as we have in certain parts of that area at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Any hunger marches?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  When we passed the Unemployment Assistance Act and when we passed many other great social welfare measures to benefit the workers we stopped the hunger marches in this country&mdash;except for a certain group who seemed anxious to wear out their boots in political propaganda for certain sections in the country.  I do not think it is wise for any Deputy in this House to condone any action on the part of irresponsibles which may have a disastrous effect on the economic position of the country.  I would advise the Deputy to be careful in regard to such statements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I was saying before I was interrupted, we have large-scale unemployment in parts of South Tipperary and in the small town of Tipperary there are over 700 persons unemployed.  In other towns the same position obtains. That does not look as if the unemployment problem has been solved.  I would urge on the Minister that he should make some attempt to give more money for unemployment relief schemes and I appeal to him in all <Col N="1639" /> sincerity to do so.  If necessary, he should bring in a Supplementary Estimate to meet the needs of those people who are unfortunate enough not to be able to secure employment. Agents from Britain are in this country and drawing people over to Britain day by day and week by week.  I know they can influence the people to go to Britain and the sad part of it is that our people are going over to Britain in greater numbers now than I think they have done for many years past.</P>
    <P>We have heard a lot of talk about the fact that the bank rate was not changed.  We heard outpourings here on that subject.  We heard many verbose utterings about the bank rate. The Government took credit because the banks did not increase the rate a few months ago.  I wonder what was the price paid?  I should like to ask the Minister if, in return for not increasing the rate, he gave the banks a licence to open and close whenever they liked when they were fighting their officials in the matter of salary increases.  Is it not true to say that that was the reason why the banks did not increase the rate of interest?  Is it not true to say that it was because the banks were able to extract from this Minister a licence to open and close at any time they liked when they were fighting a union in the matter of salary increases?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>That was the big reason and probably the commercial banks would not have acceded to any request but for the fact that they were getting their pound of flesh at the expense of the officials they were fighting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another reason why we could have some little reductions in taxation, perhaps, and some other help to the licensed trade, and so forth.  This year, the Government will save, in subsidy to the grain growers and the working farmers of the country, between £2,500,000 and £3,000,000.  They will save that definitely.</P>
      <P>We used to hear Deputy Dillon, as he was then&mdash;he is now our Minister for Agriculture&mdash;say in this House that he would not be seen dead in a field of wheat, that he hoped wheat would go up the spout and beet would go up the spout.  There are many ways of killing a dog besides choking him with butter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>When you want to kill wheat growing the easiest way to do it is to reduce the price&mdash;and that is the way the present Minister for Agriculture is killing wheat growing in this country.  There are some good and practical farmers sitting on the Government Benches&mdash;farmers such as Deputy Hughes.  How they allowed the Minister for Agriculture to do that is almost beyond comprehension.  They should not have allowed him do it.</P>

      <P>How much is conacre this year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>It all depends on where the conacre is.  I have seen conacre in certain parts of the country to make a big price at any time.  There are thousands of people in my constituency who live in mountain areas and they must pay a high price for a few acres of conacre to grow potatoes, mangolds and turnips to feed their few cows during the winter and, even though they travel long distances, they must pay high prices.  However, if the young men bought tractors and availed themselves of facilities&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>The combine has come to stay.  There is no use in talking about an extra price for wheat in the month of January because the combine wheat will not stand up to that.  I do not know what you would know over in Galway about that or about wheat. However, whatever you know, keep it to yourselves.  We know plenty down in Tipperary, and so does Deputy Hughes.  As I have said, there are more ways of killing a dog than by choking him with butter&mdash;and this is the Minister's way of killing wheat growing.  However, in killing wheat growing, he is also killing a cash crop to many of our farmers in this country. So long as a man earns an honest livelihood it does not matter what he pays for conacre.</P>
      <P>So long as the man does his business honestly, he is an asset to his country. Every man who grows what the people need in this country is an asset to us.</P>
      <P>Any man who condemns that is an enemy of the country.  That has been the policy of Fianna Fáil since away back in 1926 when it was founded&mdash;that this country should be self-sufficient&mdash; and we were on the high road to realising that policy until this unfortunate reduction in the price of wheat nearly killed its growing.</P>

There have been suggestions that Irish wheat is not as good as foreign wheat but the people who are in a position to analyse it give a definite verdict on the matter and they assure anybody who wants the information that Irish wheat is unquestionably the best wheat in the world.  It may have more moisture&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The fact that you reduced the price has killed wheat growing and the people of the country know that perfectly well.  You have sent on the emigrant ship many decent boys who had worked on wheat production and who had made a livelihood from it.  The tractors that were bought to help in the wheat production campaigns are now being sold under value and those who had acted as guarantors for them have to meet the bills.  The Minister should find some way of recompensing these people who are now hit so badly.  The big danger I see in the whole thing is that it will be very difficult for us in the near future when you go out of power, which cannot be too long now, to entice the people to grow wheat again.</P>

      <P>It has been stated here deliberately with a view to giving a false impression that Fianna Fáil increased the old age pensions by 1/6 only.  That was stated here a dozen times last night by one speaker.  Be it known to all you people for ever and a day, and never let it get out of your heads, that you would be advised strongly not to say too much about old age pensions because there are people in this country still who have long memories and who still remember the bad days and the starvation marches when the old Cumann na nGaedheal Government reduced old age pensions by a bob in the interests, they said, of economy.  That was the most dastardly thing you ever did and let me tell you there are people in the country who still think of you for that.</P>

      <P>It was untrue and unfair to state that Fianna Fáil increased the pensions by only 1/6 per week. Pensions have been increased progressively from the time Fianna Fáil took office until the last year.  One cannot take into consideration at the moment an increase which the old age pensioners have not got and which they will not get until next July but one must take into consideration that up to now Fianna Fáil has increased old age pensioners' allowances by 9/6 per week.  They did very much more than that: they made it possible for many thousands of old age pensioners to obtain pensions, thereby putting a burden on the Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil made it possible also for people of 30 years of age to claim the blind pension and they altered the means test so that many thousands of people were brought in.  In addition to that, they abolished the means test introduced by the old Cumann na nGaedheal Government in so far as it related to income in kind.  There are to-day in this country thousands of poor farmers and poor road workers who are enjoying 21/6 per week and who thank Fianna Fáil for it because <Col N="1644" /> had not Fianna Fáil altered the old age pensions code they would continue to be treated as they were previously. Even a very small farm was sufficient in the old days to keep a pension from a poor man.  In the 1952 Social Welfare Bill Fianna Fáil again came to the rescue of the old people thereby bringing on their shoulders again an additional responsibility because again the means test was altered.</P>
    <P>I would like that Deputies would study these things and appreciate them and accordingly give to the benevolent Government of Fianna Fáil, as the poor old people of the country give them, well deserved thanks.  When the means test was altered in 1952 a burden of a substantial nature was put on the shoulders of the Minister for Finance, Deputy MacEntee, in order that the essential needs of the very poor would be met no matter how unpopular was the necessary measure to achieve that. We all like doing popular things but, no matter how unpopular, I would prefer to see that the poor and the needy would have their needs met rather than to have taxation reduced for those who are able to meet it even if not too well.</P>
    <P>From that point of view I should like to see the day in this House when the matter of old age pensions would be completely removed from the realms of politics.  If they were, I am sure there are many things we could do to relieve the difficulties of our old people. There is nobody in this country as badly off as the old person who is, perhaps, invalided as well, living on his own on 21/6 a week.  He has to meet his rent, he has to pay increased rates maybe, and he has to pay an increased price for coal.  These three essentials have to be met out of 21/6 a week which leaves him not alone in a difficult financial position but, in the winter of his life, with other problems as well.</P>

      <P>Yes.  I am sorry, Sir. The present Government got into power on the many promises that they made.  Number one, in the city here, was that they would reduce the cost of living.  Has the cost of living been reduced?  Last year they said: &ldquo;We are only in power a few weeks.&rdquo;  Then they said: &ldquo;It is a Fianna Fáil Budget we have to work.&rdquo;  That is what they said last year.  They did not even dare to say last year that they had not made promises because the people's minds were too fresh and their memories were too green.  Now every member of the present Government and their supporters are saying: &ldquo;We did not make any promises at all.  We made no promises.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The one Deputy McGilligan made, he ensured that it was honoured, at the expense of the taxpayer.  Here in these papers we have the old and the new and they are painted blue.  They remind us of certain other days in this country.  We have here &ldquo;6d. for the loaf in 1951; 9½d. in 1953&rdquo;.  May I ask any sensible or honest person on the other side of the House, have the Government reduced the price of the loaf?  Each and every member of the Fine Gael Party promised to reduce the cost of living.</P>
      <P>I remember listening to my old friend Deputy Pat Crowe one day and he said: &ldquo;We are going to reduce the old bit of tobacco to the level which obtained about six years ago.  We are going to reduce the pint,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;to a bob.  I am sorry to say we cannot reduce it lower but we of Fine Gael,&rdquo; said Deputy Crowe, &ldquo;have gone very very carefully into it, there has been microscopic examination of the porter position of this country, and we cannot,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;lower it more than a bob, but the minute we get into power,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I assure you that we will reduce the price of the pint to a bob.&rdquo;  That was very nice palatable talk.  He said they would reduce cigarettes to 1/6.  &ldquo;I see a lot of young men listening to me now,&rdquo; said Deputy Crowe, &ldquo;and they can smoke all they want to now at 1/6 for 20 and the Exchequer will get the same amount of revenue.&rdquo;  That was very nice talk.  It was lovely to hear that. That did not finish it.  The best is to come yet.  &ldquo;I want,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;to speak to the housewives now, to tell them what we are going to do for them.  The minute we get into power, tea, sugar and butter will be half the price the people are now paying.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was the propaganda that I had to face in South Tipperary and that was stated not in an isolated case, but at every cross-road and, God forgive them for untruths, at the chapel gates, and at the street corners especially. I had to get up on a nearby platform and tell the people that we saw no hope of an immediate reduction in taxation; we saw no hope of an immediate reduction in the cost of living, <Col N="1647" /> that we could do it overnight definitely, there was no question about it, by one of two methods, one the one that Deputy McGilligan often adopted of borrowing to meet deficits in the Budget and the other of trying to do away with some of the social services or reducing social services.

      <P>They are all here.  They are very near and dear to our hearts here and we could not but keep them somewhere in the immediate vicinity. This is what Fine Gael said in Tipperary:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;All these increases&rdquo;</P>
      <P>&mdash;meaning the ones here painted in blue&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;have been deliberately imposed on you by the present Government.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is in capital letters.  That refers to those savages on this side of the House who never showed concern for the interests of the Irish people at any stage, I suppose&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b) They have taken unnecessary sums of money out of your pocket by increases in taxation and rates.</P>
      <P>(c) They believe that they can spend your money better than you can yourself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1648" /> Do you want relief from high taxation, high rates and high cost of living?  Do you want to live and spend your money in your own way? If so, vote 1, 2 and 3 in the order of your choice for the Fine Gael candidates: Crowe, Patrick; Morrissey, John; Mulcahy, Richard.  Fine Gael for better times.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That would be all right if there was just one little change made.  The letter &ldquo;i&rdquo; should be substituted for the letter &ldquo;e&rdquo; and it would then read, correctly, &ldquo;Fine Gael for bitter times&rdquo;.  I would suggest to the fertile minds of the propagandists of Fine Gael that they would tell the truth the next time&mdash;Fine Gael for bitter times. That should be their slogan.</P>
    <P>I have collected and kept many of the publications issued in the various counties and I find the same old 3/9 the whole way through so I do not propose to read many more of them. It is the same old story year in and year out.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which causes concern naturally amongst Deputies who represent mountain areas, that is, the reduction in the advances to the E.S.B.  The E.S.B. is a credit to this country and a good example to every section of the community.  They show good example every day of the week when they go into a rural or urban area to do a job of work, and I hope that many of our State services will follow suit and take good example by them.  Great as that organisation is, there is grave danger that rural electrification will be delayed for many years in the remote areas.  The remote areas are more entitled to the amenities provided by electrification than other areas because they enjoy very few amenities that are available in other areas.  Electricity is the one hope of providing enjoyment in the remote areas.</P>
    <P>When you take capital away from any undertaking you must be concerned as to its future and as to whether it will give the same services at the same price.  I would like to know from the Minister if he will give an assurance to this House that, as a result of the reduction in the capital <Col N="1649" /> of the E.S.B., there will not be any increase in costs in the remote areas. I am not concerned with cities and towns; we know that the further away you are from a main road, from a byroad or even from a boreen, the more you must pay for rural electrification. Therefore, I want an assurance from the Minister that rural electrification will not cost those people in the very remote areas any more than it would if this £500,000 was not taken away by the present Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">

      <P>I think our proudest boast is our education of the Parties opposite.  We remember the day when they reduced old age pensions.  We remember the day when they said that social services were costing this country £3,000,000.  To-day the total is over £30,000,000 and each and every increase in social services can be truthfully attributed to Fianna Fáil.  Every retrograde step can be attributed to the gentlemen on those benches over there, the leaders of Fine Gael, and especially my friend, Deputy McGilligan.</P>

      <P>Fianna Fáil has been responsible for every step forward, but listening to one of the Ministers here last night one would get the impression that Fianna Fáil were responsible for the retrograde steps in this country. That, of course, is not true.  Now we have converted the Fine Gael Party to a full realisation, I hope, of their duties to the nation.  I sincerely hope they will not forget the education that Fianna Fáil have given them.  It was very costly and difficult; they <Col N="1650" /> were very bad pupils and they took a long, long time, why I do not know.  I will not attribute it to dullness of brain or anything like that.  I have often tried to ascertain why the Fine Gael Party were so anti-Irish and why they were so difficult to educate along the road of nationalism.</P>
      <P>Last night the Minister for Health repeated many times the statement in regard to the dangers to the peace, to the economy and to the financial position of this country.

I remember <Col N="1651" /> Deputy Alfred Byrne&mdash;the Liffey was only a stream compared to the tears he shed in the benches over there for the publicans of Dublin.  That has now been forgotten and I want the gentlemen over there to realise that this country is now in a sound financial position because of the men and women of this country who stood by us in the period 1932 to 1938 to make certain that the £5,500,000 that Fine Gael were giving to Britain was retained in this country in the interests of the Irish people.  It means that this country would be almost £200,000,000 poorer if we had not succeeded in keeping this money in Ireland.  I give due credit to men like Deputy O'Hara and other members of the Clann na Talmhan Party, and to the members of the Labour Party, who stood firmly with us.  I give thanks to them and also to the national Party of Fianna Fáil.  As regards the Fine Gael Party, thanks are due to their British masters from whom they have accepted their political dictation from 1922 onwards.</P>

      <P>The distress that Deputy Davern was in is indicative of the position of the whole Fianna Fáil Party at this particular time.  When I came into the House earlier, he was moaning about the publicans.  His theme was taken from an address given by my good-looking colleague in North-Central Dublin constituency in the last election.  Deputy Davern had to leave out an important part of that address which referred to the 1952 Budget and which said that the publicans' incomes had been split in half by the exactions of that particular time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Davern ought to be answered in regard to one foul untruth &mdash;and he knows it to be untrue&mdash;said by him to-day.  He said that the matter about the bank rate was founded on a bargain and the bargain was that the Minister for Finance and the Government allowed the banks to close up and shut their doors on certain days in order to defeat the staffs.  An interesting thought arises in my mind on that point.  I think I will have to get the files searched, because the first <Col N="1652" /> person who gave the banks leave to open and shut at certain times in that way was Deputy Aiken when he was Minister for Finance.</P>

      <P>Deputy Davern was worried also because some Fine Gael pamphlet said that the taxes in 1952 had been deliberately put on.  Does he object to the word &ldquo;deliberately&rdquo;?  Does he remember what his Minister said&mdash;where he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Government have thought over this particular matter of subsidies on these articles for several months, and we have come to the conclusion that the last increase in wages and salaries is more than the increase in the cost of living and that there is no social or economic reason for keeping subsidies.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The subsidies went off.  Does that not argue a deliberate policy, and was it not a deliberate policy founded upon this, that the people were too well off, that they had become too well off in our time?  If the Deputy gets worried about the word &ldquo;deliberate&rdquo;, let him ask his Minister for Finance.  Why did he not say in 1952 all the things he has said now about the balance of payments and the terrible condition of the country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The phrase used about subsidies was <Col N="1653" />&ldquo;the people are too well off,&rdquo; and the Government that the Deputy backed took the subsidies away. Amongst other things, they cut the food, they cut the aid to the foodstuffs of the poor people he is moaning about all this morning, the old age pensioners. Then they say they gave compensatory benefits.  That compensatory benefit, as far as the old age pensioner was concerned, was 1/6 a week.  In those days, we were told, that meant the full cost of what Fianna Fáil had put upon the people deliberately&mdash;and there is no other word for it but &ldquo;deliberately&rdquo;.  When we this year give an extra half-crown, we are told we are just barely restoring the purchasing power which was taken from the people in 1952.</P>
    <P>I listened to the deariest bit of declamation it has been my ill-luck to listen to, last evening, from Deputy de Valera, the Leader of the Opposition. There is no inspiration in that for a defeated Party.  It was a wail from beginning to end.  In any event, he did tackle two or three things that some of his colleagues dealt with, in a different way.  I suppose that the things most in conflict in this debate are, first, whether the money paid to the old age pensioners was deserved and whether it was as much as could be spared.  The second thing is whether this device which the Minister has adopted, of charging more&mdash;or at least not giving subsidies on flour for certain purposes&mdash;is a good device. The only third thing really controverted in this debate is a thing that Deputy Davern touched upon in a completely inaccurate way, that is, the question of rural electrification and the way in which it was subsidised before.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera came to the House yesterday and said that if the money was there in their time, half-acrown would have been given to the old age pensioners.  He did not go on, however, to make any kind of thanks to the people who by their efforts in respect of economies had found the money for that half-crown.  Deputy de Valera said in regard to flour that he hoped the change would work.  He was doubtful if it would, but he had no objection to it if it did work.  Deputy <Col N="1654" /> de Valera did not speak much about rural electrification, but in this debate it is a matter I want particularly to deal with.  Before I leave the other matters and go on to it, one other point which Deputy de Valera touched on was the question of whether the wheat acreage this year was going to go down&mdash;down by as much, I might put it this way, as Fianna Fáil hoped it would.  Yesterday he thought what I call his &ldquo;hopes&rdquo; would not be realised and that the wheat acreage would not suffer to any great degree, but he said that next year will be the year in which the full test will come and he warned us that the acreage of wheat then will go down in an enormous way.</P>
    <P>I want to come now particularly to this question of rural electrification.  I have some special joy in speaking of it this morning, as I saw the Deputy who is just leaving the House sitting in front of me.  Deputy Davern congratulates the E.S.B., he thinks it is a credit to the country and a model for all other boards of the same type.  That was not always the Fianna Fáil attitude towards either those people or that particular project.  I suppose the most scurrilous piece of anti-national propaganda ever used was when Deputy MacEntee, speaking in the Seanad away back in 1932, said to the Senators of Deputy Cosgrave's Party, that its practical policy was expressed by the four schemes&mdash;the Shannon scheme, the Dairy Disposals Board, the Drum battery and the beet sugar factory&mdash;and then he added this&mdash;and it is a scurrility that has come down through the years&mdash;&ldquo;as precious a collection of white elephants as ever drove their unfortunate owners to the verge of insolvency&rdquo;.  That was the reception that we got at that time.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEntee is literary enough &mdash;he has enough literary sense, if not economic or financial sense&mdash;to know the full meaning of that phrase.  The term &ldquo;white elephants&rdquo; comes from what was said to be a device of the monarch of Siam years ago, who in order to do down a courtier whom he did not like, presented him with a white elephant, a beast that was useless, which required enormous expense to <Col N="1655" /> keep going and in good condition.  That was the view that was taken of the Dairy Disposals Board, the sugar beet project and the Shannon business. They were to bring us to the verge of insolvency, they were gifts to an unwilling nation, the nation had spent a great deal of money in keeping these useless things going and we were to be driven to the verge of insolvency by these schemes.</P>
    <P>I was looking through the accounts of the E.S.B. since it was established. They are about 25 years going.  If you leave out the war years, they never showed a deficit except in one year. If you take in the war years, they showed small deficits in two or three years and a substantial one in another. Taking in the way years, they showed deficits in five years and they showed what they call surpluses&mdash;and substantial surpluses&mdash;over all the rest. If I take the accumulation of those surpluses and substract even the deficiencies that occurred during the war years, they have something in the neighbourhood of £2,000,000 in the way of surpluses.  In the period in which they are alive, they have set up a plant renewal account and the money that has been paid into that account amounts to £13? million up to the date of the last report, which was for the 31st March, 1954.  They have repaid advances to the State of over £2,000,000.  According to a question answered by the Minister for Finance last week, their interest payments to date are £19,000,000.</P>
    <P>We have £13,000,000 in plant renewal, £19,000,000 in interest and £2,000,000 in repayment of advances. The scheme when originally projected was a scheme that in the early stages cost £5,250,000 and that might run to £8,000,000 at its fullest development. We added on things to that, which made the capital commitment somewhere around a figure short of £10,000,000.  A great deal of increased capital has been put in since then, but it is not a bad thing for an organisation started with a preliminary capital development figure of under £10,000,000 that in 25 years, leaving out the war years, shows a deficit account once <Col N="1656" /> only, that has repaid to the State £2,000,000 that has paid interest to the extent of £19,000,000 and that has a plant renewals account financed to the extent of £13,000,000.  In addition to all that, they have established what was never thought of in their early history, a contingencies fund.  The last time I saw the fund referred to in this report of 31st March, 1954, it showed a total of £700,000.</P>
    <P>Just let Deputies think of these figures&mdash;£19,000,000 interest, £2,000,000 repayments, £13,750,000 renewal of plant and £700,000 in a contingencies fund.  Add to that&mdash;and I think I can make this boast clearly for the board&mdash; that I do not think there is a single thing sold in this country that shows as little advance on 1939 prices as the price of electricity, and then the board is supposed to be going bankrupt because we have decided to let the board do what it was set up to do, amongst other things, to finance rural electrification.</P>
    <P>In the last account which this board showed, there was after making allocations for interest, for repayment of advances and provision for plant renewal, a surplus over the whole year of £233,000, or nearly £250,000. From the point of view of the board, that was not a good year.  The best year the board can have is a very wet year.  The more water there is to be found in the lakes running down through the Shannon turbines, and now the Erne turbines as well, the cheaper electricity should be, or, if electricity prices are kept at the same rate, the more profit will the board show.  The year just ended on 31st March, 1955, was, over a period of 12 months, probably the wettest in 60 years, and I will be surprised if the board's surplus is not in the region of £1,000,000 when their accounts come to be disclosed for their year which has just ended.</P>
    <P>I know from what the Minister for Finance said in reply to a question that they paid in the way of interest, as I understand, nearly £2,000,000. Their highest payment to date is that which they made in the year ended 31st March, 1954, when it was less than £1,500,000, so they have been able to <Col N="1657" /> pay an extra £500,000, in the way of interest charges out of their surplus income during the year just ended.  I believe that the board's surplus income &mdash;it can be divided out in these allocations&mdash;if the same interest amounts are taken, was in the region of £1,000,000, and then we are asked to believe that making the board take on the job of financing rural electrification fully and keeping up the rate of advance in the rural areas&mdash;not having the price interfered with by what is being done in this connection&mdash;is going to bankrupt the board.</P>
    <P>The board has made more money than it was ever thought likely it would make.  The board has a contingencies account&mdash;I do not know how it came to have that account under its statutory powers, but the board has it &mdash;and it has shown a record of profits over the years, except when it was completely upset by the lack of proper plant provision during the war years and, in the last of these years, by having to buy not merely a lot of coal but bad coal at a dear price.  The board show one year in which there was a deficit, a year in which they had to go in for very heavy coal purchases, buying dear, the quality again being not so good.</P>
    <P>The interest of Fianna Fáil in rural electrification amuses me.  They took possession of what they called the &ldquo;white elephant&rdquo; in 1932.  They had not begun to think about making any further provision for the generating side of the Shannon until just about the time the war started and then they opened with the Liffey scheme.  The Liffey scheme was not, of course, in the main, a hydro-electric scheme at all; it was a scheme to provide Dublin with a better reservoir and a better water supply; but it was possible to drain off a certain amount of what was impounded and to use it for the purpose of electricity.  That was their first advance.</P>
    <P>The second was the one which stood out from the experts' report as one which should have been engaged upon much earlier&mdash;the development of the Erne.  That was allowed to go until everything had risen in price, through <Col N="1658" /> the impact of the war.  The price of the material that had to go to make the embankments, the price of cement in particular and of the concrete that went into the poles and the wires which went into the distribution network&mdash;all these had advanced in price. The cost of labour had advanced considerably. The only other good hydro-electric scheme there was for the country, in addition to the Shannon, was the Erne, and we have lost a good deal of the value of that scheme because of the delay&mdash;and I think it was deliberate delay&mdash;on the part of the Fianna Fáil Government in adding to hydro-electric development.</P>
    <P>After all, we must remember their background in this matter.  The phrase I have quoted from Deputy MacEntee shows that the Shannon business was regarded as part of the Cosgrave Government projects.  It was part of their practical politics, and, when it had been condemned in the way in which it was condemned by Deputy MacEntee, I suppose it was too hard to ask that he should see to it that his colleagues would, nevertheless, advance along the lines we had laid down in our time.  Hence, there was as I think a deliberate policy of turning the back upon the development of electrification in this country, and then, when the demand became so great that something had to be done, they went in for what was naturally a good scheme&mdash;the scheme of the Erne; but they left it over until the price of everything had risen, with the result that the price of the unit generated was nothing like so low as it could have been, if that development had been tackled earlier.</P>
    <P>They dillied and dallied with turf, and, somewhere in the year 1941, they first thought of rural electrification. The board was then asked to prepare a report, and then there was more delay.  The report was issued as a White Paper and about the year 1944, I think, the board's report carries the statement that the Government had given them leave to go ahead with rural electrification and that they had prepared a scheme.</P>
    <P>Rural electrification was mentioned in the original Siemens-Schuckert <Col N="1659" /> Report.  In that report, which came into the hands of people in this country somewhere in the late part of 1923, there was the statement that this country lagged behind many other countries. I think the phrase used was that we were about 25 years behind in comparison with continental countries in respect of electrification for the rural areas.  The Siemens-Schuckert Report said that it was not necessary to have rural electrification developed for the purposes of the scheme they projected, but they did say&mdash;it was an easy prophecy&mdash;that, once the use of electricity became common, it could not be kept from the rural areas.  The four experts who reported on that scheme&mdash; and their report was in hands before the year 1924 had finished; it was about Easter of 1924&mdash;also said that this country was very far behind the rest of the world, and it was accepted again that, once the plant had been got to work and electricity could be sold at a cheap rate, the old deterrent of high prices would be gone and rural electrification would proceed apace.</P>
    <P>The scheme included rural electrification; the experts favoured rural electrification; but the Government to which Deputy MacEntee belongs, having criticised the whole thing as a white elephant, dallied with regard to it until 1941, and eventually got going in a very half-hearted way in 1944.  Now they try to raise this scare before the minds of the people and, because we ask the board, out of their full finances, to take on the matter of rural electrification&mdash;the attempt was made through Deputy Davern and other people throughout the country and even by writings in their newspaper, whatever circulation it has&mdash;we have this attempt to create the impression that the progress of rural electrification would be impeded and development slowed up or that the prices would be raised because of what had been done here.</P>
    <P>There is not the slightest foundation for either of these two statements&mdash; that because of what is being done here, because of this method that has been adopted this year, prices are going to rise for those who have to use <Col N="1660" /> electricity in the rural areas, or that the development plans are going to be impeded.  I was looking through some documents and it was interesting to see what Fianna Fáil said particularly with regard to rural electrification. Here are some of the things they said.</P>

      <P>Deputy MacEntee has returned to the House.  I have quoted a phrase used in the Seanad in March, 1932.  I described it as a vile bit of scurrility.  I repeat the phrase in the presence of the man who used it.  Here is what he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The success of that Government's practical policy is expressed by the four schemes&mdash;the Shannon scheme, the Dairy Disposals Board, the Drum battery and the beet sugar factory, as precious a collection of white elephants as ever drove their unfortunate owners to the verge of insolvency.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>To-day the sugar beet factory still remains and the Shannon still flows merrily to the sea, bringing revenue to the board and giving cheaper electricity to the people. Deputy Dr. Ryan spoke about this when he was campaigning against it as his whole Party were campaigning against it.  I think there is quite a number of priceless comments, priceless from the point of view of stupidity as well as being outrageous from the point of view of sabotaging a great national constructive scheme.  Deputy Dr. Ryan said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It was claimed that the Shannon scheme should serve industries in the country.  But he had been speaking to people who were thinking of taking in the Shannon electricity for power purposes and they said they could get results cheaper with crude oil.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>One is inclined to ask which was the cruder, the oil or the Deputy who made that statement that crude oil was to be the answer to the power demands of the country and not the hydro-electric scheme.</P>
      <P>Deputy de Valera said that his Party did not approve of the Shannon scheme.  But he went on to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;As it was, the Shannon scheme had already cost so much that if his Party were the Government, they would probably go ahead with the scheme rather than let the project fall through when so much Irish money had been spent on it&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He accompanied his colleague, Deputy Dr. Ryan, to Wexford and he said that he was not against the Shannon scheme or the beet work at Carlow, but asked would not Wexford men get more employment from a protective tariff on agricultural machinery than they were likely to get from the Shannon scheme for some time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember the time when the Dublin Chamber of Commerce wanted <Col N="1662" /> to pass resolutions favouring the Fianna Fáil attitude to the Shannon scheme and their approach to the whole project.  For two months the <i>Irish Times</i> which extended its fatal friendship to Fianna Fáil in the last election wrote themselves out in a series of editorials.  One in particular, it was in the <i>Irish Times</i> of the 30th April, 1927, was that the whole business was a gamble; that the board would need to be supersalesmen if they were to justify the Minister's optimism.  In another editorial it was said that the E.S.B.  Bill was State Socialism in one of its crudest forms; that some of the Government's measures were courageous works of imaginative State-craft; that no Socialist Government could go further than the Electricity Supply Bill had gone.  They told us that &ldquo;the E.S.B. Bill, in its present form, was a bad and dangerous Bill&rdquo; and they asked the Seanad resolutely to maintain its right of amendment and delay.  They told us in another editorial that the finance of the scheme was a closed book.  They wound up this series of shrieking articles by telling us that the country as a whole</P>
    <P>&ldquo;was afraid of this scheme.  It was too uncertain in its results.  The money could be better spent.  The Shannon scheme was premature and ought to be suspended.  By acknowledging that fact now the Free State Government would do the greatest service to the nation and itself.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The last of these which I want to quote is from the issue of that particular journal for April 2nd:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Minister for Industry and Commerce seems to be determined to enshrine State Socialism in the Statute Book....  The Bill is frankly confiscatory... the effect of his Bill will be to expropriate a number of efficient and thriving concerns.... Once the Oireachtas has given its blessing to this principle the thin end of the Socialist wedge will have been driven under the fabric of the State, and capital, ever fearful of innovation, will be encouraged to seek refuge elsewhere.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1663" /> Another of these mad comments comes from a different paper, which says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The present scheme of the Electricity Board bids fair to develop into a crazy, overgrown megalomaniac enterprise whose financial foundations are from the very outset unsound.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It was in the teeth of that opposition, when we had Ministers coming in at the end of 1932 with this white elephant statement, that we persevered with that scheme which both in its initiation and expert examination included rural electrification.  Rural electrification was delayed by the people who took over simply because they did not believe in it and because making a success of it really meant that something the Cosgrave Government had done was a success.  The project was deliberately delayed until 1941.  Then when prices had been raised, when the development that might have been done cheaply and given us better sources of power and a cheaper rate had been lost they came in with their project of rural electrification.  We have got the results we spoke of.</P>
    <P>Deputy Davern says that the board is an example to other boards.  In a period of years outside the war years they have shown once only an accumulated surplus with a deficit, amounting to nearly £2,000,000.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEntee may think he knows all about literature, but it is definitely balanced for the worst by what he does not know about finance or economics.  That is the test of himself and his Party in relation to this whole project which he has described as white elephants which were going to drive their owners to the verge of insolvency. The result is just what I have described.</P>
    <P>I listened to this debate being developed by Deputy de Valera yesterday. He moaned and wailed mainly about two things.  He said that in 1951 they had been left a deficit.  He also said that they had a depression but he denied that that depression was a selfimposed austerity.  By way of contrast, he then said that the present <Col N="1664" /> Finance Minister and the present Government had come into conditions of buoyancy in revenue and better productivity in the national resources. These are to some degree truths but they are not the whole truth.  Deputy de Valera spoke of the deficit that he met in 1951.  Now and again that was spoken of as £6,000,000 but it easily slipped into £16,000,000.  Deputy MacEntee said that there was a deficit facing him of £6,000,000.  Does he remember what it was&mdash;£3,000,000 of a turf bill that his colleague, Deputy Lemass, accumulated?</P>

      <P>How did Deputy Lemass propose to meet it? I will tell you, by adding it on to the national debt. Eventually, it made its way to the national debt but went through the process of being regarded as a deficit. It was an extra £1,000,000 which was proposed to be paid to C.I.E. &mdash;the £1,000,000 that the Deputy, when he was Minister, clawed back from C.I.E. last year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Maybe, but why describe it as a debt for the purpose of trying to defame me?  There were payments made to the producers of butter or milk and there was added on a certain amount for which I was not responsible.  We have had talk of a deficit backwards and forwards several times.  I doubt if Fianna Fáil believe they would get a person to listen to them outside this House on the question of deficits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy de Valera said he was unlucky in his time.  He referred to the depression in 1951, but he denies that there was any austerity.  There was not any austerity.  I find myself wondering whether Deputy de Valera and <Col N="1665" /> I speak the same language.  I do not know what the meaning of austerity is if it is not to say in relation to a country that you think the people's standard of living is too high and you set out to depress it.  I think that it is imposing austerity to say that the people are too well off and that is what Deputy MacEntee said in 1952.  I have his phrase here if he would like to hear it again.  Let me quote from column 1138 of the Official Debates, dated 2nd April, 1952:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Government has given careful thought to this problem over recent months.  They are satisfied that, as incomes generally have already advanced more than the cost of living and as essential foodstuffs are no longer scarce, there is now no economic or social justification for a policy of subsidising food for everybody.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The lead up to that occurs in column 1137:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;At the same time, it has become clear that in existing conditions the subsidies cannot achieve the purpose for which they were introduced which was, let me remind the House, by stabilising the cost-of-living index to obviate increases in the general level of money incomes. In agriculture and industry earnings have advanced since 1948 by more than the cost of living.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>They were going to reduce the subsidies and that meant increasing the cost of living.  I call that austerity and a policy of austerity.  Maybe the Deputy does not.  I do not call it a depression from outside.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera went on to say that they were faced with this terrible difficulty with regard to the balance of payments running at some extraordinary number of millions.  What he said yesterday was very inaccurate. Might I ask Deputy MacEntee, who was his Minister for Finance in those days, how does one correct a deficit in a balance of payments except by refusing people the wherewithal to buy the things that were coming in across the Border?  The balance of payments can be remedied by stopping goods at <Col N="1666" /> the frontiers by Orders.  That was not adopted.  The only other way of remedying this lack of balance in the payments was by preventing people from buying.  The way to do that was to tax the things they must buy, things like foodstuffs, and tax the things they would continue to buy, such as drink and tobacco.</P>
    <P>That was the device which was adopted to correct the balance of payments. They did that.  Does not that necessarily mean austerity?  I believe so.  Deputy de Valera tells us that in 1952 his Government had no thought of an austerity policy.  If that is so, then I wonder by what device was this plan of cutting out subsidies and increasing the cost of living to the community got over if it was not on the broad lines of simply making people pay more for the things they had to buy and for what they were going to buy in order that they might have less money in their pockets?</P>
    <P>The Deputy said that was not austerity, that it was depression.  Of course it was depression; it was depression induced by an austerity policy.  I feel that what irritated the people at the last election and gave us the success we got was not promises about reductions; it was that hardship was imposed on the people and the way it was done in 1952.  If the Ministers in those days&mdash;in 1952&mdash;had said what they said in the debate now, they might have made a case.  But they came before the people brutally and within a few months, after solemnly saying there was no reason why subsidies should be cut, did what they had sworn they were not going to do and said the people were too well off and that as wages and salaries had increased more than the cost of living they were going to rectify that by increasing the cost of living.  I think it was the dishonesty, treachery and brutality of the 1952 proposals that put the then Government into opposition where they will remain until that phase is forgotten.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera, by way of contrast, went on to say that the present Government, more particularly the Minister for Finance, was in an amazingly strong position.  There was <Col N="1667" /> buoyancy in the revenue.  Deputy Lemass claimed that in their period of office no Minister for Finance, from 1951 to 1954, had seen any buoyancy in revenue.  Deputy de Valera regarded it as remarkable that this year for the first time revenue is rising; there is buoyancy in it and Deputy de Valera thinks that is an amazing situation and we are particularly lucky.  He also thinks it is a peculiar coincidence that there is a great upsurge in productivity in the country at the moment.  All this, of course, goes back to the 1952 Budget: if you invest in deflation you must get diminished returns; if you invest in prosperity, you will get a dividend.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not shy at all. The word Deputy de Valera used yesterday was &ldquo;productivity&rdquo;.  Perhaps he has not been taught the Deputy's economics, but Deputy de Valera&mdash; and he spoke for some two hours&mdash; drooled during part of the time about the amazing increase there was in productivity and the buoyancy of revenue, the two lucky circumstances in which the Minister for Finance finds himself this year.  First of all, there was buoyancy in revenue&mdash;not inflation, as Deputy de Valera called it&mdash;and, secondly, there was an increase in productivity. Of course, there is both; we will not forget the word &ldquo;inflation&rdquo; if it is to be argued about, but, as I said before, if one invests in <Col N="1668" /> prosperity one will get a return; if one invests in deflation, as the people in opposition to-day did, one is bound to get a diminished return.</P>
      <P>From 1952 and for a couple of years after that there could not be anything but depression and a lack of prosperity. What was the philosophy of the 1952 Budget if it was not that to which I have referred here on several occasions?  Was not the object to keep people from spending?  Was not the terror that inspired the Fianna Fáil Government in those days that the balance of payments had got out of hand and&mdash;as Deputy Davern was taught, poor fellow, and he was not able to forget the lesson&mdash;the national finances were rocking; they were rocking and they were almost crocked was, I think, the phrase he used?  Of course, poor Deputy Davern had been told that; and it was in that mood that the Budget of 1952 was framed.  The whole policy that flowed from that Budget was a policy of depressing the people and leaving them with less to spend.</P>
      <P>Now, if one does that, one cannot complain if business goes down.  More particularly still, exactions were forced upon the people.  If bank credit is depressed and if one does not encourage bank credit, it will certainly take a downward course.  Deputy de Valera then comes in here and talks with dreary gloom over his bad luck and says that in his time there was nothing but depression, while in our time we are basking in the sun of increased productivity and a buoyant revenue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following on that Deputy de Valera spoke about the old age pensioners; they had his profound sympathy.  But they had not very much in the way of practical support from him when he had his chance.  Deputy de Valera wound up, following the pattern of all Fianna Fáil spokesmen so far in this debate, with a reference to the alleged promises that were made during the last general election by the people who now form this Government.  I understand that what I have already described this morning as the &ldquo;best seller&rdquo; pamphlet that I had in my constituency was talked about in this House last night.  I hope that Deputy MacEntee has it.  I hope that he will read it.  When he is reading it, will <Col N="1669" /> he stop the first time he comes to a promise in it?  Will he tell me what the promise is?  I think, as far as I remember, the effect of the directive slogan in that pamphlet&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>We are to gather now that the Attorney-General does not know when he makes a promise or gives a pledge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be glad to hear of any promise I made in that pamphlet or any promise I made in any speech.  Is there a promise in that pamphlet?  Apparently there is not.  I think the effective part of that pamphlet was where we put the prices that certain commodities were at when we left office in 1951 and the new prices&mdash; Deputy Davern does not like that phrase&mdash;which Deputy MacEntee, as Minister for Finance, deliberately put upon those commodities.  At the end of that pamphlet&mdash;it was such a best seller that I have not got a copy of it myself; I would be glad to get one&mdash; is the query: &ldquo;Can you afford Fianna Fáil any longer?&rdquo;  and the answer to that is &ldquo;Deputy Colm Gallagher.&rdquo;  I think that is all that is in that pamphlet. Can you afford Fianna Fáil any longer?  The people, as far as Dublin North Central is concerned, said &ldquo;No&rdquo;, and Deputy MacEntee ought not to be annoyed about that.  I do not think I quoted or made any reference to the 1952 Budget.  If I did, I probably used the better known paraphrase of it: Deputy MacEntee, then Minister for Finance, said the people were too well off, and he would see that they would not be so well off after he had finished with them.  The people answered that.</P>
      <P>I feel it is not for me, God knows, to teach Fianna Fáil political tactics, but I do feel they are losing their grip. I hope they will continue to publicise as far as I am concerned, and I think I can speak for my Party in this too, all those pamphlets that were circulated in the last election because if there is anything upon which the people are almost unanimous it is that the cost of Government is far too high and must, in some way or other, be got down.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me put the position as I think the people see it. One Party in this country says the cost of Government cannot be brought down, and that is the Party to which the Deputy belongs.  We, on this side of the House, say that it can be brought down and the people want it to be brought down.  If the Deputy was as good a politician to-day as he was in his earlier days he would not publicise those promises of ours, as he calls them, quite so much because he is thereby directing attention all the time to the fact that Fianna Fáil spokesmen say that prices cannot be got down; and, if they adopt our view, the immediate retort naturally is: &ldquo;Why did you not bring down prices in your 16 years and your added three?&rdquo;  And there is no answer to that.  If the Deputy here in the House, at public meetings and in newspapers all through the country continues to put that argument, it will inevitably redound to our credit.  The Fianna Fáil theory was that the costs of Government may be too high, but there is just no remedy for that; they cannot be brought down.  All the other Parties say: &ldquo;We think costs can be got down and we will attempt to get them down.&rdquo;  Play on that, if you like, and say: &ldquo;Why are you not getting them down now?&rdquo;  but that particular cock will not fight very hard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People have an appreciation of the difficulty entailed in clearing up a mess.  They know that when the whole machinery of Government is geared up to the point at which it is at the moment, to the enormous Departments and all this costly interference in people's lives and businesses it cannot just be got down to a lower point, or cannot be modified overnight; the whole procedure of Government cannot be changed in 11 or 12 short months. I hope that the people who are in opposition&mdash;and I want them to remain in opposition&mdash;will continue to say to the country and to the people that those who are now in Government promised to reduce the cost of living and we in Fianna Fáil say that that cannot be done.  That is the difference I want them to stress throughout the country because that will inure to the <Col N="1671" /> benefit of the people who form this Government and it will keep this Government going.</P>
    <P>It is somewhat late in the debate to enter upon a long argument on the question of wheat.  Deputy de Valera told his supporters yesterday that they should not be too cock-a-hoop yet about the wheat acreage going down this year; he said it may not go down because the farmers had made substantial preparations and, therefore, there would be no substantial decrease this year.  So, keep the gloom bottled up until next year, he was more or less advising his followers yesterday, because the Opposition's hopes or wishes in connection with a decrease in the wheat acreage will not be fulfilled this year.</P>
    <P>We will, of course, reach a point at which we will have to examine this whole question of wheat and its production and how far national prosperity and self-sufficiency depend upon paying fantastic prices for wheat and whether an acreage increased in an unsound way economically really can be counted in any target of national production.  I want to give this example now.  At one time Fianna Fáil thought they would produce a pure spirit here and, instead of starting off as any sane person making an experiment might start off, with one industrial alcohol factory, they started off with five.</P>
    <P>I am sure they were aghast at their own moderation in that they might have had two or even five to each county instead of five scattered all over the place.  There was a certain amount of power spirit produced through these five factories at a desperate cost, at terrific prices.  Supposing we had five to each county, supposing we had a couple of hundred of these scattered all over the country, and supposing we got from each of them a certain gallonage of very dear spirit that could be used in motor-cars, I suppose the statisticians who have to take things objectively would say that power alcohol was marvellously produced and in fact we might get to the point at which we would have to export some of this blessed stuff. Would that be national production?  If <Col N="1672" /> you got power alcohol from a number of industrial power plants coming to the point where the unfortunate motorist would probably be changing his engine every second year and paying enormous sums of money to get the car to go on the road at all, you could count that as national production.</P>
    <P>Is wheat at the fantastic price that was paid for it last year really sound national production?  Are we not at the moment in a better position in regard to production?  As I understand the situation, we are getting a better relationship of the crops that will be grown in the country.  They will be grown more economically and will better provide for our national needs while having to depend to some extent on the importation as well.  But surely production is much more sound in the country and better from every angle if you get the better diversion of crops that the Minister for Agriculture is seeking through his policy this year?</P>
    <P>It makes me wonder at the weakness of human recollection to find Fianna Fáil now driven to boast about the development of electricity in this country and boasting about the British market in their pamphlet.  When I remember the attitude of Deputy Davern and those who supported Fianna Fáil from 1932 to 1938, I would have thought that any mention of the period from 1932 to 1938, or any mention of the economic war would have brought Deputy MacEntee to his feet to protest that it was not relevant, but Deputy Davern brought in the economic war from 1932 to 1938, the time when we were told that the British market was gone and gone for ever, and when another Deputy over there thanked God it was gone for ever. Deputy MacEntee should not get too uneasy if he is reminded of the time when another Deputy from that side said that the cry for the British market was like a youngster crying for the moon, something beyond its reach, something not attainable, something which was gone and gone forever.</P>

      <P>From 1932 to 1938 was a great time, apparently.  We were told that there were two things which were gone from our country forever&mdash; the British market and our insistence on developing production here through live stock.  The live-stock policy was &ldquo;a bad policy&rdquo;.  If the people who were then Ministers and are now Deputies, if they could only have seen the devastation of the herds of cattle in this country it would be regarded as a great national victory and Deputy Davern would be lyrical about the results.  At the moment we do not pay any attention to that sort of so-called political or economic talk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, coming back to the difference between depression and productivity, is it better to kill calves and slaughter them at their birth lest they might become available for the disappearing British market or bring them to some degree of maturity and sell them? That is a question that the people must sometimes ask themselves.  Where was the real policy of Fianna Fáil? It was against the British market, against live stock, against dairy products, against anything that came from animals on the land.  They would turn <Col N="1674" /> everything over to wheat and beet.  I should say there will be another debate in which the question of wheat and beet can be argued but it seems to me that wheat at the fantastic prices that were offered for it in the last couple of years was very like trying to produce industrial alcohol and getting to the point where you had something to export instead of supplying our own needs.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture has a policy that I think is regarded as sound.  It is now regarded&mdash;mainly through his exhortation and as a result of the work which he did from 1948 to 1952&mdash;as the only hope this country has, the better production of agricultural products, real production.  The production that is to be of real value to us is the extra production, the surplus of something that we can sell, something for which we have insatiable markets offering prices that are not merely economic but better than economic prices for the farmers.  It is a policy which has left Deputy de Valera still wondering as the years go on why it was that he was not lucky enough to get somebody who would bring prosperity and progress to this country instead of the depression and deflation that Deputy MacEntee, more than any one man, was responsible for in 1952.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I must congratulate the Attorney-General on one thing.  If ever a red herring is needed to divert a debate which is going against his Party or his side of the House, the Attorney-General is always put up.  He is the fecund parent of that political commodity.  Yet, I think that if I had been the Attorney-General and had been the author of a broadcast which has already been referred to in this House, I should have hesitated to intervene in a debate on the present Budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Attorney-General has been refreshing our minds about things which were said in 1932.  I do not want to go into them at any length now.  I will merely say that the white elephant, the sugar factory to which he referred, was a white elephant because that sugar factory was getting beet <Col N="1675" /> from the Irish farmers for nothing and the company that owned it was drawing out of that factory a colossal sum in profits every year.  We bought that white elephant.  I am not going to say we dyed its hide, but we tanned its hide and we made that factory work and we built three other factories in this country and established the sugar-making industry as an Irish undertaking, owned in part by the Irish Government, owned in part by those who had invested in the preference shares and in the debenture stock of that company.  The Sugar Company has been an enterprise which has done a great deal of good for Irish agriculturists as a whole and has been, in times of stress and uncertain supplies, a very strong bulwark to the Irish economy.  We did that.  We bought out that white elephant and we set it to work.</P>
    <P>The Dairy Disposals Board, to which Deputy McGilligan has referred, was, in fact, on the verge of bankruptcy. There are on the records of this House figures to show the huge sums which had to be voted by the taxpayers of this country in order to enable the Dairy Disposals Board to meet the liabilities which we had to take over with it from the previous Government in 1932.</P>
    <P>The Shannon scheme has been referred to.  There is in the Department of Finance a report prepared in the year 1934 by the very experts who examined that Shannon scheme.  If Deputy McGilligan, who is so fond of disinterring dead records, will disinter that record and publish it, the public will see the opinion expressed by those experts that, by reason of the manner in which the Shannon was developed for hydro-electric purposes, we had one of the most expensive hydro-electric schemes in Europe.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan has been bragging and boasting about the development of the Erne.  We undertook the development of the Erne&mdash;and one of the objects of the 1941 Bill which I introduced in this House as Minister for Industry and Commerce was to secure parliamentary approval to <Col N="1676" /> negotiate with the Government of Northern Ireland in order that we might develop the Erne on an economic basis.  When we had that Bill before the House it was necessary also to clear up some doubt as to the powers of the E.S.B. in regard to the development of our turf deposits.  I heard Deputy McGilligan say it should have been done long ago.  We developed the Liffey first.  There was not prior to 1941 such a demand as would have made the development of the Erne an economic proposition.</P>
    <P>Let me get back to the subject of turf development.  The Deputy alleged that we were slow in developing our bogs.  I brought in that 1941 Bill. Among the things we had to do was to clear up some doubt as to whether the E.S.B. could, in fact, co-operate with Bord na Móna in developing the bogs for the production of electric power.  Those doubts were due to spancels which Deputy McGilligan in 1926 and 1927 put upon the E.S.B.</P>
    <P>The Deputy has been talking about the onerous conditions which were imposed on the E.S.B.  Who was the author of those conditions?  Who was the man who tried to tie the E.S.B. hand and foot and, when the members of the E.S.B. tried to break those bonds&mdash;when they said: &ldquo;We cannot carry out the task which you have imposed upon us unless we have some freedom&rdquo;&mdash;who was the man who came in here and told this House that, by reason of the fact that those men were not keeping within the pin-fold in which he had cabined and confined them, he would have to reorganise the board?  He came in here and told this House that there was a deficit of £2,000,000 odd to be wiped out.  He told this House that the accounts of the E.S.B. were in a state of confusion and he sacked the very managing director whom he had appointed.  This is the Deputy who&mdash;trading upon the fact that most of the Deputies are new men to this House who are unfamiliar with the economic history of the past years&mdash;comes in and talks to me about white elephants.</P>
    <P>There is one white elephant&mdash;the Drum battery.  We will always <Col N="1677" /> remember the day upon which Deputy McGilligan came in here and made the epoch-making announcement that an Irishman had discovered a new method of storing electricity.  I wish to Providence that, under kind Heaven, it was indeed a fact.  Deputy McGilligan came in here and talked&mdash;and the day on which he made that announcement the then Cumann na nGaedheal Government were in a political difficulty. He told us that the electrification, if you please, of the Irish main lines could be carried out for a possible expenditure of £80,000.  A sum of £80,000 and the Drum battery were going to enable us to become independent of imported coal.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan has talked about imported fuel oil.  At that time, he was scornful of fuel oil.  You see, it did not originate&mdash;like the Treaty and the Free State Constitution&mdash;in Great Britain and, therefore, of course, it was spoken of in terms of contempt side by side with British imported coal. He told us that if we could only develop the Drum battery and spend £80,000 on its development we would be able to electrify the Irish railways. We would have no more smoky coalburning locomotives on the Irish railways.</P>
    <P>Then he began to expatiate on that in the manner in which he expatiated in his broadcast upon the many millions by which Government expenditure could be reduced if only he were in office.  He began to expatiate upon the enormous benefits which it would confer upon electrical development in this country&mdash;because, at that time, the Shannon was so ambitious, so inordinately ambitious, that it was not able to pay its way.  It could not find the load for the machines which had been installed for the millions which had been spent, not experimentally&mdash;there was not any experiment about the Shannon scheme: no.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan, the Attorney-General, has been talking about the industrial alcohol factories and he has told us how that scheme should have been developed experimentally.  The Shannon scheme was not being developed experimentally: not at all. <Col N="1678" /> There was the Liffey at our door, a river right here beside the centre of the load which could have been developed in priority to the Shannon. Every technical expert you will find who will come now and look on the history of electrical development in this country will tell you that the thing to have done was to develop the Liffey before the Shannon and then the Shannon scheme would have become an economic proposition much earlier. That is so much for Deputy McGilligan and his white elephant.  There are three of them&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I was about to say that had I been responsible for the broadcast which the Attorney-General made on the 7th May, 1954, I certainly would not have had the hardihood to intervene in the Budget debate.  One would have thought that, having made that broadcast, the Attorney-General would now have been shamed into silence.  A less hard-faced politician would have been content to let the people forget the past.  Let us see what the Attorney-General did say on 7th May, 1954.  He gave the people, in what one might describe almost as a solemn moment, something like a sacramental pledge.  After all, he was the representative of his Party, the chosen representative of that Party, come to deliver to the Irish people the last word which they were to hear in the election campaign.</P>

      <P>Twelve months. What have they been doing during that time to secure these economies which the Attorney-General and former Minister for Finance said could be obtained without much effort.  He said that several millions could be saved by economies and there would not be a drop of sweat on the brow of any Minister, for these economies could be secured without much effort.  What efforts have the members of the Government been making to secure these economies?  Surely we must have the answer to that question.  I know, of course, that they cannot answer it because their answer would be an admission either that the economies could not be secured and that, if they could not be secured, then their whole case&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Attorney-General must be in a desperate plight when he bleats about tea and old age pensions.  He has not even paid for the tea just as he did not pay for the fuel during the previous period in which he was in office.  The Attorney-General has gone to the banks, or at least he has told his agent to do so. I should not have used the term &ldquo;Attorney-General&rdquo; in this connection. The Minister for Finance, the unfortunate instrument of the Government in this matter, has gone to the banks and told them to advance to his agents sums amounting to £1,000,000, £1,250,000 or £2,000,000 as the case may be, in order to enable them to subsidise tea which is grown in Ceylon and imported into this country, when at the same time he refuses to subsidise the Irish farmers in producing wheaten flour for the Irish people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Are they being lured by nautch girls and Balinese dancers to victimise the Irish farmers and the Irish taxpayers to subsidise the tea planters of Ceylon and be their sugar daddies?  While they are giving millions into the hands of the Hindus and the Singhalese, they are taking millions out of the pockets of the Irish farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But all this is a diversion.  I am sorry I was led from my line of thought by the interruptions of the Attorney-General.  I should like to return to it because when I do I shall probably have something to say about the Budget.  I was reminding the <Col N="1681" /> House what the Attorney-General had said, when speaking on behalf of his Party over the radio.  I know that recently the Attorney-General has come in here in sackcloth and ashes to try to explain away that statement of his, but we shall not allow either him or the Taoiseach to get away from this point.</P>
    <P>As I was saying, the Attorney-General told hundreds of thousands of the Irish people who intended to vote in the elections and who were very anxious to hear what he had to say, that savings of several millions could be secured in the costs of Government without much effort.  The phrase, &ldquo;savings in the cost of Government&rdquo; naturally connotes only one thing in the minds of the taxpayers.  This phrase of the former Minister for Finance conveyed to the hundreds of thousands of people listening to it that if his Party were elected and were to form a Government&mdash;and mind you it is the Fine Gael Party who have formed this Government because the only roped in fellows try to pull the wagon&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>However, they came in.  But the people listening to the Attorney-General's broadcast gathered that if they voted for Fine Gael there would be a substantial reduction in taxation.  When the issue was decided and the Government was formed and the Government came to introduce its first Vote on Account, Mr. McGilligan, as he was when he broadcast, did not occupy the position of Minister for Finance.  He, as the Americans say, got out from under.  He got out from under and left somebody else to carry the baby.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Or perhaps it may have been that the astute Mr. McGilligan <Col N="1682" /> refused to accept office as Minister for Finance having regard to what he had pledged himself to the people to do on the 7th May, 1954, and, therefore, preferred an office of less dignity and certainly of little responsibility for the financial position of the State.</P>
      <P>However, when Deputy Lemass, speaking on the Vote on Account on the 9th March of this year, challenged Deputy McGilligan with what he said, the present Taoiseach definitely repudiated responsibility for the statement which had been made by Deputy McGilligan.  It has often been said that I have been repudiated by some of my colleagues and on occasions it has been alleged that I have been repudiated by my leader.  Of course, everybody who knows knows that is not true, but in this case there is no denying the fact that on the 9th March the present Taoiseach definitely repudiated responsibility for the statement which had been made on behalf of the Fine Gael Party over Radio Eireann on the 7th May, 1954.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Corish)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Insurance (Intermittent Unemployment) (Extension) Order, 1955, made by the Minister for Social Welfare, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, and laid before Dáil Éireann on the 10th day of May, 1955, pursuant to sub-section (2) of Section 15 of the Insurance (Intermittent Unemployment) Act, 1942 (No. 7 of 1942), be confirmed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Insurance (Intermittent Unemployment) Act, 1942, established a scheme of insurance, usually known as the wet time scheme, under which insured persons and their employers pay weekly contributions into a fund known as the Supplementary Unemployment Fund and, in return, insured persons are entitled to compensation at prescribed rates for working time lost due to the weather.  The scheme is administered by the Department of Social Welfare.  There is no State contribution to the fund but the cost of administration is borne out of <Col N="1687" /> moneys provided by the Oireachtas. Up to the present, the scheme has been confined to manual workers employed in the building trade, but there is power to extend its provisions by Order to manual workers in other trades.  No such Order may come into force until it has been laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas and has been confirmed by resolution of each House.</P>
    <P>The scheme had its origin in the discussions which led to the settlement of the building trade strike in 1937. One of the complaints of the workers at that time was that they suffered considerable loss of earnings due to the time lost owing to the weather, and the then Minister for Industry and Commerce undertook to prepare a scheme of insurance to compensate them for such losses.  It has been a feature of the preparation and administration of the scheme that representatives of employers and insured persons have been consulted.  At consultations prior to the formulation of the scheme a committee comprised of representatives of employers and workers sought to have the provisions of the Act applied to workers in the civil engineering trade but it was considered that, having regard to the experimental nature of the scheme, as a whole, it should be confined in the beginning to the building trade.</P>
    <P>The building and civil engineering trades overlap to a considerable extent. Many civil engineering contracts include work which comes within the definition of &ldquo;employment in the building trade&rdquo; contained in the Act and many firms, the bulk of whose work is in the building trade, also carry out engineering contracts. Workers frequently change from one industry to another.  Those who have had long spells of employment in the building industry during which they paid contributions into the fund feel aggrieved when they are debarred from receipt of benefit during spells of employment in the civil engineering industry.</P>
    <P>Experience of the operation of the Act has shown that some work carried out by painting contractors, for example the painting of bridges and <Col N="1688" /> public lighting standards, does not come within the definition of employment in the building trade and there has been constant pressure to have the benefits of the Act extended to all work of a kind commonly carried out by painting contractors.</P>
    <P>It is now proposed that the benefits of the Act should be extended to employment in the civil engineering and painting trades.  After consultation with representatives of employers and workers, draft definitions of employments in these trades were prepared and discussed at length with State and semi-State bodies which would be affected by extension.  Certain exclusions were suggested and they have been embodied in the Order where it is considered that the conditions of employment render it unnecessary that persons in these employments should be insured.  They cover broadly all civil engineering work carried out directly by local authorities, Government Departments (exclusive of major marine works), the railway companies and the E.S.B.  The primary consideration in framing the exclusions was that persons engaged in these employments receive either full or partial payment for time lost by reason of the weather.  This, in effect, reduces the scope of the proposed extension, so far as employment in the civil engineering trade is concerned, to work actually undertaken by civil engineering and public works contractors. Painting work incidental to the excluded employments is also to be excluded.</P>
    <P>It has been found extremely difficult to form an estimate of the number of persons who would be brought within the scope of the scheme by extension to employment in the civil engineering and painting trades.  On the information available, however, it is estimated that the number will vary between 3,000 in the slack periods in these industries to 10,000 in the busy periods and the weekly average number employed has been estimated at 7,000.  It is thought that the demands made by workers in these trades on the fund will be proportionately greater than those made by workers in the building trade.  Employment on civil engineering <Col N="1689" /> works and on painting contracts is more susceptible to interruption due to the weather as the amount of work available under cover is considerably less than in the building trade.  The income to be derived from the classes to which it is proposed to extend the Act is estimated at £18,000 per year and the expenditure at £24,000.  In order to qualify for benefit an insured person must have at least 12 stamps to his credit, and it is thought that this will reduce expenditure in the first year to about £18,000.  The estimated total income and expenditure of the fund after the first year are £100,000 and £99,000 respectively.  The cost of administration of the scheme will not, it is thought, be materially increased by reason of extension.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I think further consideration should be given to that because this class of workers probably loses more time on account of bad weather all during the winter than any other class.  Some of the local authorities have discussed this matter before now and felt that further consideration should be given to it and that if possible men in the employment of local authorities over the winter months should be included under this.  I should like to hear from the Minister on what grounds they were excluded?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>As I stated at the beginning, before this Order was drafted there were long discussions between the two congresses and representatives of the employers.  Both parties were aware of the conditions under which road workers worked, but having regard to the following fact they decided that they would not be included in this Order, that is, that every county council except three have arrangements whereby stoppage of work due to inclement weather is paid for.  The Deputy will probably remember that there was a circular sent from the Department of Local Government, I <Col N="1690" /> think, in 1950, suggesting a draft scheme to them and that, as I said, was adopted by all county councils except three.</P>
      <P>As a matter of fact, I think the scheme that is in operation by these county councils who have already adopted it is much more advantageous to the workers than probably this would be.  One of the attractive features as far as the worker is concerned is that no contribution is paid, and I doubt very much whether the workers in my constituency and Deputy Allen's constituency would prefer to be included in this Order as against having applied to them the wet time scheme that the various county councils have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is no doubt aware that large numbers of men are laid off by county councils in the slack period in the winter months and if they could be employed during the days that men can work, the local authorities would carry many more men during that period.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">

      <P>I think the Minister is right there.  After all, if a county council has, say, a staff of 400, they would be looked upon as permanent staff and would have continuous employment; then there would be other people who would be employed on a temporary basis.  I would like to see certain sections of the workers coming under this.  I refer particularly to forestry workers who have to break off work due to inclement weather. Will they be included?  We have the forestry workers who belong to a Government Department.  The county council workers, as far as I know, are not cut off constant employment; they are kept working; if they get to the <Col N="1691" /> job they are all right.  I think Deputy Allen is wrong, that he is referring now to the temporary workers.  There are 700 in all.</P>

      <P>The point I want to raise is that raised by Deputy O'Leary.  I also would like a clear undertaking from the Minister that the forestry workers would be provided for in this Bill.  He said that nearly all the local bodies have adopted the 1950 scheme.  It might be adopted to some extent, as Deputy O'Leary said, as regards the men in permanent employment, but I doubt very much if the men who are casual or temporary workers are covered by that 1950 Order at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are periods of the year when local authorities have only ordinary maintenance work on roads.  There are other times when there is work under grants from the Local Authorities (Works) Act and other grants from <Col N="1692" /> time to time, including ordinary road maintenance grants.  These men are not provided for.  They are human and they have families to rear, and they should get some advantages and some protection as do men who happen to be so fortunate as to be on a permanent staff.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy O'Leary that the forestry workers should be provided for.  They are employed often in places where they have no proper shelter and are exposed on the hillsides. On a wet day they are quartered or let off half time.  Some provision should be made by the Minister to cover that class of worker.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Order and would suggest to my colleagues to leave well enough alone.  As regards the workers on the roads and even in forestry, I think they are very well done for and the less books and regimentation we have about them the better.  We have provided for wet time for road workers and I think it is applicable all over and that they are better off&mdash;I agree with the Minister &mdash;as they are than they would be by paying a contribution for wet time stamps.  That is my personal opinion.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies will agree with the former Parliamentary Secretary, who says this is an improvement.  It would not be any harm for me to say that even with this improvement there is somewhat of a risk in overdrawing on this wet time fund, or supplementary employment fund as it is called. Deputies will probably remember that we had very bad weather during the past winter and it was impossible in certain places for normal building operations to be carried out in the usual fashion.  Consequently there was a big drain on the fund.  Again, the strife that we had a month or two ago, affecting very much the building operations especially here in Dublin, resulted in very reduced contributions being paid by the workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a gradual improvement and if I can find a case later on for the inclusion of such workers as have been <Col N="1693" /> mentioned here by some of the Deputies I certainly will have no hesitation in introducing the appropriate Order.  Deputy O'Leary asked about forestry workers.  As I explained, they are not included.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1943" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a mistake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The workers' and employers' representatives are satisfied that they are adequately covered. I am informed by the Department of Lands that on a day on which work cannot be carried out in the forest, a half-day's wages is paid.  I suggest that that would probably be better compensation or at least equal to what would be provided under this particular Order.  The workers in the E.S.B. and Bord na Móna have their own schemes.  In the case of Bord na Móna the workers contribute 3d. a week, I think, and they are compensated to the extent of 10½d. per hour. The problem in the county councils is well catered for by this scheme which has been adopted.  As far as unemployment in the winter is concerned, the county councils might be able to help in that respect.  I do not think it would be suggested that out of this fund we should pay something that would be like unemployment benefit. If there are long periods like that when casuals have to be left off, they will make application to the local exchange and if they are entitled, they can draw unemployment benefit or unemployment insurance.</P>
      <P>If I see a case for the inclusion of certain workers&mdash;such as road workers, county council workers or forestry workers &mdash; I will have no hesitation in bringing in an Order.  However, at the present time I do not feel that I could stretch the resources of the fund to include any more than are provided for under this particular Order.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4 :&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 8, Section 6, to delete lines 36 to 44, inclusive, and substitute:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1) A proposal by a manager to create a new office or to create additional offices or to abolish an existing office or to amalgamate two or more offices or to alter by way of increase or reduction any salary of any officer or group of officers shall not be submitted to the appropriate Minister for consideration unless the proposal shall have been approved by the elected members of the local authority in question.</P>
      <P>The Bill does provide certain limitations with regard to existing offices and there is a certain amount of safeguard, if you like, within it, but the manager could create a new office without consulting the council, could abolish an office or amalgamate offices, and I feel that the Minister will understand that my proposal is merely an extension of the principle of restoring powers to the elected representatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Practically everything in this amendment is already covered in the Bill.  In fact, the only matter that is not so covered is the question of an increase or a reduction in the salary of the individual officer. It is a fundamental principle of the management system that the organisation of staff and the determination of the conditions of services of individual officers should be the responsibility, and the sole responsibility, of the county manager.  Section 6 of the Bill as it stands does not contravene this principle, because the right of veto which it confers relates to increases in the remuneration of classes of officers as a class or an increase in the total number of permanent officers.  It does not deal with the individual officer and the amendment would involve a radical departure from this position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A council, for instance, would be given control not only over the remuneration of officers of a class, but also over matters relating to remuneration of individual officers, and further over such matters as the forfeiture of <Col N="1696" /> remuneration during suspension or reduction of salary during sick leave. There are many other examples as well.  As a consequence, the elected members would deal in detail with the duties to be assigned to individual officers where special allowances for these duties are to be paid.  This would be an undesirable position and I am afraid I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely wish to agree with the Minister.  I have a certain amount of sympathy with Deputy Briscoe.  I think I can see what he is getting at and I do not think it was his intention to go as far as the Minister has indicated the amendment would go.  He is looking for what he thinks is a better form of words, but if he will look again at Section 6, he will appreciate that any power a local authority ought to have is safely in that section.  If the Minister is right when he says that this amendment would mean that a local authority would deal with individuals, it would be a line that should not be followed, and it is much safer, from both the local authority and the officials' point of view, that Section 6 should be left in its present form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>My difficulty is that, while classes are referred to, there might be a single individual in a class by himself who would not be regarded as being in a class.  What I am trying to emphasise is that a manager may want to increase the number in a class and the council may not be anxious to agree.  The manager can create a new position or a new series of positions. The Minister talks about the control of the manager as compared with the control of the elected representatives and of a situation arising in which the elected representatives interfere in administrative matters, but that is not the point.  The point is that, whatever the city manager thinks in regard to increasing staffs or bringing in a new class altogether, the elected representatives have to find the money afterwards to pay them and they have to take that into consideration when striking the rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As it happens, the officials are generally <Col N="1697" /> covered in their remuneration, emoluments and so on by statute and whenever the ordinary servants, the people who are paid weekly, seek an increase, they negotiate through their organised bodies.  The county manager brings it to the local authority and the local authority approves it or has a further discussion on the agreement reached or about to be reached.  The Minister does not quite appreciate what I want &mdash; the provision of a safeguard against the Minister going behind all that is in Section 6 and confronting the elected representatives with new appointees of a new class altogether.  He can create a new position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding this section, may I take it that the Minister is the person who is going to decide who shall or shall not grow seeds?  For instance, if farmers want to grow beet seed, does it follow that they will not get that permission if, for instance, the Sugar Company are going to be the sole producers of beet seed in the country?  I take it that the Minister will have full power and discretion, for instance, to reserve the production of beet seed to the Sugar Company, and that a group of seed merchants who may, for commercial reasons, be anxious to produce beet seed, will not be permitted to do that, and that the production will not be taken out of the hands of the Sugar Company, at any time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the practical course is to reserve to the Minister the power to make regulations of every kind under the Bill.  If the Deputy asks me what I contemplate doing under this section, it is very hard to envisage every conceivable contingency that might arise.  I think the primary duty that would devolve on the Minister, in the making of regulations of this kind, would be to provide that two totally unsuitable types of seed propogation are not got in immediate proximity. Now we come to the question of whether you would allow any other party, for instance, to propagate sugar beet seed.  If the Deputy asks me, off the cuff, my reaction, at first glance, would be to say that the existing system is a much more satisfactory one, that is, allowing the Sugar Company to continue the sole propagation of sugar beet seed.  I understand that would correspond to the Deputy's own view. But suppose, hereafter, you get two or three groups of people who want to produce turnip seed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Not turnip seed.  For instance, if mangel seed or fodder beet seed were grown in close proximity, you could have cross pollination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If you have two or three groups of people who want to grow turnip seed, I think my reaction to that would be to say: &ldquo;Certainly&rdquo;. <Col N="1702" /> But suppose somebody wanted to grow mangel seeds in the immediate proximity to where sugar beet seed was being propagated, I think I would be obliged to say &mdash; I am sure I would be obliged to say: &ldquo;No, you cannot do that.&rdquo;  There are certain areas where you can grow sugar beet seed, and you cannot grow for propagation any crop in the immediate vicinity which would result in cross pollination, and the destruction of both.  I do not think it would be possible for me to envisage every contingency that might arise, which would call for a regulation under this section, during the Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>All I can say is that the proper reaction of a Minister should be to make as clear regulations as he can but, at the same time, to ensure that there will not be a reckless cross pollination of crops which are being grown for the propagation of seed.  I think this is something in which one must walk warily, otherwise you might find yourself being called upon to regulate every parish in Ireland.  This is a matter which will have to be studied carefully in order to see that only certain seed crops will be propagated, and that no other seed crop will be permitted in a certain area.  Frankly, how these regulations would be enforced is a matter on which we shall require very careful deliberation and protracted examination by experts, before I would care to come to a firm decision.  Regarding the specific question raised by the Deputy, I feel it is quite obvious that the Sugar Company should continue to be the sole propagators of sugar beet seed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>My idea in raising this question was that there is a number of farmers in many parts of the country who are growing, for instance, their own mangel seed or their own turnip seed.  If mangel seed is grown in close proximity to sugar beet seed, you can have cross pollination.  If, in future, some commercial firm wishes to produce turnip seed, it will mean that the farmer who, in the past, has been accustomed to producing his own turnip seed, will not be permitted to do so.  This commercial firm may get the protection of the Minister, and <Col N="1703" /> that may prohibit the farmer from carrying on his own work, on his own farm.  I mean, it is quite possible.  As a matter of fact, I produce my own mangel and turnip seed, and use them. I know that several other farmers did likewise, particularly during the war. There are farmers who have continued that system, and are producing their own seeds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not at all sure how the machinery of this works, but I imagine that, if an industrial enterprise for the production of seeds were envisaged, a notice would be published. For instance, if the proposal were to produce seed on a commercial basis in the vicinity of the Deputy's farm, all persons who objected to it would be entitled to be heard in order to make representations.  If several substantial farmers in the area contemplated plans to produce their own seed, then I think a Minister would be entitled to say to the commercial firm: &ldquo;You will have to find some other angle.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>You cannot ramble in here to ask men to give up their habitual sound husbandry practice simply because you want to propagate seeds here.  We have to try and fit these enterprises into areas where they will not clash with the ordinary methods of husbandry of the farmers residing in those areas.  Power to make regulations of this kind always carries with it the danger that they will be unreasonably used.  I can only hope to reassure the Deputy that that is not my intention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree that due regard should be had to the existing rights of any farmer in any given area.  The same thing applies habitually in regard to the question of a nuisance.  If you live in a particular area somebody cannot come in and set up a knackers' yard beside your tennis court without answering to the person already there for any nuisance the new industry is likely to create.  On the other hand, if someone wants to set up a tennis court in the heart of Birmingham, it is not reasonable to say that nobody should set up a factory near the tennis court because he has deliberately <Col N="1704" /> chosen an area where he should expect the ordinary instruments of industrial activity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Egan</NameTxt>
      <P>When I moved to report progress last Wednesday night, I was discussing the attitude of the Minister and the Deputies who spoke from the Government Benches towards a possible wheat surplus and I was about to tell what happened after an eminent expert had given a lecture down the country on the desirability and possibility of greatly increasing our agricultural production.  When the lecture was finished, great satisfaction was expressed with the lecture and even enthusiasm at the prospects held out but when the lecturer had departed a very old man who had been listening to the lecture asked for audience of those who were left.  He said to them: &ldquo;Look here, boys, do not pay any heed to that boyo from Dublin telling you to increase production because you can take it from me that the more you produce the less you will get for it.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that the Minister's attitude towards a possible wheat surplus &mdash; let us forget about the racketeers for the moment &mdash; and the action he took to avoid a surplus in slashing the price of wheat by 12/6 a barrel is a complete justification for all that that old man said down the country.  I would remind the Minister that is no yarn. It actually happened.  I can get the details of the actual meeting place for <Col N="1705" /> the Minister if he so wishes.  Is that what we want the farmers of this country to think about increased agricultural production?  Is that the way we will get the increased agricultural production which we all asked for and which we all agree is desirable and necessary if we are to maintain even the present standard of living of our people?  Is the prospect held out to the farmer to be that the more he produces the less he will get per unit of production?</P>
    <P>In a country like this which pays out such enormous sums for imported feeding stuffs there should be no problem of a wheat surplus at all.  In any case what becomes of the surplus malting barley?  Has not that situation been met?  Apart altogether from that, there was not really a surplus last year.  Of course, the Minister might say that if there had been a different harvest you would have a surplus but it did not happen.  I could say to the Minister that the fact that there was uncertainty in regard to the cattle trade induced a lot of farmers to increase their wheat acreage.  I am sure the Minister will not deny that.</P>
    <P>In any case there should be no problem about the surplus of wheat in a country like ours which has to import an enormous amount of feeding stuffs at such terrible cost.  Apart altogether from that, the likelihood of a surplus of wheat in any normal year is very remote.  It is very unlikely that in a normal year we will have any substantial surplus of wheat.  The Minister seems to support the contention of Deputy Tully that there is very little labour content in wheat.  At column 1358, Volume 150 of the Official Report, dated 11th May, 1955, the Minister said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There is less labour content connected with wheat than there is for any other agricultural crop.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I agree absolutely with the Minister that so far as the harvesting of wheat is concerned there is less trouble with it than with any other cereal crop, or, indeed, any other farm crop.  I have been preaching that for the last 20 years.  Wheat is one of the easiest crops to grow; it is one of the most <Col N="1706" /> certain to come to fruition provided it gets proper attention and enough fertiliser.  It is one of the easiest to harvest and to handle.  I preached that when people said it could not be grown at all in this country; it could not be saved; it could not be milled and, even if it could be milled, one could not eat it.  If any crop has vindicated itself in our time it is wheat.  That has been demonstrated beyond shadow of doubt. It has been proved to the satisfaction of every expert and crank in the country.</P>
    <P>This country has wonderful capabilities in relation to wheat growing.  I think it is one of the best wheat producing countries in the world.  I think that could not be better proved than by something I saw myself: I actually saw a man cutting wheat on New Year's Day with a combine and saving a very substantial amount of it.  I will not say it was millable, but a substantial quantity of it was saved.  Mark you, he was no bad farmer.  I will give the Minister his name and address if he wishes to check up on that.</P>
    <P>The crop is easily saved, but surely the Minister and the Labour Deputies will not try, because of that fact, to contend that the labour content in wheat starts with the tilling and sowing operation and finishes with the reaping and threshing of the crop. Are we to ignore all the other stages? Are we to ignore the labour in the baking of it?  Are we to ignore the flour mills and the jute mills?  Are we to ignore the labour involved in the machinery side of it?  I grant you, ploughs are also used for the cultivation of oats and barley, but wheat, nevertheless, forms a very big proportion of the work they have to do.  Are we to ignore all the transport involved? Are we to ignore the labour employed in the hundreds of firms and by the hundreds of merchants who handle wheat and who employ thousands of men in the handling of that wheat?  Are we to go further and ignore the £13,000,000, or the £14,000,000 which the farmer gets for his wheat, or should get, and which goes back to labour in one way or another?</P>

      <P>I suppose the Deputy would like foreign wheat.  He may be interested in foreign wheat.  Wheat has become and must remain the foundation of our tillage.  Who will deny that it is the farmer's best cash crop?  It provides the kitty from which he draws the money to pay for the steps the Irish farmer has taken into the 20th century &mdash; a phrase the Minister used and one with which I do not disagree.  We would not have one tractor for the ten that are there now, were it not for wheat.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Egan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already explained the labour content in wheat.  Evidently it did not sink into Deputy O'Leary's brain.  He is prepared to ignore the flour mills and the jute mills, the machinery, the fertiliser plants and the £13,000,000 or the £14,000,000 which goes to the Irish farmer for wheat and, to-morrow or the next day, he will say that the Irish agricultural labourer is not getting enough and it is the Deputy who would take the money out of the agricultural labourer's pocket.</P>
      <P>I spoke earlier about cattle breeds. I said I was convinced that the best foundation for our stock was the dual-purpose Shorthorn cow.  But I said I was not a doctrinaire Shorthorn man. Neither am I a doctrinaire wheat man. My views on wheat are based on conviction as a result of experience, long personal experience plus the experience of those who went before me.  If the Irish people develop a taste for oaten bread and we do not require any more wheat, that will be all right with me.  I will change my views accordingly and lose no sleep in doing so.</P>
      <P>Similarly, if after a fair trial the Dutch Friesian is proved to be a superior dual-purpose animal, superior to the Shorthorn, I might be rather surprised and somewhat sorry but, again, I would not get a nervous breakdown over it.  I would accept the inevitable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1708" /> My views on wheat are not political. They are no more political than the Minister's views on the dual-purpose Shorthorn cow.  We all know they are not political.  I agree that after we have sufficient land under the plough, sufficiently well fertilised for tillage crops, the best possible attention should then be given to our grass land. I agree our aim should be to have good grass at the back end of the year, as near as possible to Christmas, and good grass again as near as possible to Christmas at the beginning of the New Year and fill up the hungry gap between with good hay and silage, as the Minister said, supplemented of course with cereals and roots.  Deputy James Tully would not agree with that because he has a new theory on farming economy.  He would not agree there would be any labour content at all in that policy because he does not understand it, just as Deputy O'Leary does not understand the wheat policy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Egan Mr. Egan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Egan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one point I want to make in relation to the land project. It is quite a common experience &mdash; it has certainly been my experience &mdash; to meet people who have applied to have drainage work done under the land project.  It is quite usual for these applicants to be told by the inspector that there is no outfall and, therefore, nothing can be done; in other words, the main river in the locality is choked up and is not able to take any more drainage.  I appeal to the Minister to use his good offices in that direction. These are rivers which should properly come under the Arterial Drainage Act, <Col N="1709" /> 1945, and I appeal to the Minister to implement that Act.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to use his good offices to have the operation of this Act extended over the whole country as quickly as possible because at the rate we are going on we will all be dead and gone and they will be draining the rivers by nuclear energy or something like that.  I would appeal especially to the Minister because I am sure he understands as well as I do &mdash; perhaps better &mdash; the terrible hold-up there is as regards drainage which is so necessary and important to agriculture. I said to his predecessor and I say to himself that I thought it was a pity that so much money was spent initially on the land project.</P>
      <P>I agree that very good work is being done, but I thought that some millions of pounds, say, £10,000,000, should have been put into arterial drainage and that the rivers Boyne and Suir and Barrow, and so on, would be dealt with.  I think to have acted otherwise was to put the cart before the horse. It is a great pity that the drainage could not have been tackled first, and the drainage system of the country looked upon as being almost as important to agriculture as the main roads are to commerce.  It is as important to the country as the trunk road is to the citizens of Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I admit a lot of drainage has been done &mdash; I am not referring to the arterial drainage.  The Parliamentary Secretary knows about that in my county, and all who travel from Mullingar to Banagher and who see the work that has been done on the Brosna scheme and tributaries on either side know the wonderful benefit that this drainage has bestowed on the people of that area.  What I wish to refer to are the smaller drainage schemes that have taken place under the Local Authorities (Works) Act and so on, quite good schemes, and the greater part of the jobs done were excellent jobs, but it is only piecemeal drainage without a general plan and above all without maintenance, and drainage without maintenance is a cod and a fraud.  In ten or 15 years' time if we <Col N="1710" /> look at drainage that has been done without maintenance the last case will be as bad as or worse than the first with the difference that a lot of public money will have been wasted in the meantime.</P>
    <P>It is just as absurd to do these jobs, to make a new drain, to drain the land for a few years and then leave it there, as it is to make a new road and give it no service or maintenance afterwards. One knows the kind of a road there will be in 20 years.  But the road will be better than the drain &mdash; in 20 years' time the drain will be choked up.  That is why I make a special plea for the general application as quickly as possible of the 1945 Arterial Drainage Act.</P>
    <P>There is just one other matter to which I would like to refer and it is an important matter on which agricultural policy is based to a great extent.  That is the question of agricultural statistics.  The system by which these statistics are collected at the moment is hopeless and the returns that are obtained are most unreliable. The garda goes to the farmhouse and he usually turns up when the farmer is very busy and when he is anxious to get rid of him as quickly as he can, the more so if one of the children is holding an unlicensed dog behind the house.  I am giving a typical example. Under those circumstances and conditions a reasonably accurate return is a most unlikely thing.  Of course, the question of family pride is also an important consideration and &ldquo;pride attends us still&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I knew of a man &mdash; I could give the Minister particulars, if he wishes, in confidence &mdash; who returned ten acres of wheat when he had none, five acres of barley when he had only one&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1943" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Egan</NameTxt>
      <P>He was not.  I am developing my point about pride if the <Col N="1711" /> Minister understands.  Then on the other hand it is quite usual for a garda to go to a locality when he is on his rounds and sit down on a block, or at the pump, and take the returns of the whole district from one man.  I am not making an attack on the Gardaí but on the system.  It is not the work of the Gardaí and they were never trained for it.  As I say, this garda goes in and takes the return of a whole neighbourhood from one man and that man gives him those returns which he may know nothing about.  Sometimes a man would have stock that the neighbours might not know anything about but usually the farmer gives the returns and makes them big or small according to his likes and dislikes for a particular man.</P>
      <P>I think this is a very serious matter. The Minister and his Department draw their conclusions from these returns and act on them and the action taken as a result of the analysis made has a great bearing on agricultural policy.  If the object of the collection of these returns is to get an accurate account of what every farmer has in stock, poultry and tillage, etc., and finally an accurate total for the whole country, it is a perfect farce.  The farmers do not take it seriously.  They think it is not sufficiently confidential and they have a suspicion that the returns they give may become the subject for discussion in the &ldquo;local&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Minister said earlier that he did not want Deputies to get up and tell him what should not be done but rather to suggest what should be done and he might ask me a fair-enough question: &ldquo;What do you suggest?&rdquo;.  I make a suggestion for what it is worth. It is this: that the return forms be handed into each household or farmhouse in much the same way as the population census returns and that the farmer be given a reasonable time, a reasonable number of days, to make his return.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest it should be completed and signed before a peace commissioner and forwarded by a certain date to the Department of Agriculture and I suggest that there be a stiff fine for failure <Col N="1712" /> to make a return or for a grossly inaccurate return.  Perhaps the Minister can devise a better system but, in any case, the present system is bad, unreliable and a farce &mdash; and every farmer knows that.</P>
    <P>If a system such as the one I have suggested were established I believe the farmer would sit down, take his time and make an honest and reasonable return.  I think that that would be a great help to any Minister for Agriculture and to his Department instead of having to depend on a collection of unreliable figures which, in most cases, bear no relation to the facts.</P>

      <P>When the debate was interrupted I was dealing with statements which had been made by Deputy McGilligan &mdash; first of all, that which he made on what was virtually the eve of the election and then that which he made in this House on the 10th March last.  It is quite clear from the terms of the statement made in this House that Deputy McGilligan must have been compelled to make it either with a gun at his back or at the point of the bayonet.  I do not know whether it was the Minister for Finance who was holding the gun or the bayonet or the Taoiseach himself. In any event, it was done for one purpose.

I think he must have done it under coercion.  I think he was not a free agent when he swallowed his words in that humiliating way.  Therefore, I assume he has made this retraction because the Taoiseach, in terms, has demanded it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What does the Taoiseach hope to get <Col N="1713" /> out of this public humiliation which he has imposed on his Attorney-General? It is quite clear.  The Taoiseach hopes to get himself out of the commitments which Fine Gael entered into with the electors who voted for him.  He finds that having got a Labour tail in the Coalition, he is not able to give effect to these sweeping economies which every person who voted for Fine Gael candidates was led to expect.  A lot of &ldquo;medicine bottles&rdquo;&mdash; as I think the Taoiseach once referred to them &mdash; were going to be broken up and we were going to be able to enjoy cheap pints, cheap smokes, cheap petrol and a lower rate of income-tax, as a result.</P>
    <P>The political exigencies in which he finds himself have caused the Taoiseach to want to go back on the word which he gave to the people.  Therefore, he came into this House and repudiated his Attorney-General.  However, the Taoiseach is not going to get out of it quite as easily as all that.  The Taoiseach knew, when this Government was being formed, what the Attorney-General, as Mr. McGilligan, said to the people on the 7th May, 1954.  He knew what the Attorney-General had promised the people at that time.  He knew that, in fact, the Attorney-General had secured the votes of the people &mdash; those who voted for him, at any rate&mdash;by false pretences, an offence which, I think, could be made the subject of a criminal charge if anything else than votes were obtained.</P>
    <P>What has the Taoiseach done to the man who treated the Irish people in such a shameful way?  He has made him Attorney-General.  Mind you, it is not the Government which appoints the Attorney-General: it is the Taoiseach.  It is the Taoiseach, who sits for my constituency, who has appointed the Attorney-General here as head of the Irish Bar, as the person responsible for every prosecution which takes place in our courts whether that prosecution be for false pretences, for securing money under false pretences or for mere drunkenness.  The Taoiseach has appointed Deputy McGilligan Attorney-General and has cast his mantle over him.  He has taken Deputy McGilligan as his principal <Col N="1714" /> adviser and as the principal adviser to the Government.  Therefore, he must have accepted, with Deputy McGilligan, all the things which Deputy McGilligan had committed himself to.  There is no use in the Taoiseach's coming in here and saying that he has no responsibility for what Deputy McGilligan said on the 7th May&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Tweedledum and Tweedledee, Codling and Short. Whatever way you want it.  As I said earlier, the Taoiseach is politically Mr. Facing-Bothways.  Deputy McGilligan was reputed to be the brains carrier of the Fine Gael Party &mdash; the &ldquo;financial wizard&rdquo;, as he had been termed.  He was reputed to be a person who had studied these matters and he was the person who was going to guide the Fine Gael Government, if they took office.  He made those statements. Surely he made them after taking counsel with his own colleagues in the shadow Cabinet of Fine Gael? Surely he did not go out and make that broadcast as an irresponsible confidence trickster or as a dishonest confidence trickster?  Yet, this man who made that broadcast, this man who secured those votes on the basis of that broadcast, is the person who has been appointed by the Taoiseach as Attorney-General of this State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a good thing he was not appointed Minister for Finance.  If he had, we would have had a worse Budget.  That is one of the mercies that inconsequently have flowed from that broadcast by Deputy McGilligan. The Taoiseach has appointed Deputy McGilligan, who gave that pledge, as his Attorney-General and, with that <Col N="1715" /> appointment, he has accepted full responsibility for the commitments which the Attorney-General, as Deputy McGilligan, entered into with the people who voted for him.  Therefore, it is not good enough for the Taoiseach to deny that he did not say what Deputy McGilligan had said.  What Deputy McGilligan stated was said, I believe, with the connivance and the cognisance of the Taoiseach and with the connivance and the Cognisance of every other member of the Fine Gael Executive.</P>

      <P>This Budget shows that the Minister does not imagine that the public purse can be filled otherwise than out of the public pocket.  It shows that he realises that we cannot distribute public largesse with both hands, that we cannot give millions away with one hand unless we take millions away with the other.  It shows, in short, that the Minister for Finance has left behind him the fantastical world of Fine Gael and Labour propaganda.  This year's Budget may not be an imaginative one but at least &mdash;let me talk of its merits first&mdash;it is a realistic Budget.  Though it is not an epoch-making Budget or an imaginative one, it is in fact a significant Budget, significant in the fact that it marks a return, though a hesitant and tentative return, to financial sanity and public probity in the minds of some elements in the Coalition.  No matter on what side of the House we are, we can commend the Minister for Finance from that point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, unlike his colleague the Attorney-General, did not broadcast during the last election campaign and, no doubt, when he came to prepare <Col N="1717" /> the Budget he was thanking his lucky stars he did not.  Perhaps the Minister on the hustings was as uninhibited in his pledges to reduce taxation and expand social services as were the Attorney-General and the Minister for Education.  He may have been, but I do not know.  Whether he was or was not, fortunately for his public reputation it is not recorded of him that he suggested, as did the Attorney-General in his pre-election broadcast, that taxation could be reduced in this very year by several million pounds, nor is he reported to have said, like the Minister for Education when he was plain Deputy Mulcahy, that the Fine Gael Party, if in office, could reduce taxation by £10,000,000 in ten minutes.  In order that there can be no doubt about the authenticity of that I shall quote the reference.</P>
    <P>That statement was made on 13th May, 1952, by the present Minister for Education, then Deputy Mulcahy, as recorded in Volume 131, column 1439 of the Official Report.  On that day he said that, if Fine Gael were in office, Deputy Costello, his leader and the present Taoiseach, would reduce taxation by £10,000,000 in ten minutes.  The Minister for Finance, therefore, was freer than most of his colleagues to consider the public interest and to deal honestly with it and because of that he has refrained in this Budget from reducing taxation.  He has not cut income-tax.  He has not cut down expenditure which would be the essential preliminary to reducing taxation. He has not reduced the taxes on beer, spirits, tobacco or petrol.  All these reliefs were promised in a specific way by the Coalition leaders but the Minister for Finance in this Budget has not been able to concede them.</P>
    <P>He has been criticised for that, even by his own supporters, even by Fine Gael's satellite, the Licensed Vintners' Association of Dublin, but, in the muddle-headed way of the Coalition, these gentlemen who criticise him for not reducing taxation are demanding even greater expenditure.  Not even the Labour elements can have it both ways.  That is where the Budget, as <Col N="1718" /> a Budget, teaches the Labour Deputies a lesson.  It teaches them the lesson which the Fine Gael elements in the Government intended the Budget should teach them.  I hope the Labour Party are not too dense to grasp it.</P>
    <P>I have already said that this year's Budget is a significant one and I should like to repeat that view.  It does give some hope that the present Minister for Finance has rejected the shameful and cynical approach, not only of his colleague, the Attorney-General, but of other members of the present Government, to the problem of public finance.  If that trust proves to be justified then we can approach this matter in an objective, even though critical, mind, having left behind us the debating school politics which have heretofore been the stock-in-trade of the demagogic Coalition groups.  We shall hear no more about murderous Budgets.  We shall hear no more about halfpenny Budgets and, as I mention the word, there is not even a halfpenny relief in this Budget for the majority of the people of this country.</P>

      <P>The crying need of the general public interest, the crying need of the people in present world conditions is a reduction in taxation. The Fianna Fáil Budget of last year, apart from providing £900,000 to reduce the price of bread, reduced taxation by virtually that figure.  That Budget was mangled by the Coalition and in consequence it closed with a deficit of £1,630,000, a deficit which must now be borrowed for and, of course, repaid this year in part and in part in all the years to come.  But, as I introduced the Fianna Fáil Budget on the 21st April last year, it balanced with a surplus of revenue over expenditure of about £350,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have reminded the Dáil that last year the Fianna Fáil Government reduced taxation by £900,000.  I am now going to state categorically that if I were now Minister for Finance I would, on the basis of the Minister's estimates for revenue, have reduced taxation this year by at least £3,000,000.  Why would I have done that?  Last week, Deputy O'Donovan, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Government, told the Dáil that &ldquo;in <Col N="1720" /> the general good the greatest boon the Minister for Finance could confer was a reduction in income-tax of 6d. in the £&rdquo;.  With that view I emphatically agree.  I think our whole economy is being distorted by the fact that income-tax, which was intended to be a mere incidental and insignificant impost, has become disproportionately large in relation to the incomes upon which it is now being levied.  Therefore, I said that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Government was on very sound ground when he made that statement.</P>
    <P>Just let us consider how income-tax bears on every single business transaction. If, for instance, a limited liability company sells raw materials or semi-processed materials to a manufacturer, then, out of any profit it makes on any single transaction, the company has, in nine cases out of ten, out of every 20/- of profit it makes 9/-to hand over to the Minister for Finance, and it does not end there.  So that the public, in order to enable this importer, this supplier of raw materials, to make a normal and reasonable profit, has to pay, not the 11/- profit which he requires in order to maintain himself in his business but 20/-, of which the Minister for Finance and the Government take 9/-.</P>
    <P>It does not end there, as I have said. When raw materials which have been imported or which, perhaps, have been obtained in this country are passed on to the manufacturer we have the same thing repeated over and over.  The man who makes the finished commodity again has to provide, when he is fixing his charges to the public, 9/-in the £ for the Minister for Finance. Of course, he does not provide it; it is the consuming public that provide it; it is the workers and the employees who have to provide it.</P>
    <P>When the transaction is finished, when he has made the commodity and passes it on to the distributor, again the same process is repeated and again the man who sells the articles, not the man who makes them, not the man who supplies the raw materials with which to make them but the man who sells them, whether he sells them as a wholesaler or as a retailer, once again, when he is fixing the price of <Col N="1721" /> the article has to remember that, in addition to the money which he requires to maintain himself and his staff, he has to find 9/- in the £ for the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Then, when we come down to the employee, to the worker, to the clerical officer&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy will not put me off the track.  When we come down to consider the employees of the man who provides the raw materials or the man who manufacturers the articles or the man who distributes them, the same tale is told.  Once again, what happens if he wants to have, say, 15/-, 18/-, 17/6, to spend? I am not talking now about the man in the top notch grade, about the man in the higher levels.  I am talking about the people who keep this country going.  If they want to spend 18/- they have to earn 20/- or, to put it this way, if they want to spend 17/-they have to earn 20/-.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Strange as it may appear, the Minister for Finance is multi-handed.  In every man's pocket there is the hand of the Minister for Finance filching <Col N="1722" /> away his shillings from him.  Is it any wonder that, as I said, our whole economy has become distorted by the fact that the standard rate of income-tax bears no relation to the realities of the world in which we live?</P>

      <P>Let the Parliamentary Secretary to the Government take this as some sort of tribute to him that he has an occasional glimpse of common sense on some of these matters. Therefore, when he said &mdash; and this is a point for the member of the Labour Party &mdash; that &ldquo;in the general good the greatest boon the Minister for Finance could confer was a reduction in income-tax of 6d. in the £&rdquo;, I agree, for the reasons which I have tried to give in a highly popularised and simplified way to this House &mdash; I am not writing a book on the incidence of income-tax&mdash;with the view expressed by the Parliamentary Secretary.  But he went on to say something else and again it is the moral of this Budget and it is a measure, let me say, of the merit of the Minister for Finance, of his tenacity, of his stubbornness and his refusal to run away from the realities of the situation as the last Fine Gael Minister for Finance did.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary not merely said that &ldquo;in the general good&rdquo;&mdash; these words should be inscribed above the Ceann Comhairle's Chair &mdash;&ldquo;the greatest boon the Minister for Finance could confer was a reduction in income-tax&rdquo; but he also went on to show where the nigger in the woodpile was.  He told us that the Minister for Finance did not grant a reduction because to do so would cost £1,500,000 and the Minister for Finance has not got £1,500,000 to reduce taxation. Why not?  And if he has not, whose fault is it?</P>

In last year's Budget not only was I able to reduce the price of bread but I was able to reduce taxation by almost £1,000,000.  I have said, and I repeat, that if I had been Minister for Finance I believe that a further reduction in taxation this year of about £3,000,000 would have been possible.

We would have been told that we were taking £2,000,000 of the people's money to grease the palms of the hotelkeepers. I was saying that if we were in office to-day there would have been in this year's Budget a reduction in the standard rate of income-tax and there would have been a corresponding reduction of an equivalent amount in other taxes as well and there would have been no cut in the social services. We would have brought down the cost of living for the people in the way in which it can be brought down, by leaving the money in the people's pockets to spend themselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Why do I say that if we were in office there would have been a reduction in taxation?  &mdash; because every thinking man in the country, the people who think of the welfare of the country, the people who think of the general good to which the Parliamentary Secretary to the Government referred, the people who voted for Fine Gael, the mass of the people who voted for us, all of us feel that the burden of the public services weighs too heavily upon the backs of our producers and that, therefore, a substantial overall reduction in taxation is what the general public interest demands. I say this is what the people want.  It is what the Fine Gael leaders promised them.  I am sure it is what the Minister for Finance would like to give but has not been able to give.  Our last year's Budget was an earnest of it, and it is what a Fianna Fáil Budget would have given.  In our 1954 Budget £2,000,000 was handed back to the people.  If this year's Budget had been introduced by me a further £3,000,000 would have been remitted by positive reductions in taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those who heard the ringing phrases of the Attorney-General &mdash; although to apply the adjective &ldquo;ringing&rdquo; to the Attorney-General's manner of speech would be a misnomer &mdash; those who heard the Attorney-General making those lavish promises about reducing taxation without much effort, those who voted for Fine Gael on the basis of those declarations are asking themselves to-day why has taxation not been reduced.  They will not be fobbed off by silly statements that this Budget represents only a first instalment.  That is a lame apology because the people are asking themselves: a first instalment of what?  Do not forget that Deputy McGilligan and the Taoiseach promised that there would be drastic economies made in public expenditure, that it could be cut down by millions of pounds without much effort.  They have been there now for 12 months. <Col N="1725" /> What efforts have they made?  People are asking themselves, therefore, of what is this Budget a first instalment &mdash; of further increases in public expenditure? That is the only new thing of any significance in this Budget.</P>
    <P>Last Sunday a weekly newspaper which supports the Coalition had a three column editorial spread-eagled with the heading: &ldquo;The machine beats Mr. Sweetman.&rdquo;  I do not know whether the Parliamentary Secretary to the Government was responsible for that editorial or not.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It is generally believed, of course, that the editorials of the <i>Sunday Independent</i> and some of the evening papers are written by members of the present administration. There we had it, at any rate, spread-eagled over three columns: &ldquo;The machine beats Mr. Sweetman.&rdquo;  The article tried to imply that in some way the Minister for Finance had been overborne by the Revenue Commissioners or by his advisers.  Everyone who has had the pleasure of knowing Deputy Sweetman in private life will realise, of course, that there is no justification whatever for that innuendo, that he is just as well able as Deputy McGilligan or myself or anyone else, to stand up to his private and official advisers and take his own line, if he feels he is justified in doing so.  Therefore, there was no justification whatever for trying to lead the Irish public to believe that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was a very poor compliment to the Minister that somebody who purports to support and uphold him should come along and tell the Irish public, the Fine Gael electors who put their trust in him, that he was like putty in the hands of the Revenue Commissioners or the machine of the Department of Finance.  The Minister admittedly, according to himself, could not afford to reduce income-tax this year.  But if he could not afford to reduce it, it was not because he was beaten by the machine.  Not at all; it was because he was beaten by his own colleagues in the Coalition.  That is <Col N="1726" /> what beat him, that is what has deprived the taxpayers of the reliefs to which they were looking forward in this Budget.  That is the reason, and the only reason, why there has not been a substantial reduction in income-tax this year.</P>
    <P>What is the moral?  The taxpayers may make up their minds that there will be no reduction &mdash; and now I hope to hear some &ldquo;hear, hears!&rdquo;&mdash; in taxation so long as the Coalition exists. There will be no relief for the taxpayers so long as the Government remains at the mercy of the petty Parties whose support is indispensable to them.  The Budget this year demonstrates that position fully, as I shall show.  I am going to hark back now to the Budget of 1952, the Budget upon which the 1955 Budget, whatever merits it has, is based.  In 1952, it was necessary to increase the rates of taxation substantially.  These substantial increases would not have been necessary if it were not for the fact that from 1948 to 1951 we were governed by a Coalition which embarked on far-reaching schemes of public expenditure and baulked at the necessary taxation to pay for them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to it. There was a deficit of £6.7 millions in the 1951 Coalition Budget.  To provide for the Social Welfare Insurance Bill of 1951 &mdash; or 1952, as it became &mdash; and <Col N="1728" /> other increased social welfare payments and to maintain all the other public services at the level at which they were left by the Coalition, about £98,000,000 would be required.  On the other hand, to meet this £98,000,000, the total revenue from taxation and otherwise was only £83,000,000.  If the Minister makes a mental calculation, he will see that substracting 83 from 98 leaves 15 and, in terms of millions, that is £15,000,000.  That was the gap that had to be covered in the 1952 Budget.</P>
      <P>We now come to what happened in the 1952 Budget.  In the 1952 Budget rates of taxation were increased.  It is a queer thing that, three years afterwards, the Coalition which referred to that increase in very scathing terms, in most horrific terms, have not reduced a single one of those taxes. We still have income-tax at 7/6 in the £; we still have the beer duty at what it was then; we still have the spirits duty, the tobacco duty and the petrol duty, all at what they were then.  I do not know which element in the Coalition claims credit for the fact that there has been no change.  I move to report progress.</P>

The presumption in the Deputy's questions that the board would still have surplus revenue sufficient to cover the cost of the concessions mentioned is unwarranted.  The fixing of charges is a matter assigned to the board by legislation.</P>

      <P>Certain preliminary arrangements will have to be made by the Commissioners of Public Works before they will be in a position to invite tenders for the erection of the proposed new national school at Milford, County Donegal.

I must stand over the decision taken by previous Governments in this matter.  I cannot agree that an injustice has been done. The principal thing here is that there is a break in the service and if we take a break into consideration in one case we would have to take it into consideration in the others.</P>

Their position to-day is that they get no pay if they are sick and when they retire all they may get, if the Minister so desires, is a week's gratuity for every year of service.  Does the Minister think that is a fair way to treat men who have given such long service to the State and who have been mainly responsible for the supervision of the expenditure of large sums of <Col N="1743" /> money throughout the year?

A travelling creamery service was subsequently provided for the Cromane, Caragh Lake and Glencar districts and the areas now mentioned by the Deputy were, and still are, served by this travelling creamery which stops at Cromane. Since July, 1953, no further representations have been made to the company in the matter by farmers in the Tulligmore and Tulligbeg areas which are, in the company's view, now adequately catered for at the stop at Cromane.  Furthermore, as the Deputy is aware, the travelling creamery is <Col N="1749" /> being operated by the company as a purely experimental measure and in view of the large area which it serves, the company considers that any alteration at this stage in the location of the existing stopping places would not only upset the experiment but would also inconvenience a large number of farmers in adjoining areas.</P>

      <P>The Commissioners of Public Works received on the 31st August, 1954, a communication from a local committee in which it was requested that a deputation be received jointly by the Ministers for the Departments concerned to discuss the drainage of the River Lennon.  This river had formed the subject of a petition under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1925.  An examination is being made of the data obtained from the survey carried out under that Act in the light of more recent information regarding the flood flows in the catchment.

It is not clear whether the Deputy's question relates to the Rossnakill-Tamney scheme alone or to a larger regional scheme, the possibility of which was mentioned in a report from the county engineer which was before the county council on the 14th December last.

The question of making available contributions at the current rate of subsidy or at any higher rate which may be determined will not arise until the Department is informed whether the county council are proceeding with the scheme mentioned in the Deputy's question or, alternatively, whether after consulting the county medical officer as recommended, they decide to proceed with the larger scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>When the debate was interrupted, I was referring to the increase in taxation which was found to be unavoidable when the then Government were framing the Budget for the year 1952-53.  I pointed out that, due to the fact that we had inherited a continuing deficit of almost £7,000,000 from the Coalition Government which went out of office in June, 1951, and the additional commitments in relation to expanded social services and the need to maintain all the other public services at the level left by the Coalition, a sum of £98,000,000 had to be provided by the Exchequer.  Now, I am leaving out of the question in that context the self-balancing items of the Road Fund on the one hand and the motor vehicle duties on the other hand.  As against this £98,000,000, we had an anticipated revenue from the then existing tax structure of £83,000,000.  Nobody who can do a simple sum in subtraction can deny that in these circumstances an increase in tax rates was inevitable. Accordingly, because the then Fianna Fáil Government did not shirk their responsibilities in these matters, did not shirk their duty to the country, we hoped to provide, by increasing the rates in taxation, the sums which were necessary to close the gap after we had made certain economies in the public services.  The taxation at the new rates, that is, the increase in the tax rates for which we took responsibility, brought in an additional revenue of £10,346,000 in 1952-53.  This additional revenue, together with certain economies and other savings, reduced the actual deficit from £15,000,000 to around £2,000,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1767" /> I want again to refer to the fact that in 1952-53 the new tax rates gave us an increase of £10,346,000 over the tax revenue collected in 1951-52&mdash;over the revenue left to us by the Coalition Government.  I want to refer to it again and to stress it for the reason that, this year, these 1952 rates of taxation will give the Coalition Minister for Finance £18,300,000 more than I got from the Coalition Budget of 1951.  We collected £10,346,000 in 1952 from an increase in taxation.  From that same increase in taxation, this year the Coalition Minister for Finance proposes to collect £18,300,000.  What does that mean to the taxpayer?  It means simply that the Coalition propose to collect £8,000,000 more in taxation than was done in the 1952 Budget.</P>
    <P>I must again hark back a bit.  According to column 1442 of Volume 131 of the Official Report, the present Taoiseach, when he was over on this side of the House as Leader of the Opposition, declared in the debate on the 1952 Budget that he would resign rather than proceed with any single provision of that Budget.  To-day, the Taoiseach, who was going to resign in 1952 because I was taking £10,000,000 more from the Irish taxpayer, is himself about to take £18,000,000 more from the Irish taxpayer.  In other words, he is taking 80 per cent. more than the 1952 increase I was able to obtain.  But I gather he does not intend to resign.  Instead of resigning, it is quite clear he intends to brazen it out.</P>
    <P>So also does the Minister for Education who, in May, 1952&mdash;the reference is column 1439 of Volume 131 of the Official Report&mdash;assured the country that Deputy Costello, now Taoiseach, would remove £10,000,000 in ten minutes if, instead of being Leader of the Opposition, he were Head of the Government.  Soon after Deputy Mulcahy, as he then was, made that speech, they were referring to him down in County Tipperary as &ldquo;million-a-minute Mulcahy&rdquo;.  I do not know what they are calling him now because now the million-a-minute Minister for Education has the temerity to ask his <Col N="1768" /> followers to believe that the present Budget has halted the rising trend in taxation.</P>
    <P>I shall now interrupt my speech for a news flash.  I have here a report of a speech made by the Minister for Lands at a Clann na Talmhan meeting. The report appeared in this morning's newspapers.  The Minister for Lands, according to the report, has also asked his followers to be gratified because, he says, the Budget was a vast relief.  The Minister for Lands said it was a vast relief to many to learn that no new taxes were imposed by the Budget.  The Parties who were telling the country in 1952 that if they were in office they would reduce taxation by £10,000,000, the Parties who, on the eve of the election, told the people who were likely to vote for them that if they were in office they would reduce taxation by many millions without effort, are now offering to their disappointed followers a crumb of consolation that there has been no increase in taxation in this Budget.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the Minister for Education has had the temerity to ask his followers to believe that the present Budget is halting the rising trend in taxation.  But what is the record of actual fact?  Far from the Coalition having prevented an increase in taxation, all they have done is to prevent a reduction in taxation.  That is all they are responsible for.  The money which, if we were in office, would have come back this year to the taxpayers has not come back.  It is not that the Coalition Government have prevented an increase in taxation. They have not prevented an increase in expenditure which is the first step towards reducing taxation.  Last year, Fianna Fáil were able to reduce taxation substantially and, as I have said, we would have done much better this year.  The very fact that the 1952 increases in taxation did yield £18,000,000 more than the 1951 rates, shows it would have been possible to have an even greater reduction in taxation this year than last year on one condition&mdash;provided expenditure had been kept within bounds.  That, of course, is the essential thing if taxation were to be reduced.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1769" /> Let me say at once that I do not want to decry the achievement of the Minister for Finance this year.  At least, he has given us a balanced Budget and that is better than the situation we had to face from the heritage left behind by the last Coalition Government.  Provided expenditure had been kept within bounds, £3,000,000 could have been returned to the taxpayer in this year's Budget; in fact, the amount might easily have been as high as £5,000,000.  I believe that a substantial reduction in taxation is the country's most urgent need.  But the country has not been given what it wants.  The people have been denied the reliefs which they so urgently required.  They have been denied them simply because the members of the Government who pledged themselves to the electors to reduce taxation have not kept their pledges.  That is the only reason why the taxpayers of this country have not £3,000,000 in their pockets this year to spend as they themselves want to spend it.</P>
    <P>While we know and believe this, we also know what the imperfections in this Budget are.  I do not think we are entitled to judge the Minister for Finance too harshly on this Budget for this reason.  Unless responsible Deputies on both sides of this House are prepared to stand fast on the principle that our economy is overburdened by the existing public expenditure, no Minister for Finance, I do not care to what Party he may belong, can reduce taxation and, at the same time, balance his Budget. That is the merit, the sole merit of this Budget, and it is a poor thing from the point of view of the people looking for remissions in taxes, of those looking to have a cheaper pint, a cheaper glass, a cheaper smoke or a cheaper gallon of petrol.  This Budget has the merit that it is a balanced Budget and that is why I say we should not deal too harshly with the Minister.  Let us make up our minds that we cannot have increased public expenditure, reduced taxation and financial stability on the basis of our present volume of production.  It is necessary that all elements concerned in the administration of the country <Col N="1770" /> should grasp that fact and act on it. Indeed I think it is most essential.</P>
    <P>There are grave grounds for apprehending that, in the very near future, we shall have to face very unfavourable export conditions indeed.  On the authority of the Minister for Agriculture, this House has been told that it would appear, except in respect of one commodity, that our farmers have been priced out of the export markets in recent months.  We cannot maintain our present standard of living, or anything like it, unless we have an export trade which is expanding in volume and value.  How can we fulfil that condition, how can we compete in overseas markets&mdash;whether the British market or any other market-if we compel our already overburdened producers to carry a heavier load of public expenditure and if we withhold from them the reliefs to which they are entitled?  That, I think, is the question which every responsible Deputy, no matter to what Party he belongs, and every responsible voter in the country, too, must ask himself&mdash;not only ask it but answer it and act on the answer.</P>
    <P>The people want a reduction in taxation. The condition of our economy demands a reduction in taxation.  It is the duty of those Deputies whose votes control and determine the Government to give them that reduction, provided, again, that they put a curb on public expenditure.  That is the essential condition, because we do not want any more McGuilligan Budgets in this country.  Our economy was sinking under them, that series of Budgets which was introduced from 1948 to 1951, with a recurring deficit every year, and wherever a deficit was not shown, wherever a deficit was concealed, it was concealed because obligations which had matured were not met as they matured and were left to those who succeeded Mr. McGilligan to liquidate and pay for.</P>

      <P>A number of other things.  Deputy, try to listen.  You are here as a responsible man.  You may disagree with me if you like.  Get up and say it.  Get up and say that you <Col N="1771" /> do not believe that the crying need of our people is a reduction in taxation. Get up and say that you want higher taxation.  Do not interrupt me when I am trying to make a speech which at least will be in the public interest. I am not thinking of my constituency. I am not thinking about what somebody will go around and say about me.  I am not thinking about what Deputy Dunne will say about me.  But you are and therefore, allow me at least to try to serve my country here in this House without unmannerly interruptions.</P>
      <P>I was saying, Sir, that the McGilligan Budgets were responsible for the 1952 Budget.  I do not believe that if tomorrow the Minister were to go out of office&mdash;I do not hanker after his job or that of any other Minister or any other person on this side of the House does not hanker after his job-at least, we would not find the situation much worse than we left it to him.  We might have improved it a great deal but then we would have freer hands. We would be able to pursue a consistent coherent policy, a policy which would be formulated in accordance with our own ideas of what was best for the country.  We would not have to kow-tow to this or that other element.  We would have been able, because we are a united and coherent Party to have a united and coherent financial policy.  That is the great benefit, that is the great public advantage, which flows from single-Party Government and which is denied, and has always been denied, in every country, to Coalition Governments.</P>
      <P>It is no use voting for reduced taxes and demanding increased expenditure at the same time.  If we do that, we are only mocking the common sense of our people.  If we want to reduce taxation then we must definitely decide to limit expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1952 taxes, let me repeat, were imposed to meet a financial and economic situation which was wellnigh desperate.  Huge commitments had been undertaken by our predecessors with regard to public remuneration, with regard to social services and subsidies, for all of which the necessary revenue was not available.  Our external <Col N="1772" /> assets were melting away at an alarming rate.  A deficit of over £30,000,000 in our balance of payments in the year 1950 had been followed by another of more than double that figure in 1951.  In three years our available external resources had shrunk by over £100,000,000.</P>
    <P>This is a small country.  It has been alleged that we had at one time a surplus of external assets over external liabilities of about £400,000,000.  In three years we had frittered away&mdash; because that is what it amounted to when you come to look on how this money was spent&mdash;we had frittered away 25 per cent. of our external resources, the things upon which we depend in a very large measure for financing our trade, for some of the income which we derive, the things which the last Minister for Finance in the Coalition Government referred to as our economic mass of manæuvre, the resources upon which we would have to rely in a last emergency.  We were frittering these things away at the rate of £100,000,000 in three years.</P>
    <P>This was the situation which the 1952 Budget was intended to deal with and we have proof from the financial statement which the Minister has presented to the Dáil this year that it has succeeded in doing that.  We have had a Budget which would have balanced last year, as I introduced it.  We have reduced the balance of payments problem to manageable proportions. We are bringing back and reinvesting now, I believe productively, in our own country some of these external assets but we are not wasting them.  If that is the situation to-day it is largely due, as the Attorney-General himself had to admit, to the 1952 Budget.  That Budget was designed, and I quite frankly admit it, to make income and expenditure balance and it was also designed to ensure that our external assets would not be wasted.</P>
    <P>I do not think that the present Minister for Finance will take deliberate steps so to inflate our economy that we shall be back to the parlous position in which we were in 1951.  I do not think that he wishes to have a deficit on our balance of payments of the order of £62,000,000 a year.  I think <Col N="1773" /> that he will continue to do as he did when he opened his Budget, to take some consolation from the fact that the deficit in our balance of payments, instead of being of the order of £62,000,000, is only one-twelfth of that, of the order of about £5,000,000, I think he said, if my recollection does not mislead me.</P>
    <P>The point I want to make again is that the 1952 Budget was designed to meet an emergency.  It was never intended that the 1952 increases in taxation would be a permanent part of our tax structure.  The unfortunate thing about it is, and the real defect in this Budget to my mind is, that it is tending&mdash;it may not do it&mdash;I do not know what the Minister may be able to do next year&mdash;but this Budget as it has been presented to the Dáil, in the circumstances in which it has been presented, having regard to the inflation of expenditure which has taken place, is tending to make the 1952 taxes part of our permanent tax structure, part of the normal basis of taxation, part of the norm by which all future Budgets will be judged.</P>
    <P>As I have said, that should not be the case because the 1952 taxes were imposed to meet a grave emergency and once that situation had been resolved, as it has been resolved, finally, in 1954, it was firmly intended by those who were responsible for putting on those increases to reduce them.</P>
    <P>The emergency has passed.  The Budget has been balanced.  The balance of payments is under control and the Minister for Finance has £8,000,000 more at his disposal than I had in 1952. Surely, the taxpayers from whom this £8,000,000 is to be taken have more right to it than any other section of the community.  Surely, the people who have contributed that £8,000,000, the people who have earned it, the people from whose earnings it has been taken, have a juster claim on it than anyone else.  I am going to stand for that principle anyhow.  It may not have been possible for the Minister for Finance to give the whole £8,000,000 back to the taxpayers in this Budget.</P>

      <P>I said £8,000,000 at the beginning of 1953, and I am saying it may not have been possible for the Minister to give the whole of that £8,000,000.  In fact, no person in his senses reasonably could expect that the Minister would have been able to give back the whole £8,000,000.  But he could have remitted almost half of it certainly, if he had stood firm on the policy upon which he was elected, on the policy upon which the people voted and on which the number of votes secured by Fine Gael had been considerably increased over the 1951 poll.</P>
      <P>If he had stood firm on that policy, then he would have been able to give back certainly £3,000,000 of it.  I do not know which of the 1952 taxes the Minister would have reduced.  If he had only dug in his heels and said: &ldquo;No increase in public expenditure&rdquo;; if the Attorney-General, as spokesman for Fine Gael, who said he could reduce expenditure by many millions of pounds, had dug in his heels and said: &ldquo;I will not stand for that&rdquo; or &ldquo;I am going to get out&rdquo;, then he would have something to give to the people.  It would naturally be a matter for his own judgment as to how he would distribute it.  However, one of the Minister's lieutenants, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Government, has told us what he would have done.  He has told us: &ldquo;In the general good the greatest boon the Minister for Finance could confer was a reduction in income-tax.&rdquo; When the Parliamentary Secretary, Mr. O'Donovan as he was then, forsook the Civil Service to join Fine Gael&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the political stargazers of that organisation told us that a new sun had shown itself in the economic firmament.  &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; they told us, &ldquo;is an economic luminary who will beam brightly on our nation and show Governments the path they should tread.&rdquo;  Later, when Mr. <Col N="1775" /> O'Donovan&mdash;I refer to him as Mr. O'Donovan because I want to distinguish his position in time&mdash;received his appointment as Parliamentary Secretary to the Government, the word went around to the Fine Gael supporters in his constituency, which happens also to be mine, that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Government was to be the grey eminence behind the new Minister for Finance, the keeper of the Minister's conscience, a person who would see that justice was done to the taxpaper and, more directly, that justice was done to those who are subject to direct taxation.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has left us in no doubt as to what he would have done if he had been Minister for Finance.  He told the Minister for Finance, as he has told us all, that: &ldquo;In the general good the greatest boon the Minister for Finance could confer was the reduction of income-tax by 6d. in the £.&rdquo;  But the Minister for Finance has turned a deaf ear to the Parliamentary Secretary and has given no significant relief to the taxpayers of the country in this Budget.  Who has been responsible for that?  That is what everybody is asking now.  Many attempts have been made to extenuate the Minister's failure, the failure of the Coalition, to reduce taxation.  But what we are asking now is: who is responsible for compelling the Minister to go back on the pledges which his Party gave at the last general election? That is what we all want to know.  I shall not try to answer that question.  I cannot answer it.  It might have been the Labour Party.  It might have been Clann na Talmhan.  It might even have been Deputy MacBride.  One does not know because Deputy MacBride has peculiar ideas as to how the public finances should be managed. Perhaps it is he who has been responsible for denying to the taxpayers the reliefs they are entitled to get.</P>

      <P>What we did realise was that our country was in a parlous condition as theirs was.  We both happened to be in the same boat.  The British Minister became Chancellor of the Exchequer late in 1951 and I became Minister for Finance early in 1951.  We both had inherited the same type of problem and we had to follow a Government of spendthrifts.  We found accumulated debts which we had to meet, that we were bankrupt almost in the face of the world.  Therefore, we said to each other: &ldquo;We intend to pursue a realistic policy in this country.&rdquo;  I took no dictation from any Minister, Mr. Butler or anybody else, in my life. Accordingly, I am not going to take that vile insinuation from any Deputy in this House, particularly a stranger. a person whom I do not know ever served in this country one day.</P>

We want to get to the state here which they have in other countries, where the public finances will be regarded as the concern of everybody and where it will be realised that unless you have sound public finance, unless you have stable financial and economic conditions in the country, unless you try to make the people's money worth-while, you can build nothing, there will be no future and there can be no progress.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance has introduced a Budget which will meet with the approval of most people in the country.  The Governments of other countries have problems akin to ours, as the ever-recurring problem of any Government is to find enough money to enable them to carry on, to build up their economic position and to improve the social status of the people.  The Minister has done a good job.  In his Budget statement he announced the granting of benefits amounting to over £4,000,000 and at the same time he found it possible to refrain from increasing the rate of taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In particular, I want to express my appreciation of the reliefs granted in respect of small breweries.  As we know, in recent years those breweries have found it very difficult to prosper <Col N="1779" /> and to make reasonable profits.  They have had to contend with and to compete against larger breweries, to their disadvantage.  I hope that, as a result of these reliefs, the industries carried on by those concerns will expand and give more employment.  In Dundalk, we have two such breweries and I know that both the employers and employees there are grateful to the Minister for what he has done.</P>
    <P>Some people will express disappointment that the Minister did not make any reference to the claims of industry with regard to depreciation and wear and tear of machinery.  It is obvious that if industry is to prosper still further, even if it is to hold its present position, it must have protection and it must receive incentives to expand. One practical way of helping the industrial drive is to grant tax reliefs whenever possible.  Irish industrialists in particular may be disappointed with this Budget, but I think there is a gleam of hope in the fact that there is at present a committee examining the whole question of industrial taxation and it will probably make some recommendation to the Minister, which I am sure he will accept, as I know he is fully aware of the importance of this matter.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to impending legislation with regard to a voluntary health scheme.  That is very commendable and I hope that when it is in operation it will be conducted on sound and effective principles.  I am sure it will be a success and no doubt it will entice many people to avail of the services offered, when they consider that tax reliefs will be given in respect of the premiums paid under such a health scheme.  People who avail themselves of the proposed service will make themselves more independent of the State&mdash;and that is a step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>There is one burden that rests very heavily on many people at the present time, that relating to rents and rates.  This burden seems to be increasing with the years.  Rent payers and ratepayers alike&mdash;especially rate-payers&mdash;find it very difficult at times <Col N="1780" /> to make ends meet, especially when they have to contend with the added bill of income-tax.  Rates can be described as another form of tax and I am sure that, as soon as the State finances permit, the Minister will do something to alleviate the position of those people.</P>
    <P>Whilst acknowledging in general the importance of the reliefs granted in respect of the allowances for children&mdash; those reliefs will have a very beneficial effect on families&mdash;I think there is much discontent throughout the country with the present system of collecting income-tax.  I would ask the Minister to consider seriously the possibility of introducing the system of P.A.Y.E. into this country.  That system is at present operating in Great Britain with great success.  We read often in the daily papers of suggestions made with regard to this system.  I myself have been approached on many occasions and I have been told that if the system of P.A.Y.E. were introduced it would relieve many of the hardships inflicted on income-tax payers by the present system whereby they have to pay considerable sums of money in a short space of time.  If the contributions could be spread over the 52 weeks of the year, especially where it concerns people in employment the whole year round, the effect on the housholder's weekly budget would not be so great.  I hope the Minister will consider this matter, as it is very important and as it is a source of much displeasure throughout the country.</P>
    <P>A lot of talk has developed during this debate about promises made and promises broken.  To my mind, the one specific promise that was made and the one promise that stood out on its own during the last election related to the Government's intention to do all it possibly could to better the economic position and to make our people more content.  This Government has done all it can to merit the confidence of the people which it received in May of last year and it has succeeded in doing so, as can be gauged from the level of prosperity and contentment in the country to-day.  To my mind, the action of the Minister in raising pensions, which will benefit more than <Col N="1781" /> 161,000 old age pensioners, more than 6,000 blind pensioners and over 28,000 widows, his action in giving tax reliefs which will benefit the small breweries I have referred to and relief to farmers and married men with families, his action in preventing the prices of tea and butter from rising, which incidentally will benefit everyone in the country, his action in preventing the bank rate from rising and, in addition, his action in preventing the rate of taxation from rising&mdash;all these actions will be welcomed by the vast majority of the people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate has gone on for quite some time, but it is well to have put on record again the type of Budget this is and how it is viewed in the country.  I think the Budget statement can go on the records as a document of broken promises, because the Budget statement of the Minister is an admission by the Government of broken promises.  There is no doubt whatever that were it not for the lavish promises made 15 months ago by the groups which form and keep the Government in power, were it not for the extravagant statements, the dishonest statements&mdash;statements which were well known to be be dishonest by many of those who made them&mdash;that Government would not be sitting over there to-day.  They deceived the people and they set out on a deliberate campaign to deceive the people in the last general election.  The Taoiseach and every Minister sitting on that front bench, irrespective of the group to which he belongs, did make the promises that have been referred to from this side of the House.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach came here the other day and denied that he ever made a promise.  I happened to be in Enniscorthy on almost the eve of the election and Mr. Costello, as he then was, was concluding a long tour which he made of the country.  It was in the week during which the election would be held and I heard him say that, if he was given responsibility for heading a Government, he guaranteed to the people of that town that he would reduce taxation by at least £10,000,000 within a very short time of taking office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1782" /> I can get hundreds of people who listened to him make that statement. The local papers did not record that; they did not even take his speech, because the election was being held that week and would be over by the time they came out, but I definitely heard him say it.  He spoke for three-quarters of an hour on that occasion and made promise after promise to the people of that constituency to reduce taxation, to give the people cheaper food and cheaper clothing.</P>
    <P>Whenever his principal statements appeared in the daily papers they were prepared statements, but the Taoiseach was not reported at all the meetings he spoke at, and at very few of the meetings at which Ministers or back benchers&mdash;Fine Gael, Labour or any of the other groups&mdash;spoke were they reported; but in every household they canvassed they left a blue leaflet showing the existing prices of bread, tea, sugar, butter, the existing level of motor taxation and so on, and compared these with what they were in 1951.  What were those leaflets issued for?  Was it not to influence the electorate, to get their minds thinking that, if they had a change of Government, they would have cheaper food and a lower cost of living?</P>
    <P>Many of the unthinking people of the country had faith up to that time in the spoken word of the leaders of political groups, but I wonder what many of these people must be thinking to-day after reading and having had explained to them the financial policy of the Minister for Finance for the coming 12 months.  It is in the Budget statement each year that Governments have been wont to indicate what their fiscal, financial and economic policy for the coming 12 months is to be.  In each and every year since the State was established, the Minister for Finance leads off and sets out in his statement what Government policy is to be.  Will any Minister or any Deputy on the back benches opposite have the hardihood to say that the statement read to the House two weeks ago is an indication to the people that they will have lower taxation and a cheaper cost of living in any single respect?</P>
    <P>Has the loaf gone down?  Has tea <Col N="1783" /> gone down?  Has sugar gone down? Has tobacco gone down?  Has the pint been reduced?  Has any one of these lavish promises been carried into effect, with the exception of the promise with regard to butter, which was reduced by 5d. a lb. and which costs in a full year about £2,250,000?  In no other instance, has the cost of living been brought down.  It has even increased since this Government took office.  They may have no control over it in certain directions. That is quite a possibility, if it is a matter of the cost of goods which we must bring in here&mdash;they have no control over that&mdash;but there are other internal aspects of the cost of living over which they have control.</P>
    <P>I suppose that the actions of all the Ministers which affect the cost of living in any way can be discussed on this Resolution and I want to assert that the action of the Minister for Industry and Commerce in fixing prices for bacon, which was in full supply last August or September and of which there was a big surplus for export, has had the effect of increasing the price of bacon to the consumer, without any compensating advantage whatever to the producer.  The producer of bacon in this country is getting from £1 to 30/- a cwt. less to-day than he was getting 12 months ago when bacon was 4d. a lb. less than it is to-day.  We must assume that the bacon factories and the retailers of bacon at that time were getting fair profits, because they were not grousing.  That one action of the Government has increased the cost of living to the ordinary consumers with no advantage&mdash;rather with a disadvantage&mdash;to the producers of bacon.</P>
    <P>The Government decided to reduce the price of wheat.  Last year they carried on a deliberate campaign against wheat growing in this country, and even went so far as to say that it was a tragedy that so much wheat was grown.  That campaign had one object&mdash; to give the Government an opportunity, when the time came, to slash the price of wheat.  It was slashed to the extent of 12/6 a barrel.  The reason for that action was supposed to be the <Col N="1784" /> existence of racketeers in wheat production. The wheat that was grown on conacre was supposed to be grown by racketeers.  It was grown by neighbours of Deputies, small farmers' sons, working-men's sons, and people like them, who took a few acres on conacre, and grew about 2 per cent. of the wheat.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>It was Government policy to slash the price of wheat.  There is no doubt about that.  The Government took credit for that in this Budget. The Minister took credit for a saving of over £1,500,000, in the whole year, in the present Budget, and he took that at the expense of the farmers, the vulnerable section of the community, the primary producers who, with the exception of wheat, and possibly to a certain extent, milk, have no control whatever over the prices they get, or over the cost of production.  Because they were vulnerable in that respect, the Minister for Finance in the present Government, attacked them, and reduced the price of wheat in the present year.  The Government need not be one bit proud of their achievement. The result was that they succeeded admirably in reducing the acreage of wheat grown in this country.  I do not know whether they can be proud of that achievement or not, or whether it can go on record as one of the great achievements of the present Government. Every day of the week we hear Ministers and Deputies on all sides of the House appealing to the farmers for greater production.  It was a nice way the Government indicated to them how they should produce more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One particular tax which was imposed by a former Minister for Finance &mdash;I think it was Deputy MacEntee or Deputy Aiken&mdash;was remitted.  I refer to the tax on proprietors of certain dance halls.  There was a furore about it, and it was talked about more than anything else.  It was stated that the Government had given £500,000 to their friends, the dance-hall proprietors. Probably that did lead to <Col N="1785" /> many people voting against Fianna Fáil in the last election.  I have no doubt that it did.  It was hard to explain why to the ordinary rank and file of the people.  It was explained in this House, but Deputies did not want to listen to it; they would not accept an explanation.</P>
    <P>The 1952 Budget has been mentioned very often by Deputies on the opposite benches.  The House was told it was a Budget that put a blister on the country.  They were certain that it was ruining the country, and that all the ills which came since, flowed from that Budget.  It is extraordinary that not one single tax imposed by the 1952 Budget has been remitted.  Deputy MacEntee pointed out that he tried to get £10,000,000 extra on the 1952 Budget brought into the Exchequer that year, but this year it is bringing to the Exchequer over £18,000,000 extra.  Why did the Minister not remit that £8,000,000, get it back to the taxpayers, reduce the cost of living and ease the burden?  Can any Minister answer that?  We have to justify the 1952 Budget.  It is like the man and woman going to the altar.  Johnny said to her: &ldquo;We are both one now.&rdquo;  She replied: &ldquo;Yes, but I am the one.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We on this side of the House stood behind the taxation imposed in the 1952 Budget, and we can be proud of that fact.  We can also be proud that it was Deputy MacEntee and Deputy de Valera who led the Government at that time.  We can be proud of their leadership in 1952, when this country was on the verge of bankruptcy, after being taken over from a Coalition Government.  Because of their leadership they saved this country.  It took about two and a half or three years for Fianna Fáil to drive that self-same policy into the slow, dull brains of the Coalition Ministers, and to bring them to realise that the 1952 Budget was sound and that it saved this country from bankruptcy.</P>

      <P>The Deputy drew me, and advised me that what we did in the 1952 Budget was unpopular.  As a result of that, I was just indicating that what we did we are quite proud of, and we would do the same thing again, in the same set of circumstances. I am sure that, whether Fianna Fáil are here or on the other side of the House, they will do the unpopular thing, if the best interests of the country demand such an action. They will abide by the consequences, and by the misrepresentation, slander and abuse.  There is a great difference between the task of the present Minister for Finance, and that of Deputy MacEntee when he was Minister because, when Deputy MacEntee took office, he did so with a deficit Budget, which amounted to £7,000,000.

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The question which I asked this evening and which the Minister answered was an effort on my part to get from the Minister his agreement or promise that the Rossnakill water supply scheme would now be sanctioned by him and his Department since he has in his possession the official report from our engineers, which report he indicated on the Adjournment a week ago would have enabled him some time ago to have furthered the scheme and the interests of the scheme.</P>
      <P>Before going into the details of this particular matter, there is unfortunately, again, as there was on the last occasion, reason for me to point out something that, I think, should be brought to your notice, Sir.  As you are aware, a fortnight or so ago I sought to have a question raised on the Adjournment.  As a result of a misunderstanding I was not present on the night on which you appointed me to be here.  I explained that to you, Sir, and you graciously accepted the explanation as a complete and genuine misunderstanding not only on my part but on the part of your own secretary, who was the person who was to convey the information to me.</P>
      <P>I had to mention this the other night when I was speaking on the Adjournment owing to the fact that certain people in this House had tried to make a debating point out of it or some other point best known to themselves. I gave the explanation then that since I had satisfied you, Sir, as Ceann Comhairle of this House, I was not here to answer to anybody else and the Minister at present in the House, Deputy O'Donnell, when replying to me in the debate, said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I accept unreservedly Deputy Blaney's explanation as to why he did not appear here on the last night.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>But he did not stop at that.  He went on to say:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;I am just sorry that it has to be <Col N="1788" /> attributed to an official of this House that he did not turn up here.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On reading that, it is plain to me that it implies that I have given this House or you, Sir, to understand that your secretary was responsible for the matter.  I am quite sure that the matter was a misunderstanding and it was accepted by you, Sir, as a clear and genuine misunderstanding and any reflection cast upon the gentleman in question who is your secretary, Sir, should not be brought up in the House in the circumstances it was.  To-day, despite the unreserved acceptance by the Minister for Local Government of my explanation a week ago, he throws it back in the House that I had not the courtesy to come into the House on the appointed night when this matter came up before.  Those are two contradictory statements.  Surely they call for some explanation from the Minister. In asking for some explanation from him I would ask, irrespective of how I will come out of the matter, that the Ceann Comhairle's secretary should certainly be cleared of any allegation of slackness in the carrying out of his duties.</P>
    <P>Having said that, there is much that I want to say in connection with this matter on the Order Paper to-day. I want, as I have said, to get from the Minister to-day his sanction for the going ahead with the Rossnakill water supply scheme which he said could have been gone on with much more quickly and better had it not been for obstruction on my part in the Donegal County Council.  On last Tuesday night in this House, the Minister stated at column 1200 of the Official Report:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A sufficient report was then available to submit to me and it was not submitted.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He was now referring to the 14th December of last year.  He went on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I awaited receipt of that report. I heard nothing further about it until the 3rd April last, when I was approached by the Deputy's neighbour, Councillor Kelly from the Fanad peninsula, who approached me and asked me what was the position. <Col N="1789" /> When I informed him of the position I understand that he immediately took the matter up with the county council and asked them to forward the report to me.  That report was received two days prior to the Parliamentary Secretary replying to these questions.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I was accused of holding this matter up.  If that report which as a result of alleged obstruction by me was not in the Minister's possession last week or the week before&mdash;that was the reason given by him why this matter was held up&mdash;is now in his hands, I want to know whether he is in a position as a result of that report to give sanction to the scheme.  Hence, my question to-day whether the Minister would now make available to the Donegal County Council the grants necessary for the carrying out of the Rossnakill-Tamney water supply scheme.</P>
    <P>The answer was:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This scheme, if approved, would qualify for State assistance in the form of contributions to loan charges which, in the case of Gaeltacht schemes, was fixed some years ago at the rate of 43? per cent.  It is not clear whether the Deputy's question relates to the Rossnakill-Tamney scheme alone or to a larger regional scheme, the possibility of which was mentioned in a report from the county engineer which was before the county council on the 14th December last.  In regard to the larger scheme, the county council was advised on the 5th instant to have it considered from the aspect of need and urgency and to obtain the advice of the county medical officer.  The question of making available contributions at the current rate of subsidy or at any higher rate which may be determined will not arise until the Department is informed whether the county council are proceeding with the scheme mentioned in the Deputy's question, or, alternatively, whether after consulting the county medical officer as recommended, they decide to proceed with the larger scheme.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If the report was really the bogey a couple of months ago as to whether <Col N="1790" /> the scheme could not be sanctioned, the report I was alleged to be keeping by obstruction from coming to the Minister, the Minister was then either misled unconsciously or otherwise into the belief that if the report had been in his hands from the 14th December this scheme could have gone through. He now knows and I know&mdash;I knew it before this evening&mdash;that the report available to our county council on the 14th December was purely a preliminary report and no Minister and no Department of any Government could possibly give sanction to such preliminary plans.  I want to make it quite clear that if it cannot be done to-day it could not be done two months ago on the same report.</P>
    <P>That brings me to another point at issue.  It was alleged that I misled the Donegal County Council into believing that 100 per cent. grant was available.  The Minister was supposed to be quoting from the minutes of the Donegal County Council.  I want to quote an extract from the minutes of the Donegal County Council forwarded to the Minister and his Department. It is from the minutes of the Donegal County Council of the 14th December, 1954.  I stated that there was a supply some distance from Rossnakill that is not only adequate for Rossnakill but for a very large area:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;... Councillor Blaney said he thought there was provision for a 100 per cent. grant in a Gaeltacht area.  If this were so, he asked if it would not be possible to proceed with the Fanad supply and then include Rossnakill as a residual scheme.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now there is a vast difference there. A vastly different context was given in the report in the local Press as between what is recorded there in the minutes and what I was alleged to have said.  A completely different context was given as to what I actually said.  I said I thought there was a 100 per cent. grant available and, if that was so, we should proceed in a certain direction.</P>
    <P>While that may have passed unnoticed, it is worthwhile recalling what the Minister stated in this House <Col N="1791" /> on Wednesday night last which, in the light of what I have now said and in the light of that minute there, gives a different complexion to his allegation here.  It is also true, according to the Minister, that at this very moment in his Department there is being considered a recommendation or resolution from the Donegal County Council.  It is not true that I misled, according to the Minister, some of the councillors in asking that the grant for Gaeltacht schemes should be raised.  Now if the council some few months ago were in a position to know that the grant was not 100 per cent. and if they took steps to try to get it up from 43? per cent, surely it is basely untrue to say that in the interval I have been able to stand up and cod the members of the Donegal County Council into believing that there is in fact 100 per cent. grant available when there is not.</P>
    <P>Another matter that was not brought into its proper context either in the Minister's reply here or in regard to this minute was that I also suggested that, in addition to a Gaeltacht grant possibly being made available for this scheme, some grant might also be got from the National Development Fund. The reason why that has not been included in these minutes and in this extract is that when we were asked by the Government some time back to prepare schemes suitable under the National Development Fund or coming within its scope, this particular regional scheme was one of the schemes brought forward as a suggested scheme for a Development Fund grant. All those things have been completely distorted and distorted in such a way that is hard to understand why they should have been so distorted.  When one considers that this particular scheme is a water scheme serving my own house, surely anybody with ordinary common sense will scarcely stand up and declare that I am trying to retard the progress of a scheme from which I, as an individual, will benefit as much as anybody else, and which scheme was originally initiated by my late father as far back as 28 years ago &mdash;a scheme in relation to which I have used every endeavour to try to forward it and get it done since I became a <Col N="1792" /> member of the Donegal County Council.</P>
    <P>The normal approach to a matter like this was not the approach made to it last Wednesday night; and that approach was certainly not called for. But there was something else not called for and that was the Minister's statement that it was because of Councillor Kelly's intervention at the county council offices that the engineer's report dealing with this matter and discussed at the December meeting of the council came to hand. The indication was that it came to hand as a result of Councillor Kelly, Fine Gael, getting on to the Donegal County Council.</P>
    <P>I will now give the history of how the report came to hand.  Councillor Kelly is not on record as having been in touch with the Donegal County Council meetings since 3rd April last in regard to this matter.  It is a strange thing that my original question on this matter dispatched on the 30th April, and which would normally reach the Department, I suppose, on the following day, 1st May, had the only really effective result; that was that on 2nd May the Department of Local Government phoned the Donegal County Council offices and found out, as a result of that phone call, that not only had this report been sent up but that in fact it had been sent on 19th January, together with a letter of inquiry as to what grants we might get for regional or Gaeltacht schemes. Lest anybody might say: &ldquo;When it was not enclosed nobody could know it was there,&rdquo; let me make it quite clear that the original letter in the Department of Local Government, of which there is a copy in the county council offices, not only asks what grants are available but states specifically that the minutes of the Donegal County Council meeting of 14th December, incorporating the engineer's report, are enclosed.  In any sort of decently-run establishment would not ordinary commonsense dictate that if one gets a letter containing a statement that something is enclosed, and there is in fact an enclosure, one should write notifying the interested party that no enclosure had been received? <Col N="1793" /> Is it not ordinary common courtesy in any business to write and inquire back and tell the sender that the enclosure is missing?  That was not done in this case.  I want to know why it was not done.</P>
    <P>I also want to point out that if the Minister was as anxious about this scheme as he now would like the House and that part of the country from which I come to believe he is, he surely would have discovered that that letter should have had attached to it the engineer's report incorporated in the minutes, which report, he says, I held up.  I did not hold it up.  It was available, and it was sent on the 19th January last.  The Department say they did not get it.  The covering letter said it was enclosed.  The Minister or his Department did not inquire why it was not enclosed and Councillor Kelly, at the request of the Minister, did not go to the county council offices and there tell them to send it on; it was as a result of my question that the Department telephoned, and a copy of the report was forwarded.</P>
    <P>Let us see wherein truth lies.  Councillor Kelly was at a meeting of the county council on Monday night last, a meeting which dealt with this very matter; all the people concerned were there.  I may add that that meeting was not convened by me.  I was not consulted about it in any way and, if there was any flavour about it, it was the flavour of the Minister's own Party.  At that meeting I stated in Councillor Kelly's presence what I have now stated here.  He is not on record at headquarters showing that he had ever been in on this or that it was at his instigation that a copy of the report was forwarded.  Councillor Kelly got up and spoke at that meeting and he made no reference of any kind to that; neither did he make any denial of what I said at any time.</P>
    <P>Let us be quite clear about this matter.  This scheme was originally intended for a small area.  It was initiated many years ago.  Various things happened which caused it to be held up.  The Minister will find the reasons why it was held up.  He will find, if he goes to the Donegal County Council <Col N="1794" /> complete corroboration of everything I have said here.  Being quite charitable in this matter, I am prepared if the Minister has been misled through lack of information into making the accusation he made against me last week in this House in relation to the holding up of this scheme, to accept that as a very good explanation.  I am putting the matter to the Minister in that light now.  I am also putting it to him that, if he is as anxious about getting this scheme through as he would lead people to believe he is, he should now make every effort to get sanction for it instead of hemming and hawing about it and putting it on the long finger.  If this was instigated by Fine Gael with the intention of getting me down in my own area for political purposes on 24th June next, then all I can tell those interested is that they will have another think coming to them when the 24th June dawns.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. O'Donnell)</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite a considerable amount of heat has been engendered in this debate by Deputy Blaney.  I did not hear a word about this Rossnakill water supply scheme since I came into office until two or three weeks ago&mdash; not a word about it.  Now Deputy Blaney tells me that, not only he himself, but his late father also was endeavouring to get the scheme for 28 years.  I accept his word for that. During that time there was a Fianna Fáil Government in office, and there was a Fianna Fáil Minister for Local Government.  Yet, the Deputy was unable to get this scheme.</P>
      <P>A preliminary report was received in my Department on 3rd May and the Deputy now asks me to sanction this scheme, 15 days after I receive it. He tells us that he and his father were trying for 28 years to get it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yet he gave me only 15 days in which to consider the matter.  Let me tell him now.  The question he asks me is this: if I will now make available to <Col N="1795" /> the Donegal County Council the grants necessary for the carrying out of the Rossnakill-Tamney water supply scheme?  Donegal County Council has not adopted any scheme for Rossnakill or Tamney.  If the Deputy would go back and be as energetic in the county council as he is here, then I have no doubt but that some submission would come from the county council, a submission which I could approve or otherwise.  He would then be doing something for the people of his own area.</P>
    <P>The Deputy was well aware that the grant which my Department gives is 43? per cent. of the cost.  He knew that, but despite that, at that county council meeting in the month of December last he said he thought there should be a 100 per cent. grant for this work.  As a result of his misthought, or the inaccuracy of his thoughts, I heard nothing and received no preliminary plan&mdash;and I say that deliberately&mdash;from the Donegal County Council until the beginning of this month. If Deputy Blaney thought there was a 100 per cent. grant for a water supply such as this in the Gaeltacht he had a remedy and a way of confirming his thoughts and he need not have misled, as I said, the Donegal County Council into thinking that there were 100 per cent. grants for schemes such as this.</P>
    <P>Nothing further was heard about the matter until, as I said before, Councillor Kelly mentioned it to me.  I cannot approve of this scheme until we know exactly what the county council propose.  They have not yet made a decision on the Rossnakill scheme or on the regional scheme.  They have as yet come to no decision and Deputy Blaney is a member of that county council&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The county council had made no decision on this.  I have sent certain queries to the county council, and when I have received replies to them I will deal with this matter, but until the county council makes up its own mind I can do nothing for them.  I can assure the Deputy that the fact that his house will receive some water from this supply will not deter me in my energies and efforts to give the decent people of Fanad and the area a proper water supply.</P>
