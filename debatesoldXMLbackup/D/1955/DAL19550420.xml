    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if, in view of the unemployment caused in the building trade as a result of the strike of employees of builders' providers, he intends to take any steps to endeavour to settle the strike.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Norton)</NameTxt>
      <P>The present unemployment in the building trade, which arises indirectly from the dispute between certain builders' providers and their employees, is a matter of serious concern to me and to the Government. If this situation continues for very long, there is a danger that, even when normal conditions return, the building industry may be prevented by a shortage of skilled operatives from providing full normal employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy is, no doubt, aware, the dispute between the builders' poroviders and their employees was investigated by the Labour Court. The court's recommendation has been rejected by the workers and the employers have not yet indicated their attitude to it. In the circumstances. I do not see what <Col N="2" /> I can do at this stage to bring the strike to an end. I am, however, keeping in close touch with the whole position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Government adopted special measures to deal with the recent bank dispute, notwithstanding the fact that other machinery was available, and, as the builders' proimportance and interest to the community, will the Minister take steps to establish special machinery to settle it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not like to answer that question by means of a supplementary interogatory, because I think the Deputy and the trade union movement will have to consider the reactions which would follow if there is a right of appeal to the Minister against a decision of the Labour Court. That is an issue which, I think, requires much further consideration than we can give it in the course of a short question time here to-day.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state the nature of the proposals, which were submitted to him by the Cork Harbour Commissioners, and in respect of which a grant of £400,000 from the National Development Fund was recently authorised; further, whether such proposals provided for (i)  the widening and deepening of the liner anchorage at Cobh, (ii) the establishment and extension of a deep water quay at Cobh, (iii)  the reconstruction of Cobhyh town pier, which as now been converted into a mere boat slip because of its dangerous condition and from which more than 700 workers have to leave daily and nightly for work on Haulbowline, (iv) the dredging and repair of Ballinacurra pier and harbour, (v)  the repair and reconstruction of Aghada pier, and (vi) the reconstruction and repair of Monkstown pier.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that before the Dáil adjourned I asked him if he could give us the boundaries of Cork Harbou? I have since gone through the file that he told me to <Col N="4" /> look into and I find that the inner boundary of Cork Harbour is across from Monkstown to Rushbrooke, down to Cariagaline, that that does bnot embrace the City of Cork where £360,000 is proposed to be spent, an d while the Minister for Finance gave it out here that this matter was being given consideration under the National Development Fund, I should like to know how the Harbour Development Fund money is being spent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will introduce proposals for legislation to compel Cork Harbour Commissioners to put into a proper state of repair the piers in Cobh Harbour, which are at present in a dangerous condition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The responsibilities of a harbour authority for the maintenance of their harbour and of the harbour <Col N="5" /> works under their control are already prescribed by Section 47 of the Harbours Act, 1946.  Any representations about the condition of the piers at Cobh should, accordingly, be addressed to the Cork Harbour Commissioners. As I indicated in reply to a question from the Deputy on 17th November last, extensive repairs to the Town Pier at Cobh have recently been carried out by the Harbour Commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the question, is the Minister aware that he was requested during a recent visit to Cobh to see the pier and that he was very carefully spirited away from it? As a Labour Party Minister, I should like that he would see where 700 men have to get on board&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware that dues charged by the Cork Harbour Board for fertilisers are from 1/3 to 2/- per ton higher than those charged by other harbour authorities, and that the ships concerned could discharge their cargoes at Cobh if facilities were provided there; and, if so, if he will make representations to the board in the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if, in view of the fact that the cost of the constant dredging, which has to be carried out on the River Lee between Blackrock and Cork City, is largely responsible for the high harbour dues charged, he will request the Cork Harbour Board to operate a differential rate of dues in favour of vessels discharging cargo in Cobh and Cobh Harbour; further, if he will take steps to ensure that the <Col N="6" /> Cork Harbour Board provide proper facilities for the discharge of cargoes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 and 5 together.</P>
      <P>I understand that the Cork Harbour Commissioners have been legally advised that it is not within their powers to charge lower rates at Cobh than at Cork, even if they considered such a course to be justified.</P>
      <P>The provision of any facilities that may be required at Cobh for the discharge of cargoes is a matter for the Cork Harbour Commissioners to whom any representations which the Deputy may wish to make should be addressed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister further aware that the difference in these dues, which, on account of his inactivity, I raised with his predecessor here on the 7th December, 1950, meant the loss of an industry to Cobh and that the actual dues charged are 2/9¾d. a ton for raw phosphates, 10d. a ton for coal, 2/6 a ton for wheat and 2/6 a ton for foreign barley and maize?  These are the raw materials for the farmers' produce.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state the regulations and by-laws in force since May, 1954, at Shannon and Dublin Airports, relating to the admission of visitors meeting and seeing off friends and relatives, and whether special consideration is given to <Col N="10" /> certain classes of people; and, if so, if he will indicate the classes in question, and state in particular what provisions are in force for dealing with members of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The admission of visitors to Shannon and Dublin Airports to meet or see off friends and relatives is governed by the Shannon Airport by-laws, 1953, and the Dublin Airport by-laws, 1953.  Both sets of by-laws came into force on 13th April, 1953.</P>
      <P>The payment of admission charges by visitors is governed by the Shannon Airport (admission charges) by-laws, 1953, and the Dublin Airport (admission charges) by-laws, 1953, both of which came into force on 14th September, 1953.</P>
      <P>Ordinarily visitors seeing off friends and relatives are admitted to the public areas at both airports but are excluded from the areas reserved for embarking and disembarking passengers. At Shannon they are also ordinarily excluded from the transit or customs-free area.</P>
      <P>There are no special regulations relating to the admission of specific classes of persons to either airport for the purpose of meeting or seeing off friends or relatives, but in special circumstances the airport managers have discretion to allow visitors into areas other than the public areas.</P>
      <P>The by-laws contain no special provisions relating to members of the Oireachtas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I explained that the airport manager in special circumstances has discretion to allow visitors into areas other than the public areas. I presume these circumstances are <Col N="11" /> where somebody arrives at the airport and wants to see a friend off.  Presumably such people make application to the airport manager and the manager is entitled to say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; as he pleases.  But there is no direction from the Government in the matter; and there is no direction from the Department.  The discretion is one which is vested entirely in the manager and exercisable by him if he thinks the circumstances warrant it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>Responsibility for fixing charges for electricity rests under statute on the E.S.B. and I have no function in the matter.  I am informed, however, that the basis of the assessment of the fixed charges for the houses referred to by the Deputy is identical with that applied throughout the whole country and represents a reduction in nearly all cases on the former fixed charges.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>These houses are advertised by the local authority as four-roomed and five-roomed houses.  The rentals, as everybody knows, are as high as 34/- to 38/- per week, including rates.  Being a member of the urban council, I have myself raised this matter at one of our meetings and I have been assured by the officials that the houses in question are four-roomed and five-roomed houses.  The members of the urban council cannot understand how the E.S.B. can make out that these are five-roomed and six-roomed houses. All one has on the ground floor is a living-room and a kitchenette and there is no division whatsoever.  The kitchen is certified by the E.S.B. as a kitchenette, though there is no division whatsoever.  Such classification is a gross injustice and I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to take the matter up again with the E.S.B.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the E.S.B. that the Rathgormack area, which includes Clonea, and the Dunhill area, which includes Kill and Newtown, have been considered for selection by the board on a number of occasions, but have not so far been selected as the returns for the areas have not compared favourably with those for other areas still awaiting development in the Waterford district. I am also informed that in both areas only a moderate proportion of the householders has agreed to take supply and that an increase in the number of householders willing to accept supply would be necessary before the areas could be selected for development.  The selection of areas is, of course, a matter solely for the E.S.B.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the E.S.B. that the neighbourhood of Cleariestown, County Wexford, is included in the Kilmore area which has been developed under the rural electrification scheme but that the extension of supply at standard rates of charge to householders in the vicinity of Cleariestown was not found economic when the original construction work was in progress.  Where provision of supply at standard rates is uneconomic, householders are offered supply at special service charges, and I am informed by the board that, when certain postdevelopment <Col N="15" /> work is being carried out in the area, the position of the householders concerned will be considered and they will be given an opportunity of taking supply on the basis of special terms, if necessary.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he will state (a) the comparative consumption of meals per lb. of live weight gain of the large white and landrace breeds of pigs, (b) their relative immunities to various diseases, (c) the relative suitability of their carcases for the present pork and bacon trade, and (d) whether there is evidence that a large scale investigation and practical trial of both breeds under similar conditions is called for in this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards (a) and (c), there would be considerable variation between individual pigs and strains of pig within each breed.  I am not aware of any conclusive results of tests of the comparative potentialities of the breeds in the matter of food conversion efficiency and carcase quality, based on pigs of an equally representative standard of selection in each case as developed through comprehensive progeny testing.</P>
      <P>As regards (b), no inherent differences in susceptibility to disease have been reliably established according to present information.  Landrace pigs, which are native to continental countries, have there been exposed to and found susceptible to serious diseases not occurring in this country such as atrophic rhinitis for which no successful treatment has been reported.</P>
      <P>As regards (d), the soundest approach in this country is to develop, as is now being undertaken, comprehensive progeny-testing of the universal large white breed so as to identify the most suitable strains.  In any event, the import of landrace pigs could not be permitted because of very serious veterinary objections.</P>

      <P>An interview, in addition to a written examination, is prescribed for candidates at competitions for posts as meteorological assistant for the reason that experience shows that this is the most satisfactory method of selecting candidates for posts of this type.  The work of the meteorological service <Col N="26" /> is specialised, and the duties of a meteorological assistant call for qualities which it is considered could not be satisfactorily assessed by written examination alone.  It is not, therefore, proposed to dispense with the interview as part of these competitions.</P>
      <P>I do not know what the Deputy means by his reference to &ldquo;equivalent Civil Service posts&rdquo;, but I would draw his attention to the fact that interviews, in addition to written examinations, are by no means unusual in competitions conducted by the Civil Service Commissioners for posts in which the circumstances are similar to those obtaining in the case of meteorological assistants.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>When I moved to report progress before the recess I was speaking of our obligation or the obligation of any Government to the garrison towns.  I said on that occasion that the garrison towns were towns whose whole economy was built on an army of occupation and when that army was removed their economies were completely smashed.  In my constituency there is a tragic example of that upset in the town of Fermoy.  The garrison towns readily adapted themselves and accepted the changed position, but for some inexplicable reason the moneyed people in Fermoy had no faith, no confidence, in the new Ireland.  They held aloof, with the result that opportunities which came the way of many other towns passed by and Fermoy was left in the lurch.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I maintain that any Government and any Minister for Industry and Commerce has an obligation to towns of that kind.  We cannot leave them strewn as economic wrecks on the road to victory and progress.  It is the duty of the Government to come in, where possible, when private enterprise has failed.  It is no use to pinpoint <Col N="33" /> a particular situation without having something constructive to offer. Therefore, I propose to suggest to the Minister that Fermoy forms the hub of an extensive forest area.  It would be ideally situated from every point of view for the development of a wood pulp industry.  We are all too familiar with the pattern of things and are we to assume that when such an industry comes along it, too, will be based in Dublin and that the raw material for that industry will be drawn from the provinces?  At the moment, there are extensive thinnings and there is an extensive removal of fairly mature timber from that area.  That development is bound to increase.  Some of those forests will reach maturity in a very short time.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister and to the Government to come in where private enterprise has failed.  One of the tragedies of a town like Fermoy is that while a number of people had a considerable amount of money they were not public-spirited enough, when opportunities came, to put their money into an industry that would rehabilitate their town.  Their approach was very much that of the vulture; they would prefer to live and grow fat on the corpse of Fermoy.  There is a rather tragic position there.  There has been wholesale emigration from that particular town.  At the moment, there are over 300 unemployed registered at the local employment exchange.  Such a situation cannot be allowed to continue.  As a Deputy and as a representative for that particular area, it is my duty to urge on the Minister the gravity of the very acute problem which exists there and to ask him and his Department to examine the suggestion which I have put forward.</P>
    <P>The report of the Commission on Emigration seems to suggest that the City of Dublin has not overgrown. When I was speaking earlier on this debate I made the point that it is nothing unusual for rural Deputies to have the taunt flung at them that Dublin is Ireland.  No matter by what road you approach this city, you cannot but notice the development that <Col N="34" /> has taken place in it.  There are considerable factory extensions in the suburbs and these same suburbs are ever-increasing.  I for one could not accept the opinion of the commission on that point but if there were some relative comparison between Dublin City and the other main provincial towns then one might be inclined to agree with the report.  To my mind, however, Dublin has grown to the extent that one might describe it as an exotic creation on an economy which is based primarily and fundamentally on agriculture.  Dublin continues to grow and, at the moment, greater Dublin houses practically one fifth of the total population of this State.  It houses and has within its boundaries practically the whole Government administrative machine and no serious attempt has been made to examine this problem and no serious attempt has been made towards the decentralisation of that particular machine.  Many people who are capable of giving opinions can see no logical reason why some of the Government Departments should not be decentralised and placed in the provinces.</P>
    <P>In the light of the development of a city such as Dublin, certain important questions arise.  A few weeks ago there was a Supplementary Estimate for the Department of Defence and some speeches were made here on the subject of air-raid precautions.  I should like the House to consider what the position of Dublin would be in a nuclear war.  When one contemplates the devastation that was caused by the dropping of an atomic bomb on Hiroshima and on Nagasaki, one hates to think of the position of Dublin.  The atomic bombs which were dropped on Japan were, we are told, just like damp squibs in the light of recent scientific developments.  It is obvious that one bomb would destroy the whole population of Dublin and send it up in that type of &ldquo;mushroom&rdquo; which we see picked up here and there on the testing grounds by telescopic cameras. Even if we were fortunate, under God's providence, to be neutral in another war, what, in fact, would our position be?  Suppose some of those explosives <Col N="35" /> were dropped on British industrial centres on the west coast&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce is responsible for the development of industry.  Industrialists who come here are given certain concessions and certain facilities. Surely there should be a <i>quid pro quo</i> and that the Department of Industry and Commerce would give some incentive towards having industries located in the provincial towns.  Again, when one realises that there is something like 15 per cent. of the representation in this House coming from Dublin City and County, when one thinks of what can be done and when one thinks of the coup carried out by the Attorney-General on the eve of the last election, one is forced to believe that in certain circumstances such a huge concentration of population would be a challenge to a democratic set-up.  Again, it is very easy in a set-up like this, where you have this enormous concentration of population, for any particular political Party to offer incentives that would pack mule the rest of the rural community. I appeal to the Minister and to his Department to give some consideration to decentralising industry to prevent migration to the cities and emigration from the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has an enormous Department and I propose to discuss one of the organisations under his control, which itself is enormous, the E.S.B.  When this great undertaking was conceived here 25 <Col N="36" /> years ago, none of us thought that such enormous progress would me made.  In fact, many members of this House did not share our enthusiasm at that time for the electricity supply scheme.  Even more valuable than the scheme itself was the state of mind that it displayed, the confidence in the future that it showed.  We are all delighted now that it has borne fruit.  Indeed, although it is not appropriate to this discussion, if some of the same confidence could be, for instance, devoted to forestry or if it had been done then, how much better off we would be to-day.</P>
      <P>To return to the E.S.B., there is, of course, no rose without a thorn and I think the E.S.B. is tending to suffer somewhat from&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>An overgrowth of thorns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;quite a lot of thorns.  A lot of these thorns are thorns that we associate with monopoly. Monopoly is a paradise of the planners, of course.  The E.S.B. has developed the autocracy of the big body in a rather alarming way and it shows considerable objection to criticism.</P>
      <P>To deal with only one item, that is, the new system of charging domestic consumers for electric current, I do not know what examination was given to this new system of charging.  It is probably easier for the E.S.B. staff to deal with it in this way; it is easier to do the planning.  But there are many complaints and I think every Deputy has received a great number of these complaints.  I have 200 letters in the matter.  The Minister, of course, had to tell me, when I asked questions in the House, that he had no function but this House has given very great powers to this body, and this House has a function, if the board does things that displease the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This fixed charge, I think, is the cause of most of the irritation.  I have made many complaints to the board of obvious disparities and irregularities in the way in which this charge is arrived at and I really have not got any satisfaction from the board.  I wrote personally to the Minister some months ago and he was kind enough to send me <Col N="37" /> an extremely long and detailed reply setting out the E.S.B. position in the matter.  I was grateful for that but it was almost a blunt refusal to reconsider the system.  I think the consumers would prefer a straight charge, that is, a charge instead of the arbitrarily imposed basic rate plus the use charge. There are some laughable anomalies in the present system.  I have bills in my possession for two units of electricity, £2 18s; and in many instances one unit would work out at 18/- or 19/-because of this fixed charge.</P>
    <P>I have seen cases where there were similar types of houses of the same size where a different basic charge was arranged for each house and in one case where the person was being charged a higher basic rate he kicked up a row and the E.S.B. inspector came along and, as a result, this gentleman got all his neighbours brought up to the higher charge.  To-day in the House one of the questions asked was on that matter where houses of similar size were getting bills from the E.S.B. for different basic rates.</P>
    <P>I do not know why it is necessary to have the meter charge.  I think it would be possible, for instance, to have a flat rate for domestic current, to have, for instance, lighting and heating all over the country the same, and let it find its own price level.  It must find it eventually.  We have to find the money and it should not be very difficult for the planners to devise that. There is human objection to paying for unconsumed current.  In the long run we all should only pay for exactly the goods supplied to us and it should not be made too easy for the people in the offices of the E.S.B. to say: &ldquo;We can plan ahead if we know our income will be so much on the basis of the fixed charge alone.&rdquo;  It should be made a bit harder for them than that and what they do should relate itself more easily to the services they are supposed to render.</P>
    <P>The people have created this monopoly themselves and they are entitled to object if it does what it could not do if there was competition. They have created the monopoly.  If there were competitive suppliers of <Col N="38" /> electric current the E.S.B. could not do many of the things they so blandly and in an autocratic way do to-day.</P>
    <P>Another angle of their activities that I have been worried about and have asked questions about was the expansion of retail trading by the E.S.B. Although permission was given in the 1929 Bill for the E.S.B. to go into retail trading, I do not think it was conceived then that this trading would grow to the enormous extent to which it has grown.  Small traders and electrical suppliers in the towns, cities and villages all over the country are having their livings threatened by this State octopus.  Do we want to go in that direction?  If we do not, I think we should stop it now.  I think already it has gone too far.</P>
    <P>The size of the organisation gives it enormous buying ability.  An example of that took place in Cork this winter. During the cold spell electric fires were unobtainable from many retailers. They were unobtainable because the E.S.B. had bought out the entire output of the factories manufacturing these fires.  Now, do we want to go in that direction?  I do not think so. The mass advertising that the E.S.B. do &mdash; pick up any of the daily newspapers and, of course, the provincial papers and they all devote enormous space&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall get away from the E.S.B. and this stone wall that has gone up around them since I came into the House, but I should like to say that these matters will add to the hardships of the E.S.B. consumers.  It will help the E.S.B. to build up that indifference to criticism that I am afraid is one of their great faults and I think that this House should authorise the holding of an inquiry into those dictatorial and overbearing trends now in evidence in that organisation.</P>
      <P>I intended confining myself to the E.S.B., but I want to add, as a footnote so to speak, a few words about the Cork airport about which other Cork Deputies have already spoken. There has been, to my mind, a lot of confused thinking about this airport. Deputy McGrath gave the impression that I was rather antagonistic to it. He sat for years behind the Government Benches and he was rather ineffective as an airport enthusiast during that time.  Now he says that I, as a beginner, am opposed to the airport and that I will not let the Government do anything about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is very flattering to me but I should like to point out that I have not got that much authority.  I do not oppose the airport, but it must be thought of in conjunction with the economy of a poor country.  This must be a poor country because we had to increase the price of bread and butter <Col N="40" /> in 1952, and it is only now that we have been able to reduce the price of butter. I think the price of bread should also be reduced before we begin indulging in airports.  That was what I said in my election speeches to which Deputy McGrath referred when he was speaking on this Estimate, and I am satisfied now to repeat those speeches in Deputy McGrath's company in the City of Cork whenever he wishes to make the appointment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I should like to compliment the Minister on the comprehensive nature of the survey which he has made in introducing his Estimate and also on the workmanlike approach he has displayed in tackling the work of his Department.  Naturally, I suppose, the most important aspect of this Estimate is that which relates to our industrial development, but I often feel that we have not approached the problem of industrial development sufficiently fundamentally and objectively. We have naturally been anxious to develop industries to provide employment. That was inevitable in the period of time which has elapsed since 1921, but I feel the time has now come when we should take stock of our industrial development generally and try to analyse the main obstacles and the main difficulties that confront us. I have tried to analyse some of those difficulties under six different headings which I should like to enumerate so that we might be able to consider them one by one &mdash; if not now, possibly at some later stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first difficulty, or, if you like, No. 1 obstacle, is the smallness of our home market&mdash;the smallness of our internal market in terms of modern industrial development.  Three million of a population is a fairly small market and therefore it is essential that in the development of our industries, we should, wherever possible, develop an industry which is capable of an export market as well.  That is the ideal type of industry&mdash;an industry that can cater for a certain home market and that can, in addition, hope to capture and develop an export trade. In that way overhead costs&mdash;costs of production generally&mdash;can be reduced. It is, therefore, an essential ingredient <Col N="41" /> of our industrial development that we should develop an export trade.  Whenever we are examining the possibility of setting up an industry we should examine it in conjunction with the possibility of developing an export trade.</P>
    <P>The second obstacle to our industrial development probably arises from the lack of raw materials.  Apart from the raw materials produced from the land and from a very small quantity of mineral deposits which have so far been identified and developed, we have, in fact, no raw materials to speak of.  There is very little we can do to overcome that difficulty beyond making a special effort to try and probe to the full all the possibilities there are for mining&mdash;mineral development and mining of coal.  We have, of course, at our hands the means available whereby we can produce one of the most important raw materials of to-day&mdash; timber&mdash;but, unfortunately, so far we have completely neglected the opportunity which is open to us from that point of view.</P>
    <P>The third difficulty is that which arises from the pattern of trade, which existed heretofore, but which has developed particularly since the war, whereby a dual pricing system of raw materials operates: in our case that dual pricing system operates in relation to coal, steel and metals generally. Now that places our manufacturers at a serious disadvantage. It is quite obvious that if a manufacturer has to pay a higher price than his competitors for his raw materials he becomes unable to compete effectively and he becomes certainly completely unable to compete in the export market.  This question of dual pricing is one that should receive a good deal more attention from the Government and from our industrialists than it has so far received.  It is one of the handicaps which are being imposed on our industrial development. The payment of a higher price for raw materials obviously prevents competition by our manufacturers in the export market and, in addition, results in a higher price for the goods produced by our own industrialists.  This is a very serious question and I would <Col N="42" /> urge the Minister to have the matter examined very carefully.</P>
    <P>This question of dual pricing and differential pricing which operates in regard to raw materials is important from another aspect as well: in addition to the direct handicap it imposes upon our manufacturers and the restriction it places upon our industrial development, it also leads in some cases to higher tariffs than would normally be required.  If our manufacturers have to pay a higher price for their raw materials they need a higher rate of protection against their foreign competitors in order to survive. Accordingly, in many instances a much higher protective tariff has been necessitated by reason of the fact that this dual pricing system is in operation.</P>
    <P>The fourth handicap under which our industrialists labour is that they have to pay a higher rate of interest for their money.  Not only have they to pay a higher price for the raw materials they use but in addition they have to pay a higher rate of interest on the money they require to develop their industries.  I am glad to say that at the moment that position does not exist for the first time in the history of our State; to that extent, one of the obstacles in the way of industrial development has been removed &mdash; I hope for all time.</P>
    <P>The fifth difficulty arises from lack of risk capital and also from the conservative attitude, if I may say so, of many of our large investors who are slow to take the risks required for industrial development.  I do not know how that particular difficulty can be overcome.  It could be overcome through the medium of Government aid from time to time in order to ensure that industry is developed, if it is felt that a particular industry is essential and has a sound chance of economic survival.</P>
    <P>The sixth difficulty is what may be termed the lack of industrial tradition and experience, or the lack of know-how. Inevitably, as a result of our history, we have suffered from a lack of industrial tradition and industrial experience.  It takes time to build up <Col N="43" /> that tradition, that experience and that technical know-how.  But that is not such a serious obstacle inasmuch as technical experience, if not tradition, can be acquired fairly rapidly either by sending people from here abroad to acquire it or by bringing in technicians to assist in the development of our industrial arm.</P>
    <P>These are, so far as I can analyse them, the six main problems that face the Minister and the Government in the promotion of industrial development. I do not know to what extent the Industrial Development Authority has had an opportunity of examining these difficulties and propounding proposals to the Government for resolving them.  It has often occurred to me that the Government should not hesitate where need arises and where there is a possibility of developing a new industry of providing the buildings, equipping them and providing the technical assistance necessary for the development of such an industry.  I do not suggest that the Government should itself undertake the running of an industry.  Where, however, there is an opening and where those who are in a position to start such an industry are slow to take the first step, the Government should consider the advisability of building and equipping a factory and providing the technical experience necessary; having done that, the factory could then be handed over to private investors, or to a company.</P>
    <P>A similar scheme was operated for a time in the Six Counties.  I think it was also operated in England.  We might do well to consider the advisability of instituting such a scheme here. Such a scheme, of course, would only operate where the Department and the Industrial Development Authority were satisfied that the creation of a particular industry was a sound proposition and that the industry could survive economically.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in introducing his Estimate, made some reference to the question of mineral development.  I am far from satisfied that we have explored, as we should have explored, the full extent of our mineral deposits and <Col N="44" /> the potential mineral development available in the country.</P>
    <P>Sometimes I have the feeling that mineral deposits that are known to exist in different parts of the country are written off on the basis that the quantity of the mineral available is not sufficient or that the difficulties of extracting it present too great an obstacle and that those conclusions are reached, not on the basis of a modern assessment of the position, but on the basis of an assessment made some considerable time ago.  The prices of metals have increased very considerably since most of these surveys or assessments were made.  In addition to that, the methods of extraction of minerals and the separation of them have improved beyond recognition and I have the feeling that many mineral deposits that were regarded as uneconomic maybe 20 or 30 years ago might be quite a sound proposition to-day.</P>
    <P>One area in particular to which I would draw the Minister's attention is the area of West Cavan and Leitrim. We know that there are very big deposits and that little or no work has been done to ascertain the extent of these deposits or whether it would be economic to develop mining operations in that area.  It is an extremely poor part of the country from which there is a very high rate of emigration and it would be a tremendous asset if these minerals could be properly surveyed and if mines could be opened there.</P>
    <P>I welcome the announcement by the Minister that it is proposed to undertake the export of whiskey, or a special blend of whiskey, on a large scale.  That, indeed, is a development that is very long overdue.  I am glad that at last some concrete steps are being taken in the matter and that that particular neglect&mdash;because it is nothing else but a neglect&mdash;of this export possibility will be remedied.</P>
    <P>One matter to which I would like to draw the Minister's attention relates to the utilisation of timber.  Small and inadequate as our forest operations have been, there are matured in different parts of the country certain State forests and the time has come <Col N="45" /> when there should be some definite plan for the utilisation of the products from our forests.  Probably the Department of Lands has considered that particular aspect of afforestation, but I feel the time has come when this must be considered in a more serious way from an industrial point of view. There has been a tendency to regard the thinnings from forests and the timber produced from forests as being merely supplies of pit props.  That, I think, is probably the lowest priced timber.  I think that an examination of the possible utilisation of the quantity of timber that will be available over the period of the next ten years should be made now and plans for the utilisation of that timber should be made.</P>
    <P>In addition to the timber that will mature through' State forests, there are fairly substantial quantities of timber available in private ownership throughout the country but by reason of the lack of any purchasing organisation that timber is often allowed to be completely wasted or is used uneconomically. In many cases it is valuable timber that could produce a much better return.  I would ask the Minister to consider that aspect of the problem of afforestation and to initiate discussions with the Department of Lands in regard to it.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether on this Estimate it would be open to me to discuss the advisability of detaching the Forestry Division completely from the Department of Lands.  I think ultimately that is a step that will have to be taken but I do not know that it is relevant on this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister if he has read the industrial survey which was prepared, I think, two years ago by a group of American technicians, economists and businessmen under an E.C.A. technical assistance project.  The industrial survey is entitled &ldquo;Industrial Potentials of Ireland&rdquo; and the survey was carried out after a fairly thorough investigation <Col N="46" /> of economic conditions here, of the industrial developments that had been carried out so far, but I feel that survey may have been overlooked as indeed is the case with many Government commissions and surveys carried out from time to time by Government Departments.  They are overlooked and nothing is done about them afterwards.</P>
      <P>We set up a commission with a great flourish of trumpets; we complain bitterly if the commission takes too long to bring in a report, but then as soon as the report comes out we put it in a pigeon-hole and gradually the dust is inclined to cover the report and everybody forgets about it.  Very seldom is any definite action taken on foot of the report of a commission, and I feel to a certain extent this industrial survey, which contains a very valuable analysis of our industrial development so far, has been overlooked.  I would ask the Minister to take it off the dusty shelf and have a look at it again in the light of present circumstances.</P>
      <P>I do not want to weary the House by quoting long extracts from it, but there are one or two extracts that I think are appropriate.  They are in the conclusions reached at the end and I think they are important.  I would ask the Minister to bear these particular conclusions in mind.  After having reviewed the position generally, the experts summarised the position in this way:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We return at the end, to a theme that has run like a chain of linked traffic signals throughout our analysis of the Irish economy&mdash;the degree of Ireland's economic linkage to the United Kingdom which is inconsistent with its passionate commitment to political independence.  The effectiveness of political sovereignty will continue to be vitiated while the Irish economy remains so decisively dependent upon the United Kingdom as a market for its exports, as the purveyor of its shipping services, as its major source of import supply, and in its financial and fiscal services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The influence of this status of economic dependency dominates the design and colour of Ireland's economic life in myriad ways that <Col N="47" /> rob it of independent initiative.  Her currency is tied to sterling and sterling crises affect Ireland by the inevitable process of infusion. Ireland's investment funds both public and private have flowed to the United Kingdom in the absence of a developed and active market for home investment.  She is almost entirely dependent upon Britain for dollar exchange.  She is forced to buy an important part of her processing materials upon terms that are competitively disadvantageous, and to sell an important part of her output in a form that serves the convenience and interest of England's economy rather than her own. Almost every decision and bargain with respect to Ireland's foreign trade is conditioned by the stern necessity of accepting the best terms that Britain will offer, since no tenable alternatives have been fashioned.</P>
    <P>The status of economic dependence permeates the psychology and outlook of all but a few of the boldest spirits who are concerned with the management of Ireland's economic affairs.  Procedures in most economic fields continue to be modelled upon British procedures even at a time when, demonstrably, they are working far from well in the country of their origin.</P>
    <P>Irish business is generally hesitant to meet British competition head-on. Premium aged Irish whiskey is exported at prices competitive with ordinary Scotch, which leaves neither much by way of incentive for exporting or margin for promoting its sale.  Irish pottery and most Irish textiles are styled to imitate British designs instead of developing a distinctive character of their own. There is an enormous goodwill toward Ireland in many parts of the world, partly generated by its forced emigration of population, that could be capitalised if Ireland could develop export products that were both excellent in quality and recognisably Irish in their characteristics.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="48" /> For the Irish economy to come of age, it must be placed in a position of independence comparable at least to that which to date has been achieved in the political field.  That, too, will require time and effort. Independence can only be achieved through building alternative markets and finding alternative sources of supply.  It emphatically cannot be forwarded by merely giving up long established relationships with the British economy, a process that would leave Ireland weaker rather than stronger.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then the final paragraph:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The greatest need in Ireland's economic life is confidence&mdash;the will to establish a framework of economic institutions geared to dynamic growth, the independence to cut loose from usages modelled upon European practice that is defensively restrictive.  In short, Ireland in the economic sphere needs to adopt the independence of spirit that it has applied to the political and cultural fronts.  Its economic development calls for the boldness of individual initiative and the healthy gusto for the good things of life that characterise the heroic tradition...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is an interesting survey coming from outsiders, businessmen, economists, who presumably approached this question objectively.  Not unnaturally what struck one forcibly was that we are in the extraordinary position of having to sell most of our products to Britain at a lower price than the market price. There is a differential price imposed upon our exporters of cattle.  They receive less for the cattle they export than their competitors across the Channel.  While, therefore, we receive a smaller price than the market price for a large proportion of our exports, we, at the same time, have to pay a higher price for a large proportion of our imports and particularly, as I have already mentioned, our imports of essential raw materials.  It is essential to try to remedy that position if we are to develop industrially in a healthy way.  If we tackle that question objectively and if we are able to <Col N="49" /> remove some of those restrictions to our development, it will then become possible to lower many of the tariffs that had to be erected in order to protect our own people and our own manufacturers from what, in effect, amounts to an unfair type of competition from across the Channel.</P>
    <P>I welcome very much the announcement made by the Minister that it is proposed to do something about the cross-Channel shipping trade.  It is an extraordinary situation that 70 per cent.  or more of our cross-Channel shipping should be owned by non-Irish interests.  I would like to join with other Deputies in urging the Minister to take particularly strong measures in regard to the passenger trade between here and Britain.  The way in which travellers, especially on the Holyhead route, are treated is nothing short of scandalous.  The conditions that exist at peak times would not be tolerated in any other country and those conditions exist because apparently British Railways and the operators of this particular service feel that they have the Irish people at their mercy, that they will put up with any conditions, that any conditions are good enough for the Irish travelling public. Of course, these conditions are extremely harmful to our own tourist development.</P>
    <P>With regard to tourism generally, I do not know whether the Minister would consider the possibility of availing of voluntary advisory boards or consultative boards that could assist either the Tourist Board or the Department in regard to different matters.  I feel we have available in the country quite a number of people who would not be able to devote their whole time to tourism but whose views and advice would be extremely helpful and who would be willing to make those views and advice available on a voluntary basis to the Government.  I know the difficulty of tying in advisory boards of this kind with a big organisation but value would be got if some use could be made of people in a position to give specialised advice either in regard to advertising abroad, to catering facilities in hotels or to transport here.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="50" /> Also, of course, I welcome wholeheartedly the announcement made by the Minister that it is hoped that, by June, there will be a passenger service on the River Shannon.  I think one of the important aspects of our tourist development which we have been inclined to overlook is the lack of new things for our own people to do.  Our approach to tourist development should always be on two different fronts.  In the first place, we should aim, I suppose, at enticing visitors from other countries but quite as important is the question of providing new things for our own people to do.  In the final analysis, I think the main thing people look for during their holiday period, and particularly young people, is something new to do.  They have been to Bray once, maybe to Salthill another time and maybe to Courtown another time and then they think they have exhausted the possibilities at home. Therefore it is always essential to provide something new for them to do.</P>
    <P>I feel that the development of the Shannon area as a tourist centre has possibilities from that point of view and that the Shannon River service should give a new impetus to tourism in that area.  I do not know whether or not the Minister has yet had an opportunity of asking the Tourist Board to examine the hotel facilities in the area.  It would appear to me that it would be desirable at this stage, with the passenger service on the Shannon this summer, to ensure that hotel accommodation is made available at most centres on the Shannon and that the Tourist Board might do some useful work by getting in touch at this stage with the interests concerned in the different towns right along the Shannon from Limerick to County Leitrim.</P>
    <P>That brings me to another question also relating to the Shannon and to inland waterways generally.  One of our assets, which we have neglected completely from a commercial point of view, is our inland waterways.  Water transport is the cheapest form of transport.  I think all of us must be getting more and more alarmed at the increasing cost of road making, road widening and road mending.  Undoubtedly, <Col N="51" /> it is probably very nice for motorists to have very big wide roads on which they can speed, but the cost of such roads is becoming increasingly high.  Of course, the cost of the maintenance of the roads is increased very substantially by reason of the very heavy traffic and very heavy lorries that are constantly being added to the road traffic.</P>
    <P>In that connection, it would appear to me that if this new oil refinery is going to be built at Foynes, or some other place near the Shannon or near a canal, the Minister should strive to the best of his ability to ensure that the petrol deliveries from the oil refinery will not be thrown on to the roads of the country, but that, instead, we will use&mdash;as they do right through America and on the continent of Europe&mdash;tank barges.  I have no axe to grind on the subject of where the oil refinery should be located.  No doubt this will become a highly controversial question between the different Deputies in this House, but if it should be located at Foynes there is no reason in the world why the petrol produced at Foynes should not be delivered mainly through inland waterways.  You have a network, between the Shannon and canals, of over 300 miles of inland waterways which can be reached from Foynes. 130 miles northwards bring you to Leitrim and Roscommon.  You have the Royal Canal right through the northern portion of the Midlands, Longford and Mullingar, right up to Dublin.  You have the Grand Canal running through Tullamore and through the southern portion of the Midlands.  You have a canal running right down from New Ross to Waterford. You have an additional canal running from Shannon harbour to Ballinasloe. This is a tremendous network.</P>
    <P>The roads are costing the local and central authorities a tremendous amount of money.  The Shannon is a perfect highway which can carry the equivalent of lorry-loads on barges of over 100 tons each without costing the country a halfpenny.  In addition, the <Col N="52" /> canals are there to be used.  It would seem a sound proposition to try and divert as much heavy traffic as possible on to the Shannon and on to the canals.  I hope the Minister will bear that in mind when considering plans for the establishment of the oil refinery.  If the oil refinery is to be situated at Foynes it would seem to be the obvious thing to do.</P>
    <P>The difficulty about the Minister's Estimate is that it covers such a variety of different topics that it is very hard to limit oneself to any kind of a short compass.  There are one or two things which I should like to say in regard to C.I.E.  First of all, I should like to ask the Minister when we can expect that the turf-burning engines will be in operation.  This matter was first promised as far back, if I am not mistaken, as 1949 or 1950. We were told that experiments were being made and that a prototype was being built.  At irregular intervals, probably about every six months, I put down questions to the Minister and his predecessor as to what progress was being made but I always received the same answer, that is, that the prototype is being built and that everything is proceeding satisfactorily.  To a layman, not versed in the construction of railway engines, it does seem a long period of time.  I wonder if the question of turf-burning engines is being pressed as hard as it might be by C.I.E.?  I hope the Minister will satisfy himself on that issue.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which I have to raise and I have a certain sense of grievance in raising it.  I am satisfied that C.I.E. have been importing vast quantities&mdash;not small quantities but vast quantities&mdash;of material for the building of wagons and coaches which hitherto has been made here and that some unemployment in C.I.E. works has been caused by these imports.  I have raised this with the Minister on a number of occasions but so far I have failed to get any explanation.  Either this material was imported or it was not.  If it was not imported the House could be told it was not imported.  If it was imported and if it was imported <Col N="53" /> because it was impossible to make it here, the House could be told that.  It is nearly three months since I first raised the question and I have failed so far to get any satisfaction on the matter.  I would ask the Minister to take the matter up seriously with C.I.E.  I have been extremely patient about the matter.  I deliberately refrained from raising it often in this House but the only alternative now left to me is to raise it in this House, which I shall not hesitate to do unless I get a satisfactory explanation.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister's survey dealt with the question of the future of the Tóstal or not.  There is one suggestion which I made before and would like to repeat.  I feel that the Tóstal as conceived and as operated hitherto is not successful from a long term point of view.  It would be much better to try to concentrate on one or two events in which we can make a really useful contribution.  I always thought it should be possible for us to develop a theatre festival that would not be centralised in Dublin but could cover the whole country, that would really attract visitors.  We have an extremely good theatre; we have a traditionally good reputation for theatre.  If a proper annual theatre festival were organised it would provide from a long term point of view a much surer draw for visitors to the country than the rather diffused, and, if I may say so without being offensive, the rather cheap type of Tóstal that we have had hitherto.</P>
    <P>I am not saying this by way of criticism of what has been done, which has been done in an effort to do something hurriedly to make a splash of colour. That kind of thing does not survive for long.  I do not think it will survive. If people came once or twice they would not feel like returning.  If you have a good theatre festival you will always draw from all over the world a substantial number of visitors who will return year after year for it.  I do not see anybody being enticed to return to see the Tóstal celebrations we have had.</P>
    <P>On a concluding note, may I appeal to the Minister to make a contribution to this year's Tóstal by having <Col N="54" /> the gazebo on O'Connell Bridge removed?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I have rarely agreed with Deputy MacBride on any subject, but if I can just reinforce that last request of his, which bears very little relation to the Estimate for the Department of Industry and Commerce, I would beg the Minister, in the interests of the decency of tourism, to have removed, if necessary by Act of Parliament, that ghastly concrete submarine on O'Connell Bridge and, if it is considered good from the standpoint of tourists to have flowers on a bridge, there can be constructed some simple form of decorative railing which would conform with the harmony of the railings now bounding the bridge on either side in which flowers can grow, without insulting further the citizens of this fair city.</P>
      <P>I was somewhat misdirected from what I intended to say on the subject of this Estimate by Deputy MacBride's last observation, with which I wholly concur.  To come back to some rather more fundamental issues, the Minister is not going to be allowed by this side of the House to get away from the subject of his failure to reduce the cost of living and the absence of any comment by him, or any note in the course of his speech, is indicative of the desire of himself and his colleagues to escape from the realities in regard to this matter.  Although we have said a great deal on this side of the House in regard to the utter failure of the present Government to carry out their promises and although it may be wearisome to repeat much of what has been said, I think we, for the first time, are beginning to get some conception of the new Coalition Government policy and, in particular, the new Labour Party policy in regard to price levels. It is embodied in the use of the word &ldquo;stabilisation&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;reduction in prices&rdquo;.  It can be noticed that Ministers of the present Government, speaking at various places through the country, at various functions, have now begun to use the phrase &ldquo;reduction or stabilisation of prices&rdquo; when referring to their promises to the electorate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="55" /> For example, at a Labour convention in Dublin, Deputy Corish, the Minister for Social Welfare, was reported in the <i>Irish Press</i> of March 23rd as saying the following:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If their efforts to stabilise or reduce prices were not successful they would not hesitate to say so and would take other steps to fulfil the undertaking.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Therein lies the clue to the new policy.  No longer is it a question of crashing prices.  No longer is it a question of exploding a balloon of inflation which was entirely the creation of the last Government and for which world circumstances had no responsibility.  No longer is it a question of ignoring the profiteering hordes of business executives around the country.  It is now simply a question of stabilisation.  If stabilisation is effected that will satisfy the consciences of the Labour Party members of the present Government and when I say that I mean also the consciences of all those in the Fine Gael Party who, when they were not in the presence of the Press, promised the sun, the moon and the stars at every church and chapel in the country during the course of the general election.</P>
    <P>I suppose it should be pointed out that the cost of living was virtually stabilised in May, 1953.  We understand that the present Minister for Industry and Commerce relies on the statistics provided for him by the Director of the Central Bureau of Statistics.  He has found no false or corrupt influence by the last Government in regard to the presentation of the cost-of-living statistics and apparently the basis adopted is sound. That being so, it can be remarked that the cost-of-living index showed a figure of 126 in May, 1953, and is virtually at the same level, having fallen two points and risen two points since the inception of the present Government's administration, and yet, the present Government have the audacity now to talk about effecting a stabilisation in the cost of living.  The electors, when they heard the promises made, were not thinking in terms of a reduction in <Col N="56" /> the price of butter of 5d. in the lb. They were thinking of something far more substantial; they were thinking of a general and substantial decline in the price of all essential commodities. Even if one were to take 1/2d. or 1d. in the price off the two-lb. loaf and add it to the 5d. in the lb. reduction given in the price of butter, that would not satisfy the electors if they expected the Government to honour their promises in regard to this matter.</P>
    <P>In actual fact the cost of living has risen.  Let us be frank about it, it has not risen by a very large margin but it has risen by a sufficient margin to make the position of the Government more than painful.  We have, by means of a series of questions, asked of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach, obtained the list of commodities whose prices have risen between the months of February and April.  The list is very substantial, and even though the rises are small and marginal it is laughable, in the light of the list of commodities whose prices have been increased, to suggest that the Government are in any way honouring their promises.</P>
    <P>Some of these articles are not of great importance.  Many of them are in common use, but the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture during the election campaign used to hold up a box of Aspro tablets to show that even the price of those had risen during the time Fianna Fáil was in office.  I think, therefore, that we on this side of the House will be forgiven for mentioning this list of commodities: beef, mutton, boiling fowl, cheese, lard, oatmeal, bran, pollard, semolina, potatoes, cabbage, onions, carrots, dried peas, oranges, tomatoes, coffee, cocoa, boiled sweets, bars of chocolate, cotton meal, candles, paraffin oil, turf, firewood blocks, house rents, rates, men's raincoats, spring interior mattresses, boot polish, toothpaste, motor tyres and tubes, cycle tyres, blankets, sheets, cutlery, crockery, scouring powder, medicines, shoe repairs and pigmeal.  I understand there may be some reduction in pigmeal.</P>
    <P>In addition to those the rates have gone up, though the Minister for <Col N="57" /> Defence made fulsome promises in Longford that not only would the central Government if possible take upon itself the entire cost of any new services operated by local authorities but also that some of the existing burden of rate liability should be transferred back from the local to the central authority.</P>
    <P>There is a pretty list for a Government who managed to deceive some 20 per cent.  of the electorate of Dublin and Cork.  It is a good list upon which to justify their effort to reduce the cost of living.  We come back again to the question as to whether we are to have some reasonable standard of honesty in making promises during general election campaigns. I defy the Minister for Industry and Commerce to produce to me a single reputable economist who at least had the reputation of being able to provide advice to Governments and businesses of note who could have told him in February of 1954, when this propaganda was being prepared by the Coalition Parties, that there was the remotest chance of there being any appreciable fall in the price of the main commodities used by the people of this State.  The Minister will be unable to provide any such advice.</P>
    <P>I am perfectly certain his own economic expert in the Labour Party, Mr. Roberts, some of whose writings I must say I find remarkably impartial&mdash; I should like to point out I am not criticising him here&mdash;could not give any reports to the Labour Party to show that there would be any appreciable reduction in the cost of living or that there would be any great improvement in conditions which prevail in European countries and in the dollar world.  The only way of reducing the cost of living was by subsidies at the cost of taxation which the country could not afford.</P>
    <P>Those facts were fully available to the members of the Coalition Government at the time the propaganda was being prepared for the election.  There was nothing they could not have found out by putting a question to the Bureau of Statistics or by following the O.E.E.C. reports.  They could have found out that there was no prospect <Col N="58" /> that it would be possible to bring about a reduction in the cost of living. Everything pointed to the fact that there had not been any undue increase in the cost of living in this country during Fianna Fáil's term of office.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go over the ground again.  I do not want to repeat what I said earlier on the comparison between the cost of living here and that which existed in other countries from the time of decline in the value of the £ in 1948, which was recognised as the basic year for price comparisons, and 1953.  During that period the cost of living rose in this country no more than in the major continental countries where subsidies have been imposed in large measure either during or at the end of the war to keep down the prices of commodities, and where there was a proper system of price analysis, of price stabilisation and of price control.</P>
    <P>The reports of the International Labour Organisation in the interests of the workers can be regarded as reasonably accurate.  In six, seven or eight countries, and particularly in Great Britain, the cost of living rise was comparable with the increase here. We used the same money as Great Britain; our £ was the same as theirs in value for the purposes of the purchase of raw commodities.  During the period from the time of the devaluation of the £ and during the post-Korean boom the rise in the cost of living here was only nearly as much or perhaps a little less than in Great Britain.  One country might have been able to afford some greater measure of subsidies than another and if that be the case the cost of living here should have gone up by still more than it did instead of being almost exactly at the same percentage.</P>
    <P>I should like to hear from the Minister whether this new phrase &ldquo;stabilisation&rdquo; really describes the position because about two months ago we were given the impression that unless the cost of living could be reduced the members of the present Government would insist on some serious measure. Now the word &ldquo;stabilisation&rdquo; is being used and if this is their policy we can be assured that they no longer intend <Col N="59" /> to take any action except perhaps what could be taken in the coming Budget by way of the kind of surplus we might expect, or if not in this Budget in the Budget thereafter.  Nor had the Minister for Industry and Commerce anything original or of interest to say about the question of profits and prices.  We have asked the Minister to tell us what kind of legislation he intends to introduce to replace the previous pre-war price control legislation; whether he has any new ideas on the subject; whether he has considered the whole question as to how far we should talk about prices instead of referring to the level of productivity or the efficiency of industry.</P>
    <P>As the Minister knows, though some people are rather reluctant to say so here, some of our companies paying the very highest dividends in the land are at the same time producing the best articles at lower prices than their competitors.  The whole of our price policy, from the point of view in which it was examined and conducted inevitably during the war, needs now a complete and drastic overhaul and change because, as I have already said, profits in a great number of instances bear no relation to prices.  A great number of factors enter into the price of an article and to merely restrain companies from making profits is not a solution of the problem.  Profits may or may not result in excessive prices; but it is quite obvious that we need now a new approach to the whole problem of production and profits if we are to have a satisfactory price policy.</P>
    <P>The next observation I would like to make is that we note with some appreciation&mdash;it may be a little bitter &mdash;that the Minister has from the point of view of a number of policies relevant to his Department been given considerable assistance by the last Government. The tremendous flow of development projects about which he spoke and concerning which he made, I think, intelligent and useful observations were nearly all of them devised by Fianna Fáil at one period or another. One might say that the foundations of the Minister's Department rest almost <Col N="60" /> entirely upon the inventive genius of Deputy Seán Lemass, the previous Minister.  When the Minister spoke, introducing his Estimate, of harbour development, aviation development, turf power development and Irish shipping, and when he referred to the possibilities of an oil refinery and spoke of the changes in connection with our transport organisation, practically all the decisions of importance in relation to all those were made for him by the previous Minister.</P>
    <P>I think it is time some slight reference was made to the fact that the dieselisation of C.I.E. was finally the sole responsibility of the previous Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Seán Lemass.  I wish Deputy Morrissey were here now because I would like to remind him of the insults he hurled at the chairman of C.I.E., the chairman whom he removed from office, when he spoke of the first beginnings of dieselisation policy; all the implications in his speech were that dieselisation was going to be just one more extravagent fantasy of Fianna Fáil.  I am glad the present Minister has accepted the dieselisation policy and has accepted also the fact that we took the ultimate responsibility for the large capital outlay involved for the very fundamental conversion required before C.I.E. could pay its way properly and become an efficient transport organisation.</P>
    <P>Equally, legislation for the improvement in the conditions of the worker &mdash;the Factory Act&mdash;was on the stocks before ever the present Government came into office, not to speak of the body responsible for undertaking work under the Undeveloped Areas Act. The Minister can also be satisfied with the fact that the amount of capital engaged each year in the years before he took office for direct production showed a satisfactory increase.  From the year 1950 to 1953 he can be satisfied to some extent with the high consumption of food, with the very high expenditure on goods and services of all kinds, even after allowing for the increase in the cost of living.</P>
    <P>In the year before the Minister took office, 1953, people spent more than they had ever spent before, save in <Col N="61" /> the year 1951, when they spent about 2½ per cent. more, because that was the year during which all countries were stockpiling for fear of war.  Apart from that year, the people spent well and satisfactorily.  The Minister can also be satisfied with the increase in production&mdash;8 per cent. in two years&mdash; which took place just before the last Government left office.  He can be satisfied with the increase in the volume of exports.  I think the increase was something in the region of 33? per cent. from 1949 to 1953, and the increase has been steady during the last three years.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I think we on this side of the House have made it clear, as we made it clear at the time of the election and in subsequent speeches, that nevertheless we cannot regard the present situation with complacency. One of the things that surprised me in the Minister's speech was his evident complacency in regard to the problem of emigration.  I have said frequently here that we now realise after some 30 years of independence that to make an election promise to reduce emigration damns a prospective Deputy almost automatically as dishonest because so many have promised what they were ultimately unable to fulfil in that regard.</P>
    <P>The present Government got into office in 1948 partly on the wildest statements in regard to the emigrant ship and partly on promises to end emigration overnight and put every man to work within 24 hours.  I think we are all a little bit sobered now about this problem.  I think we now realise that it is a dangerous thing to promise to end emigration; but it is still more dangerous to be complacent about it.  We have now the report of the Emigration Commission which states that unless the pattern of emigration changes some 38 per cent. of the young women and 25 per cent. of the young men will emigrate within the next ten or 15 years.</P>
    <P>We now have a new type of problem to face in relation to emigration.  We have the problem that England&mdash; perhaps temporarily: we do not know &mdash; is in a state of boom, a state which <Col N="62" /> attracts labour because rates of wages are such as the average employer here is unable to pay.  Young people are going to England every day seeking higher wages and being offered positions at wages which this community could ill afford to pay.  There is a new pull from Great Britain.  We know that most of the young people on small farms, with the exception of one, have to leave those farms and seek employment elsewhere.  Now there is this additional inducement and I think all Deputies realise that emigration has reached a very high level of intensity. Many people have to emigrate; but to-day young men are leaving jobs at £8 per week to go to jobs at £12 per week in Great Britain.</P>
    <P>I think none of us have yet really faced the only solution to this problem, namely, an immense and striking increase in productivity.  Productivity here is still a specialised doctrine.  I do not think we have, if I may use a somewhat unusual phrase, the wine of productivity in our blood. That may be due partly to our history. It may be due to climatic conditions. It may be due to a number of causes. I do not think we really have the necessary enthusiasm here for increased productivity.  Yet, we know from the whole economic history of the world since the time of the industrial revolution that there is no way of increasing prosperity in order to retain our people here in profitable employment, so that only those will go abroad who are really seeking adventure or some occupation of so specialised a type that they cannot find it here, other than by industrial development and increased agricultural and industrial productivity.  It seems to me that is the secret of success in the future.</P>
    <P>We all know that there is a multiplication of small stagnancies and inefficiencies throughout the whole economic life of this country which have yet to be overcome.  We can all of us see the progress that is being made.  We can all of us see examples of improved efficiency and high quality goods at low cost. We can all of us see shining <Col N="63" /> examples of individual factories and individuals everywhere who have been able to export in competition with the products of Great Britain and other countries and who have succeeded in capturing markets abroad.  We know about those, but we also know of the stagnation that still exists, the stagnation born from many causes which exists, the elimination of which is the only possible method by which we can increase the level of earnings in this country so that this tremendous flow of emigration can be at least partly arrested.</P>
    <P>I had hoped that the Minister would make some reference to these matters because I think they are of vital importance.  If one compares, for example, the language used by public representatives of every type throughout the country in regard to economics in general with that used by the people of America or even by the people of Great Britain, there is far too much talk of giving employment for employment's sake instead of stepping up productivity which must in its turn produce more employment.  It so happens that in countries that have been highly industrialised and where there is so large a market that all sorts of specialist agencies can be created for the studying of these problems there has been more opportunity for discussion of the question of productivity and of high output than there can be in a country like this where industry is just being started and where it is only in its first stages. I admit that in all this argument we have to bear in mind the recent character of our industry.  We have to bear in mind the success of many of our industries, the comparative success of others and the stagnation of many more.</P>
    <P>In other countries there has been an opportunity of discussing this question of productivity.  We have here a small organisation created under the auspices of the last Government, the Institute of Management.  It is doing good work, but I think a great deal more needs to be done from the highest possible level on this question.  For example, I do not suppose many of the people of this <Col N="64" /> country engaged in industry know that in a country such as Great Britain, where there are these great opportunities, there are productivity councils in which the employers and the trade unions take an interest.  There are summer schools relating to productivity, to increasing output, to which representatives of the trade unions and the employers come.  There is a very large measure of instruction, of teaching, throughout the length and breadth of Great Britain in regard to this whole subject.</P>
    <P>I have noticed&mdash;not in all trade unions here but in a limited number&mdash; some of the members have referred to the general subject of productivity and to what is known as time and motion study in entirely old-fashioned terms as though an industry might dread the advent of any changes in its structure which might lead to greater productivity for fear there might be less employment, whereas, of course, I think most of our trade unions and most of the non-Communist progressive trade unions in Great Britain know perfectly well that the inevitable result of greater productivity is that people have more money to spend and can buy more things.  People get employment to a greater degree and the level of employment goes up as a result of the use of machinery.  It hardly ever goes down except for a very short and temporary period.  We have never faced that issue completely.  I read reports of county council meetings where public representatives talk about machines as if through the use of machines workers would lose their jobs whereas the use of modern machines can only increase the total number of persons employed in the servicing of the machinery and in the work of road building and road construction.</P>
    <P>We need the greatest leadership from those at the very highest level on this entire subject.  I think that the Minister should do his utmost to advertise to a greater extent the development of industrial consultancy.  I think he should tell more about the co-operation of the trade unions in other countries when an industrial consultant comes to a group of industries and offers them assistance to increase <Col N="65" /> productivity.  I think he should lay far more emphasis on the fact that under present circumstances the whole conception of time and motion study as applied to workers as being something in the nature of slavery has entirely disappeared.  We can now see where one unit in industry, having been the subject of a time and motion study, where the workers have a share with the employers in the profits made through the establishment of some sort of incentive bonus scheme related to the fostering of production in various parts of industrial activity, other trade unions in the remaining units of the industry will ask the employers to bring in a consultant so that they may also share in the incentive bonuses that result from the increased flow of work, from the increased flow of productivity.</P>
    <P>The work of the industrial consultants in this country has been on the whole highly successful.  I myself have had occasion to study the work of one group of consultants who succeeded in doubling the production of a very wellknown firm close to this city with the result that that firm got a share in an order from a world-wide concern that it had never been able to obtain before.  Production per worker was doubled and with the entire consent of the trade union concerned knowing the inevitable effect it would have on the wage structure of the company.</P>
    <P>Consultancy has also been applied in semi-state corporations with very great success.  One semi-state corporation succeeded in saving £20,000 a year by the employment of a management expert who knew nothing whatever about the industry when he came to it.</P>
    <P>The point is that if we are to have greater productivity there must be more advertisement from the highest level about what can be done, about the help given and the encouragement given to industrial organisations by industrial consultancy.  I think the Institute of Management needs even more assistance than it is getting from the present Government and, as I said, none of the trade unions that are modern and up to date in their attitude have any objection to this <Col N="66" /> because they know their members must inevitably share in the greater profits achieved.</P>
    <P>I should mention the example of the cotton industry in Great Britain where there has been of necessity an enormous redeployment arising out of the change-over from out-of-date looms to automatic looms and where the number of looms per worker is enormously increased.  It was found necessary to have the most careful analysis of the position in regard to each type of company because it was found that in the case of certain companies the cost of expanding the industry's physical volume would be greater than the result achieved.  But the main point was this: that the trade unions concerned entered into an agreement with the cotton industry employers whereby they would agree to the redeployment of individual units in the cotton industry provided the firms would make use of the services of industrial consultants so that when there was complete reorganisation in manufacture the workers would inevitably benefit in some way or other through some kind of incentive bonus scheme or at least through sharing in the quicker flow of materials through the factory and the smoothing-over of difficulties and the greater flow in productivity of the industry.</P>
    <P>All these facts are well known to many people.  This question of industrial consultancy and improvement of productivity has become a fine art in the United States.  I am not suggesting that we should get &mdash; shall I say&mdash; into the very high pitch of very fierce competition which is a characteristic of United States economy.  I do not think it is possible for a people of our temperament ever to do so, but I do suggest that in between there lies a mean and we have never yet achieved that mean in this country and that the present Government, now that most of the post-war inflation difficulties have passed, have a greater opportunity than ever to study this whole subject.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister ought to consider this whole question in relation to the level of tariffs.  The Minister, we have noted, has commenced a study <Col N="67" /> into the tariff level of two industries. We have now had industries under tariff here for a considerable number of years.  All of us believe that tariff protection is essential at least at the commencement of life of a new industry. All of us believe that some measure of protection may be necessary at all times in certain instances because of the differential in the price of raw materials imported here and used in countries competing with us in our market and because of the other factors well known, such as the size of the units of the industry, and so forth. But both the previous Minister for Industry and Commerce and, I think, all of us on this side of the House realise that in the interest of industry, in the interest of productivity, in the interest of producing the best possible commodities at the lowest possible price, reviews of tariffs are wise if they are adopted in a sympathetic spirit.</P>
    <P>I would like to suggest to the Minister that some sort of co-operative use of industrial consultants by a whole industry would be one way in which he could be presented with facts given on an independent basis which would enable him to determine whether the industry was properly grouped, whether it might have too many groups in it, whether it was being efficiently conducted.  If such a consultant made a report to the Minister, the Minister would have the right to reject or accept it, to take into account all the factors which the consultant might not appreciate in making the report.  I might add that in Great Britain and in America there are certain industrialists who, desiring to expand their exports and without any encouragement from the Government, have co-operatively among themselves employed consultants at different times in order to make recommendations on behalf of their industry as a whole.  Instead of having consultants working on behalf merely of an industry with a very large turnover, huge capital resources, in giving a report it would be possible to apply it to an industry which was a very small unit making one special group of commodities; the consultant would examine the industry as a whole <Col N="68" /> and examine all the implications arising from high costs in the industry and report to the Minister.  It would seem to me that the Minister in designing permanent policy to preserve and expand our industry should take power to appoint consultants of that kind, making it a regular feature of Government examination, but, above all, encourage numbers of manufacturers to carry out examinations of that kind voluntarily among themselves and without any recourse to a Government Order or to Government insistence.</P>
    <P>As I have said, we are only at the beginning of the field of examining productivity in all its aspects.  It is a science which in itself is only about 30 years old and it is a science which has only begun to apply to small units of industry in the last ten or 15 years. Up to then it was associated with great and enormous corporations such as General Motors in the United States and other corporations.  Now with the development of the science in which the flow of materials through the factory, no matter how small they are, no matter how small the factory is, can be calculated scientifically and now that the fatigue of the worker can be examined and comprehended sympathetically and now that the relations of the worker and the foreman in the factory can be established on a basis agreed by all, the whole of the science of industrial efficiency has extended far beyond what is imagined by most people in this country.  I recommend the Minister to consider the whole of that question in very great detail as having very great importance both for the expansion of exports and in relation to the general problem of industrial efficiency.</P>
    <P>As the Minister knows, the problem in regard to industry is very closely related to exports and I should like to ask him whether he thinks that the present panoply of services to aid potential exporters is sufficient, whether Córas Tráchtála Teoranta have sufficient resources at their disposal for the most difficult part of their work which is finding the right agents for commodities, or still further, improving our design, for enabling the <Col N="69" /> risks in regard to payment in certain countries to be overcome, whether they have all the facilities they need or whether even something more is required if we are to expand our exports.</P>
    <P>I would suggest also to the Minister that it would be no harm in certain instances if he linked to some degree the continuation of the very high level of tariffs with the productive effort made by the industries who export and, if there comes to his knowledge any group of industrialists who are not using a reasonable portion of their reserves for the exploration of the export market, that it would be right for him in the circumstances to question the extent of the tariff imposed upon the community for the benefit of that industry.  Now that the post-war difficulties are over, now that the Korean inflation is at an end and now that we are set at least for the time being on a fair tide in regard to European and world trade in general, the Minister has an opportunity of bringing any rightful pressure to bear on groups of industries in order to ensure that they are doing their utmost to expand and increase their exports or to develop their exports if they have not done so.</P>
    <P>I would like to draw the attention of the Minister to a statement which he can obtain from the Central Statistics Office relating to the net output per person in Ireland and in Great Britain and the Six Counties in each of the years 1950 and 1936.  If he examines the figures he will find no cause for complacency in regard to industrial productivity.  He will find that the comparative progress made between 1936 and 1950 in respect of British and Irish industries of the same type is nothing of which we can be proud, that there is a leeway to be made up in regard to that matter.  If he will examine the table in which the 24 industries are compared and show the difference in the level of output between British and Irish in 1936 and the value of the output per worker, and the difference in the level of the output in 1950, he will come to a number of conclusions.  First of all, a great war generally stimulates inventive genius <Col N="70" /> as well as carrying out destruction among the participating powers but if the Minister examines the table he will find plenty of evidence of the kind I have already suggested, that the development of industrial consultancy on an increasing scale is vital to the efficiency of industry in this country and that he could perhaps play his own part in regard to that matter.</P>
    <P>I wish now to say a few words about the tourist industry.  I still think there needs to be far more improvement in the second-class hotels in this country and that sooner or later the Minister will have to face up to An Bord Fáilte in regard to the grading of hotels.  I felt that only recently because of com parison which one hears from people who visit this country.  I have had to spend a number of days in the smaller type of British hotel and I think it is true that we have to improve the second grade of hotel very substantially because enormous strides are being made in Great Britain, particularly since the end of rationing, in regard to that matter.</P>
    <P>I want to repeat what I have already said, namely, that there is a familiar phrase used by certain classes of hoteliers in this country: &ldquo;Let us not copy French cooking, because we cannot. Let us have good, honest, plain fare and the tourist will like it.&rdquo;  That is a phrase which is only partially true.  I have found that frequently it is an excuse just for thoroughly dull, over dull, plain cooking.  I think the development of cooking in between that level of what is known as plain, ordinary cooking and the French cooking&mdash;which we are supposed to be unable to copy although we have all the raw materials here&mdash;is what we need.  In my view, the tourist industry will not progress if it relies on that purely negative statement of &ldquo;good plain cooking.&rdquo;  I find that the variety to be found in a great many countries other than France is one compared with which we have not reached the proper point in regard to any grade of hotel below the <i>de luxe</i> grade in this country.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister whether he thinks An Bord Fáilte have <Col N="71" /> a sufficient grant for tourist fishing amenities.  Is he going to reduce the grant for stocking inland rivers for fishery purposes &mdash; whether to the Inland Fishery Board or to An Bord Fáilte?  Have An Bord Fáilte sufficient finance to advertise the fisheries of Ireland among fishermen's societies in Great Britain?  I notice a certain effort was made in that regard but I have not noticed much emphasis on it recently.  Has that campaign been abandoned or how far has it succeeded?  Has an effort been made to contact the endless societies of fishermen in Great Britain, most of whom have about ten yards of a river bank from which to fish and all of whom are looking for reasonably inexpensive fishing and reasonably inexpensive hotels?</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister should tell An Bord Fáilte to speed up the work of placing signs everywhere leading to historic monuments.  I was in Sligo recently and, so far as the ordinary tourist is concerned, Lough Gill might never exist.  I do not know whether the position has changed in the past few months but, on entering the town of Sligo a few months ago from the main or adjoining roads, Lough Gill might not exist.  Lough Gill is one of the most beautiful loughs in Europe but it is completely ignored by the average tourist in this country.  Unless there has been a change within the past ten days, there is as yet no sign leading to Clonmacnoise on entering Athlone or departing from it or on the roads leading from it.  Similar things may be said about other areas.  I trust the work of replacing these signs will be speeded up.</P>
    <P>I want now to say a few words about An Tóstal.  To some extent, I agree with what Deputy MacBride has said although I generally disagree with him on economic matters.  At the end of this period of An Tóstal I think the Minister will have to re-examine the whole question of what An Tóstal is supposed to be.  In the enthusiasm with which it was generated, it was quite natural and expected that there would be some confusion of mind as to what was intended.  If it is meant to be a civic week&mdash;a week in which everything <Col N="72" /> Irish is advertised and which is administered for our own purposes, a week in which we show ourselves to ourselves, a week in which the tourist element is only a minor one&mdash;let us develop it in that way.  Let us have an organisation that will help its expansion in that way.  Let the Government give what resources it can, with that in mind.  If it is meant to be primarily a tourist attraction then we will have to reconsider the whole project of An Tóstal.  It would be inevitable that it would require considerable examination because of the fact that it was started at a period when tourists do not normally come to this country and the period before the tourist season was chosen rather than the period of the end of the tourist season.</P>
    <P>I have frequently tried to get from An Bord Fáilte the statistical facts in that connection.  I have tried to find out if it is a fact that there are insufficient hotel bedrooms in Dublin and the main tourist areas in September and the early part of October&mdash;a period which is one of the most common periods throughout Europe for festivals, including Edinburgh, Salzburg, and the most popular form of festival in Venice where they have them continuously. I have in mind, now, festivals not associated with religious events where you have a different position, such as the Easter festival, and so forth.</P>
    <P>If the period of September is uneconomic from the point of view of a great festival then I think we should ask why we have so few hotel bedrooms and whether the hotel industry has sufficiently expanded in Dublin. Secondly, we should ask whether the festival should be held at the beginning or at the end of the tourist season. Apparently, for people who have means of their own, and even for workers in industry who have a certain freedom in regard to the choosing of a time for their vacation, April and the beginning of May is not an easy time either for a worker or an executive to leave his business.  It is quite evident from studying the statistics of travelling in Europe in September and early October that there is then still a <Col N="73" /> tremendous flow of tourists throughout Europe.</P>
    <P>In those months there are a number of festivals.  Some of them end in the early part of September but at least they continue for the best part of that month.  It seems to me that we need to make that second decision.  We need to decide whether or not An Tóstal is to be for the tourist or mainly for ourselves and, secondly, we need to decide the period at which it should take place.  The third point is whether or not we can continue, for tourist purposes, the present diffuse kind of festival which is a mixture of dramatic events, international sporting events and pageants.  We have to decide whether that can really be a success from the point of view of tourist development.  We must ask ourselves whether or not people in sufficiently large numbers are coming to this country as tourists to see international bicycle races or international golf tournaments.  We must ask ourselves whether or not that will attract any kind of an inflow of tourists which would justify the continuation of An Tóstal as a tourist affair.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, shall we not have to examine the situation and look abroad and ask ourselves whether the things which draw tourists to a country can be any different here in large measure from what they are abroad? We must ask ourselves whether there is anything we can offer which would interest the average foreigner and which would place us in a different position from other countries where they have had to specialise, and specialise in very considerable measure, in order to draw tourists.  In passing, I should say it is evident that a country such as Italy with its wealth of art and culture is in an entirely different position.</P>
    <P>We never had a chance of establishing art here.  That was destroyed for us.  There was no possibility of that so long as we lived under oppression.  We must face the reality of that situation. Does the future of An Tóstal not lie in some form of specialisation either in the theatre, in music or in some other field?  The Edinburgh festival has succeeded in a country with <Col N="74" /> a tradition, a language, and a culture all its own and with beautiful scenery. It has succeeded in a country with as many castles and churches as we have, if not more.  But they have perforce developed a festival of an international character to which they invite international artistes and orchestras. Music is associated to some degree with Edinburgh, but it was never considered a supremely Scottish gift.  We have to consider along the same lines.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy MacBride that, though there are immense difficulties in guaranteeing the arrival of foreign dramatic companies to play with our own at a particular period to be arranged at least a year or perhaps two years in advance and although there may be even insufficient theatres in Dublin, a theatre festival has much to commend it.  I think that the Minister should consider the whole matter from its foundations and make up his mind about these various points because I do not think that An Tóstal is likely to succeed under prevailing circumstances.  I think that has to be related to the fact that up to now the Minister has tried to satisfy the interests of every area.  Both Ministers for Industry and Commerce have tried to organise An Tóstal so that the people in Galway will feel they will make money out of it as well as the people in Dublin whereas in fact, with certain exceptions, the flow of tourists here from abroad and particularly from America has not been exciting, has not been dramatically successful.</P>
    <P>Last of all, I would like to ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he, perhaps, if no other Minister, can do something to aid in the promotion of a concert and assembly hall in Dublin.  There has been a committee working to provide a concert and assembly rooms in Dublin for four or five years.  We are the only capital city in the world without a modern concert hall.  The committee have called themselves the Concert Hall and Assembly Rooms Committee because they know that it is most unlikely that they ever could find the money just purely for musical purposes and so, with a sense of realism, they <Col N="75" /> have linked it with the idea of assembly rooms with proper sound broadcasting, with facilities for translation, where international conferences as well as our own many conferences can be held.</P>
    <P>There is in this city at the present time no completely modern conference hall.  No one could call the Mansion House, which is booked out three times over, a modern conference hall of the kind that can be found in other capital cities.  There is certainly no concert hall in Dublin and the possibility of having such a hall and even linking it with one or two small theatres is something which, quite apart from the cultural point of view, I think, would pay rich dividends from the standpoint of the tourist industry.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister has got to decide, sooner or later, on a specialised form of An Tóstal and, if he does that, he will need, apart from international conferences, a concert hall of that description.  I wish that he would consider with the other Ministers, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs who is involved in connection with the proper use to be made of the Radio Eireann Symphony Orchestra, and with the Taoiseach who is in charge of the Arts Council, whether they cannot examine this project.  In my own belief it would repay in dividends in terms of tourists coming to this country all the money spent upon it and we could place ourselves in the position that we could tell the whole world that we had a Grade A assembly rooms and concert hall with all the facilities for translation, interpretation and for conferences, small and big.  Although we have at the moment a good many international conferences we could have still more if we had that facility.</P>

      <P>I do not like speaking after Deputy Childers, because listening to him is something like listening to a gramophone.  I have heard the same speech for the last ten years &mdash; big and pompous and full of nonsense.  If only Deputy Childers would realise that this is a small, poor, impoverished little country and talk as if he was talking to the native Irish. It seems as if he thinks he is talking <Col N="76" /> to the Mau-Mau.  He is not.  In fact, it is in an empire such as there is across the water that Deputy Childers would fit in better to-day.</P>
      <P>He started gibing at the Labour Party and Fine Gael for the manner in which they have allowed the cost of living to go up.  He never said a word for the last 15 years of the quotas and licences and Orders that were made to give certain individuals in this city and other big towns a free flood of goods into this country to make them rich overnight while other people were denied even 1/- worth of stuff at any time.  That is the type of thing that went on in this country but that is the type of thing that neither Deputy Childers nor Deputy Lemass will dare to talk about.  We who live in the country know too much about these things.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the Department of Industry and Commerce needs a complete overhaul.  I know the Minister is a man of strong will and I would ask him to give it a complete overhaul because there was more gangsterdom carried out under the auspices of the last Government in this Department than there was in any other Department in the State.  I say that without fear of contradiction.  There is no question about it, millions and millions were wasted and squandered through this Department over the last 15 or 20 years.  There was an industrial drive which, if it was carried out in an ordered and reasonable way, would have brought results.  What results has it brought?  We have all over the country assembly stations which call themselves Irish industries which are nothing more than assembly stations and which were given licences and which were brought in from other countries and whose concern is to get in without paying a big levy or dividend. That is the type of people who have this country in the hollow of their hands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I stand for Irish industry built on Irish agriculture which would be native to Irish soil.  We do not want this mad rush of industry and development where every type of foreigner and semi-foreigner is head, neck and shoulders into it while the native Irish <Col N="77" /> have to fly out of the country as fast as they can go.  I believe in native, normal, industrial development.  I believe in making haste slowly, not in the mad, indiscriminate operations we had over the last number of years.</P>
    <P>If Irish industry absorbed the vast amount of unemployed in the large towns and cities, I would be satisfied, but it did not.  It did no such thing. I say more power to the many native industries which are standing on their own legs and working for Irish development. I have nothing against them. But while we were building Irish industry in the big cities we were drawing the people from the land As fast as an industry started in a town the boys and girls came in from the land to the industry and left the land a wilderness.</P>
    <P>In the course of the next ten or 12 years there will be in this country what we cursed 20 years ago, large ranches. No small farmer can dare to live in the Irish countryside now.  He must get a 100 or 200 or 300 acre ranch to live at all.</P>
    <P>Deputies come in here lauding the advance of Irish industry.  What advance?  The advance should show itself in the happiness and peace of the people of the country.  It should show itself in a balanced economy. Where is the balance in the economy of this country?  I should like to have the balance pointed out to me.  It is not there.  I come from the centre of Ireland which was thickly populated before ever we got back our freedom. These people were fairly poor, but they were peaceful and happy and worked for their living and stayed at home.  To-day they are on the move because we have started this mad drive in industry.</P>
    <P>Having been conquered for 700 years, you are not going to industrialise the country completely in 20 years.  You just cannot do it in the same way as you cannot revive the Irish language in a few years.  It would take you 200 or 300 years to do that by normal development.  If we simply go on as we are we will be back to the day of the herd and the dog and the big ranches.  If we have much more of <Col N="78" /> these industrialists hiding behind the high wall of tariffs and driving around the country in big Chryslers and Daimlers there will not be anybody left in the country in 20 years.  These are not the things for which Pearse lies in his grave.  He wanted to bring the people back to the land.  What he wanted was the development of our countryside.</P>
    <P>Have we got that to-day?  We certainly have not, and I would ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce to see that something is done and that the few agricultural labourers who are left will be able to stay in the countryside and that they will stop fleeing to the towns where they can get £4, £5 or £6 a week more in fancy jobs.  Who is going to wait on the land when they can do much better in fancy jobs in the cities, where they do not have to dirty their boots, while the hobnailed man in the country gets a bare £4 a week for his labours?</P>
    <P>The countryside is being blighted because of this industrial development. Of course I want to see ordinary, common-sense industrial development going slowly and steadily.  But we must be careful to scrutinise every effort we make.  What have we got in the City of Dublin but a whole lot of non-nationals of all types almost in control of industry, people whose names we could not mention.  I would ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce to see that non-nationals brought in as technicians to start Irish industries should be withdrawn as soon as Irish technicians have been trained to take up their positions.</P>
    <P>These are the criticisms I have been bringing in here during the past eight or ten years and I shall keep at them because I want to see Ireland Irish and not an adjunct of outside countries or outside influences.  While we have some millions of pounds invested outside we are looking for foreign capital. Bring in foreign capital if you like but I know what it will find you.  It will give you revolution as it gave every country that lost its balance.  There is too much of that kind of backhand method in this country&mdash;there is too much shelter being given behind the high wall of tariffs.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="79" /> I agree that Irish industrialists should be given help to get on their feet at the beginning, but once they are on their feet I should like to see that they are given a chance of walking for themselves.  I know an industrialist in my own county who said to me: &ldquo;I want no tariff although I am sheltered behind one at the moment.  I do not want it.  The tariff wall put me on my feet and I now can go abroad to America and Europe and do my own business there, and I want no tariff from anybody.  I am giving big employment and good wages.&rdquo;  I say that these people are too long sheltered behind the tariff wall.  They are drawing the people from the land of Ireland. Our agricultural girls and boys are getting out because they see the attraction of the £6, £7 or £8 a week in the towns on those fancy jobs.</P>
    <P>Do we not know that we are making this country lop-sided?  All I hear from both the Fianna Fáil side and the inter-Party side is that Fianna Fáil put up 500 factories and that the inter-Party groups put up 600.  What will they do next?  You can put them up if you like, but they are nothing more than service stations and you would be as well off if you never saw half of them.  I say that the people should be brought back to the land to reclaim it to make a decent living on it.  They should be brought back from the cities and the towns.</P>
    <P>Why were so many of these industries established in Dublin anyway? Why have we all these satellite towns now around the city?  We have some of the best land in Europe in County Dublin being overrun by service stations of all kinds.  During the past 20 years this most productive land has been ignored.  Take Mullingar and Trim and do something about developing these instead.  There should be some directive given so that the towns which have been blighted during the past 20 years would be built up.  Why concentrate solely on County Dublin?</P>
    <P>I believe in normal Irish industry run in the interests of Irishmen and balanced throughout the country.  I am tired of these non-nationals who <Col N="80" /> are in control of the industries of the country.  I think we should have a proper school for the training of our own people.  Those are the things that I see wrong in this national development.  It is blighting the country and bringing us back again to the days of the bullock and the herd and the dog.  We have made little effort to wipe it out.  It is coming back again.  The labourer is gone, the small farmer is going and his land is being bought by the big fellow.  The big industrialists in Dublin are going around the country in their high-powered cars in royal luxury lying behind the tariff wall while at the same time 10,000 Irishmen are trekking out of the country never to come back.</P>
    <P>Men fought and died for Ireland, and their sons and daughters should get a little chance of enjoying their native soil.  I do not propose being tied to a Party line when expressing opinions of this kind, and I should like to say that there are old I.R.A. men of 70 years and over who say: &ldquo;What kind of idiots were we.&rdquo;  What is happening now is that the industrial magnate is lying safe and snug behind the tariff wall drawing his big dividends while the Irishmen are flying.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to make a complete review of Irish industry and to investigate every industry started behind the tariff wall.  The people of the country expect a native Irish Government to do at least that much for them.  It is time they did something for themselves.  Deputy Childers talked about the cost of living, and said that we did not reduce the cost of living.  We all know what the trouble is here.  It is not the cost of living; it is the cost of taxation, the granting of quotas and licences and all the other things that are done behind closed doors.  High taxation is crushing the people.  It is crushing them out of their homesteads.</P>
    <P>I believe in native industry, but I also believe in first things first.  I am glad that the first Irish Government ever elected here laid the foundations on which to build Irish industry, namely, the Shannon scheme.  I believe in the E.S.B., and in Bord na Móna.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="81" /> I believe in afforestation and the development of C.I.E.  These are the pillars upon which we should build our industrial arm.  Why not build on them and stop this Jewish claptrap here in Dublin?  Foreigners are coming in here, living here for a few years and taking Irish names in order to start industries.  If they cannot get in themselves they send the money in and they put an Irishman's name on the company, but they have financial control.  We are supposed to be advancing young Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.  We are advancing to our own doom.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not attempt to comment on the speech made by the Deputy who has just sat down for the simple reason that I do not know whether he is for or against industrialisation. He referred to rushed industrial development and a madly indiscriminate industrial drive.  One would think he was talking about Manchester or some other highly industrialised city.  The people living in the few little cities we have may be concerned about conditions of employment in industry generally.  We, who are on the fringe of the industrial drive, are worried as to how we can acquire some industries to absorb the surplus labour which is now compelled to emigrate.</P>
      <P>I do not know what exactly is the opinion of farmer Deputies in that respect; the last speaker professes to be a farmer.  Our agricultural industry cannot absorb all our unemployed.  It has often been pointed out in this House&mdash;so often that it should not be necessary for me to repeat it&mdash;how difficult the situation is with regard to the surplus unemployed on the land. Even if our agricultural industry were to flourish beyond our most sanguine expectations farmers would still have to seek an outlet for some proportion of their families which could not ultimately hope to settle down on the land.  Unquestionably we must develop our industrial arm to the greatest possible extent in order to absorb the maximum number of our surplus unemployed. The only alternative to that is to export them on the emigrant ship to employment abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="82" /> Deputies who speak as the last speaker did are either pretending not to understand the situation or else they are not conversant with the facts. I thought that by now everyone was agreed we must have an industrial arm and it is a matter for successive governments to decide as to the best method of promoting the success of that industrial drive.  A good deal of criticism is offered time and again in relation to protective tariffs and their exploitation.  There is a good deal of exaggeration with regard to foreign capital and foreigners coming in here to take advantage of our industrial drive.  No Deputy has yet pointed out by what means new industries can be sponsored and fostered other than by securing protection until such time as they have passed the teething stage.</P>
    <P>I think we must all agree that we have now reached a stage where many of our industries, inexperienced and weak at the beginning, are now in a position to produce efficiently and compete without protection.  Some of them are even in a position to capture export markets.  Our industrial drive began in the main after 1932.  Our industries have now reached a high standard of efficiency and, provided the Minister guiding industrial policy does not make any serious mistake, we can look forward to the successful realisation of that important ambition.</P>
    <P>Those of us who live on the fringe of the industrial drive are not so much concerned about conditions of employment as about the actual provision of employment.  In that respect the Minister's predecessor put on the Statute Book a most important piece of legislation in relation to the decentralisation of industry, namely, the Undeveloped Areas Act.  That was a bold and progressive piece of legislation which, even if it has not succeeded to the extent we all hoped it would succeed, can nevertheless be described as a very bold step in the decentralisation of industry.  We are interested in that policy of decentralisation.  I wonder if the Minister fully appreciates the significance of further pursuing that effort towards decentralisation which will in time justify a better standard of living for a bigger population <Col N="83" /> in these areas that are now becoming depopulated.</P>
    <P>Possibly the Undeveloped Areas Act falls short of what is required in some respects; that point was adverted to by the previous Minister when he was piloting the measure through the House.  Local initiative and local capital are necessary in order to develop industry. These are not always available in the small towns and villages in the congested areas.  In the bigger towns a certain amount of capital will be forthcoming.  In such cases the Act has been a definite source of encouragement. Without it we would never have succeeded in getting the industrialists to move away from the larger cities, particularly Dublin, where all the necessary facilities are available&mdash;import facilities and distribution facilities.  But in hundreds of small villages the only incentive to establish industries comes from those who desire employment for themselves. Those who have capital to spare are not industrially minded and they need something more than the incentive of the Undeveloped Areas Act if they are to be induced to invest money in local industry.  I move to report progress.</P>

The object of this Bill is to re-enact, with amendments, the laws which prohibit gaming and lotteries while exempting from this prohibition, on certain conditions which are set out in the Bill, the holding of small lotteries for charitable purposes and gaming for small stakes at travelling shows and carnivals and also, in certain circumstances, in amusement halls and fun-fairs.  And the opportunity has been taken to clarify the law, much of which is a relic of antiquity, and to repeal a score or more of the statutes in which it is contained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principle upon which we have <Col N="84" /> proceeded is that gaming is not wrong in itself, but that public gaming needs to be severely restricted to prevent fraud and excess.  We feel, however, that the prohibition should stop short of a prohibition of minor forms of gaming and the holding of small lotteries for charitable purposes which have long been sanctioned by public opinion.  Accordingly it is proposed to authorise gaming for small stakes at travelling shows, carnivals and fun-fairs by which I mean amusement halls providing a variety of attractions of the type that are to be found at many holiday and seaside resorts.</P>
    <P>Gaming and lotteries are more open to abuses and to the danger of fraud than betting on horses and dogs, which has, moreover, this to recommend it that it helps to support the horse and dog breeding industries, and gaming and lotteries are, therefore, activities which, in our view, are rather to be tolerated than favoured.  We are not kill-joys and we recognise that the law as it stands is a bad example of class legislation since, like the prohibition of off the course betting which was abolished in 1926, it was designed to deny to the working classes facilities for recreation and amusement that were readily available to the well-to-do. However, we do not want to see rash or foolish persons ruin themselves and their families by excessive gambling or to create a powerful vested interest in the form of professional gamblers and racketeers such as those whose activities have caused the public authorities so much trouble in other parts of the world.</P>
    <P>The Bill is in five parts, the first of which need not detain us at this stage as it is concerned merely with definitions and repeals.  Gaming is dealt with in Parts II and III of the Bill. Part IV deals with lotteries and Part V is concerned with enforcement, evidence and penalties.</P>
    <P>Under Part II of the Bill gaming, which is defined in the first part as &ldquo;playing a game for stakes hazarded by the player&rdquo;, is declared to be unlawful &ldquo;in which by reason of the nature of the game, the chances of all the players, including the banker, are not equal or in which a toll is levied on the stakes or for the right to take <Col N="85" /> part in which any charge is made&rdquo;. However, it is not the players but the persons who promote or provide facilities for unlawful gaming that we want to get after and it is they alone who will be committing an offence.  This in effect is the position under existing law.</P>
    <P>Owing to the difficulties that have been experienced in proving, in the case of particular games, that the chances of all the players, including the banker, are not equal, the definition of unlawful games in the Gaming Act, 1845, has been widened so as to include gaming... &ldquo;in which a toll is levied on the stakes or for the right to take part in which any charge is made&rdquo;.  The new definition will, it is felt, bring within its ambit all gambling games (such as pongo) irrespective of whether they are games of skill or chance, and will render the promoters liable to prosecution.  As the purpose of the Bill is to control what might be described as the commercial promotion of gaming, sub-section (2) of Section 4 exempts what may be described as &ldquo;private&rdquo; gaming.  Thus, the playing of a game for money in a club or at a whist drive will not be unlawful where the provisions of the sub-section are fulfilled.</P>
    <P>Before leaving the definition sections I would draw attention to the definition of &ldquo;slot-machines&rdquo; in Section 9. It is the intention that the section will provide for a complete prohibition on coin-operated machines which, when successfully operated, automatically deliver a prize of greater value than the stake.  Slot-machines are really a lottery device.  In playing the machines one inserts a coin in a slot and receives two or more coins or the equivalent in the form of a token or a prize if one succeeds in winning. These machines usually return twothirds of the money taken in, but they can be rigged to return only one-third or less.  To put it another way, the owner normally gets 1d. for every 3d. staked and may get 2d. or more.</P>
    <P>Section 8, which prohibits gaming on licensed premises, and Section 10 which provides penalties for cheating, are simply restating existing law.  It is <Col N="86" /> intended, however, that where there is only one charge in respect of the day on which the game is played the charge will not constitute part of the stakes hazarded by the player and in consequence playing of games such as whist or rings or darts, in which there are no side-stakes, but in which the player hazards his entry fee in a competition to win a prize will not come within the definition of gaming and will not be prohibited on licensed premises.  This is simply a case of removing the technical offence which is at present committed by the operation of some of these harmless games in public houses, licensed hotels and clubs.</P>
    <P>I should now like to explain how the Bill proposes to deal with the public promotion of games of chance.  As I mentioned earlier, the Government's attitude is that gaming, whether in the form of wagering, games of chance or lotteries, is not bad in itself but that excessive gaming brings definite evils in its train.  So long as gaming is carried on in moderation under conditions which preclude fraud, we see nothing wrong with it.  In consequence, we are providing, in Section 6, that games of chance may be promoted without a licence at circuses and travelling shows, in any one place for a period of one week in every three months, where gaming is not the main activity of the show and the stake is not more than 6d. a time.  It may be that a 6d. stake is too high and that it ought to be reduced.  As to this I have an open mind but I am satisfied that to permit gaming for stakes in excess of 6d. a time might lead to the loss of considerable sums.  It has in fact been suggested to me by persons engaged in the amusement business that the stake should be limited to a 3d. piece.</P>
    <P>Gaming without a licence is to be allowed at carnivals, bazaars, sports meetings, etc., where gaming is not the main activity and where the organisers get no personal profit.  But, of course, the prescribed conditions with respect to the age of the players and the size of the stakes will have to be observed.</P>
    <P>I come now to Part III of the Bill which provides for the commercial promotion of games of chance in <Col N="87" /> amusement arcades and fun-fairs during the holiday season.  We have some misgivings about making provision for anything but occasional gaming but, again, having regard to the fact that there is a public demand at tourist resorts during the holiday season for amusements of one kind or another &mdash; particularly if the weather happens to be wet&mdash;and that the force of public opinion has not been behind the prohibition of gaming of the type in question at holiday resorts, we think that it would be better to regulate what is happening rather than to persist in the effort to enforce a law that cannot be enforced unless it has public opinion behind it.  As a precaution against the establishment of chains of gaming houses, under the guise of amusement arcades, the Bill provides several safeguards, in particular that premises can only be licensed for part of the year (the holiday season) after the local authority&mdash;the urban council, borough council, etc., as the case may be&mdash; passes a resolution in favour of the establishment of such premises.</P>
    <P>We feel that it is a wise precaution to place responsibility on the local authority for having this kind of gaming in their town and that the people of a town, through their elected representatives, should have the right to say whether gaming saloons should or should not be allowed to open.  We do not want the local inhabitants to be forced to have gaming saloons whether they want them or not.  Furthermore, when a local authority has passed a resolution adopting this part of the Bill it will have the right of being heard in court in support of or against particular applications.  The police also will have a right of audience in court and may give evidence as to the character of the applicant and suitability of the premises from the point of view of police supervision.</P>
    <P>Section 14 of the Bill indicates the various conditions which the District Court may attach to the grant of a certificate and Section 19 requires the licensee to display a notice in a conspicuous position near the entrance of <Col N="88" /> his premises setting out the conditions of the licence.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill is concerned with lotteries.  Sections 22 and 23 of the Bill authorise the holding of private lotteries and lotteries at carnivals, without restriction, provided that the conditions specified in the sections are fulfilled.  Our idea here is that lotteries of this type are normally on such a small scale that no specific restrictions are needed.  We recognise, however, that there is a public demand that will not be denied for lotteries on a somewhat larger scale for charitable purposes and the provision we have made is that such lotteries may be held only under a police permit in the case of an occasional lottery and under licence from the District Court in the case of periodic lotteries.  The general conditions which are to govern the holding of these lotteries are that they shall comply with the conditions specified in Sections 25 and 26 of the Bill, chief amongst which are the conditions that the prize fund shall not exceed the sum of £300 and that the permit or licence holder shall derive no personal benefit from the lotteries.  We have fixed the prize fund at a maximum of £300 with the deliberate purpose of excluding professionals from the promotion of lotteries and keeping expenses down to a minimum.</P>
    <P>We recognise that the promoters of such lotteries have to rely wholly or chiefly on voluntary workers and this, we think, is as it should be.  The promotion of a lottery on a week-to-week basis with £300 in prizes is a formidable undertaking which will require very hard and unselfish work on the part of the promoting charity and to raise the prize fund above £300 or the allowance for expenses above 25 per cent. of the proceeds would take such lotteries out of the category of voluntary charitable work and into the realm of professional promotion.  And this is something that ought, we feel, to be avoided.</P>
    <P>The provisions of Section 26 have been drafted with regard to the situation that exists at present whereby a number of charities are promoting £300 weekly lotteries.  Prior to 1953 <Col N="89" /> the limit was £100 and some years before that £30.  As you are aware these lotteries in aid of charities are illegal under existing law and their toleration extending back over 40 years has been on the basis that the organisers give their time and labour free.  Unfortunately, at the £300 mark some charity promotions, in an endeavour to outpace rivals and to get in as much money as possible, have been paying clerical staffs, organisers, agents and collectors and it is obvious that, if the prize money were to be raised any higher, the increased sales of tickets necessitated could only be got by an increase in the number of collectors, etc., receiving payment for their services.  Furthermore the number of lotteries which could operate on a countrywide scale would necessarily be few and the purposes for which they might be promoted would not necessarily be the most deserving.  For instance, some sports organisations with thousands of members might create a virtual monopoly for themselves and in the process bring to an end the innumerable small parish charity promotions which fulfil such good purposes as helping the sick and the aged, relieving poverty and distress, advancing religion and education.</P>
    <P>Another point which should be borne in mind is that while 25 per cent. of the gross proceeds for expenses is adequate in the case of lotteries promoted by unpaid voluntary workers (if there is an excess it goes to the charity, anyway) it is not sufficient when the promotion loses its parochial character and depends on paid agents, collectors, etc., etc.  As it is, even at the £300 point, representations have already been made to me that some of the existing lotteries cannot carry on unless the percentage for expenses is raised to 40 per cent. or more and an examination of figures supplied shows that over £1 in every £2 10s. collected goes in expenses of one kind or another.  I should like Deputies to consider carefully the implication of providing higher prizes and greater percentages of the proceeds for expenses. I am aware that Deputies are being asked for their support in that <Col N="90" /> regard and I should like them to think twice before raising the matter.</P>
    <P>In looking at the remaining provisions in Part IV of the Bill relating to lotteries Deputies will observe that there is a prohibition on advertising of any kind&mdash;another provision which emphasises their private nature and the intention that they should operate within local limits.  Furthermore, tickets or prizes cannot be sent outside the State.  There is no prohibition, however, on a charity outside the State from being a beneficiary of a lottery promoted and conducted wholly within the State.</P>
    <P>Part V of the Bill, which relates to enforcement, evidence and penalties, does not call for any comment from me at this stage, save in relation to Section 34 which continues the existing provisions of the law that makes gaming or wagering contracts unenforceable. In my view, there is as much need to-day as there ever was to protect rash and inexperienced backers and those with whom gambling has become a passion from ruining themselves and, what is worse, from bringing ruin and misery upon their families.  And I think it is a sound principle of public policy that layers, too, should be discouraged from taking unwarrantable risks.  It will be within the knowledge of every Deputy in this House that, in certain circumstances and under certain conditions, the temptation to bet beyond one's means, is hard to resist.  Indeed, the backer who plunges on the last race to recover his loses is a familiar figure to us all.  If the present law is changed, nothing is more certain than that weak-minded persons, with gambling propensities, will become the prey of sharks and will be subjected to such inducements to bet beyond their means on credit, maybe after they have been plied with drink, that they will not be able to resist the temptation to do so.</P>
    <P>I do not, of course, suggest that reputable bookmakers would countenance such malpractices still less that they would be guilty of them.  Nor do I suggest that the immediate victims would be deserving of any greater measure of sympathy than ordinary <Col N="91" /> humanity requires us to extend to those who are the slaves of a predominant passion.  But I do ask you to have compassion on their families and to consider the husbands and wives of these people and their innocent children, on whom so much misery could be brought in this way.  I know it could be argued that wagering contracts should be put on the same footing as other contracts but this, in my opinion, is to take a doctrinaire view of the case, without allowing for the circumstances which give these contracts their special character and provide the justification for the existing provision of the law.  In this connection, I may remind you that the sale of liquor on credit, for consumption on the premises, has had to be prohibited for a somewhat similar reason and it is noteworthy that, even before there was an absolute prohibition on credit sales, the amounts due on foot of some such sales were declared by law to be irrecoverable. I would also draw the attention of Deputies to the fact that the joint committee on the Betting Act, 1926, and the law relating to the business of bookmaking reported against changing the law which makes betting debts irrecoverable.  And as a family man appealing to other family men I ask you to leave the law as it is.</P>
    <P>I have now concluded such observations as occur to me and it remains only to say that we are submitting this Bill as an honest attempt to create order out of the existing statutory chaos.  We are only too conscious of the difficulty in legally defining gaming and distinguishing in practice between acts which violate the law and those that may be questionable but not illegal.  We have done our best to overcome these difficulties having been assisted in our task, as I am glad to acknowledge, by the consideration which was given to this question by my predecessor when he was in office, and I hope that the House will see its way to approve our proposals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is certainly overdue.  It is about two years since the then Government had a draft before them almost identical with this. <Col N="92" /> I have to admit that speaking for myself I am a bit of a pussyfoot in these matters and the one thing I am afraid of in regard to legalising these things is that you will have the same results as we had by the legalising of betting.  A lot of people think it was a good thing to legalise betting and from one point of view it may have been, inasmuch as people would be breaking the law by betting off the course.  However, my personal view is that there are about 20 people betting now for the one there was before legalisation.  What I am afraid of is that in legalising gambling under this Bill there will be a similar increase in all these opportunities of getting rid of money easily.</P>
      <P>The Bill is overdue and it is practically the same Bill as was drafted a couple of years ago.  Perhaps the reason I held back is that although I have these personal views, I did not want anyone to think that because I felt these things ought not to be the Bill was being brought in.  In any event I am satisfied and I think it is the general view among Deputies that it is time to do something about gambling. For instance, these slot-machines were going too far.  They were leading poor families to ruin by the way they were being operated even in shops where food was being sold.  Then we have the pools.  There was one successful pool started outside this part of the country.  It got on so well that others started to follow suit and I think&mdash;my recollection may be wrong&mdash;within a year there were at least 40 competing with one another.</P>
      <P>All the people engaged in these pools were not by any means the desirable type.  Some of them had very desirable objects, hospitals, churches, and the rest, but, on the other hand, some of them were being run by people whose antecedents were not of the very best.  The whole thing reached such a position that if the Government had not taken steps to halt it, it would have been a very bad situation altogether.  Therefore, we agreed to do something which we had not legal authority to do.  We agreed to tolerate up to £300, prior to the 25 per cent. expenses for promotion, pending the passage of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="93" /> I do not intend to go into the provisions of the Bill in detail now as it is practically the same Bill as I had. I dare say that the speech made by the Minister is somewhat on the lines of the speech I might have made.  However, there are some sections here which I should like to refer to and which I may or may not have agreed to.  Section 7 concerns gaming at carnivals.  It is hard that only one week is allowed for travelling show people while one month is allowed for people promoting bazaars, and so forth.</P>
    <P>Section 32 deals with the prohibition on sending money or documents out of the State.  In my view, that section is not enforceable.  It is very bad for any Parliament to pass laws that cannot be enforced.  We have some of them already.  We have the licensing laws.  Everybody knows that they are not in force because public opinion is not in favour of some of the restrictions. I think we ought not deliberately pass a section such as Section 32 of this Bill, which reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;No person shall send or attempt to send out of the State any ticket, counterfoil or coupon for use in a lottery or any money for the purchase of, or any money representing the purchase price of, a ticket or chance in a lottery or a prize won in a lottery, or any document relating to the purchase or sale of, or indicating the identity of the holder of, any such ticket or chance or the winner of any such prize.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As I have said, I think that is not enforceable. I may be wrong but if I am right then I say we ought not enact legislation that cannot be enforced. One of the worst things in any State is to have laws in operation that cannot be enforced.  We ought to be careful before passing any legislation of that type.</P>
    <P>I fear the Minister will have a tough time before he gets this Bill through. Already, we have had plenty of representations. I think the limit of £300 for lotteries is quite all right, as also the £25.  He made his case for that and it was a case that convinced me <Col N="94" /> too.  £300 is enough.  I do not know what will happen if pools promoters outside the State continue as they have been doing.  When I was Minister for Justice I found that everybody running a pool&mdash;it was based on the Twenty-Six Counties&mdash;complied with the Order to cease operations for the unlimited prizes.  Then there was the pool from the Six Counties.  I agreed that the objects for which the pool was run were laudable&mdash;as, indeed, were the objects in relation to which the other pools also were run.</P>
    <P>I could not tell the House of all the abuse I got from some of our own people here because I compelled them to cease operating and apparently winked at the other thing.  Some action was taken in the courts, with what result I do not know.  However, the position was anomalous when one body was allowed to carry on with an unlimited prize fund and the others were not.  It would cause all sorts of discontent.  There will be remedies under this Bill but I say to the House that we should not pass any provision in the Bill that we cannot enforce.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill except for the reservations which I have made.  I hope my fear will not be justified that, as a result of the legalising of gaming, we shall have an extension of all the games of chance, lotteries, and so forth, comparable to the scandalous increase in the number of betting shops all over the country.  I sincerely hope that will not happen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is general acceptance of the need for a Bill such as this.  So long as men and women live and whether it is legalised or not, gambling in one form or another will continue.  I think it is desirable that it should be regulated in some way.  If that is not done then you allow the present undesirable position to remain &mdash;a position whereby decisions as to what type of gambling should go or what form should be permitted depend on the views of different superintendents and on the decisions of different district justices.  That has been the position in the past.  While I think the Minister has advisedly taken steps under this Bill to control <Col N="95" /> gambling he should be careful not to make the law so strict or so unworkable as to drive underground, if I might use that expression, the people who promote gambles.  If the Bill does not get the goodwill of the people who promote lotteries and games then there is the grave danger that illegality will flourish, together with fraud and corruption.  It is desirable to have this Bill as wide as possible and acceptable to the promoters of gaming, at the same time ensuring that the ordinary members of the public who engage in minor forms of gambling get the pleasures they desire to have and which, in my opinion, they are perfectly entitled to enjoy.</P>
      <P>I can see no justification for what the Minister says about keeping the bookmakers apart from ordinary promoters of gaming houses.  They are in the business for the sake of the profit they can make out of it, and more luck to them.  After all, that is all that almost everybody in the world is out for.  Those of us who are honest will have to admit that that is true. Whether or not they help the horse-racing or the greyhound industry I do not know but in my view they are not particularly interested in that side of things.  If there was no gaming on horse-racing or on dogs it is questionable whether the greyhound or the horse-racing industry would suffer at all.</P>
      <P>The fact is that we have betting and it is desirable to ensure, as I notice the Minister stated, that frauds are stopped.  If it is desirable to have control and to stop frauds then I think everyone will welcome this Bill and agree with the Minister in that regard. The system of licensing gaming houses and of keeping a check on the promoters of lotteries is desirable but the question of who should and who should not have a licence is another matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are some undesirable points in the Bill.  One of the things to which I have the very strongest objection&mdash;and I speak primarily because of the fact that I am thinking of the people employed in the gaming business and in lotteries, as agents&mdash;is the <Col N="96" /> limit in regard to the six months' period, implying that only the seaside resorts are entitled to this higher form of gambling.  Would anybody suggest that it is wrong that an old lady, who is not able to go to a racecourse or to go to an ordinary bookmaker's office to put 10/- or £1 on a horse or dog, should go into a pongo saloon of a winter's evening, if she does not care to go to the pictures, and lay 3d. a time for about two hours with the possible loss of about 3/-, that is, provided she loses all the time?  That would cost her roughly the same as the cinema.  She cannot go through the hurly burly of breaking through a cinema queue on Sunday night, and cannot afford to pay the black market 6/-.</P>
    <P>Is there anything wrong in her going in and playing the numbers?  I do not see any crime in it, and I do not see how the Minister or anybody else can suggest it.  I do not see how it legalises or makes the position any better if all the money goes to charity.  If a woman goes in and spends on gaming all the money that should go to buy food for the family, and if the money all goes to charity, I do not see that it lessens her crime.  It is difficult to understand that if the money goes to charity rather than into somebody's private pocket it makes it any better.  I do not accept that.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister should take the broad view.  Let us legalise gaming up to a point.  Let us limit the stakes.  Let us make sure that only reputable, decent people are permitted to operate it.  Let us make sure that there will be no fraud or trickery.  Then we can go the whole way with him.  I disagree with giving certain sections special rights and saying that the man in the seaside resorts who is operating on a big scale or the man in a big town is entitled to concessions that other people are not entitled to.  I disagree completely with class legislation and sectional interests. The people of all sections have the same rights as long as they are good citizens.  I would suggest that the Minister should examine the Bill from that point of view, of having gaming <Col N="97" /> for all the people or not at all.  Personally, I suggest that it should be licensed.</P>
    <P>In my opinion it is not right that the local authority should decide as to whether or not there should be gaming in their areas.  I am a member of a number of local authorities and I am aware of the influence that can be brought by sectional interests and the pressure that can be exercised.  There is no person more subject to that than the ordinary public representative.  I suggest that it would be far better that the Garda authorities should deal with it.  If a permit is to be given, let it be given by the Garda authority, say, the superintendent or somebody in the district.  I do not think the local authority should have that right. I feel that if it were the local authority, we would be defeating ourselves. In the case of the issue of licences to bookmakers it is the district justice who decides the matter. There should be a similar provision in this case.  I am aware that, the local authority having given sanction, the matter has to go to the court.  I am quite satisfied with that.  The court is a competent body and will not be subject to pressure.  I suggest that the local authority is the very last body that should be put under the strain of having to administer the Bill or that should be given the responsibility.</P>
    <P>There is a time element referred to by Deputy Boland, the question of the travelling show and the 28 days' notice that is to be given to local authorities. These are matters that will be rectified on Committee and that should be rectified. It is ridiculous to limit the time so strictly to a period of a week in the case of a travelling show or circus. When a travelling show or circus finds things are good in an area, that the money is flowing and people are enjoying the show they provide, it is only reasonable that they should be permitted to stay there for a much longer period than a week.  It would scarcely be worth while in some cases to pull up for a week.  These travelling shows have an amount of paraphernalia and it would not be worth while unpacking to stay for only a week, especially having regard to the fact <Col N="98" /> that a showman's week is not a matter of seven days but commences on Friday and ends on Sunday.  Certainly in the small country towns, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday could be given as a present to anybody for all the showman takes in.  The Minister would be well advised to accept amendments on the lines I have suggested.</P>
    <P>In Section 16 (e) it is specified that the types of games to be played should be listed.  It is difficult for showmen to know what games they will play in a particular area.  The type of game would be dictated by the type of game liked in the locality.  Very often showmen have to improvise to meet the demand in a locality.  It is rather strict to ask him to decide beforehand on the games to be played.</P>
    <P>I would particularly object to the attempt made in this Bill to do away with the private person who promotes lotteries or games.  These are the people who give the employment.  I know there are over 5,000 people directly employed in the rural areas and several thousand in other areas. These people are making a living.  A personal friend of mine has been disemployed due to the restrictions imposed in the past three or four months. He has a family to maintain.  Due to certain circumstances, he is not in a position to engage in manual work. What is he to do?  Emigrate?  Must he fly out of the land because we decide suddenly to be pussyfoot?  I do not think it is a good thing to do that.  He is only one of a number.  There are thousands like him, people who have engaged in this business which is carried on in every country in the world.</P>
    <P>It is deplorable that this should be confined to so-called charities because a good deal of the charity money does not reach the charitable purpose, as we know, and where all these voluntary helpers are coming in, it is only the private gaming concern that really does anything at all.</P>
    <P>I would make a plea to the Minister to remember the thousands of people engaged in this business.  As he finished his speech by appealing for the families who suffer as a result of <Col N="99" /> gaming I would say let us think of the families of those who gain through gaming.  The Minister should consider the wives and children of those employees who have been put out of work and who, if the Bill as drafted is enacted, will certainly be put out of work for the future.  I would also suggest that if the Bill is delayed and does not go through for a long time he should declare some kind of amnesty until such time as the Bill is decided by the votes of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAFinlay1954" hpid="Mr. Finlay Mr. Finlay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finlay</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to welcome the Bill, which has been already welcomed, as bringing into some reality and truth the situation with regard to gaming.  There are one or two aspects of the Bill to which I wish to refer. The first one is in connection with the running of lotteries.  I appreciate what the Minister said, that the entire intention of the Bill is to try to confine the charitable lottery to a real charitable lottery, run by enthusiastic people, as far as possible on a voluntary basis and to keep out of the running of such lotteries the professional element.  At the same time I would suggest to the Minister and to the House that possibly the very figures, that is to say, the £300 and the 25 per cent. expenses, may not have that effect.  It is fair to say that in this country&mdash;unaffected in any way by this legislation&mdash;there is in various periodicals and newspapers a form of competition in crossword puzzles which, to a very large proportion of the population, in fact, one would be tempted to say to everyone over the age of seven years, is very nearly a lottery.  No real skill is required.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finlay</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.  The crossword puzzles are in operation and they require no skill.  You pay your sixpence and I think you are taking your chance.  That is a gaming operation. I am not saying that it should be legislated against, but I am considering it in comparison with the restrictions on charitable and philanthropic lotteries. <Col N="100" /> I would consider these crossword competitions as being in competition with those charitable lotteries.  The expense of running these puzzles are unlimited. The case has been made by one pools organisation operating in Dublin and the country generally for a very good purpose and which has been working within the limits imposed by the Government&mdash;the case has been made by the organisers of that pool that it is difficult to operate on a 25 per cent. expense margin.  I appreciate that the effort to keep expenses down is one of the provisions in the Bill.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that through it the Minister hopes to prevent the element of professionalism entering into these things.  The expenses of running them are high because you have people who are slow to pay and you must have collectors going around with books. There are other overheads such as printing and advertising.  A society of this kind which has been working for the past two years and which has had a good lot of voluntary effort says it cannot operate on a 25 per cent. expenses margin.  I doubt if raising the level from 25 per cent. to 30 per cent. or even 40 per cent. would really permit a professional pool to operate behind a charitable front.  Possibly consideration of increasing the £300 limit would put these charitable lotteries in a better position to compete with the newspaper competitions and with some of the lotteries which have been permitted to come in from outside.</P>
      <P>The limit of £300 is reasonable to a certain extent but the Minister might consider increasing the limit and adding a restriction about the number of entries.  He could impose a limit of one entry.  If only one entry of 6d. were allowed to each subscriber I think the organisers should be entitled to increase the prize money.  I suggest that the Minister would consider this aspect of the question between this and Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One other matter to which I should like to refer concerns Section 41 of the Bill.  I may be misreading that section and I may not be recollecting properly the criminal law but it does seem to me that the obstruction of a <Col N="101" /> member of the Garda Síochána in the execution of his duty would be an offence under this as it is under other Acts.  It would be very useful and desirable that a particular penalty or sanction would be imposed for committing the offence under this Act; in other words, the Guards must be strengthened to search premises where they suspect gaming is taking place and I would be in favour of any penalties or sanctions imposed, but a presumption as to the commission of an offence is an entirely separate offence.  Of course, I may not be reading the section properly, but I think that the section provides that the Guard would start off with the presumption of guilt on the part of the owner of the premises to be searched.  I do not in any way suggest that there should be any limit put on the powers of the Guards in this matter, but I should like that the Minister would consider how a principle creating a new and separate offence merely by impeding or obstructing the Guards, which is a separate offence in itself, is desirable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of this Bill.  I have indeed for quite a long time been pestering the Minister's Department and trying to get the Minister's predecessor to see eye to eye with me in this matter of getting amended this rather antiquated law which has been in force in this country in connection with games such as pongo and roulette as played at country carnivals.  I welcome Deputy Kyne's views here, but what I am mainly concerned with is that before we finish we produce a reasonable and practical measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To start off with, I think we should be able to deal with this matter with a fresh outlook because in fact I am convinced and always have been convinced that the Gaming Act of 1854 should not be applied to this country. There is no decision of the Supreme Court of this country on that matter but it is rather obvious that the preamble to the 1854 Act refers to the gaming houses in the City of London. Yet, it was under the Gaming Act of 1854 that all these prosecutions have <Col N="102" /> been taken during the past number of years.</P>
    <P>Clearly, that legislation was not intended to deal with the type of poor widow and her husband about whom the Minister has been talking.  It was intended to protect the elder sons and the younger sons of the manor and the bucks of the London gaming houses. It was significant that the Act passed in 1780 was an Act dealing with a man named Wilson and applied only to the Isle of Mauritius.  The Act following that was aimed at giving relief in income-tax of 1/2 in the £ to the British taxpayer.  I hope the Minister for Finance will consider that before he introduces his Budget.</P>
    <P>In relation to the statutes passed in that particular year there was an index included.  That index was printed by Messrs.  Eyre and Spottiswode, the official printers to the British Parliament at the time.  That index purported to show to which country each of these Acts applied.  After England appeared the letter E; after the United Kingdom, the letters U.K.; after Scotland the letter S appeared, and so on.  In relation to this particular Act passed in 1854 the letter E appeared in the printed index.  Therefore the Act referred only to England. But this is the Act under which unfortunate showmen have been pilloried and pestered here by the powers-that-be since we started on our own.  I am not blaming the Minister or the authorities, but the fact remains that we have been operating a law passed for a different country to deal with different circumstances, a law which has no relation and no application to local circumstances here.</P>
    <P>When we come to deal with local circumstances, let us put our own views on the Statute Book.  Let us deal with local conditions as we know them and forget about what the position is elsewhere.  Speaking of elsewhere, we can start in this matter with the extraordinary knowledge that we have legalised one of the biggest State lotteries in the world.  We have, too, an extraordinary number of licensed bookmakers all over the country. That being so, I fail to see why we should shed all these tears now and <Col N="103" /> start chanting a <i>de profundis</i> because someone puts 1d. on roulette or invests 3d. in a game of pongo.  National weaknesses of character are not confined to the poor fellow who puts his 1d. on the games played at carnivals or invests in a game of pongo, la boule or roulette on a wet night at the seaside.</P>
    <P>I have always thought that an awful lot of nonsense is talked about the number of people who go in openly to the bookmaker's office and mortgage their farms in order to put £500 on the nose of a stumer of a horse that was never out before.  We are still being pilloried and described under the Gaming Act of 1854 as rogues and vagabonds if we put a penny on roulette or la boule, or get our cards for pongo or netball, or anything else. Let us be realists and let us get down to putting on the Statute Book a workable measure which will have the cooperation of the public and the confidence of the people who operate it.</P>
    <P>In the main, the principles of the Bill are all right.  I suggest to the Minister that on the Committee Stage the House should seek to make this Bill workable.  A period of one month is mentioned in Section 6.  One month is also mentioned in Section 7.  Has the Minister considered the position of a circus or a carnival travelling around the country?  Has he considered the time it takes these people to get from one place to another.  I do not think that factor has been adverted to by either the Minister or his advisers.  In sub-section (b) of Section 6 it is stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;... the show at or within three miles of that place does not extend over a period exceeding one week and has not been carried on within that area during the preceding three months.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is no definition of area in the definition section.  What does it mean?  Does it mean the whole county.  Are the miles square miles or linear miles?  The Minister should examine that point.  It seems to me that as it stands at present a showman <Col N="104" /> might find himself confined to operating in one particular spot in one particular county.  Area will have to be defined.</P>
    <P>From time immemorial it has been the practice for some of these showmen to devote the proceedings of one week to one charity and another week to another charity and have only one week for themselves.  I take it I can mention a particular firm since it was mentioned by James Joyce in <i>Ulysses.</i> I refer to the firm of Tofts.  They come to Galway every year and the proceeds of one week are devoted to the St. Vincent de Paul; another week is devoted to another local charity. They operate for two weeks for charity before they operate for themselves. Under this section that position can no longer obtain if it is passed as it stands.  The Minister will appreciate that in Galway a lease has to be obtained from the corporation and a substantial rent has to be paid.  Section 6 as it stands is unworkable and the period should be at least one month.</P>
    <P>Section 7 deals with the people to whom Deputy Kyne referred.  They are the people who make no profit.  A local dramatic society would come under Section 7.  Suppose that society puts on a show in town A and then proceeds to town B 25 miles away and puts on another show: they have to pay for their transport; being human, I assume they must have a meal.  Will they be liable to prosecution under Section 7 if it is passed as it stands?  If they pay for transport and food out of the proceeds that can be interpreted as a personal profit. The Minister might consider that proposition.</P>
    <P>Under Section 9 the Minister outlaws what is known as the one armed band; that is the slot-machine.  I do not see why we should be so terrified of a penny-in-the-slot machine.  I have seen them operating on premises within five yards of Piccadilly Circus. I do not see what extraordinary inroads such a machine could make on the family inheritance of someone sticking his pennies into these machines.  Furthermore, granted there is any man who will put his family and <Col N="105" /> his property in pawn through the medium of the penny-in-the-slot machine, if there is not someone he will meet on his way who will take as much from him I am no judge of human nature.  If such a man spends his patrimony on these machines he should not be let out&mdash;certainly not without his mother.</P>
    <P>Consider the position in the small seaside resorts.  Sometimes, for instance, on the Island of Achill one cannot go out to fish or to enjoy oneself on the beach because it is raining. These penny-in-the-slot machines would give the people in these places something to do.  The only other amenity is the local pub.  The Minister is not a drinking man and his conflict will be between taking away these machines and driving people into the pubs.  If he does not permit the machines he will be helping the local publican.  I see nothing wrong in permitting these machines in conjunction with the other amusements one expects to find.</P>
    <P>The main objection to this measure arises in relation to Part III in connection with the local authority.  I suggest to the Minister that that part of the Bill will be unworkable from the point of view of those who will have to operate it.  The Minister provides that the local authority must adopt this resolution.  To start off with, you will not have uniformity on that; you will have those that will and those that will not adopt it.  It is not the people who will not adopt it who will suffer; the people who will suffer will be the people who are interested, say, in promoting the local carnival.  It is provided that a resolution shall not have effect unless not less than one month's notice of intention to propose it has been given in writing to every member of the local authority and has been published by advertisement in at least two newspapers circulating in the area to which the proposal relates.</P>
    <P>Let us imagine this performance. We have to summon&mdash;I am putting the extreme case to the Minister&mdash;the local authority from the extreme corners of a scattered county like Mayo and provide the cost of transport and that cost in the case of Mayo is about £70 per meeting for transport alone.  Then we <Col N="106" /> solemnly sit down, this proposal having been advertised in two local papers circulating in the county.  The advertising has to take place first and then the local authority has to be summoned to sit in solemn conclave on this question. Then they have to pass a resolution and they &ldquo;shall cause notice of the fact to be published in at least two newspapers circulating in the area to which the resolution relates.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>So far as I can see the newspapers will do very well under this section because they will be doing nothing but publishing notices, first that the local authority is being called together to deal with the resolution and when the local authority has dealt with it, a further notice stating that they have dealt with it, and this may be given as evidence of the passing of a resolution. Having done all that, the poor showman has still to come to the District Court, if my interpretation of Section 14 is correct.  He has to come back and put in a further advertisement and serve it on the Garda superintendent. Incidentally, there is a period laid down for the intending applicant.  It is provided that he shall give 28 days' notice in writing of his intention to each local authority and to the Garda Síochána, and you have a further advertisement that he has got to publish.</P>
    <P>All this I suggest to the Minister can be completely wiped out if the Minister will adopt the simple procedure laid down in the Public Dance Halls Act of 1935 dealing with this matter.  I want the Minister to appreciate this &mdash; that the local authority can come in under the public health regulations anyhow.  Under the Dance Halls Act of 1935 any person can come in and oppose any application. The local authority has come in in cases where the public health is concerned in regard to the number of persons permitted or insufficient fire-fighting appliances.  They come in under the health regulations.  In the same way it would be open to them if there was any special danger from the public health point of view to come in under this Act.  They could come in but there is no reason I could see <Col N="107" /> under the sun for writing this into the statute to make them a party to any of these applications.  I shall deal with it in a more detailed manner on the Committee Stage but I suggest a procedure such as under the Public Dance Halls Act, under which persons may apply for a limited licence for a defined period not exceeding a month in respect of, say, dances to be held &mdash; a certain number within the month &mdash;or can go to the annual licensing session and get a licence for a year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>But he must be approved by the local authority first.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister that he must not.  He applies to the courts for this licence, the annual licence in respect of a particular building which he wishes to run as a dance hall.  He serves notice on the Garda superintendent and comes into court and any member of the public can come and oppose his application, but he is mainly concerned with the Garda superintendent.  That is for an annual licence, but he can give 48 hours' notice and apply to the District Court for a licence for a defined period not exceeding one month, and having served that on the superintendent he can get a licence for specific occasions or for a number of occasions within a confined period not exceeding one month.  He can do that without any advertisement and if the local superintendent and the court is satisfied he gets his licence.  That is the simple procedure and I strongly suggest to the Minister that he would consider these provisions and do away with this cumbersome and complicated and&mdash;even though this may affect myself, I say&mdash;very expensive procedure provided under this particular section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not quite understand what the object of Section 18 is because Section 18 suggests to me, unless I have misread it, that when a showman finishes with a county council or local authority, finishes with all advertisements and with the court and with the further advertisement, that he still has to come to the customs people.  How this is going to be worked or what form of <Col N="108" /> duty is going to be put on under Section 18 I do not know.  The section, as it reads, brings my mind back to the question of getting a liquor licence where the court grants a certificate and you then have to come to the customs people.  What the purpose of the section is I do not know.  I would feel far happier if the Minister said in plain words that the stamp duty on annual licences will be £2 and that the stamp duty on a licence for a defined period not exceeding one month will be 10/-. We would all know where we were then.  I do not know the meaning of Section 18.  Perhaps that is a shot the Minister is keeping in his locker.  I would be very interested to hear what he intends to do or what the Revenue Commissioners will do under this section.</P>
    <P>I must say I am not greatly concerned with the lotteries portion of this Bill except again to make the thing workable if we are going to put a realistic measure on the Statute Book.  I know that the Hospitals' Trust having got in first, and having now got a vested interest, must have its rights protected, but as somebody &mdash;I think it was Deputy Boland &mdash;mentioned I cannot see how this thing will work, because I can give the Minister instances of things that happen day in, day out in country towns.  We had recently, for instance, in my part of the country a world trout fly-fishing competition.  There was a small sweep run on the winners of the competition and cards were sent to some former members of our club, one of whom is a distinguished clergyman in California.  We got some dollars from him and from his friends. Similarly, with old fishing men and their relatives in England and in other parts of the world, to whom cards were sent.  I do not think many of these clubs could carry on without the little help they get from people like that in places such as America and England.</P>
    <P>I am sure the local parish priest will realise the effect of this section.  In the case of many churches in this country, if the walls were not built out of sweeps that drew the money from England and America certainly many of the roofs were put on by subscriptions <Col N="109" /> coming from these countries.  I do not really think that Section 23 is workable and certainly if it passes this House I think there will be many prosecutions under that section if the Minister is able to find them out. Sections 31 and 32 were also referred to and I do not think they are enforceable.  Again, I think that if the Minister relies on the local superintendent of the Garda Síochána to give notice in connection with these matters, that will be sufficient.  He is the man who knows the local people and local conditions.  He will see that no chancer will avail himself of opportunities such as the Minister might be afraid of.</P>
    <P>I would also like to say I agree with Deputy Finlay who, I think, referred to Section 41.  As the Minister is aware, it is already an offence to obstruct a Guard in the execution of his duty.  If a Guard is obstructed in the execution of his duty under this Bill it is just as much an offence as if he were obstructed in connection with any other part of his duties.  Therefore, Section 41 is superfluous and I would not like to see it going through in its present form.  Section 42 amuses me:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It shall not be necessary in support of a prosecution in relation to unlawful gaming to prove that any person found playing at any game was playing for any money, wages or stake.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I would like to see how the prosecutor would get a conviction if he could not prove that there were some wages or stake or how he was going to prove it was gaming, unlawful or otherwise. I would like to know also if these two sections go through whether, if I was having a game of 1d. &ldquo;25&rdquo; in my house with two or three friends, a Guard could not hammer on the door, charge in and drag me in for unlawful gaming. However, I do not propose to let the Minister put these two sections through on the Committee Stage of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I again appeal to the Minister to approach this matter with an open mind.  We are starting a new chapter dealing with this very annoying type of law that we adopted from another <Col N="110" /> country.  As the Minister well knows, there is nothing which tends more to bring the law as a whole into disrespect than to have something which everybody in the country regards as &ldquo;cod&rdquo;.  You had some district justices throwing out some of the cases, fining one penny, and others fining £100 for each charge.  I am glad that chapter is closed, and if the Minister keeps an open mind I am satisfied this House in the main will take a sensible view of this Bill and will put on the Statute Book a workable measure.  I hope the Minister will not take a rigid view of this matter, that he will keep an open mind until we finish the Committee Stage and, particularly, that he will accept amendments to ensure that it will not be impossible for these men to carry on in view of the cumbersome procedure that is entailed in Part III of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to be as brief as I can and to say that I agree on the whole with the comments that have been made by the Deputies who have spoken.  In particular, I would like to compliment Deputy Moran on the remarks he made because I think they do represent the position fairly well.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that, by and large, this Bill is neither fish nor flesh.  The position will remain as chaotic after the Bill is passed as it is at the moment, and the situation is chaotic on this question of gambling and gaming.  We forbid pools completely; yet you can go down to the G.P.O. on certain nights of the week and you can hardly get near a counter with people buying postal orders to compete in football pools in England.  We forbid gambling in certain forms, pongo and pools of one kind or another; yet our two main Sunday newspapers carry out an extensive game of pongo every Sunday in which the whole country can compete and in which the papers can make as much profit as they like and in which as many entries can be made as anybody has money to buy copies of the paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We do not allow a 3d. or 6d. game of pongo but a man can go and bet £1,000 on any old horse or dog he feels like betting on.  We have the Sweep, which is probably the biggest form of <Col N="111" /> gaming or gambling almost in the world.  In addition to that, our President and all the high functionaries of State will attend race meetings right through the country and participate in gambling.  But lo and behold if anybody dares to bring a law case against somebody who bets and does not pay his money, he is told in court immediately: &ldquo;The Gaming Act; gaming is illegal and therefore you cannot sue for a gaming debt.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am merely mentioning these incidents to show how completely chaotic and illogical the present position is. I had hoped that this Bill might have attempted to place it on a more reasoned and logical basis.  I can fully appreciate the difficulties that the Minister has to meet and I think I can appreciate fully why the Minister's predecessor had this Bill tucked away in the drawer of his desk for two years without bringing it out into the light of day.  I am really in some difficulty to know what could be suggested to deal with the position.  I see on the whole that this is probably the kind of measure that should really be examined by a small committee or by a commission of experts to try to get some kind of comprehensive code to deal with the position.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that the Bill is not intended to condemn gaming as such but that it is intended only to regulate things.  I think probably there is considerably more involved than regulating gaming and I do not know whether the basis upon which it is sought to regulate it is really a sound basis.  However, I am sure the Minister will take into account the various comments that have been made on the Second Reading and will try to meet the House to the best of his ability on it.</P>
    <P>I am concerned here to-night to make one or two points in regard to showmen, the ordinary small showmen travelling the country who in themselves form part of our social life, if you like, in rural parts of the country. They are part of the local attraction in every small village and town throughout the country.  I think we <Col N="112" /> should not penalise them because, by and large, I have never heard any serious complaints about them.  They are regarded as businessmen and you very seldom hear any complaints against them.  I think that certain provisions of this Bill will put them out of business&mdash;the provision, for instance, whereby they have to obtain a licence from a county council.  Are we not likely to have a completely anomalous position where one county will decide to grant a licence and where maybe in three or four adjoining counties they will say: &ldquo;No.  We do not like gaming.&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>As Deputies know, these travelling shows work on a circuit basis.  The economy of the show depends on being able to work every day during the season and to have to travel as short a distance as possible.  Take an extreme case.  Supposing the Counties of Sligo, Roscommon and some of the north-western counties say: &ldquo;No.  We will not have it,&rdquo; and that Donegal says: &ldquo;Yes, we will.&rdquo;  It means that the show would have to travel maybe 150 miles before it could reach a place where it could set up camp and that would destroy the possibility of making the show pay.  As well as that, the provisions in the Bill which limit the stay of a show to a week are fairly unworkable for the reason which has already been very ably stated by some other Deputies.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go into any details on the Second Reading, but I should like to appeal to the Minister to meet representatives of the Irish Showmen's Guild which is a representative organisation of the small showman throughout the country.  I could not help thinking when the Minister in the course of his speech, in pointing out that gaming on horses and dogs was a help to support the horse and dog breeding industry, that there are at least 5,000 travelling showmen in the country, all small people, and that this Bill may well jeopardise their future livelihood.  We should have some consideration for their viewpoint before embarking on this piece of legislation. Therefore, I would very strongly appeal to the Minister to meet representatives of the Irish Showmen's <Col N="113" /> Guild and to have considered in detail the various suggestions they have to make in regard to the provisions of the Bill which deal with their particular problem.</P>
    <P>I think the question of slot-machines is probably one of the main reasons for the general agitation there has been for a Bill of this kind.  I think many of us have felt for a long time that slot-machines were being used in an unlimited way by children and were becoming a serious evil.  The children developed very nearly an addiction to putting pennies in slot-machines and it caused a lot of damage to them.  I would have thought it might have been possible to deal with the matter merely by making it illegal for children &mdash;say, boys and girls under 16 years&mdash; to use slot-machines or to prevent any amusement caterer from allowing children under 16 years to use them. Always provided the slot-machines are limited to a penny at the seaside or even in towns&mdash;at stations, and so on &mdash;I think they would be pretty harmless but I do not know as I am not an expert on these things.  I wonder whether the House knows really very much about it and whether it would not be better if a matter of this kind were considered by a body of experts. I do not know where you could get the experts on this matter but I imagine a few people could be picked who would have a pretty good knowledge of conditions.</P>

After all, we belong, to a degree, to the same kind of profession and we should not try to put our colleagues out of business.  At least we ought to hear what they have to say.  I am sure the Minister will make every endeavour to hear their viewpoint, at least.</P>

      <P>I do not agree with this Bill.  My idea is that if a man, woman or child wants to gamble they should be allowed to gamble; we should not prevent them and, if we try <Col N="114" /> to, they will.  Then we are merely dragging it underground.  I prefer to see these little gambles at the seaside and in buildings here and there in Dublin and throughout the country going on as they are going on.  I think the reason why this Bill is being brought before this House is on account of pongo and slot-machines. Several Deputies mentioned horses and dogs and the attitude was that we can go and bet whatever we like on them but that we want all these restrictions on pongo and slot-machines.</P>
      <P>It has been stated that the horse-breeding industry is a great industry and that the breeding of greyhounds is a great industry.  I am a keen race-goer.  I had some good greyhounds in my time and I hope to have some good ones again. However, I have never got the same enjoyment out of racing or out of the dogs as I got when I was a boy and went out through the fields to see the showman arriving and then went to his show that night and gambled at his roulette table, and so forth.  So much has been said about pongo and slot-machines in this country as to put the showman under a cloud.  The majority of showmen in the business at the present time belong to families that have been in the business for generations. If they were the cheats that some people think they are, or that this Bill would make them out to be, they would not have lasted in the business for more than a couple of years.  I have here a communication which I received only to-day from the showmen and on it I see names that have become household words in this country.  I see the names of decent, good-living, reputable people and generations of our people have dealt with them.  They brighten the lives of the people of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should not like to see any restriction on pongo.  The playing of pongo is a social event in the country districts. People like to come to town and play pongo for 1d., 2d. or 3d. a turn.  There is no need for anybody in this House to put a restriction on it when the people's pockets impose the restriction for them.  I might say here that the most beautiful church in <Col N="115" /> the diocese I come from was built out of receipts from carnivals&mdash;and we hope to build more.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I moved to report progress I was trying to deal with the problem of the undeveloped areas, and I was pointing out that the Undeveloped Areas Act did not reach far enough to solve completely the problem of bringing industry to the undeveloped areas on the western seaboard. The reasons are very obvious. In the smaller towns and backward areas the necessary capital is not available for investment in local industry and the incentive, no matter how great it may be, does not find the necessary local initiative to see that the necessary finance is forthcoming for local industry.  Before the position develops much farther the Minister should consider the question of establishing State-sponsored industries in those areas.  His predecessor made it amply clear when the Undeveloped Areas Bill was going through the House that if it had not the desired effect he could easily foresee a situation where the Government would have to take steps to see that industry was sponsored in certain areas.</P>
      <P>The congested areas come under various Departments and for that reason some co-ordination is absolutely essential if there is to be a concerted effort made to create new industries or to develop those which already exist along the western seaboard and in the Gaeltacht areas.  There is the Department of Fisheries, the Department of Lands and a number of other Departments whose efforts must be co-ordinated if further progress is to be made in that direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that respect we in our time had a Parliamentary Secretary to the Government who was active in the co-ordination of the various Departments which are interested in the development of industry in the Gaeltacht and congested areas.  I would urge the Minister to see that the Parliamentary <Col N="116" /> Secretary to the Government would act in a similar capacity now or, if the present Parliamentary Secretary, who exists in name only, is not to undertake that important task, that the work be assigned to some other Minister or Parliamentary Secretary who will undertake the co-ordination of the various Departments in so far as their work relates to the development of industry in the congested areas.  The Fisheries Section, State sponsored organisations such as Bord na Móna, the E.S.B. and An Bord Iascaigh Mhara and the Land Commission and the Department of Industry and Commerce all have their finger to some extent in the pie so far as industries in the Gaeltacht and on the western seaboard are concerned.  If we are not to have a separate Ministry, we believe it is essential to have a Parliamentary Secretary to the Government, who will exist in practice and not merely in name, for the purpose of co-ordinating those important services. Unless the Government have thrown in the towel and have decided to give up the fight to stop the flow of emigration and the depopulating of those areas, unless they consider it is not worth while trying any longer to keep people in those areas, they should take serious notice of the position.</P>
    <P>Deputy Giles deplored the fact that people were being drawn from the land to work in industries in the towns.  We would not quibble as to which towns they worked in if they worked in Irish towns.  We realise that there is not sufficient employment on the land and that the entire family cannot remain on a small holding for the rest of their days, that if there are ten in family at least eight must find employment elsewhere. If they cannot find it in the towns in industries of one kind or another they have to emigrate. It is ridiculous for a Deputy like Deputy Giles to suggest that they should be prevented from going to industries in the towns and should be allowed to remain available as cheap labour to work on the land.</P>
    <P>We think industrial development is moving far too slowly.  It could not move fast enough so far as the problem of depopulation is concerned.  But, <Col N="117" /> while we shall not quibble as to whether they work in Dublin, Cork, Galway or some Irish town, we would prefer to see industries established in the immediate vicinity, in villages in the Gaeltacht and undeveloped areas. It is that problem which we would like the Minister to tackle seriously.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the same opinion is held by other Deputies but I think the day is fast approaching when the small town will disappear in some areas.  In the small town or village the weekly market day has disappeared and with it much of the traffic that used to come into the town or village. The result is that the grocer is forced out with his shop on wheels.  The mobile shop is the order of the day. One grocer sets out with his van to bring his shop to the people when the people will not come to him and his neighbour must do the same if he is to compete.  The shop is brought to the door of the man-in-the-country and the people need not come to the towns and those in the villages and towns who depended on the traffic which came in from the hinterland find themselves deprived of business with the result that the town is fast fading out.  It is essential to have healthy and prosperous villages and towns if we are to have a prosperous rural area.  One is essential to the other, one is indispensable to the other.</P>
    <P>The position as it exists at the moment is just a case of &ldquo;as nothing succeeds like success, nothing fails like failure.&rdquo;  The competition between the travelling shops is tending towards diverting further traffic from the towns and villages with the result that there is a complete lack of employment and the villages and smaller towns are being left in some cases with little or no business except that which those who can afford to compete on wheels can do by bringing out their wares to the rural areas.  That is a serious problem which somebody must tackle before very long.  I suppose the grocer in a village feels he has a right to bring his provisions along the roads of the rural areas to his customers' doors. His rival in the same village feels that if he is to exist in trade he must do the same and the village is being deprived <Col N="118" /> of the traffic day by day.  The people who would come into the village ordinarily to support the different types of trade do not come any more.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is any legislation yet that would permit the publican to go into the country with his wares, but mind you he would feel like doing it at the moment if he could only get the necessary permission to do so.  He is suffering as a result of being deprived of the traffic which the market day of old brought to the town or village.  The weekly shopping day which the housewife spent in the town when she came in her horse and cart or in her ass and cart or, better still, in her motor car, is over.  It has become no longer necessary because the provisions are brought to her door. It is a serious situation for those towns to which the surplus farm labour could move in order to take such jobs as apprentices, assistants in shops and so forth.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister seriously to consider the co-ordinating of the different Departments for the purpose of solving this problem.  The different Departments should coordinate in sponsoring industries to support these towns.  The appointment of some person by the Government to undertake that work of co-ordination is something which the Minister should consider.  If he is not to have a Minister responsible for the Gaeltacht he should at least have an active Parliamentary Secretary who would coordinate all the Departments concerned in providing an industry for these areas.  I would appeal to him seriously to consider this.</P>
    <P>Those of us who live on the western seaboard do not find any serious efforts being made to maintain the increasing population which these areas would have if the people were not compelled to seek employment elsewhere.  Deputy Giles deplored the necessity for these people to go into industries in Dublin and other cities but if they do not find employment in those cities they should at least find it in their own villages. The only alternative is that they cross the Channel and find employment in England or in some of the industrial <Col N="119" /> towns abroad where higher wages exist.</P>
    <P>I do not want to hold up the House much longer but I should like to say something about this question of An Tóstal which has been discussed by most speakers here.  My opinion and hope when An Tóstal was first organised was that it eventually would become an occasion for reunion among our peoples scattered in different corners of the earth&mdash;Ireland at Home. I believe that if the purpose for which it was organised were strictly pursued&mdash; and I believe we are slipping from that purpose which we displayed in the first year of An Tóstal&mdash;it would become an occasion for reunion among our exiles who are yet the best tourists we can have.  If the spirit of rivalry which existed in most of our areas in the first year were properly maintained and persisted in, our people abroad would soon find it a suitable occasion on which to take their holidays at home and renew that spirit of friendship and comradeship which is completely lacking since they left home.</P>
    <P>Nobody who experienced anything of the spirit of reunion which exists on the occasion of St. Patrick's Night in New York would fail to realise in some way the importance of having a reunion at home of all our exiles.  If they thought others were coming at the same time and that enjoyable functions were being organised to celebrate their coming, thousands would make it the occasion of a visit to their native land in order to renew the spirit of friendship and homely feeling which they have not experienced since they said good-bye to their neighbours and friends.</P>
    <P>I think that if we could revive the spirit of An Tóstal on those lines it would become the success visualised when it was first organised.  Tourists from other countries will come to spend their holiday here during the peak of the season, but if we succeeded in developing An Tóstal along the lines of Ireland at Home we would also succeed in attracting these tourists at that particular time and we would then be serving the dual purpose <Col N="120" /> which was visualised by those who organised that festival.  I think the Minister should appeal to Bord Fáilte and the other tourist organisations, in spite of criticism, to maintain the spirit of An Tóstal and persist along the lines of its initial year until the festival has passed its teething stage, which will not be for a long time to come.</P>
    <P>If An Tóstal had passed that stage I think it would be bound to become an outstanding success and that it would run itself efficiently.  Somebody has said that An Tóstal was not worth the trouble, but I think that if it had never attracted anybody from outside, the initial effort did a wonderful lot of good in so far as it improved the appearance of our towns and villages and set our people doing something to improve their homes.</P>
    <P>There is a third aspect of a successfully established An Tóstal which is no less important than the other ones.  I feel sure that the Minister will consider it on those lines and try to maintain the objects for which An Tóstal was organised in the first instance.  I believe there is yet time to recapture the spirit and the hopes of those who set about making that festival a success, the type of festival visualised by those who inaugurated it.</P>
    <P>I have nothing further to say except to endorse what previous speakers have said about tourism.  In short, I think the main argument boils down to the improvement of our roads, not merely our main roads but also our second- and third-class roads.  These are not the responsibility of the local authorities.  They may never be, but they should be repaired systematically and a good deal more attention should be paid to them particularly in the tourist centres.  Vehicular traffic is absolutely essential even for those who wish to travel within a small radius of their headquarters.  I endorse what other speakers have said with regard to the importance of spending more money on these roads and paying more attention to their repair and maintenance. Roads are one of the first essentials required by the tourist, particularly in the seaside resorts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is inevitable in this debate that there should be repetition. In view of the importance of the matters that come under the Minister's control repetition is necessary in order to emphasise matters of particular importance and I would like to comment, first of all, on one of the aspects raised by Deputy Brennan.</P>
      <P>What is the policy of this Government with regard to the development of the western areas?  Since 1948 we have had various efforts made by successive Governments to remedy the emigration problem and solve unemployment in these areas.  With all due respect to the Governments concerned, they were merely tinkering with the problems.  The latest effort to bring industrial development to the West was the setting up of An Foras Tionscal. I challenge contradiction when I say that little or no progress has been made by that particular body.  If we examine the work of An Foras Tionscal with regard to a fall in the unemployment figures, the establishment of more factories and the reduction of emigration, we can only come to the conclusion that it has been a failure.</P>
      <P>There is one thing always trotted out here; we must go slowly; we must creep before we walk.  This country has never got up off its knees for the last 30 years.  As far as the people in the West are concerned, they have no illusions that this, or any other Government in the near future, will come to their rescue.  There was a motion debated here in the name of Deputy Maguire and in my name, and the views of certain members were disclosed. Some speakers made no bones about it: emigration was one of the means by which unemployment could be solved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that Deputy Lemass, then Minister for Industry and Commerce, really believed that certain sections of the Undeveloped Areas Act, if implemented, would bring great benefit to towns and villages in the West of Ireland.  The idea was to entice industrialists to the more neglected areas.  I emphasise the word &ldquo;entice&rdquo;. The idea was to offer an inducement so that industries would be established <Col N="122" /> in places like Galway, Sligo, Donegal, West Cork, Kerry, Clare and so forth. The House commended the Minister for his efforts at the time.</P>
    <P>What do we find?  When this particular section came under the scrutiny of the Department there was no question of giving an inducement to an industrialist to go to the West of Ireland: the industrialist had to prove that he would be at a loss if he went to the West of Ireland.  What was passed here was reversed in its interpretation once it left this Chamber. If any Deputy doubts what I am saying I shall be only too glad to accompany him to the offices of An Foras Tionscal and go over there some of the projects which have been submitted time and time again by those interested in getting industries into the small towns in the West.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is responsible for departmental decisions.  The Deputy cannot discuss or criticise officials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am criticising the Minister for allowing this position to obtain.  I know that his predecessor in office was dissatisfied with that interpretation and intended to take the necessary steps to ensure that the spirit of the act, as adumbrated by this House, would be properly interpreted. Of course, if any useful or major industry comes into this country there is little talk about siting that industry in the undeveloped areas.  Immediately the question arises of the right of the individual and people are only too delighted to allow it into Dublin.</P>
      <P>There is one point we should all bear in mind.  The City and County of Dublin have 30 representatives here.  The West of Ireland sends 25 Deputies. There is the explanation why more industrial development takes place in Dublin than anywhere else.  It is only natural that every Deputy should try to get industrial projects for his own constituency.  Time has proved that Dublin directs everything of importance as far as the country is concerned.  We had to begin with the Tolka River in order to get compensation for unfortunate farmers along the Shannon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="123" /> The present Minister will need great determination to resist the pressure that will be brought to bear on him in connection with the siting of different industries.  I believe he has the ability to do a good job in his Department. I also believe that his road is a pretty hard one but I hope he will not take what I have to say in this debate in a sense of personal criticism.  The feeling of impatience that I have had for many years has made me feel very frustrated and I know that many of the younger men, among the people who sent me into this House originally in 1948, have left this country in utter disgust in the intervening years.</P>
    <P>The Minister will have to get a dynamic policy if he is to make any impression on the minds of the people who live in the undeveloped areas. There is a mental condition which has to be changed, and that will be as hard to deal with as physical conditions because the feeling of hopelessness is there and the belief that all Parties are the same, that all Parties will promise the sun, moon and stars and that afterwards little is done.  That feeling is there, deep in the hearts of the people in the western areas.</P>
    <P>I do not think we should be frightened by the idea of having State interference or greater State aid given in the West.  Many of our most useful industries to-day are under the control of the State or semi-State bodies and if we compare the position of Foras Tionscal and the position that obtains even in the Six Counties, we can see how much more attractive the conditions are in the Six Counties for industrial development than they are in the West of Ireland.  The authorities there and the British authorities are prepared to go to the extent of erecting factories and renting factories to industrial concerns in the Six Counties. Instead of that you have the mentality displayed here with regard to this portion of Ireland that the industrial people have to prove a loss if they are to get the substantial aid which is necessary for them going into the West of Ireland.  I will not say any more at this stage on that particular matter of the neglect of the West of Ireland.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="124" /> There is another point, and here I welcome the new outlook that has been displayed in connection with what can be one of our most important industries in the future, that is the distilling industry.  I want to congratulate the Minister for the interest he has taken in seeing that a blended whiskey is produced here.  It is premature at this stage to say much about the project. I want to emphasise that the distilling industry depends on the land and everything in connection with the finished product, whiskey, comes from and is made within the country.  I would not like to think that for the sake of obtaining a rather attractive market in the near future we would take any steps that might damage our long-term prospects.  I understand that in connection with this blended whiskey there is an intention to import portion of the blend from outside this State. I understand that the Revenue Commissioners have consulted with the distillers on the question of changing the interpretation of Irish whiskey to include a product from the Six Counties.  I think that we have sufficient pot-still whiskey here and sufficient skill to produce the blend without going outside our own jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to understand that there will be a strong objection on the part of people outside this House, and I certainly will take every possible opportunity to object in this House, if I find that a decision has been made or is about to be made to import a pot-still whiskey into this country to be utilised in the final blend.  I do not care what proportion of it may be used, whether it is .1 per cent. or anything else.  I want to make it clear if we can import pot-still whiskey from outside the Twenty-Six County area, it is just as easy to import it from Scotland as from the Six Counties.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be taken as objecting to co-operating with the Six Counties in this matter.  I would prefer that we had the Six Counties in with us and that we could all work as a unit then, but as it stands there is nothing to prevent whiskey outside the 32 Counties being brought into the Six <Col N="125" /> Counties and sent down here then as an alleged Irish product.  I shall not go any deeper into it at the moment, but I want to sound that warning to the Minister that I personally hope that no decision has been taken or will be taken to bring in portion of this blend.  God knows there is no shortage of the commodity here in the country at the present time, and the facilities are available to carry out further distillation if it is considered desirable.  It would be a tragic thing in the beginning to get off on the wrong foot with something that can be and I believe probably will be in the future our second greatest industry outside the cattle trade.</P>
    <P>In his opening statement the Minister referred to the working of the E.S.B., and in his speech he referred to a sum of £84,000 which was provided in the Estimates for 1954-55 for the repayment of advances for rural electrification and said that it is intended in the future that the E.S.B. will meet the costs of this development from its own resources.</P>
    <P>I think it is agreed by all Parties and individuals in this House that rural electrification is possibly the most important development that has come in rural Ireland since freedom was achieved in this part of the country.  I do not think this House or the people outside it would tolerate for a moment the suggestion that there should be a slow-down on the development of rural electrification. I do not think we should be satisfied even with the actual rate of progress itself.  We should never be satisfied on anything like that if there is a chance to increase the progress or to increase the number of areas that will be brought in each year.</P>
    <P>I do not like that move in connection with the £84,000.  It is all right to say the E.S.B. is a flourishing concern.  No excuse must be given to them to slack or to slow down.  I think rural Deputies will agree with me when I say it is almost unbelievable the change in outlook that is brought about where the rural electrification service has been provided. It is one of our few hopes for <Col N="126" /> the future as far as the rural areas are concerned.</P>
    <P>There is a hesitancy in certain localities in regard to the acceptance of this service and the present rate of progress, good as some Deputies think it is, could be stepped up if the E.S.B. were willing to go into an area without waiting for this high percentage of acceptance.  Somebody mentioned here to-day that nothing succeeds like success.  If the E.S.B. went in in areas with 10 to 15 per cent. less acceptance, once the people saw their neighbours accepting this service there would be a rush on their parts to accept it.</P>
    <P>There are, of course, several snags arising from day to day in connection with that service.  One of the snags&mdash;and it is a hardship on many people&mdash;is where you have pockets, small areas, which do not actually fit into the mapped-out sections for rural electrification.  Consequently, an extra service charge has to be imposed on the people who live in those pocket areas outside.  It is an unfortunate position for these people that just because they are unlucky enough to live half a mile or three-quarters of a mile away from the end of the area where the service is being supplied, they must pay a very heavy charge to get the service.</P>
    <P>Under the Constitution we are all equal and entitled to the same benefits. There is no enticement or encouragement to these people to take the service, and very often the families concerned are poor people who can ill afford the extra charge.  I see no reason why that sum of £84,000, or a similar sum, could not be used as a fund to subsidise the extra service charge imposed on those people who live in those outside areas.  This is a matter that has been discussed time and again in this House and I find in that respect that as each year passes nothing is being done to meet the hardship that is imposed on these unfortunate people.</P>
    <P>One other point I would like to mention in connection with the E.S.B. is a slight criticism, if you like.  They have gone in in a big way for the sale of electrical equipment, and I am glad <Col N="127" /> to see a sales organisation established in the E.S.B. in the same way as we have a sales organisation set up now in Bord na Móna that will supply turf to people's houses.  I find that the E.S.B. are acting as agents to sell many items of equipment that are imported. I have no objection in the world to the E.S.B. selling what they manufacture here, or what is manufactured here, but if we allow the E.S.B. to act as agents for the importation of many of the utensils and much of the equipment that is being used in houses, we are going to encourage them to put off the day when they will manufacture these things themselves.</P>
    <P>I think the E.S.B.'s sales organisation should be more or less confined to the sales of whatever is produced in Ireland, and that they certainly should not set the example of acting as import agents when they should be taking all possible steps to establish a situation here whereby those items they import would be manufactured in Ireland.  As long as they are allowed to continue that, the temptation is there to think little about opening factories or industrial establishments here for the production of this equipment and household requirements.</P>
    <P>Let me refer now to An Tóstal.  Last year An Bord Fáilte or Fógra Fáilte&mdash; I do not know which; I can never make up my mind who is running this business at all &mdash; advertised the Tóstal extensively in the daily Press.  In their advertising campaign they drew attention to what was happening in Dublin.  In other words, they were asking all Ireland to come up to Dublin, and at the same time we had the same wise people asking provincial towns to run Tóstal in the country.  I am informed that this Dublin Tóstal Council had to pack up because there was no money made available by the Dublin business people.  It is not my affair to criticise the Dublin business people&mdash;they know their business far better than I know it&mdash;but although they found it was not a wise proposition to keep this Dublin Tóstal going, they found, at any rate, that they will still get publicity for Dublin at the expense of the rural areas because <Col N="128" /> either An Bord Fáilte or Fógra Fáilte will now have to bear the full cost of publicity for the Dublin Tóstal where normally this should be borne by the Dublin citizens and the Dublin business people who are going to make the biggest profit out of it.  Instead of that, this House has placed funds at the disposal of An Bord Fáilte and Fógra Fáilte.</P>
    <P>Money that has been raised in taxation on people in rural areas as well as on people in Dublin is now about to be devoted to the benefit of the Dublin people.  I have no objection in the world to Dublin getting everything it can, but I think the Dublin businessmen were wise when they wound up the Dublin Tóstal and got, instead, An Bord Fáilte to carry the cost of what the Dublin Tóstal should be carrying, thus placing the burden not alone on the citizens of Dublin but also on the people of rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>I want to deal now with something that I do not think has been raised in this House yet.  I am sure a lot of worthy Deputies will think I should have my head examined or that I should not be in this House for making this suggestion.  Most Deputies are aware of the statement made by a very prominent Irishman that there is a great danger of Ireland becoming a crannóg perched in solitary aloofness in the Atlantic.  I am inclined to agree with that viewpoint except for the fact that we have so many emigrants and we still have some contact on that basis.  However, I feel myself that we are gradually losing touch with the tremendous developments that are taking place in the world outside us. For centuries we have been held down in this country, bound in chains, by alien oppressors.  Those were the oppressors who faced our people with bullets, who destroyed our forests and who crushed our industries, such as they were.  The day of that oppressor has gone.  The chains of bondage have been smashed&mdash;at least they have been smashed in the Twenty-Six Counties&mdash; and we now have the privilege of government by our own elected representatives.</P>
    <P>On the question of the revival of the industries which were crushed and on <Col N="129" /> the question of the establishment of new industries, I can only say that commendable efforts have been made in that regard over the past 30 years by different Governments&mdash;commendable when you take into consideration some of the great difficulties which they have had to face.  However, 30 years have elapsed and I think that to-day we lag far behind other countries of our size, far behind other countries with less than our mineral resources.  We have the excuse that we are severly handicapped by lack of power and lack of suitable raw materials to get a great industrial drive under way.  Whether we like it or not, we are at least 100 years behind the British to-day in industrial development.</P>
    <P>Britain achieved her high place in the industrial sphere mainly, I believe, because she had coal deposits.  She had the means of creating power and energy.  The power, the energy which is so necessary for industrial development is, to a small degree, being provided here in Ireland by our hydro-electric development schemes and, to a still lesser extent, by our recent development of our peat resources but we still depend to a very large extent on the importation of fuel from abroad to create or develop energy and we shall be depending on it for many years to come.  Nobody in his senses will, I hope, suggest that the power given by our hydro-electric schemes and the power that is got from our bogs will be sufficient to meet the industrial development which we all visualise should take place.  It behoves us, therefore, to look for an alternative source of power and energy.  While we jog along here, content with the progress of Bord na Móna and the E.S.B., while we are content at least once a year to pat those companies on the back for being able to show a profit or for being able at long last to show that they are no longer in need of subsidies&mdash;while we are content to allow our development to move along slowly&mdash;other countries are going ahead by leaps and bounds.</P>
    <P>In spite of what I should describe as her still very large coal deposits, Britain has decided to go ahead with <Col N="130" /> plans for the development of nuclear power.  She is going ahead with plans for the development of nuclear power on a breath-taking scale.  In my view, we should give serious consideration to the thought that if Britain can jump still further ahead of us in the next few years by her utilisation of nuclear power then Ireland is doomed to failure for all time because the already overwhelming weight of British industrial capacity will smother her completely. It is quite evident to anybody who has taken the trouble to read the papers that Britain is going all-out on an inspiring programme of harnessing nuclear power so that, in the near future, she will reach new heights of industrial development and will once more become&mdash;in her own mind, at any rate&mdash;the leader of the nations which are at the moment highly skilled in industry.  She intends to go ahead with this development herself and, at the same time, continue to export her coal to nations such as Ireland, retaining to herself the benefits to be derived from the development of nuclear power.  I believe we are living in a new era and we should march into it eagerly and courageously, resolved to put our own nation on top.</P>
    <P>I was listening recently to a B.B.C. news item in which it was reported that Nehru announced recently to the Indian National Assembly that by the end of next year India will have two nuclear reactors.  This will be carried out in India without the benefit of British scientists, without their aid and without money from Britain.  If India, which so recently achieved its freedom, can have courage to go ahead with schemes like this, why cannot we, whose history resembles that of India so much, emulate her example?  As I have said, we are like India in many ways in our political history.  We are also like India in the fact that we have no resources of coal or means of creating energy.  We are both in the same boat in that regard, but India seized the opportunity to close the gap between herself and more fortunate nations.</P>
    <P>India is not the only country that will take advantage of this new era. <Col N="131" /> Other countries have alerted themselves to the wonderful possibilities that lie ahead.  Practically every country in Europe is making plans at present for the installation of nuclear power reactors.  I believe this Government should give immediate attention to the startling developments which have taken place in recent years in respect to nuclear power for peaceful purposes.  A timid, cautious approach now will be a cause of regret in years to come.</P>
    <P>America has proved herself a great friend to us in the past.  We should approach the American Government for technical assistance, and financial help, if necessary, in order to go ahead with the construction of one nuclear power station or reactor.</P>
    <P>This nation has always shown that its intentions are peaceful.  We have set an example to other nations by adopting a strict attitude of neutrality in the past.  We have deplored wars and have shown our peaceful intentions. Some people will say that we could not do anything else, that, if we were as strong as the big nations, probably we would be just as greedy as they have proved themselves to be. I do not believe that.  I believe that the Irish people could never turn into what we have very close to us, men who would go to extremes to build an empire.  I believe that the Irish people have a very charitable outlook and would be anything but oppressors of their neighbours or of those who would ask them for help.</P>
    <P>In one way it is sad to think that this wonderful means of developing power has been discovered as a result of the recent terrible war.  Possibly, we can look on it in this way that out of evil cometh good.  We should not lag behind.  We should set our mind to the future and play our part, however small, in setting an example by the utilisation of this splendid new source of power for peaceful means and for peaceful uses alone.</P>

      <P>There are a few matters with which I wish to deal on this Estimate.  I regret that matters <Col N="132" /> important to counties are made political pawns.  I allude to the position as regards Cork airport.  I have heard every Cork Deputy speaking here on the subject of an airport for Cork.  I would like to take this back a few years.  I say that the responsibility for the fact that there is not an airport in Cork lies with the parish pump minds of the Cork Deputies.  Experts from the Minister's Department went down to Cork County a few years ago to select a suitable site for an airport.  They selected two sites, one at a place called Farmer's Cross and another at Midleton.  This State went to the trouble of sending experts from the Meteorological Department to Cork during the course of a period of two or three years.  A report was furnished to the Department as a result of that investigation and, as the then Minister stated in the House, Farmer's Cross was ruled out due to the prevalence of fog.  That was the position four years ago.  Then the question of a site for an airport in Cork was turned into a political gamble and has continued as a political gamble ever since.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is wrong with a Department which, having expended public money on sending experts to Cork for two or three years for meteorological observations and getting back a decision from them, ignores that decision and goes nosing around looking to see into which area the political plum can best be thrown to produce results? And nothing is done.  I heard six or seven Deputies speaking one after the other looking for this airport in Cork. I may be the only Deputy to speak here from the area chosen by the Department as the site for that airport, but I consider that one man with a good case is worth ten men with bad cases and I am demanding from the Minister that the recommendations of his Department be now put into force and that the airport be established in Midleton without any further delay.  I can see no justification for the manoeuvring that is going on in the Minister's Department in connection with this.  I asked a question here of the Minister's predecessor some two years <Col N="133" /> ago.  He told me a couple of thousand pounds had been spent on his gentlemen who went down there to make those observations.</P>
    <P>If public money is being expended in an examination as between two sites and a decision is arrived at that one site is useless on account of fog but that the other is all right, the next thing the people expect is some action, some decision, some work.  In regard to this airport, and on behalf of my constituents in East Cork, I am demanding that action now.  If the Minister is aware of any further investigations carried on since, I want to know why they were carried out and I want to know the amount of public money expended on those investigations.  This is taxpayers' money we are talking about.  Every penny of public money spent on sending those officials from the Department to poke around the holes and corners of Cork to find out which site would be the more suitable is taxpayers' money, and the public are entitled to know, when the investigation is completed and the Minister announces the result, how that money was spent.  On behalf of my constituents here to-night I am demanding that action be taken and let there be no more about it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Giles talked here to-night about the herd and the man and the dog, and I feel sure Deputy Giles now realises that he is tied to the Party with the herd and the man and the dog.</P>

      <P>Deputy Giles spoke for a long time to-night about the unfortunate farmer.  I wonder does Deputy Giles recall the statement made by his Minister on the 23rd March in his introduction to this Estimate, as reported at column 519, Vol. 149 of the Official Report, as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Taking into account the Supplementary Estimate for 1954-55, the reduction in the food subsidies for the year 1955-56 amounts to £1,053,000. As explained by the Minister for Finance, when presenting the Vote <Col N="134" /> on Account for 1955-56, the decrease in the food subsidies arises from the reduced prices for home-grown wheat which have been fixed by the Government.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>So that from those people whom Deputy Giles represents here the Minister claims he is extracting the sum of £1,053,000.  And he goes further than that because while he tells them they will have cheaper wheat he tells them something else also as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Another factor contributing to the reduction is that it is anticipated that the flour millers will obtain increased receipts from the sales of flour offals.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In plain language you get less for your wheat and pay more for your bran and pollard and then you are going to produce cheap bacon.  That is the statement made here by the Minister.  The price of foreign pollard to-day is in the region of £26 a ton.  It is a little more than a lot of the farmers got for their wheat.</P>
    <P>If the Minister's policy is proceeded with, the farmers will be well advised to keep the whole wheat, dry it themselves and feed it to their pigs rather than sell it to the mills and buy back the skin for more than they get for the whole wheat.  That will pay them better than buying the milo maize muck which the Minister for Agriculture announced to-day will cost £20 per ton.  Of course, anything is good enough for the Irish farmer now. Deputy Giles complained to-day that the land is going back to the herd and the dog; he must realise that this is the Government of the herd, the dog and the bullock, to say nothing of unemployment on the land.</P>

      <P>I suggest to the Minister that he has a duty in this respect.  He has a duty to Labour.  He has a duty to the workers who are looking for employment in Haulbowline.  I want to ensure that that duty is carried out. Surely it is within the Minister's power to tell this industry, which was ready to go into the production of sheet steel last May, when the Government was changed, to go ahead this May.  Twelve months is long enough for the new Government to go on its honeymoon.  Men are waiting for work.  When will the Minister give it to them?  We hear appeals from all <Col N="138" /> quarters in this House in relation to providing employment.  We are looking for work for our own men.  We are endeavouring to find employment for them, any kind of employment, which will prevent them leaving our shores. The Minister need only go down to the Library and take the trouble that I took and he will find that over £2,000,000 worth of tinplate comes into the country each year.  It is many a year&mdash;it was in 1939&mdash;since portions of that tinplate mill were landed at Haulbowline. I am asking the Minister seriously to get to work on this problem and to get his Department to work on it and for Heaven's sake to make his mind up about it.  That is a simple thing.  If the Minister gives the word to-morrow there will be a couple of hundred men working there in a fortnight, and within 12 to 18 months the full 1,300 will be working, producing the £2,000,000 worth of tinplate that should be, but is not, produced in this country.</P>
      <P>The Minister knows what happened during the emergency?  Does not the Minister know that every tin can that John Bull sent over to this country had to go back full or, if it did not, you would not get another tin can?  Is not this the time that we should be moving ahead?  Is not this the period during which preparations should be made for whatever is coming in this world?  Does the Minister not know that but for Deputy Lemass establishing that industry in 1939 there would be no iron to shoe a horse in this country during the emergency period? The Minister has a breathing-space now &mdash; is he going to take advantage of it or is he going to turn back along the line of the old policy and put the matter in abeyance?</P>
      <P>Those are the matters that I am interested in, and in which I have reason to be interested.  I asked the Minister to-day about certain charges that are being made by Cork Harbour Commissioners &mdash; charges that were sanctioned by his Department, and I am not concerned what Government was there, or who sanctioned them. You have 2/9?d. charged per ton for rock phosphate coming into Cork as against 1/4 in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="139" /> I went to the trouble of going back to the time when I was negotiating for that industry and what did I find?  In December, 1950, when I was carrying out negotiations with the company to start an artificial manure factory in Cobh and came up here with my case, the Minister did nothing.  Mark you, the case was a strong one.  The case was that under the offer of the Cork Harbour Commissioners they would collect £24,750 in harbour dues on 180,000 tons of rock phosphate.  We read a lot about decentralisation and the reasons for it, but all that gentleman would have to do was to start his factory in Dublin instead of Cork and he would save £12,750, the difference in harbour dues between Cork and Dublin.  We lost the industry on account of that.  This gentleman put it to me as a business man and said: &ldquo;Do you think I can make that much profit that I can afford to pay £12,750 more to the Cork Harbour Commissioners than I would pay to the Dublin Harbour Board?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>People wonder, as Deputy McQuillan here to-night wondered, why these industries are not decentralised.  These are some of the reasons&mdash;because the old man of the sea established in Cork Harbour has his tentacles out like an octopus grabbing and seeking all he can devour.</P>

      <P>I suggest the Minister has every responsibility.  It is all very well to sit back and say: &ldquo;I have no responsibility,&rdquo; and the Government washes its paws like Pontius Pilate.  I heard Deputy McQuillan here to-night on the same thing, complaining of the interpretation that was put on certain clauses in an Act under which the West suffered.  I say to the Minister <Col N="140" /> that it was the responsibility of the Minister in 1950 to be in here on the following week with a Bill to remedy that condition of affairs.  Does the Minister not think that the time of this House would be better occupied with that than with what was under discussion for two hours here this evening, the Gaming Bill?  That is something that would mean employment in this country for Irish people.  Yet the Minister says he has no responsibility.</P>

      <P>The Minister has responsibility while he is sitting there, and will have to live up to it whether he likes it or not.  He will have to face up to the position of affairs that exists. The Minister is responsible, as the Minister for Finance stated, for a sum of £400,000 that was given for the development of Cork Harbour and which under false pretences, is being spent on the quays of Cork City, 14 miles from the inner bounds of the harbour above on the River Lee.  Does the Minister realise that responsibility?  He was responsible for the giving of the money. The distance from the inner boundary of the harbour, which is at Monkstown, to where this money is expended is 14 miles up the River Lee. And the Minister is quite satisfied.</P>
      <P>Within the next few months the men will be working in the oil refinery in Aghada.  Does the Minister realise that the main source of workers for that refinery will be from Passage and Cobh?  Does the Minister realise that the only landing place available to them at Aghada has a big notice up in front of it from the Harbour Board: &ldquo;This pier is dangerous&rdquo; and that of the 24 steps up to it from the water's edge there are only two standing? And the Minister is not responsible. I think if somebody said that he had no sense of responsibility he would be nearer the mark.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="141" /> How the money is expended is again a matter for the Cork Harbour Commissioners. Deputy Corry is asking the House to believe that the Cork Harbour Commissioners are, to use his own language, fraudulently expending money for another purpose. I think that charge ought not to be allowed to pass unchallenged in the House where the Cork Harbour Commissioners have no representation.  If Deputy Corry has a quarrel with the Cork Harbour Commissioners, he ought to have his quarrel on the spot where those whose honesty and integrity are being impugned will have an opportunity of replying.  It is not fair that this House should be used for the purpose of blackguarding them as they are being blackguarded now.</P>

      <P>The Minister has already stated that he has no responsibility in this matter. In this House the Minister's word has always been accepted when a statement of that kind has been made and, in the circumstances, I cannot see how the Deputy can continue to debate this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to doubt the Minister's word at all.  I suggest to the Minister that he was responsible for handing over £400,000; in reply to my question to-day I was told that £360,000 was to be spent on the turntable in the quays of Cork and the remaining £70,000 was to be spent in the extension of Tivoli.  Before the Dáil adjourned I asked the Minister if he would tell me what were the outer and inner boundaries of Cork harbour. He was kind enough to inform me of the authorities where I would find my information.  Did the Minister examine those authorities before he gave £360,000 for the development of a harbour with the knowledge that the money was not being spent within that harbour?  That is my case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hold that within the next few months the Minister will have an opportunity of at least partially remedying that condition of affairs, the condition of affairs under which members of an authority in this country come along, sit there and when the manager says: &ldquo;There is very serious <Col N="142" /> extra expenditure here and I will have to put extra dues on something to meet that expenditure,&rdquo; the first member of the board says: &ldquo;You are not going to put it on my coal&rdquo;; the next member says: &ldquo;You are not going to put it on my wheat&rdquo;, and so on, and all that is left to tax is the fellow who is not there.  You have no representative of the largest industry in the country there; there is no representative of the farmer there.  That is what I am complaining of to the Minister, and he has an opportunity within the next couple of months of remedying that condition of affairs, of seeing that there will be representatives of the harbour on the Cork Harbour Board and not representatives of the River Lee.</P>
    <P>These are the things which in my opinion are very gravely responsible for the fact that there are no industries in the Cobh area.  The industry of which I spoke would give employment to at least 100 men, that is, the artificial manure industry that was driven out by the action of those authorities.  You have a worse position still.  The reply I got on that occasion was that the money had to be found somewhere to run the harbour. Is the Minister aware that one shipping company alone gets a reduction of over £2,000 a year in dues from that harbour board and that every time that company has a ship to be repaired it is sent over to the Continent or to John Bull though Rushebrooke Dockyard is there and workers are there looking for work?</P>
    <P>What action is the Minister going to take about that?  Surely he has the same authority over the Cork Harbour Board that the Minister for Local Government has over a county council and surely when matters of that description are brought to his notice, it is his duty to have them investigated? It is only last year that proposals for the dredging of Cork Harbour, to enable liners to come into the inner harbour and the removal of what is known as the Pinnacle Rock, were put up to the Minister's Department for the sum of £75,000.  The Minister's Department offered £50,000 and the work was not done.  Why was not some of the £400,000 devoted to <Col N="143" /> that so as to enable liners to come into the inner harbour?  Surely that would be a more appropriate place to spend that money than spending it above on the quays of the River Lee?</P>
    <P>I do not know what action the Minister is going to take but I promise the Minister one thing&mdash;and it might be a lead to Deputy McQuillan and other Deputies&mdash;that if he does not bring in an amending Bill then I will and I will flog them into that Lobby on one side or the other.  These are the serious matters affecting the principal town in my constituency. When the Minister was there I was anxious to show him the town pier and to draw his attention to its condition. The extraordinary thing was that, though everybody who ever went over to Irish Steel, Ltd., left from the town pier, the Minister did not leave from the town pier: they took good care to shuffle him away from the town pier when he was coming and when he was going.  He landed at another pier.  As I have already said, 700 men use that pier every day.  In his reply to-day the Minister told me that extensive repairs were carried out to it.  It has been converted into a boat slip.  Does the Minister know what that means? That is where 700 men have to go out on to the launch at 12 o'clock in the night and the return shift coming off at 1.30 a.m. have to come back there in the middle of the night&mdash;and £360,000 is being devoted to the development of Cork harbour above at the quays of Cork City.</P>

I think they are hastening slowly backwards&mdash;backwards. I should like to congratulate the Minister on one thing and I am glad that I have one thing on which I can congratulate him.  I refer to his trip down the Shannon and the activity of C.I.E. in putting a boat on the Shannon for cruising. I am glad to see that development. I wonder if I could induce the Minister to come with me next Sunday and take a ramble up the Blackwater? I can assure him that when he would see the beauties of the Blackwater he would say that the Shannon is not a patch on it&mdash;and we would get rid of that famous bridge down there and perhaps he could induce C.I.E. to put a pleasure boat upon the Blackwater.  There were pleasure boats and yachts there before.  In fact, the Duke of Devonshire cut a special canal up into Lismore, which the Minister's colleague is now blocking with a new bridge.</P>

    <P>Efforts were made by the Minister's Department to get some firm to take it, but they were not successful.  I now make a suggestion to the Minister in that regard.  Whether or not he will help me I do not know, but I make this suggestion in all earnestness. I suggest to the Minister that he should now hand those oil-bunkering facilities over to Irish Steel, Limited.  The brains that brought Irish Steel, Limited, from a bankrupt concern to a commercial success could also make a commercial success of the oil-bunkering.  I put that suggestion now to the Minister for what it is worth.  If he takes my advice, at least he will have something there: he can say &ldquo;I did it&rdquo;.  The day I met the Minister he was down opening <Col N="145" /> a corrugated-iron shop his predecessor had fixed up.  I do not like to see that at all.  I should like the Minister to have some head-stone so that when he is gone we can say: &ldquo;Norton did that&rdquo;.</P>

The position there at the moment is something like what one would expect to see at a backward African port.  Is it not time that things were taken in hand and an improvement effected?  Instead of spending that £70,000 on the Tivoli reclamation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to intervene in this debate only very briefly in connection with one particular body which is administered by the Minister, namely, an Foras Tionscal, which was established under the Undeveloped Areas Act, 1952.  The Undeveloped Areas Act was passed in 1952 with a great flourish of trumpets and at that time in the debates in the Dáil we heard all sorts of pronouncements from well-meaning Deputies, the Minister who introduced the Bill and all Parties in the Dáil, that the Bill was designed to improve and encourage industrial development in those areas on the western seaboard and elsewhere where year after year there was mass emigration either seasonal or permanent. After three years it is time we asked ourselves what has been done under this Act and in what manner the board&mdash;An Foras Tionscal &mdash;to which, we might say, the administration of the Act was entrusted has served the purpose for which it was set up.</P>
      <P>I see from Section 3 that the Act was intended to apply and does apply to the congested areas and to any other area to which, by order of the Minister, the Act is for the time being declared to apply.  The congested areas as specified in the Act, as we would know even if the Act had not designated them, are the Counties of Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim, Roscommon, Mayo, Galway and Kerry and there are a few other areas mentioned also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some time ago when a Deputy asked the Minister if he would state in respect of one of these counties, which is the second largest county in Ireland, the number and the total amount of the grants made each year under the Undeveloped Areas Act, 1952, since it came into operation the Minister had to reply that in the year ended 31st March, 1953, two grants amounting to £26,000 were approved for projects in that county; that in the year ended 31st March, 1954, one grant of £50,000 was approved; that in the 11 months ended 28th February, 1955, two grants amounting to £36,000 had been approved.  He added a very significant <Col N="147" /> sentence to his reply: &ldquo;No payment has yet been made in respect of these grants&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Where are we getting?  We passed an Act in 1952 entitled the Undeveloped Areas Act and we told the people of these areas that we would develop the areas.  We encouraged them into believing and thinking that we would give every encouragement to private enterprise, assistance and help of every nature, and the fact is that, three years afterwards, not one penny piece has been paid to the biggest county on that western seaboard.  I think the Act was passed purely for propaganda purposes.  It has not been implemented in so far as that county and the other counties are concerned. I make an earnest appeal to the Minister for Industry and Commerce to-night to make it his business to see that the Act is implemented to the extent to which it was intended it should be implemented when it was passed by this House.  I do not think there is any point whatever in passing Acts of Parliament if they are passed merely for the glorification of the Party or Government for the time being and if they are not implemented.</P>
    <P>I shall make a rather scathing comment on the body which was set up under that Act to encourage industry in undeveloped areas&mdash;An Foras Tionscal. I had personal experience of being associated with a group of private individuals who were prepared to start an industry in the West of Ireland and to put their private capital into it.  Before they came near the Government or the Department of Industry and Commerce or An Foras Tionscal they went to that excellent body, the Industrial Development Authority That Authority deserves a tribute for the encouragement and help its members give to prospective industrialists. With the assistance they received from the Industrial Development Authority and on their own initiative the group to which I refer inquired into the prospects of the success of an industry and, having got all the information and having gone to tremendous trouble to get the facts, <Col N="148" /> they presented their case to An Foras Tionscal.</P>
    <P>I have personal knowledge of the fact that from the first time they presented their case they were discouraged; they received no assistance, no encouragement.  I am inclined to think that the reason for the discouragement was that An Foras Tionscal considered that that particular industry would compete with an industry which had been established elsewhere in the country and might affect the profits of the particular industry which had been established. The industry which had previously been established was established where all industries, apparently, are established in this country with a view to minimising risk, that is, in the city of Dublin or the surrounding area.  The particular body to which I refer pointed out to An Foras Tionscal and to the Government that they could produce commodities for the entire west of Ireland and for the entire area which it was intended to serve at a cost at least 25 per cent. cheaper than industry elsewhere could produce it.  The particular commodities concerned were connected with building, farm buildings, if you like, roofing materials, flooring materials and various other things.  And the members of this body were able to produce evidence that if they were given assistance they would produce all these materials for the people in the western counties at least 25 per cent. cheaper than these people can buy them to-day.</P>
    <P>If we are sincere in our efforts to reduce the cost of things and in our attempts to encourage development, particularly in the undeveloped areas, surely that prime factor&mdash;a reduction of more than 25 per cent. in cost of materials for bridge building, for out-office building, for everything that hundreds of thousands of farmers in the west could have delivered to them at 25 per cent. less than they could get it from the vested interest which had a monopoly up to this&mdash;should count, with the object of encouraging the promotion of industry in the West of Ireland?</P>
    <P>The fact is that it was altogether <Col N="149" /> refused any assistance.  I do not know whether that is an isolated case, but I do not think that it is because I have read somewhere at some time that there were up to 190 or more applications for assistance for industries or proposed industries in the undeveloped areas, and I have also read somewhere that less than 1 or 2 or 3 per cent. have met with any success from An Foras Tionscal.  I do not know what it is costing to maintain this Foras Tionscal.  I do not know what staff is maintained, but I read the Minister's reply to a question by a Deputy in the House in relation to one county&mdash; the second biggest county in Ireland&mdash; about the amount of assistance An Foras Tionscal had recommended in respect of industry in that county in three years.</P>
    <P>The information given shows either a complete lack of desire to help these undeveloped areas or a complete lack of interest in the development of these counties because nobody will tell me that a sum amounting to £26,000 in 1953, £50,000 in 1954 and £36,000 in the following year is sufficient to encourage industry in the furthermost county from the metropolis.  I do not think I could accept that as being correct.  The amount of assistance given is infinitesimal and could not possibly assist industry.</P>
    <P>I have given an instance of a case in which I know the promoters of an industry were not assisted or encouraged. These particular promoters stated to An Foras Tionscal that if they did not get assistance they would start the very same industry within 40 miles of Dublin where they would not need their assistance.  Naturally they would not need the assistance if they began the industry near Dublin because the question arises of freight charges down to the West of Ireland and various other factors affecting the risks of promoting industries in that county.</P>
    <P>These factors were not taken into consideration at all as far as I can see. It does appear that as a result of the attitude of An Foras Tionscal these promoters have left an area in which they had all the raw materials at hand. They are now contemplating going <Col N="150" /> into an area already over-populated and over-industrialised.  I am suggesting seriously to the Minister that he should look into all the facts of this case and all the matters that come within the domain of An Foras Tionscal. If they think they have not got the power under the present Act&mdash;the Undeveloped Areas Act of 1952&mdash;to make advances to a company contemplating setting up in the West of Ireland, the Minister should consider ways and means of providing such power.  If a proposed new company is regarded as being in competition with an older company which had got assistance from either the Industrial Development Authority, or the Minister, or An Foras Tionscal or some other Government-sponsored body, and if the Minister thought assistance should be continued to this older established company as against the proposed company, the Minister should consider if he is ever going to encourage or promote industry to the stage envisaged by this Act.</P>
    <P>Proposed new industries with raw materials at hand should be given every encouragement to go ahead. You could have one company on the eastern coast which had been established for several years and which, with the Government assistance, had been making profits for some time, and another newer industry established on the West coast, manufacturing the same commodity but it would be 25 per cent. to 33? per cent. cheaper than a firm which had a monopoly in the area could supply it at.  It is a tragic thing to say that the farmers on the west coast have to purchase their building materials from an industry manned and maintained in the most densely populated area in this country &mdash; Dublin &mdash;and I think it is a poor tribute to the encouragement of industry under this Undeveloped Areas Act of 1952 to say that when an industry was mooted in an area where all the raw materials were available in the West of Ireland no encouragement was given to the promoters, even though they pointed out that they would produce the commodity at 25 per cent. less than the established company.</P>
    <P>We are entitled all over the country <Col N="151" /> to expect that a commodity should be produced at a reasonable profit on competitive lines.  And what is happening? The Department of Industry and Commerce, as far as one can gather, make a grant to the promoters of an industry, that industry is established, and as far as one can see, once it is established with Government assistance, for ever afterwards it is protected.  No other body can compete with it with Government aid. The obvious corollary to that statement and the obvious deduction to be drawn from it is that the particular industry will thrive; it will expand. In what direction will it expand?  It will expand in an already over-populated area, in and around the City of Dublin.  Nevertheless, we pass what we call an Undeveloped Areas Act and the Government, having passed that Act, subsequently state they cannot assist in establishing industry in this undeveloped area because there already exists in a highly developed area an industry with which the proposed new industry would compete, an industry which would be forced to reduce its prices if a competitor were allowed to set up.  I ask the Minister if that is not a fact.</P>
    <P>If anybody wants any proof as to the truth of what I am saying he has only to ask himself what has the Department of Industry and Commerce done or what has the body established under the Undeveloped Areas Act done since its inception to encourage and foster the growth and development of industry in the West of Ireland?  It will be found that a couple of industries have been encouraged not particularly large and not giving any substantial employment. In the county to which I have referred not a pound note has yet been paid. Grants have been made, but nothing has yet been paid though three years have elapsed.</P>
    <P>A few small industries have been encouraged, but very little has been done to develop the undeveloped areas.  One particular industry which has been established may possibly grow into a very much bigger industry in the years to come.  It has been <Col N="152" /> our experience that one has to produce something novel to the Department and to the board; one of the tests of one's sincerity in obtaining a grant from An Foras Tionscal is that what one intends to produce must be absolutely new.  It must not be something which might compete with any other industry.  The excuse given is that promoters who might compete with private enterprise cannot be subsidised; it would be unfair to subsidise them in order that they might compete with private enterprise.</P>
    <P>I think it would be better to forget about this Act altogether.  I do not think there are any commodities of which advantage would be taken in the undeveloped areas in which the element of possible competition would not arise; it might only be 5 per cent. or 10 per cent., but it would be bound either in its ancillary or main production to compete in some way with already existing industries.  If we take a strict interpretation of the Act, what purpose does it serve then? I suggest to the Minister that the interpretation of the Act should be far more broadminded than it is at present.  Otherwise, the whole force and effect of the Act will be lost.  If the Act is to have any beneficial effect it will have to be interpreted on a much more broadminded basis than it has been up to the present.</P>
    <P>No assistance has been given under the Act up to the present.  Now, some years ago an industry started in my own town.  The first sod was turned and the building commenced long before the Undeveloped Areas Act came into operation.  Here I would like to pay tribute to the Minister for Agriculture in the last inter-Party Government for being instrumental in having that industry established where it is to-day.  Now, the particular factory was not completed until after the passing of the Undeveloped Areas Act. We were treated to the spectacle then of Government Ministers coming down for the opening ceremony and telling the misguided public that this factory represented the first fruits of the Undeveloped Areas Act.  Not one penny piece of Government money was advanced towards the erection of that <Col N="153" /> factory.  Is it our intention to be honest in our political and public lives?</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to implement the Act to its fullest extent.  An Foras Tionscal should be so instructed. Alternatively, I suggest that An Foras Tionscal should be abolished, or reconstructed, and the Act forgotten about.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with a good deal of what the last speaker has said about An Foras Tionscal.  Two authorities have been set up in this State. One was set up to deal with industry in the country generally, namely, the Industrial Development Authority, and the other was charged with the special obligation of serving that part of the country described under the Act as the undeveloped areas.  The last speaker has said that that body has not been a shining success in bringing industries to these areas.  References have been made as to what the Minister should do.  As I understand the position, it is not what the Minister should do but what private enterprise should do with the help that is available under the Act.  On whom is the obligation placed?  Thereby hangs the tale.  Is it upon the Minister or is it upon private enterprise?  I take it that all Parties here so far pin their faith on private enterprise in the matter of industrialisation, with the exception, of course, of large projects like the production of electricity, turf, sugar and so forth.  For all the rest we rely upon private enterprise.  That is a wise decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An Foras Tionscal was established on that basis.  Private enterprise need not necessarily be located inside the undeveloped areas.  Private enterprise inside the country or private enterprise coming in from outside &mdash; our exiles returning with their money or technical skill and knowledge to start an industry or re-establish an old one&mdash; can be equally effective and these people know that under the Act they will get all the assistance possible.  In the aggregate, I think it is in the neighbourhood of fifty-fifty; I understand they can get half the establishment costs and, having received that, <Col N="154" /> the industry remains their own private venture.</P>
    <P>The last speaker has pointed out the defects and in the main his criticism both in its tone and content has been well-intentioned.  He has not, however, suggested in what direction the Minister should go or in what respect he should amend or alter the present situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Breen</NameTxt>
      <P>I put down some questions to the Minister for Industry and Commerce about the position at our airports and I will deal with No. 12 first.  I asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether in the selection of personnel for Shannon and Dublin airports special consideration is given to persons who served in the British Forces in Ireland from 1916 to 1921, and if so, to what extent.  The Minister replied that the answer was in the negative and I want the Minister to realise that this is not a personal matter between the Minister and myself or between the Government of the day and myself.  I know that the Minister is wrongly informed when he tells me the answer is in the negative. I know that at both Shannon and Collinstown there are certain men in control who would not employ any other only men who served the enemy of this country from 1916 to 1921 and they make no bones about stating it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to give a guarantee if it is possible for him to do so to certain employees both in Shannon and Collinstown.  I would not risk being in the positions of those men even if the Minister did give me a guarantee that those people would not be penalised, and when they are employed at Shannon and at Dublin, the only reason that they are employed <Col N="155" /> is that they were members of the R.A.F.  The man who told them that was no less a person than Captain Saul who told them: &ldquo;Remember, it is only because you are a product of the R.A.F. that you are getting this job.  The Irish are a lazy and a useless lot.&rdquo;  It is a poor bird that soils its own nest and it is a poor Irishman who comments to such an extent on other Irishmen.  When we have to go outside this country and get men because they served against this country from 1916 to 1921 to run our airports and make a living in this country &mdash; well, then, why should we hold commemorations for 1916?</P>
    <P>I will now deal with the other question. I asked the Minister if he would tell me the regulations and by-laws in force after May, 1954, in the Dublin and Shannon Airports relating to the admission of visitors meeting and seeing off friends and relatives and whether special consideration is given to certain classes of people; and if so, if he would indicate the process in question and state what provisions were in force for dealing with members of the Oireachtas.  I hold&mdash;the Minister may not agree with me&mdash;that members of the Oireachtas are entitled to go into any State or semi-State-controlled industry or place in this country.  The Minister may not agree with me on that, but I hold that when a man is elected to this House and when he comes in here with all the responsibilities of a Deputy he should not be treated as I was treated when I went out to Collinstown and when an employee of Aer Lingus told me he would throw me out because through some oversight on my part 1 overstepped a boundary.</P>
    <P>I never asked for any privileges in this country; I never got any, but I do not think it is fitting that a civil servant in the employment of this State should be in a position to tell me that he would throw me out.  No man was ever yet born that would throw me out of any place, old and all as I am.  I want no privileges from this Government or any other Government that will come here, but when that stuff is dealt out to me <Col N="156" /> what must be the treatment given to ordinary citizens of this country?  I made inquiries afterwards and I found that the orders were given from the top to have me insulted.  I was seeing away a boy I raised, a boy I will never see again, and through some oversight on my part I was walking along and did not observe a boundary that I should have observed, but it was no way to treat me.  It was not that the official did not know me because he called me by name and told me that he would throw me out and would get help to throw me out. Of course he did not throw me out, and no one, while I have breath in me, will throw me anywhere, although I may be getting on in years.</P>
    <P>I raised this matter here because I think it is a shocking thing that men elected to this House are treated in such a manner.  I have been in airports in most parts of the world and I was treated with respect because I was a Deputy.  Surely a Deputy should be treated with equal respect in his own airport.  If a Deputy will not conduct himself at the airport this House can deal with him.  I am asking the Minister to think over the matter and not to let it be said that rules and regulations governing this and that are applicable to Deputies of this House.</P>

      <P>I was in Cobh recently seeing off a relative on the liner, <i>America,</i> and I returned by Shannon Airport and visited the airport as an ordinary individual with a few friends. I remember some time ago that on the approach road to the airport there was a hut where you were halted and you <Col N="157" /> had to pay a nominal fee.  On this occasion&mdash;it was Holy Thursday when I was returning&mdash;as I approached the hut there was another car being checked-on there and when I went to park my car I was challenged by the official in charge and he asked me how I entered the place.  I told him politely that I went round by the hut and just parked my car.  He was rather abusive and insulting but at no time did I divulge who I was.  He demanded the fee of 2/-, I think it was, which I paid but I left the airport without anybody knowing who I was except just myself and my friends.</P>
      <P>I want to make myself clear that I would not like anybody to be received there as I was.  The official just took it for granted that I was just somebody that came along, but as an ordinary citizen I resented that treatment. It would give a bad impression to anybody.  He charged me with failing to observe certain rules that I was to pull up there.  I did not know I should pull up at this particular point.  I am not comparing my case with Deputy Breen's.  He is a man with a great national record and I certainly do not want to put myself on the same plane as Deputy Breen or set myself up as doing anything like Deputy Breen has done in his time; I would never be able to do so for that matter, but I think it creates a very bad impression that even the ordinary citizen should be treated in such a discourteous way and the Minister should take steps to prevent this.  Let me say that I am not complaining in my own case as a member of the Dáil but I take this opportunity of mentioning it.</P>

      <P>I think every Party in this House will see at once that Deputy Dan Breen occupies a unique position not merely as a Deputy of the House but in the esteem and affection of all members of this House.  That goes irrespective of his political views because in his own personality and in his own sufferings for this country he has epitomised the struggle of a nation for its freedom.  I am quite certain I speak for every member of the House, <Col N="158" /> those on the Opposition Benches as well as those on the Government Benches, in expressing regret that Deputy Breen should have been treated in any discourteous way on the occasion of his visit to Dublin Airport.</P>
      <P>This incident happened many months ago and when Deputy Breen wrote to me on the matter, obviously very annoyed, I asked him to come and see me so that I might have the matter investigated and appropriate atonement made.  Deputy Breen said then that he did not blame me in any way for the incident and made allegations that it was people who did not like his political views who were mainly responsible for this incident, directed, he alleged, against himself.  At the same time he wrote to the chairman of Aer Lingus.  I discussed the matter with the chairman and asked him to have the whole situation investigated.  The chairman had the whole matter investigated and I was subsequently informed that he tendered an apology to Deputy Breen for the incident that morning and expressed regret that it should have occurred.  I think in doing that the chairman of Aer Lingus went as far as, in the circumstances, one would reasonably expect him to go.</P>

      <P>I understand the position was explained to Deputy Breen that the particular official had instructions. The instructions were that all persons, whether they were Deputies or not, with the exception, I think, of diplomats, Ministers and members of the Hierarchy, were not permitted to go into the inwards or outwards customs halls.  That was the instruction which the person had.  In interpreting an instruction of that kind the person was apparently unduly rigid and inflexible&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielBreen" hpid="Mr. Breen Mr. Breen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Breen</NameTxt>
      <P>And insulting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;when he was dealing with such a well-known member of the Oireachtas as Deputy Breen.  That is the kind of thing that happens from time to time when people get instructions to carry out.  Sometimes they interpret them in a way that leaves much ground for complaint as to the manner in which they carry out their duties.  I understand that the chairman pointed out to Deputy Breen that this person was bound by particular instructions that were issued to him but they were not interpreted by him in a flexible kind of way, with the result that the incident of which Deputy Breen complains took place.  I said to Deputy Breen I was sorry that such a distinguished member of the Oireachtas, or indeed any member of the Oireachtas or any citizen, should have been treated in any way that left even the slightest ground for feeling that discourtesy was intended, because, after all, it is a national airline and people employed by a national airline are expected to give good service to the whole community which they serve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Breen's questions, however, travel outside the scope of the particular incident with which he was concerned that morning.  The position is that at the airports, both Dublin and Shannon, there are two broad categories of staff employed by the Minister <Col N="160" /> for Industry and Commerce.  The bulk of them, of course, were all recruited before I came to office.  I have nothing to do with the recruitment of staff.  One category is the general service and technical officers; the other is composed of subordinate grades.  The general service and technical officers have been recruited through the Civil Service Commissioners. No preference is given in the relevant competitions to persons who have had service in the British Forces. Incidentally, the chairman of the Civil Service Commission is the Ceann Comhairle of this House.  The usual concessions to members of the Irish Defence Forces given in the Civil Service Commissioners' competitions apply.</P>
    <P>In respect of those persons recruited to the subordinate grades who are employed at Shannon only, for example, airport security officers, cleaners, messengers, drivers, etc., they are recruited departmentally mainly by advertisement of vacancies in the Press and through local employment exchanges. Consideration is not given to service in the British Forces in filling these posts but Irish Army service is considered in the same way as for Civil Service Commissioners' competitions.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce is not responsible for the recruitment of the large block of staff employed by the catering manager at Shannon Airport.  The catering manager states that in selecting staff no special consideration is given to persons who served in the British Forces. The Minister is not responsible for the recruitment of staff employed by Aer Rianta in the management of Dublin Airport, but I understand from the personnel section of the company that in selecting personnel no special consideration is given to persons who have served in the British Forces.</P>
    <P>I think Deputy Breen and the House may take these statements as authentic. They represent the actual position so far as the recruitment of staff is concerned.  I had nothing to do with the recruitment of a single member of the staff at any of the airports.  This represents the facts and it is well the facts should be stated even in connection <Col N="161" /> with an incident of this kind.  I do not think there remains anything further for me to add except to say I share with the rest of the House regret that Deputy Breen should have been treated in this way.  If I thought Deputy Breen desired to pursue the matter further after I last spoke to him I would have suggested that he might come and discuss the matter with me to see if it could be considered in a wider context.  If that is the desire of the House I certainly will undertake to see that it is further considered.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister ascertain the number of pilots in the Irish service who are still on the British R.A.F. Reserve and, in the recent promotions, the number of Irish <Col N="162" /> Army pilots who were promoted as against the R.A.F. pilots?</P>

      <P>That is true, but I would remind the Deputy that it is not an all-Irish Company.  It is not an all-Irish Company because the Fianna Fáil Government set it up as a British and Irish Company in which 40 per cent.  of the capital is British and 60 per cent. of the capital is Irish. Do not try and pin that on my back.  The British directors are there, thanks to the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
