      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state the number of new industrial projects which (a) have been initiated since June, 1954, (b) have started production since June, 1954, and (c) it is anticipated will start production in the course of 1956.</P>

      <P>The number of industrial proposals which have come to my notice in the period since 1st June, 1954, is 393.  The number of new industries and extensions to existing undertakings which came to my notice as having commenced production in the same period is 144.  There may of course, be others of which there is no official record to date.</P>
      <P>As regards (c) of the question, experience shows that proposals go through many stages between the points of initiation and production, and I think it would be unwise to attempt to forecast the figure asked for by the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the supplementary question of Deputy Walsh, I imagine the question put down by Deputy O'Reilly arises out of a statement by Deputy Walsh which was featured in the <i>Irish Press</i> of the 21st November that the milk staff was cut from 23 to two.  I understand that it was suggested by Deputy Walsh in a statement made by him in public that a few days after he had left office, substantial reductions had been made of the character described.  In fact, when he left office there were 13 persons working on this and immediately afterwards there were 12 persons.  In July, there were 12 persons working on it and there are now at this present moment 12 persons working on the staff of this Costings Commission. Recently the director asked us for <Col N="1077" /> further clerical assistance and it was made available to him at once.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Has there been any change in the number of experts working on the Milk Costings Commission, or was there any change made in the number working on the Costings Commission from the 2nd June until the 2nd July 1954&mdash;the experts I am talking about?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>All I know is that on the 2nd June, 1954, we had one agricultural inspector, six temporary costings officials, two drainage and reclamation supervisors (unestablished), and four temporary farm buildings supervisors. That was on the 2nd June, 1954.  On the 2nd July, 1954, we had one agricultural inspector, five temporary costings officers, two drainage and reclamation supervisors and four temporary farm buildings supervisors.  The staff at present employed&mdash;that is, as of to-day&mdash;24th November, 1955&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy was guilty of a mental aberration on a public platform, which I am trying to correct as charitably as may be.  The staff at present is one agricultural inspector, two temporary costings officers, one drainage and reclamation supervisor, four farm buildings supervisors and four clerical officers.  That is all I have been asked for; and, any staff I have been asked for, I have provided.  But that is a far different story from the suggestion that the staff was 23 on the day Deputy Walsh left office and was reduced, a month later, to two.  I attribute that suggestion to no more evil intention on the part of Deputy Walsh than that he suffered a mental aberration on a public platform&mdash;it could happen to a bishop&mdash;but, thereafter, if Deputy Walsh were a sensible man, he would say he was sorry for his mistake and not try to brazen it out when it is demonstrated to him that he made a slight mistake.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I possibly will make a double effort to brazen it out.  Arising out of the Minister's statement, is it true that it has taken 12 men over <Col N="1078" /> two years to compile the figures taken from 140 farms?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy set up the Costings Commission.  I have not interfered with its operations, good, bad or indifferent, except to provide it with whatever staff it asked me to provide.  But I have the greatest sympathy with the Deputy.  He was launching out into the West Limerick by-election and doing the best he could for the Party.  He put his foot in it and all I ask him is: Let him not put his foot in his own mouth now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, he stated that recently he had been asked for an increase in staff; his answer was that the staff is now 12 as against 12 some date back in 1954.  What number was he asked for recently, and on what date, to bring the staff up to the 12, the 1954 figure, that it is now back to?  What had it fallen to before he was asked for the staff and how many did he supply immediately on demand?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Corish) Brendan Corish">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Corish)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Social Welfare (Temporary Provisions) Bill, 1955, which is now before the Dáil for Second Reading, is the Bill required to implement the promise made to recipients of old age and blind pensions, widows' (non-contributory) pensions and long-duration disability benefit that an extra week's payment of pension or benefit would be made to them in December.</P>
      <P>The object of this additional payment is, as Deputies are aware, to provide the persons concerned with a lump sum payment approximately equal to the extra cost of tea to them for one year following on the recent increase in price of that commodity.</P>
      <P>It is not proposed to double the pension or benefit where persons are resident outside the State, and only one extra payment will be made to a person such as a blind pensioner who is also in receipt of long-term disability benefit.</P>
      <P>Those who will benefit as a result of this Bill are:&mdash;160,000 old age pensioners, 6,000 blind pensioners, 28,000 widows, and 25,000 recipients of long-duration disability benefit, a total in all of 219,000 persons.  The cost of the additional payment to these 219,000 persons is estimated at a sum of £253,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The additional payment to old age and blind pensioners and to widows in receipt of non-contributory pensions will be made on Friday, the 23rd December.  The extra payment to persons in receipt of long-term disability benefit will be made during the week commencing on the 19th December.  It has been difficult to make all the arrangements necessary in the short time available, but the difficulties have been overcome and I am glad to say that the additional <Col N="1081" /> money should be in the hands of all the recipients before Christmas.</P>
    <P>I feel confident that this Bill will recommend itself to Deputies of all Parties, and ask for its early passage in order that the additional payments may be made before Christmas.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom díospóireacht a dhéanamh ar an mBille seo.  Dúirt an Tánaiste le dhéanaí go raibh an Rialtas chun 6d.  a thabairt gach seachtain do gach sean phinsinéar sa Stáit.  Ba mhaith liom a fháil amach ón Aire an bhfuil aon difríocht á déanamh idir na sean-phinsineirí atá ag fháil 6/6 in aghaidh na seachtaine agus na daoine atá ag fháil 10/-, 12/6, 15/- agus £1 in aghaidh na seachtaine. Má tá, ní reítiónn sé leis an méid a dúirt an Tánaiste, eadhon gur de bharr an mhéadú i gcostas an tae a bhí an soláthrathas seo á dhéanamh ag an Rialtas.  Fé mar a leím-se an Bille gheobhaidh gach pinsinéar méadú do réir méid an phinsiúin atá aca cheana agus, mar sin, go bhfaghaidh a lán de na daoine méadú 2d., 3d., 4d., nó 5d. i n-aghaidh na seachtaine.</P>
      <P>Sé an rud céanna é maidir leis na baintreacha agus na díleachtaí agus na daoine eile a luaitear san mBille.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to know from the Minister, has he segregated the different cadres of people in receipt of old age pensions, namely, the people who are receiving 6/6 per week, 10/- per week, 12/6 per week, 15/- per week and £1 per week.  That does not seem to correspond with the statement by the Tánaiste that provision was being made by the Government, because of the increase in the cost of living and the increase in the cost of tea of 6d. per week or £1 6s. per year.  As I read the Bill, each category of pensioners will get a sum corresponding to the amount they are in receipt of at the moment and there will, therefore, be an increase of 2d. a week, 3d. a week, 4d. a week and 5d. per week in a big number of these cases.  The same applies to the widows and orphans and to the other people included in the Bill.  In the case of disability, the person must be in receipt of disability for 51 weeks.  This is a very ungenerous <Col N="1082" /> approach and it is not one upon which the Government can applaud itself.</P>
    <P>These facts should be made known. The Minister stated that the total number of pensioners is 219,000.  We should like very much to be told, when he is replying, the different categories and how much each will get.  It is not much to boast about.  The measure is a Bill entitled:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;An Act to provide for the increase in certain cases, in respect of one week in the month of December, 1955, of pensions under the Old Age Pensions Acts, 1908 to 1955, pensions under the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Acts, 1935 to 1955, and disability benefit under the Social Welfare Act, 1952.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It provides for one year.  What are the Government's intentions in regard to this whole matter?  What will be their approach if there is a further rise in the cost of living in regard to all these social welfare matters?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I approach this Bill in practically the same manner as it was approached by Deputy Kennedy. When the matter of the increase in the cost of tea was discussed in the House, the question of those least well able to bear any further increases was taken into account.  The Tánaiste Indicated that the consumption of tea per head had reached a certain figure and that, therefore, the allowance of 6d. per week to the beneficiaries of social services would adequately cover the increase to them in the cost of tea by this Government action.</P>
      <P>First of all, this is a Bill limited to one year&mdash;1955 and 1955 only.  It is not a continuing Bill.  I take it that that is so.  I should like the Minister to make it clear whether it will continue or whether it will be reintroduced. As far as I can see from reading the Bill, it is a measure that is limited to a payment at the end of the year to all beneficiaries of a certain sum of money and it does not go beyond this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Kennedy asked the Minister for figures.  I am sure the Minister must have the figures for otherwise he <Col N="1083" /> could not have told us the estimated cost.  He says there are roughly 219,000 pensioners of all categories who will benefit by this Bill and the total cost is estimated to be £253,000.  I want to know how that cost was reached and whether it includes administration costs which I am sure it does.  What is the net figure that will accrue to the beneficiaries?  The cost cannot be very much.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I thought. There will only be a double payment for the particular week.  The means test is applied in the case of old age pensioners and some old age pensioners are drawing as little as 6/- per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well.  Those pensioners will get 9/- according to the Bill and not 24/-.  That is roughly about 2d. per week instead of the 6d. per week for the increased cost of tea. I am sure it is not claimed by the Government to-day that every pensioner is in receipt of a pension of not less than 24/- per week.  I should like the Minister to tell us the numbers getting 9/- per week, 10/- per week and so on up so that we can see whether, in fact, this measure will bring the relief to the people who can least bear the increase in cost.  It would have been far better in my opinion had the Minister followed the expressed statement of the Tánaiste.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Tánaiste indicated they had gone into the consumption of tea per head of the population and he reckoned that one-third of a lb. was the average weekly consumption of tea per head of the community.  I do not know whether he included in his <Col N="1084" /> calculation infants who drink milk. Even if we accept that figure as being the consumption per person per week, he argued that the present increase to these people would compensate them and would place no additional burden on them as a result of this increase. Is the Minister suggesting that I am making a mistake when I say that everybody understood that it was a 6d. a week gift to the pensioners for the purpose of meeting this cost?</P>
      <P>I am pointing out, as Deputy Kennedy did, that you have pensioners in various categories of income as low in some cases as 9/- a week.  These people will have their pensions on that particular increase doubled.  That is all the Bill gives them.  Therefore, they will have 9/- and not 24/-. Perhaps the Minister would give the figures which he must have; otherwise he could not have told us what it was going to cost if it had not been added up.  The House is entitled to a detailed analysis of the different categories of beneficiaries and the approximate numbers under each weekly payment.</P>

      <P>I cannot see why there should be any controversy regarding this measure.  It gives the House and the country evidence of the mindful interest that the Minister and the Government have in the people, mainly the weaker sections of the community, old age pensioners, widows and orphans and people in receipt of disability benefits.  I believe that this double payment during the Christmas week will be of great advantage to those people and will help them, as the Government intends it should, to have a brighter and a happier Christmas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only opposition to this measure put forward by Fianna Fáil is that a payment of 25/- or 26/- is not made to each old age pensioner who is in receipt of a pension.  Deputies Kennedy and Briscoe mentioned that, so far as some of these pensioners are concerned, the double payment will not amount to more than 9/- a week.  It must be borne in mind by Deputies Kennedy and Briscoe that a pensioner who is in receipt of a pension of 9/- a week has other means.  Were it not for the fact that his income is much <Col N="1085" /> higher than that of a pensioner in receipt of a pension of 24/- a week, his pension would not be reduced by 15/- weekly.</P>
    <P>I believe that the measure, as presented to the House, is quite reasonable and fair to all categories of pensioners having regard to the difference in their means.  It gives to the people with maximum benefits the maximum amount under the Bill and it gives to the people with lesser benefits a proportionate rate.  I cannot for the life of me see why there should be any opposition to this measure.</P>

      <P>Such a measure as this was long overdue and it was thoughtful of the Minister to bring it in.  It is the tradition in this country to send Christmas boxes to friends. That is borne out by the present Government who are sending these Christmas boxes along to the people who are in most need of them.  The gesture will indicate to these people that they have, in the Minister for Social Welfare and in the present Government, careful and considerate friends.  Deputy Kennedy is smirking but Fianna Fáil were in office for almost 20 years and not until we got a Labour Minister for Social Welfare was it ever thought of in this country to send a Christmas box to the aged and less fortunate section of our people.  Now I believe Fianna Fáil may be converted to the idea that it is only from the present Minister for Social Welfare and his associates in the Government that this type of thing would come forward.</P>

It was introduced by the Deputy's colleagues and it was to take a shilling off the old age pensioners. This will rank in the history of the nation for hundreds of years to come as the meanest Bill that ever was framed.  The days of Oliver Twist <Col N="1086" /> have long passed, but I never yet saw a social welfare measure introduced in this House by the Fianna Fáil Government but the Labour Party were up on their hind legs yelling and bawling for more, like Oliver Twist looking for more porridge.  They have changed their time since they got in with their new-found friends in the Fine Gael Party, who never yet were too generous.</P>

He told the House then that he was proposing to soften the blow on the old age pensioners and the widows&mdash;but not on the orphans, and this Bill makes no provision for them.  Orphans must not drink tea, according to the code of the Coalition Government, and they get nothing under this.  Their Mothers may get, according to the rate of pension they have, from 1½d. to 2½d. a week.  I would not be a bit wrong in repeating that this is the meanest Bill ever introduced here.  It is only 16 months since this Government asked for the support of the people to give better social welfare benefits and there was no question then of tea being increased in price under the Fianna Fáil Government led by Eamon de Valera.  It was said here a short time ago there was a gift of £1,000,000 to the tobacco manufacturers.</P>

      <P>I have never heard of any democratic Party or Government in the world&mdash;and democracy is a long time in existence and there have been many democratic Governments&mdash;as far as any records I have seen go, where a Bill was introduced to give 2½d. each to old age pensioners.  The present Minister for Social Welfare made this statement:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;No fair-minded person would say that the present benefits paid to old age pensioners, widows and orphans, and unemployed were sufficient to provide for the most modest requirements. Labour, therefore, proposed that those benefits be increased.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is the increase.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister had told the House that in the near future he proposed to increase those benefits, the House would accept this Bill and pass it quickly as the best that could be done now.  We would understand if he said that the financial stringency and strait-jacket that the Minister for Finance had erected around the Government did not allow more than 1½d. or 2d. a week to be given to the old age pensioners and widows, with nothing at all for orphans, although orphans may be up to 14 or 15 years of age, and most of them drink tea. This matter was mentioned first by the Tánaiste as being given to compensate those who drink tea, but what about all the other increases that have taken place in the last six weeks in the cost of living&mdash;in clothing, boots, food of all kinds?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everything has gone up.  Surely the 1½d. or 2½d. is not expected to compensate them for all those increases? We will know very soon that there are far greater increases than the increase in the price of tea.  I hope that the Minister will explain that in concluding his remarks on this paltry Bill. He and his Government recently had £1,000,000 to give to their friends the tobacco manufacturers in the same manner as Fianna Fáil had it.  They were advised by the Prices Advisory Body that they were entitled to get <Col N="1089" /> £1,000,000&mdash;so were the Fianna Fáil Government advised.  The present Minister severely criticised that and campaigned in the country against Fianna Fáil because of the way they were subsidising the millionaire tobacco manufacturers.  This Government, the Minister, Deputy O'Leary and the other Labour Party members quite recently remained mute as mice&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1943" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">

      <P>&ldquo;Its aim is to provide increased benefits and pensions, retirement pensions for men at 65 and women at 60, maternity benefits from £2 to £5 and an old age pension of 50/- a week.&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not wish to delay the House. Let the Minister make all the preparations he needs to make to hand out this great Christmas gift.  I am surprised that there was even one Labour Deputy in the House when the Minister announced it.  If the Minister <Col N="1090" /> had been honest with the House, we would have accepted that&mdash;that they were in straitened financial circumstances although the poor Minister for Finance was to give 50/- a week to the old age pensioners, so much to the widows and so much to the orphans. There is nothing for the orphans in this.  The Minister had better hurry up and give them this small amount. We hope that in our time in this House, whether it be long or short, we will never see such a mean Bill introduced, especially by a socialist Minister for Social Welfare.</P>

Having been so long supporting a Government which only a few years ago had butter at 4/2 a lb., he never said one word when the old age pensioners received only 1/6 of an increase through his Government.  But I know what is worrying Deputy Allen, Deputy Kennedy and the Fianna Fáil Party generally&mdash;the fact that this Bill has been introduced to give a double week's allowance to our old age pensioners. If that Bill were not introduced it would be great propaganda in the coming by-election.  No matter what Deputy Allen says, I think the old age pensioners welcome it.  In the short time since we came back to office and since the present Minister has been responsible for the Department of Social Welfare, it is the second increase to be given.  That is more than we can say of the Fianna Fáil Government led by the ex-Taoiseach, who is listening to me now and who led his Minister for Finance through-the 1952 Budget which brought all the destruction and brought prices to the high level they have reached to-day.

I am surprised that any Fianna Fáil member should stand up to criticise something that is being given to them for Christmas, because if a man gets 48/- in Christmas week that is surely better than 24/- which Fianna Fáil would be giving him.  There is no use in the Fianna Fáil Party making propaganda out of the old people.  We would like to see more given if the State could afford it.  I would like to see more than the 50/- for the old age pensioners.  I would like to see the old age pensioners brought up to the same level as the Six-County people. We hear a lot from the Ard-Fheis about Partition but, until the social welfare end of this State is brought in line with that of the North, we need not talk about that.  I know the Fianna Fáil Party are annoyed that this Bill was brought in.  Deputy Allen is not satisfied at all.  They would be delighted if there were nothing for the old age pensioners.  I am glad that there is something for the old people, the blind and the widows.  These are the people who need the help of a Government, whether it be inter-Party, Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil.  It is the duty of the Government to come to the aid of these people.

      <P>The Minister might be good enough to deal with these points when he comes to reply.  I <Col N="1094" /> want to know is this House to be faced with endless temporary provisions Bills in the near future?  It is not only tea that has gone up.  Why pick on tea? Has the cost of tea hit the poorer sections of the community hardest? What about coal and all other foodstuffs? It is such an important matter of policy that the Minister should deal with the question generally and let us know are we to expect further temporary provisions Bills in the near future to compensate the poorer sections for increases in other commodities.</P>
      <P>Deputy Murphy referred to the people who are in receipt of pensions as low as 9/-.  His argument was that the fact that they got only 9/- demonstrates that they have other income. The Deputy cannot argue that they do not drink the same amount of tea as those in receipt of higher pensions.  Is not that the point?  I cannot see the logic of his argument.</P>
      <P>This is not a question of propaganda, as was suggested by some Deputies. The House and the Minister will recall that when Deputy MacEntee, then Minister for Finance, introduced the Budget of 1953 the present Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture screamed across the House that it was a halfpenny Budget when Deputy MacEntee announced that he was taking a halfpenny off the loaf, which cost the State close on £1,000,000. The important point is that that halfpenny off the loaf was a permanent annual feature, not a temporary provision such as the Bill now before the House is.</P>
      <P>The Minister has said that the administrative cost in operating this Bill is negligible.  If that is the case, there may be nothing in the point that I was going to make, that it might be possible to give some type of voucher to the people mentioned in the Bill, if there would be any saving in their going to the tea merchants direct.  As the administrative costs will be small, I cannot see that there would be anything in that unless the Minister might like to consider it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether Deputy Murphy is coming down to West <Col N="1095" /> Limerick or not but I am sure he would be very welcome there.

      <P>It is very difficult to know what reply to give to the debate in view of the speeches that have been made.  I should like to deal with one of the points raised, in the first place, by Deputy Ó Cinnéide and secondly by Deputy Briscoe.  Both of them said that the Tánaiste, Deputy Norton, had promised that the increase for the classes mentioned in this Bill would be paid by way of 6d. per week.  I should like to read now what the Tánaiste said when he spoke in the House on 26th October&mdash;columns 75-76 of the Official Report, Volume 153, No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Government have been most anxious to see, therefore, what could be done, as evidence of their goodwill, of their sympathetic understanding of the difficulties of these people, as evidence of their desire to help them, to shelter them from the impact of this increase in the tea prices and they have decided that it will give to these persons, that is, to old age pensioners, widows, blind persons and long duration disability benefit recipients, a compensatory payment of their basic allowance in one single payment which will offset the additional cash cost...&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but just before that he said in the same column:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;We accept that as the average consumption in respect of that class in the community and we arrive at a situation in which for them the increase in the price of tea will represent <Col N="1096" /> an additional charge of 6d. per week approximately.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He said that before the statement which I have mentioned in the first place.  I trust that clears up that matter.</P>
    <P>This Bill has been described as mean and niggardly by certain Fianna Fáil Deputies but I should like to ask any Deputy or any Front Bench member of the Fianna Fáil Party in what year during their régime or since the inception of the State has as much been given to old age and blind pensioners and widows and orphans?  One can describe this particular measure taking it on its own as an increase of approximately 6d. per week but the record of this Government is second to none in their treatment of old age and blind pensioners and widows and orphans within such a short period. This increase, plus the increase given on the 29th July of this year, is akin to 3/- per week and at no time in the history of this State has such an increase been given to the people who are catered for in this Bill.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that Deputy Ó Cinnéide and Deputy Briscoe advocated that the 6d. per week should be paid as a weekly payment.  If the Government had decided on that it would have meant that these old age pensioners, these blind people, these widows and orphans, these people who are chronically ill would have received but 4/- up to Christmas week, as against what they are getting now, the majority of them, from 20/- to 24/- per week.</P>
    <P>Deputy Allen here has tried to infer to the public through the Press and through the radio that this Bill means that certain people will get from 1½d. &mdash;I think he went down as he spoke; he started off at 3½d.&mdash;to 2½d. or 4d. per week.  That is absolutely untrue, and the unfortunate thing about it is that Deputy Allen knows it.  He knew what was in the Bill, because he is intelligent enough to read.  The vast majority of these people are getting the maximum amount in double payment of the old age pension and the blind pension.  Out of a total of 165,923, 158,454 will get 24/-.</P>

      <P>Eight hundred and seven will get 7/6 a week.  There are approximately 25,000 at present in receipt of sickness and disability benefits.  These are deemed to be chronically ill and practically all of these will get the full benefit of this measure.  The net point of all this is that, while Deputy Allen says it is a mean Bill, it means £253,000.  The Bill introduced here in June and which had effect from the 29th July meant £1,250,000 per annum, so that, between the two, these people will receive £1,500,000 in extra benefits, and I challenge any Deputy to say whether or not anything like that was done during the régime of Fianna Fáil, or by any previous Government back to 1922.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other Deputies have said that this would not at all compensate for the increase in the cost of living.  I do not believe that the allowances being paid to these people are sufficient or <Col N="1098" /> adequate; I do not think anybody in the House would say they were adequate; but I do say that we have done this year more than has been done in any other single year.  It is amusing, therefore, to see such criticism when we realise that, in the Budget of 1952, 1/6 extra was given to compensate for the increased prices in tea, sugar, bread, butter, and so forth. We give 6d. a week extra now to compensate for the increase of 2/- in the price of tea.</P>

      <P>That it is expedient to authorise such payments out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas as are necessary to give effect to any Act of the present session to provide for the increase in certain cases, in respect of one week in the month of December, 1955, of pensions under the Old Age Pensions Acts, 1908 to 1955, pensions under the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Acts, 1935 to 1955, and disability benefit under the Social Welfare Act, 1952.</P>

      <P>On the Money Resolution, the Minister quoted Deputy Norton in a statement in the House on 26th October.  I shall quote from the same statement reported at column 75 of the same volume:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The Government have been most anxious to see, therefore, what could <Col N="1100" /> be done, as evidence of their goodwill, of their sympathetic understanding of the difficulties of these people, as evidence of their desire to help them, to shelter them from the impact of this increase in the price of tea and they have decided that it will give to these persons, that is, to old age pensioners, widows, blind persons and long-duration disability benefit recipients, a compensatory payment of their basic allowance in one single payment which will offset the additional cash cost in one year of the increased price of tea on the assumption that the increase reaches 2/- per lb., which it need not do.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The main argument we put up on the Second Reading of this Bill was that the Government were niggardly in that they did not give a flat rate increase to every category of pensioner who became entitled to an increase, that they rigorously applied a means test down the whole line, with the result that certain people will get as low at 2d. per week, some 3d. a week and more 5d.  We contend they should have followed the line we followed when we introduced the social welfare benefits under our Act, which in one year amounted to £3,000,000 in benefits.  It should be borne in mind by the Minister and the House that the total increase at that time was not 1/6, that it was 1/6 plus 2/6, a total flat increase of 4/-, and whether you take the 2/6 or the 1/6, or the two together, there was no differentiation. It applied to the pensioner who had 6/6 a week as well as the men who had full benefits.  In this Bill, in respect of which this Money Resolution is being moved, there is a rigid application of the means test down along the line.</P>

      <P>Seeing that the Minister intimated that the Fianna Fáil administration was responsible for an increase in the cost of living by the 1952 Budget, the Minister and his colleagues must take responsibility for the increase in the cost of living at the present time.  The Minister is only dealing, in this Bill, with one compensatory commodity, the price of tea. The Minister knows that tea is only one single item.  There are hundreds of items, the prices of which have been increased in recent months, which go to make up the cost of living.  The Minister has only to refer to his colleague, the Minister for Local Government, to find out that notifications have been sent to the local authorities, intimating to them increases of from 25 to 40 per cent. in commodities which they have to buy.</P>

    <P>On the wording of that financial motion, I want to suggest to the Minister&mdash;and I hope those speakers who have defended this measure so vigorously and aggressively will take advantage of this Resolution and support me &mdash;not to go through all the bother of putting a Bill into an Act of Parliament for the sake of one niggardly payment of 20/- odd for one week. After all, the Minister's remarks have given us the impression that this payment has the character more of a Christmas present, rather than a compensation for the increase in price of any particular commodity.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister now to take advantage of this Money Resolution to drop these penny-halfpenny and two-pence-halfpenny calculations which have been gone through on the Second Reading, to do the decent thing in this matter and give a lump sum of an equal amount to every beneficiary who, he has indicated, will benefit, due to this Bill.  It is evident that nobody in this House, so far as we can judge from the speeches, is going to ask for any division on this.  The humiliation involved in having to walk through the Lobbies of this House and vote for this measure would be far greater than the callousness displayed by the person who would vote <Col N="1103" /> against it.  It is the meanness and miserliness of it that I am objecting to here.</P>
    <P>After all, it is only one payment and the Tánaiste, at least, has some sense of humour and sufficient sagacity to avoid the grotesque by not having this payment made weekly.  Seeing that it is to be made only in one lump sum, I think the Minister ought to do the decent thing, seeing that it is the season of Christmas, and increase that lump sum from £250,000, to £500,000. After all, the Government was able to find £1,000,000 of back money, which we said was not there, to pay several categories of public servants.  The money was not there and the Government has had to put the State in pawn to find that £1,000,000 and other commitments. Here is a limited number of categories of very deserving people and I think this is a very mean way of dealing with them.  It would be far better not to have brought them in at all.</P>

      <P>Let me repeat again that for the old age pensioners, the blind, the people in receipt of widows' and orphans' pensions and the chronically ill, we are providing £1,500,000 this year.  I have expressed my views here many times on the means test.  In principle, I am against it, but I cannot find my way at the present time to abolish it.  I said if I had the money that would be required to do away with the means test at the present time I would devote it to people who, in my opinion, deserve a further increase in their allowances.  There are people here who have old age pensions at the rate of 24/- per week; there are people who have old age pensions at <Col N="1105" /> the rate of 9/- per week; and these pensions are assessed on the basis of their means.  I do not think it would be fair to apply the same lump sum payment to the person with 24/- per week in present circumstances, to the person with 4/6 per week and to the person with 9/- per week.  We decided, therefore, to give them their single lump sum payments in accordance with the basic pensions they have.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister now on the Committee Stage that he change the wording of Section 1 to read as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Where a person is entitled to a pension under the Old Age Pensions Acts, 1908 to 1955, in respect of the week commencing on the 23rd day of December, 1955, any amount payable to him in respect of that pension for that week shall be increased by a sum of £1 4s.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I differ from the Minister inasmuch as he says he does not stand for a means test; I stand for a means test in all pensions because of our economic position, the smallness of the island on which we live, the main occupation of our people and the small farms on which they live, together with the frugal means of existence that exist for the majority of the people.  But I make that suggestion to the Minister now, in relation to Section 1, on the principle <Col N="1106" /> that he has taken us to task on our small allowance of 1/6.  We will stick to that figure.  I say to him that, when we gave the 1/6, we gave it to every category in receipt of an old age pension.  On that basis, I suggest to him now that he change the wording to read &ldquo;£1 4s. 0d.&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;a sum equal to that amount&rdquo;&mdash;a sum equal to what they now get.  The Minister is silent!</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I have it now.  At column 75 of Volume 153 of the Official Report the Tánaiste said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We accept that as the average consumption in respect of that class in the community and we arrive at a situation in which for them the increase in the price of tea will represent an additional charge of 6d. per week approximately.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is a definite statement from the Tánaiste that in his estimation, on the advice he had, the average increased cost per person in the class to which this Bill refers would be 6d. per week. He goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The Government have been most anxious to see, therefore, what could be done, as evidence of their goodwill, <Col N="1107" /> of their sympathetic understanding of the difficulties of these people, as evidence of their desire to help them, to shelter them from the impact of this increase in tea prices and they have decided that it will give to these persons, that is, to old age pensioners, widows, blind persons and long duration disability benefit recipients, a compensatory payment...&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Of their basic allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;of their basic allowance, but all through it the intention was, and it was understood, that they would have 6d. per week, because he goes on further:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;...of their basic allowance in one single payment which will offset the additional cash cost in one year of the increased price of tea...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Tánaiste definitely says that the compensation will equal the additional cost which he assesses at 6d. per week. There is no getting away from that.  It is there in black and white.  He goes on further:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;...on the assumption that the increase reaches 2/- per lb., which it need not do.  The result of that will be that 160,000 old age pensioners will get that benefit.</P>
      <P>Mr. Lemass: Sixpence a week?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is the 6d. per week to which the Tánaiste had referred earlier.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Mr. Norton:  Twenty-eight thousand widows will get that benefit.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Here the Minister for Social Welfare interjects and says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Mr. Corish: It represents £250,000.</P>
      <P>Mr. Norton: Six thousand blind persons will get it and 18,000 long duration disability benefit recipients will also participate.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nobody reading that part of the Tánaiste's speech could take any interpretation from it other than that everybody was going to get the full compensation for the impact of the <Col N="1108" /> increased cost of tea.  Now the tea did not go up 2/-; it went up by 2/4.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I know.  It certainly was in excess of 2/-.  It is at least 2/4.  However, we will not quarrel about that.  Now, in view of that statement, does the Minister think he is doing justice to the Tánaiste's and the Government's promise by giving the same people an increase of less than 2d. per week as compensation for the impact of the increased cost of tea?  That is the position.  But that is not what was understood.  I do not know whether it is what was intended.  I take it the statement was made with the best intentions. It certainly is not now working out on the basis as suggested.  I think the Minister ought to amend Section 2 in order to bring better compensation to the people.  There should be an increase to the figure suggested by Deputy Kennedy.</P>

      <P>At column 75 of Volume 153 of the Official Debates, Deputy Norton, the Tánaiste, said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We accept that as the average consumption in respect of that class in the community and we arrive at a situation in which for them the increase in the price of tea will represent an additional charge of 6d. per week approximately.  It may be less, but it certainly will not be more&mdash;it will be in that vicinity.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is the sentence in the Tánaiste's speech which conveyed the idea to the House and the general public that the old age pensioners, the widows and orphans and the ordinary people mentioned in this Bill would get an increase of 6d. a week.  Our complaint against this Bill is that there is a rigid application of the means test.  We stand for a means test in all social services but there is too rigid an application of the means test in this Bill.  The 6d. a week has not been given in this Bill to a number of people, namely, recipients of old age pensions, widows and orphans and long-term disability recipients.</P>
      <P>The Bill is niggardly.  It has not followed the principle of the Bill produced by Fianna Fáil where a flat increase of 1/6 was given.  I got up to make that point clear and I think I have made it fairly clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should remember that this Social Welfare Bill is not in the same nature as a Bill that would provide for a weekly increase. Neither I nor the Government would depart from the principle followed out <Col N="1111" /> in respect of increases to old age pensioners.  When we gave the increase of 2/6 per week on 29th July, it was applied to all classes.  That principle was not departed from and it is not intended to depart from it.</P>
      <P>This is a Bill to provide compensation for certain people in receipt of social welfare benefits to offset the expected increase in the price of tea. The Tánaiste promised that we would compensate them to the amount of the weekly amount they will receive.  That is exactly what is being done.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kennedy describes this as a niggardly Bill, which reminds me of something which I forgot to mention. The maximum even in this Bill is not 24/-.  A sick man who has 24/- a week sickness or disability benefit and who has a wife and an allowance for her to the extent of 12/- will, on this particular date before Christmas, receive an extra 36/-.  I do not know exactly what the members of the Opposition are trying to get at, or whether they are trying to play down this Bill for the purpose of the Limerick by-election or some other purpose.  We were threatened with the Limerick by-election in the course of this discussion, but let me come back to the main point.  We are compensating these people to the extent of £253,000.  That is no mean sum, especially when we remember the refusals we got from Fianna Fáil when they were in Government when we advocated certain small increases in social welfare benefits. I do not think the record in respect to increases in old age, blind and widows' pensions in the last 12 months has been too bad, to say the least of it.</P>

    <Title>Committee on Finance. - Agricultural Produce (Cereals) (Amendment) Bill, 1955&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Dillon) James M. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Dillon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  This Bill is essentially a Bill to incorporate in the Agricultural Produce (Cereals) Acts certain temporary legislation, mainly relating to wheat, which came into existence during the war and post-war years.  If not so incorporated, this temporary <Col N="1112" /> legislation would lapse on expiration of the Supplies and Services (Temporary Provisions) Acts.  It consists for the most part of Orders which are the concern of the Minister for Agriculture but also includes some Orders administered by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who is concerned with wheat after it has reached the mill floor.  The Bill contains nothing that is new in principle.  It does not involve extra expenditure and will not affect revenue.</P>
      <P>Ever since the passing of the Emergency Powers Act, 1939, new legislation regarding the price, marketing and milling of wheat has been by way of Orders made under that Act, the Emergency Powers Order, 1939, or the Supplies and Services (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1946.  This new legislation arose only in part from emergency conditions and some of it would, in the normal course, have been the subject of a new Agricultural Produce (Cereals) Act, of which nine were passed in the years preceding the war.  Other Orders were the result of emergency conditions but as they have proved to be of value or to be an improvement on the previous legislation, the Bill provides for their retention.</P>
      <P>The most important section of the Bill is Section 2, with which is linked Section 15, under which certain repeals are provided for.  The object of Section 2 is to enable the Minister for Agriculture to make an annual Order controlling the price, marketing and disposal of wheat on the same general lines as the Wheat Order, 1955.  An Order similar to the Wheat Order, 1955, has been made in every year since 1942.  In passing, I may mention that the Bill does not interfere in any way with the machinery established by the Agricultural Produce (Cereals) Act, 1935, to ensure that all home-grown millable wheat is purchased by the mills as it comes on the market and is subsequently milled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main provisions of the annual Wheat Order, as made in recent years, are as follows: (i) Legal effect is given to the decision of the Government in regard to the price for millable wheat of the harvest in question; (ii) purchase of wheat from growers is restricted to certain categories of <Col N="1113" /> purchasers, including licensed mills (purchasing directly or through licensed agents), licensed wheat dealers and holders of seed (wheat) assembler's permits; (iii) control is exercised over the use of wheat by purchasers thereof; and (iv) certain commission, handling or storage charges payable to licensed agents or persons collecting wheat on behalf of mills are fixed and also resale prices for wheat sold by licensed wheat dealers.</P>
    <P>Before 1942, wheat was bought directly by the mills and also by a large number of registered wheat dealers who resold wheat to the mills. In that year each registered wheat dealer actually in business (with the exception of about 30 firms) was required to become the licensed agent of a particular mill, for which he was authorised to purchase a specified maximum quantity, on a commission basis.  Approximately 30 firms were permitted to retain an independent status as dealers entitled to purchase and resell wheat.  These firms were dealers equipped with drying and storage facilities who, because of the large scale of their dealings in wheat or because they had multiple branches, could not suitably be attached to a particular mill.  The changes introduced in 1942 were designed to secure equitable distribution of available supplies between the mills, avoidance of undue competition and transport and elimination of unnecessary handling and storage of wheat on the way to the mills.</P>
    <P>The wheat marketing system established by the Order has, in general, remained unchanged since.  Broadly speaking, apart from wheat purchased from the limited number of independent dealers, wheat is now purchased by the mills themselves, either directly or through some 300 licensed agents acting on a commission basis.  These arrangements have operated satisfactorily since they were introduced and result in more economical handling of wheat.</P>
    <P>The Emergency Powers (Cereals) Order, 1941, introduced a system of control over the assembly of seed <Col N="1114" /> wheat by purchase from growers.  This, with modifications, has been incorporated in successive annual Orders made in the meantime, including the Wheat Order, 1955.  Under these arrangements the purchase of wheat from growers for resale as seed is restricted to holders of permits, who are required to furnish returns of their transactions, and quality standards are fixed for seed wheat.  It is considered advisable to retain these arrangements, with a view to ensuring that seed wheat is assembled in suitable premises, that minimum standards of quality are maintained and that accurate information of stocks held is available.  The system also makes it possible to allocate import licences for seed wheat in proportion to native assembly.</P>
    <P>There is not now the same need as during the emergency period to control the resale, disposal or use of wheat purchased from growers but it is considered advisable to retain the general powers in this regard conferred by Article 10 of the Wheat Order, 1955.  Under Section 17 of the Cereals Act, 1935, home-grown wheat may not be disposed of by the holder of a milling licence, for purposes other than milling, except under licence of the Minister for Agriculture.  It is considered that the power under the Wheat Order to enable control to be exercised over, e.g., the drying and sale of wheat by licensed wheat dealers and the disposal of surplus seed wheat by seed (wheat) assemblers should be maintained.</P>
    <P>The annual Wheat Order made in recent years has also fixed certain commission, handling and storage charges payable to licensed agents or sack distributors and also prices for wheat resold by wheat dealers.  It is proposed to retain power to fix these charges and prices in order to maintain uniformity of remuneration to licensed agents, and others, in respect of the services rendered by them and to ensure that wheat dealers receive a fair price for wheat sold by them, whether artificially dried or not.  Sections 12 and 13 of the Agricultural Produce (Cereals) Act, 1935 were suspended by the Emergency Powers (No. 39) Order, 1940, and the Emergency <Col N="1115" /> Powers (No. 201) Order, 1942.  Section 15 of the Bill make this suspension permanent.</P>
    <P>Section 15 also revokes sub-section (1) of Section 62 of the 1933 Act.  This sub-section limited the purchase for resale of wheat to persons registered under the Act as wheat dealers.  Retention of this provision would not serve any useful purpose now that the arrangements for wheat marketing which have been in operation in recent years are being put on a permanent basis.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill provides for the replacement of Article 3 of the Emergency Powers (No. 39) Order, 1940, which provides that, subject to compliance with certain conditions, artificially dried wheat purchased by the holder of a milling licence may be deemed, for the purposes of the Agricultural Produce (Cereals) Acts, to be the equivalent amount of undried wheat in the ratio 280 barrels of dried wheat equalling 300 barrels of undried wheat.</P>
    <P>I want at this stage to inform the House that it may be possible to work out a system whereby the mills' handling of wheat will in future be determined on a basis of flour and offals produced, and if that more simple method of calculation is decided upon it may be possible to drop this whole practice of adopting the arbitrary ratio of 280 barrels of dried wheat corresponding to 300 barrles of undried wheat; but I will return to that topic on the Committee Stage of the Bill, if that meets the convenience of the House.</P>
    <P>The Cereals Acts impose various obligations on the holders of milling licences in regard to the milling and purchase of wheat.  The purpose of Article 3 of the Emergency Powers (No. 39) Order, 1940, was to ensure that holders of milling licences who purchased portion of their requirements in the form of dried wheat might be credited, for the purpose of ascertaining the extent of their compliance with the Acts, with the purchase or use of the equivalent larger quantity of undried wheat.  Correspondingly, <Col N="1116" /> the order also provided that sales of dried wheat by the holder of a milling licence might be deemed to be the undried equivalent.</P>
    <P>As moisture content in wheat may vary considerably from year to year, it is proposed to have, instead of a rigid 280:300 ratio, such ratio as may be fixed by Order having regard to the circumstances of the season concerned. I say that subject to the interpolation to which I have directed the attention of the House.</P>
    <P>Section 6 of the Bill replaces the Emergency Powers (Storage of Grain) Order, 1942.  This Order was made at a time when it was particularly important to prevent loss or deterioration of grain.  It has not been found necessary to make much use of the powers conferred by the Order but it is considered advisable to retain them, particularly as grain stores are exempt from certain provisions of the Food Hygiene Regulations, 1950.</P>
    <P>Section 9 of the Bill provides for the determination of moisture content in wheat in accordance with a method which has been prescribed in the annual Wheat Order since 1943.  Under the Wheat Order as made in recent years, price deductions fall to be made in respect of excess moisture content in wheat purchased from growers.  I am advised that there are on the market various types of rapid-action moisture testing apparatus but that these do not give uniformly accurate results, particularly in the higher moisture ranges.  It is, accordingly, considered advisable to continue to specify the oven method, which gives accurate results and is reasonably simple of execution.</P>
    <P>Sections 3, 5, 7 and 8 of the Bill are primarily the concern of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and I propose merely to indicate very briefly their purport.</P>
    <P>Section 3 is designed to permit the Minister for Industry and Commerce to vary milling quotas in circumstances where his present powers under the Cereals Acts are inadequate.  It has been necessary in recent years to have resort for this purpose to the making of Orders under emergency legislation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1117" /> Section 5 of the Bill replaces Article 6 of the Wheat Milling Order, 1953, and is designed to permit the Minister for Industry and Commerce, with the concurrence of the Minister for Agriculture, to relieve the holder of a milling licence from the obligation to mill the national percentage of home-grown wheat if there are special circumstances which justify that course.</P>
    <P>The effect of Section 7 is to place wheat milled into wheatenmeal for biscuit-making on the same footing as wheat milled into flour for the same purpose.</P>
    <P>Section 8 of the Bill gives permanent effect to an import concession first granted in the Flour and Wheatenmeal (Importation) Order, 1947.</P>
    <P>The remaining sections of the Bill do not, I think, call for any special comment.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would again like to remind Deputies that there is little that is new in the Bill, which, broadly speaking, makes alternative provision for matters contained in temporary legislation which came into existence over the last 15 years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>It would have been very helpful if the Minister had issued an explanatory note when he was circulating this Bill.  On first looking through the Bill, I saw many sections there about which I was a little perturbed, but having heard the explanation given by the Minister, I take it it is only bringing up to date all the Orders that have been made down through the years and including them in the one measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This may be a very opportune time for a discussion on wheat and the methods of purchase, sale, and so forth.  Since the advent of combines particularly, a very big change has taken place, that is, regarding moisture. As the Minister has pointed out, there are gadgets now in many of the mills for testing the moisture content of wheat.  In many cases, they are not very accurate, and there is a great difference of opinion regarding the correctness of the return that may be given from time to time, because of the <Col N="1118" /> variation that takes place from mill to mill.  Farmers may have a sample of wheat tested at one mill where a moisture content of 22 per cent. may be recorded; it goes to another agent, and it may be 24 per cent.  One wonders why that happens.  No change has taken place in the wheat; yet there is not a uniform return of moisture content. That has given rise to a great deal of criticism regarding this apparatus which has been installed in a number of mills.</P>
    <P>Possibly the time has come when farmers' representatives should be at the mills to see that the bushelling is right, that the wheat is properly weighed and that the moisture content is right.  It has been done with success in the case of beet and there has been no difficulty about it.  It has been in operation for almost 30 years and the fact of having these supervisors at the factories tended to promote greater harmony between the managers of the factories and the growers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will not misinterpret it if I ask him a question? Has he considered this difficulty, that there are four factories and over 300 points of intake for wheat?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to that point.  In the earlier stages, there were many criticisms by the farmers relating to sugar content of beet, and so forth, but, after some years, when they knew the supervisors were there, the criticisms ceased, and far greater harmony existed between the managers of the company and the farmers' representatives.  The Minister has raised the point that it would be very difficult to get supervisors into the mills.  I agree it is a very difficult problem, but I think it can be solved. First of all, I think there are something like 350 agents and dealers in the country buying wheat, and it would be necessary, in order to have proper supervision, to put a man into the agent's store and have him test every sample.  It would mean that he would have to remain there day in and day out and, of course, it would mean the employment of 350 men which would amount to a very big sum.  Even so, it might be worth it, if there was a man <Col N="1119" /> put in.  A levy of 2d. or 3d. a barrel should be sufficient to enable any organisation&mdash;for instance, the National Farmers' Association, if they took over the responsibility of appointing these men&mdash;to pay supervisors at the mills or at the agents' stores.</P>
      <P>The reason I have raised this matter is that I am wondering if the Minister would include it in the Bill, and make provision for the deduction of that sum of money by the purchasers of wheat to enable the National Farmers' Association, or some other appropriate body, which would have the responsisibility of having these men appointed, to collect this money from the millers or from the agents.  At the moment this question of testing is giving rise to a good deal of trouble and dissatisfaction regarding the moisture content.</P>
      <P>I have seen cases where there is a difference of 2 or 3 per cent.  If there is supervision the farmer feels that he is getting an honest return in the bushel weight and in the moisture content and in the weighing of his wheat. During the war years in most districts farmers went to the trouble of barrelling wheat, weighing it themselves at their threshings but with the advent of the combine that has gone.  Now the farmer has to depend on the honesty of the man employed by the agent or the miller who is weighing his corn for return.</P>
      <P>Section 4, I thought, meant something more than it does.  It refers to allowances in respect of artificially dried home-grown wheat.  I thought the Minister would have made provision for paying to the farmer the price fixed for dried grain or dried wheat, that, in other words, we had now arrived at the stage that farmers would be permitted to dry their own wheat and store it if necessary and get the dried grain price for it.  I think it is not the Minister's intention to include that in this Bill, is it?</P>
      <P>Section 4, sub-section (1) reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  Where&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1120" /> (a)  any home-grown wheat is purchased by a purchaser who is the holder of a milling licence, and</P>
    <P>(b)  the wheat has been subjected before the purchase to an artificial process of drying, and</P>
    <P>(c)  the vendor and purchaser of the wheat have informed the Minister of the transaction and furnished to him such particulars thereof as he may require,</P>
    <P>I thought the Minister would have included the farmer in order to encourage farmers to co-operate in the erection of silos and stores and the installation of drying plants.  If the Minister were prepared to include in this Bill farmers who would co-operate and combine to have their wheat dried and stored it might be to the advantage of the millers and the State.</P>
    <P>The Minister set out last year in his Wheat Order to try and get farmers to keep their wheat until after Christmas. He offered an additional price in the Spring-time for that purpose but he has not succeeded in convincing many farmers that there was any great advantage in doing that.  There are many factors operating against that.  Want of money is the principal one.  Farmers could not wait until Spring for their harvest money.  There is difficulty in keeping the wheat in ricks or stacks and in saving it from vermin.  There is a shortage of storage accommodation.  All these factors have to be taken into consideration.  I do not believe that we can ever get back to the system we had 25, 30 or 40 years ago, where the farmers kept their corn in ricks until Spring-time.  If farmers were compensated by way of a better price, a price much more attractive than the Minister made it this year, there is a possibility that groups of farmers might combine and erect their own silos and do their own drying.  No provision is made in this Bill for that type of person.  It states here specifically that only the holder of a milling licence, who has put it through a process of drying, or his agent, is entitled to get the dried grain price for wheat.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Minister for Industry and <Col N="1121" /> Commerce may, with the concurrence of the Minister, by licence relieve, to such extent and subject to compliance with such conditions as he may specify in the licence, the holder of a milling licence from the obligation to mill an amount of home-grown wheat calculated by reference to the appointed national percentage.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Am I to take it that this section gives authority to the Minister to issue an Order to any particular miller absolving him from this obligation of milling a percentage of home-grown grain?</P>

      <P>There is another power that I did not know was in existence.  It is No. 3 in the First Schedule:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A person shall not, during the sale season, exchange any wheat or the product of any wheat for any other commodity or exchange any other commodity for any wheat or the product of any wheat.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>What exactly does that mean?  Why retain such a provision?  Otherwise, we have no objection to the Bill going through.  Possibly, given a little time to examine it more fully, other Deputies might have amendments but, as regards the Bill, there is no objection, as far as I can see.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to see that the Emergency Powers Orders for the last few years relating to wheat are being merged into one Bill.  There is nothing new in it except, I think, Section 4, and I am quite certain that Section 4 was changed because of the advent of the combine harvester and also because of last year's harvest.  Up to that date it was a fact that for the purpose of assessing what was the <Col N="1123" /> milling licence of a mill it was taken that he had lost 6? per cent. in the drying of wheat&mdash;280 to every 300 barrels dried was to be his dried wheat when finished irrespective of what was the actual weight.  With the advent of the combine harvester, it is obvious that there must be a greater range of moisture content, and in wet years damper wheat.  As a result I think that change is very necessary because for instance wheatmeal millers at the present moment in some instances do not supply a quantity of meal sufficient for all the country.  It would be unwise and improper to further curtail their milling by an amount over 6¾ per cent. which would be their loss in a damp year.</P>
      <P>I agree with everything else there except when I come to Section 9.  Section 9 specifies the method by which moisture in wheat shall be determined. Here I must disagree most definitely. I agree with the Minister that the various electronic meters on the market do not always give a uniform result, and I feel that to use one of those properly over a wet harvest, for any mill to undertake this, it is necessary that there should be a parent body which could test representative samples sent up against the results obtained by the machine in use at the point of intake, such as in the case of Guinness agents buying malting barley.  Twice a week samples are put in sealed tins and if tests discover any slight error in the electronic devices it can be rectified by simple subtraction or addition.  The results which have been found in the meantime on those electronic devices can be subject to the subtraction or the addition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Agriculture have no such system with wheat.  They have simply insisted that the thing be dried at 130 degrees Fahrenheit for one hour in an oven, having been weighed before and after, and that the loss in weight equals the loss in moisture and from that it is reduced to a percentage moisture loss.  I think that is, to put it crudely, a most puerile procedure, because first of all, I know that by different methods of grinding it is possible in the grinding itself, by <Col N="1124" /> setting up heat, to remove 1 per cent. moisture.  I also know that the ovens in general use in the country do not give exact temperatures of 130 degrees right through one hour of drying, that there are ovens which have a variation of 7 degrees, and that the best type of oven one can buy has a slight variation of course, which nobody will object to, of approximately, 1½ degrees above and below.  Therefore, I do not think this is a perfect system.</P>
    <P>Also in the case of very wet wheat, the farmer when a bad season arrives with wheat of 30 per cent. moisture is in bad luck and we must make a genuine effort to do our best for him. I defy anybody to grind that wheat. It is literally impossible to grind it. What you have to do is to squeeze it. If you put it into a coffee grinder or any type of grinder you will find you are really squeezing the wheat and it is possible to see blobs of moisture emerge from it.</P>
    <P>Whether or not this is in favour of the farmer or to his disadvantage depends absolutely on wheather or not one blob goes into the ten grams of wheat you weigh.  That is literally true, and with the best heart in the world there is not a buyer who will agree that in every individual case he has done a good job.  It is literally impossible to do it.  No grinder can do it.  You can put wheat into the grinder and by setting up heat remove 1 per cent.  Moisture which would be in favour of the farmer but that is an error.  Secondly, when you get very wet wheat it is a fact that when you squeeze it, and take out 30 or 40 grams and then extract and weigh ten grams of it, there may be more moisture in the ten grams than in the bulk lot you grind, and the farmer has to suffer.  If there is less moisture the drier suffers. I am not looking for a perfect system, but I think that the approach to this thing is so crude and puerile that Section 9 probably should be deleted from the Act for a period of six to 12 months during which time the matter should be investigated.</P>
    <P>I do not know what would be the proper approach to this problem of moisture content.  I do know that the Brewers' Institute, which is an institution <Col N="1125" /> embracing all Europe, has been sitting on this problem for four years. Whether or not they have produced recommendations or a result I do not know, but I think that it would be necessary to set out and specify some type of technique so that you would get a uniform or as near to uniform a sample as possible.</P>
    <P>There are mills in this country, it is no secret to say, which are making a very genuine approach to the problem. When they get this wet wheat, they have a system whereby they dry a sample of wheat, say 50 grams, down to a moisture content at which they can fairly grind it, and having done this and made a first subtraction in weight for loss in grinding, then they make a second extraction from ten grams of the material.  This is an approach that may or may not hold water when it is examined by the analytical chemist or the Department of Agriculture, but it is some approach, and better than putting the wheat into a coffee grinder at 30 per cent. moisture and squeezing it and expecting proper results afterwards.  Thirty-six samples or more are generally placed in an over at a time.  These samples must be weighed and I defy any operative&mdash;girls are mostly put on the job&mdash;to weigh them within three-quarters of an hour.  While this is going on moisture is building up in the samples that have been removed from the over if they are placed in and ordinary atmosphere.  Funnily enough, if you just have a look at it, this will be in favour of the farmer, yet these inaccuracies in tests are not a proper approach to the problem.  These inaccuracies just cannot be allowed to stand part of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I think that the approach that could be made would be to delete Section 9 and to refer this to a body such as the Institute of Industrial Research and Standards and let them set up the proper technique.  That would be the best approach that we could make to this whole question of moisture content testing.  We should let them also specify certain instruments for the purpose such as particular ovens and grinders which in their opinion are the <Col N="1126" /> proper articles to do the job.  The system, by which a buyer can by law take samples into his kitchen and get the oven up to 130 degrees Farnheit and leave the samples in it for an hour, is not the best way or a satisfactory way of dealing with this matter.  The oven in a farmer's kitchen is not the best way to carry out the test for moisture content.  It has as we all know been found that two trays of samples put into an oven will not give the same results because the bottom of the oven is found to be much hotter than the top.  We must go into this problem of moisture content to a much deeper degree than is being done under this Bill.</P>
    <P>Let us suppose I am a buyer of wheat and a farmer sends me three loads of one parcel from a field and I take one sample only from each load; that would be in law according to this Bill a representative sample.  One sample per load is not enough.  I suggest that the best possible means of taking samples would be to take a sample from one in every five bags. That would give a representative sample from the whole consignment. Of course there is the danger in that that, if bags are left standing for three or four days, it might be that in certain conditions the wheat along the sides of the bags would be drier than that in the middle.  On the other hand if there was dew or rain, it would be found that the wheat in the sides of the bags would be wetter than in the middle, but yet I think the best approach in getting a representative sample would be to take samples from one in every five bags.  Therefore, I would ask the Minister to get his advisers to look into Section 9 again and, as well as looking into it, if possible, they should discuss the matter with the farmers' associations, the buyers' associations or the principal buyers.  In that way, it might be possible to get something better than these crude provisions which provide for samples being tested at 130 degrees Farnheit.  He should have some specified ovens, some specified technique and some defined type of grinder.  Under the present conditions, a farmer can go from one place to <Col N="1127" /> another and get from 2 to 3 per cent. variation in his samples.</P>
    <P>Deputy Walsh has raised the question of bushelling.  I know of one case where a weights and measures sergeant who was an expert at his job told me of a farmer who got different figures in various places to which he went.  In that particular case, the variation was as high as 1½ lb. in bushel weight.  That is perfectly true. It is quite possible that that could happen because, when wheat is spilled out, there is aeration or the grain becomes polished and a lot of the light grain is lost, with the result that there is variation from place to place.  I think that by a better method of testing, a better technique and specified instruments, it should be possible to get as near exactitude as is possible.</P>
    <P>With regard to the suggestion of having farmers' representatives at the mill, I think that is an excellent idea, but I wonder if it will ever work.  I think there are about 350 intake points in the country.  Deputy Walsh has suggested the payment of 3d. per barrel to provide the money.  Some years ago, the Beet Growers' Association decided to try and raise revenue from a similar charge of 1d. a barrel to pay for a small office, but that scheme was a complete failure.  I did at that time talk to some of the farmers about that, but there was no acceptance of it.  I would suggest that, before there can be any decision by the Government in that regard, the opinion of the farmers in the whole country should be obtained.  If we were to put 3d. a barrel on, then it should be done only if the majority were in favour of it.  The first thing the Minister would have to get would be a direction from the majority of the farmers concerned through somebody like the National Farmers' Association or the Beet Growers' Association.</P>

      <P>I do not believe that the decision lies with us, but with the farmers themselves, and I would not like to see this 3d. a barrel taken from them, unless they give us a direction <Col N="1128" /> to do it.  I am glad these Emergency Powers Orders are being put into one Bill, and I hope it will become an Act, but I would ask the Minister to reconsider Section 9.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am much obliged to Deputies Walsh and Donegan for their intervention.  I shall try to deal as far as I can on this stage with the particular issues that have been raised. Both Deputy Walsh and Deputy Donegan spoke about the problem of uniformity of tests.</P>
      <P>I think I heard Deputy Donegan say at one stage that the procedure envisaged in this Bill is very far from being perfect.  Of course, that is true but in matters of this kind I suggest to the House that you can purchase perfection at too high a price.  What you want to ensure is that substantial justice is done to the producer and that if there is a shading from perfect justice it should be in favour of the producer rather than the miller.  I think that is sound.  I think that where Deputy Donegan, on reflection, ultimately discerned the possibility of error, he saw that these errors were in favour of the farmer.</P>
      <P>I know that Deputy Walsh, who has had experience, and Deputy Donegan, who some day will have experience, sympathise with the Minister for Agriculture in the realisation that his job is to get for the farmer anything he can get for him.  My primary job is to see that the balance is titled in the right direction and I think the present scheme broadly provides that.  If freely admit that it does not guarantee perfection and absolute certainty in every case.  I think that if we try to get perfection we may find ourselves paying too high a price for it.  As long as substantial justice is done all round and that any defect will be in favour of the producer I think we have something closely approximating the ideal situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to tell Deputy Walsh what the position is in regard to the proposition to establish a farmers' representative at each point of intake. That proposition was put to me and I discussed it with the deputations from the Best Growers' Association and <Col N="1129" /> from the National Farmers' Association. I said to them that they were coming to me with this proposal after experiencing one of the most difficult harvests for many years&mdash;the harvest of 1954-55&mdash;and I told them that it was natural that after the extraordinary experiences they had had of getting the wheat taken in that they should demur about the moisture content.</P>
    <P>The plain fact is that 90 per cent. of that particular anomaly arose because, by the direction of the Government, I, as Minister for Agriculture, compelled the millers to take in and grade as suitable, wheat which, if it had been properly tested, would have been rejected.  You had wheat taken in as millable which had 30, 31 and 32 per cent. moisture content.  If the millers had stood on the letter of the law they would have graded that wheat as unmillable and would have rejected it but they collaborated with me, as Minister, in taking in anything that could be salvaged as millable wheat.</P>
    <P>In that year you did get the most anomalous situations arising but where a man appears to have been unjustly debited with 1 or 2 per cent. of moisture which he did not believe his wheat had in it the real fact is that his wheat was dealt with in the category of millable wheat when within the letter of the law it could have been rejected on the grounds of unsuitability and could have been cast down into the 50/- category of unmillable wheat to be crushed for animal food.</P>
    <P>I told the deputations that if, on mature reflection, they felt that the reasonable majority of grain growers wanted this representation and wanted at every point of intake, the same facilities as the beet growers had at their four points of intake, I was prepared to go to the Government and ask authority to come to Dáil Éireann for enabling legislation.  I cannot do that in the same way as it is done for the best growers because theirs is done through the contract.  I would have to get legislative authority to levey the wheat and pay the inspectors.  I think they are wrong.  I think it would cost them £30,000 if they are going to employ <Col N="1130" /> 300 men.  Actually I think they would have to pay them much more.</P>

      <P>It would mean ten weeks' work for these men who would have to be employed.  I think they would be wasting the money because I understand that this year the National Farmers' Association issued a printed form in which they called on people to enter the nature of their complaints, if they felt that the moisture content of their wheat was not properly estimated. I do not think that they got back one-tenth of 1 per cent. of these forms and I do not think that the Department got one single complaint. If we laid out £300,000 on employing men for ten weeks in each of these 300 centres and if no complaints came in it would be waste of money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would we not be very foolish if we laid out £300,000 against the possibility of complaints and if not one complaint came in?  I think the people who are primarily concerned in this matter are the people who grow the wheat.  If they come to me and in substantial majority say that, having seen the good year and the bad year, they still want me to give them £250,000 a year in having this check taken, I propose to come to Dáil Éireann with proposals along that line. But if they ask my advice, as having surveyed the scene from the centre in the good year and in the bad year, I still advise them that they are not going to get value for their money.  If you look back over the previous ten or 15 years, which were average years, the volume of complaints about moisture content was very small.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation is that these 300 wheat <Col N="1131" /> dealers depend for their living on persuading farmers to come and deal with them.  They are living on the percentage they get on the volume of wheat they handle.  Surely it must be a natural instinct in their dealings with farmers to treat the farmer as generously as they can and none of them wants to get the reputation of a greedy grasping man because he knows that the farmer will then pass his door and go to another agent.  Is it not more likely that if there is any way in which he can lean in favour of the farmer he will do that?  If you clamp down too rigorously with the literal interpretation of all these regulations, I want to warn the growers, watching this from the centre and standing impartially between the various interests concerned, they are going to lose more out of a rigid and precise enforcement of these regulations than by whatever latitude there may be otherwise.</P>
    <P>However, they have of course the right to stick to their guns, but I am Minister for Agriculture and my business is to root for the farmer and to get as much as I can out of any legislation enacted by this House for the farmer.  There is the legislation and the more precisely it is enacted and the tighter we draw it and the more Draconian the manner in which we enforce it, the more it will react on the farmers.  I think on balance that taking the bad year with the good year and the average year, the natural desire of the wheat dealer is to draw custom into his own premises.</P>
    <P>Deputy Donegan referred to Section 9, and it was in that context, I think, he said he did not consider this a perfect system at all.  I agree, but no human system is perfect and the only reason that we have adopted that system is because it is internationally accepted procedure.  What ordinarily happens is that one of these electronic devices is employed to assess the amount of moisture, and then substantial agreement is reached between the purchaser and the vendor; but if there is a serious difference and the miller or the grain purchaser wants to defend his moisture deduction against <Col N="1132" /> the farmer that is the only test on which he can go to court.  This electronic device is merely a rough-and-ready method designed to secure a handy basis of agreement and to avoid undue delay.  It is very easy to think of foolproof devices for making tests of this kind; and suppose we insist on an even more foolproof device to check up on moisture, as Deputy Donegan seems to suggest, can you imagine how we could have brought in the harvest of 1954?  Could you imagine how it would have been got in at all if it was required by law that every parcel of wheat taken in would have to go through this elaborate procedure?</P>
    <P>This method is not perfect&mdash;I concede that.  I do not believe there is such a thing as a perfect method.  I think this method works, by and large, reasonably well.  I do not think there is in any average year any serious abuse but I have given the grain growers an undertaking that if they come back again with this request I shall seek the authority of the Government to bring suitable legislation before the House.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the First Schedule, to which I think Deputy Walsh referred, is designed to prevent barter operations and, I think, has something to do with administrative machinery for avoiding any departure from the fixed minimum price.  I agree with Deputy Walsh that many of these provisos which turn up in schedules of regulations of this character often seem grotesque, but I think his experience will have taught him what I have learned by my own bitter experience that you cannot make regulations on the assumption that everyone is going to play ball.  You will always find some &ldquo;sore thumb&rdquo; coming along to see if he can push his foot through some little chink.  You have to close that chink just to keep that sort of person out.  If you are dealing with 100 per cent. reasonable men these sorts of provisions might not be necessary at all.  That is the only defence I can make for Section 3 of the Schedule.</P>
    <P>I think Deputy Walsh asked what is the exact significance of Section 4.  I <Col N="1133" /> think it reproduces an Order which he himself made&mdash;I am making no point of it&mdash;in 1953, and it is purely related to this 280-300 ratio and I rather imagine, if the Minister for Industry and Commerce alters his basis of calculation from a wheat basis to a flour and offals basis, Section 4 will fall from the Bill.  It is purely consequential on this other method and is an entirely technical device for making some obstruse calculation.</P>
    <P>I fully appreciate Deputy Walsh's legitimate observations on the section which permits the Minister for the time being to alter milling quotas.  I consider that his thrusts on that occasion were moderate and restrained in all the circumstances, but I would like to reasure him that so far as I know this is purely designed for administrative convenience to avoid shifting small quantities of wheat from one mill to another.  The concern of the Minister is to see that all the wheat is milled, and it is sometimes more convenient to allow one mill to take 102 per cent. of its quota and another 98 per cent. because the wheat appears to be in these particular areas.  The Committee Stage will be taken at a later date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Just one point&mdash;the Minister did not make any reference to farmers drying their own wheat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is another question&mdash;I forgot about it; my apologies. That is another frequently canvased question and I do not see how we can deal with it.  What many farmers' representatives have asked is if you take the basic price for wheat at 70/- for such-and-such a moisture content, it you present wheat of 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 per cent. less moisture, there should be a corresponding increase as there is a corresponding decrease if you have excess moisture content.  Deputies will remember that in the bad year we changed the moisture content in order to lighten the burden for the man who had bad wheat, but I think the real reason why the moisture content principle was introduced was because it was designed to put a very trifling impost on at the lower stage, but where in a normal year a farmer dumped in <Col N="1134" /> wheat with 28 per cent. or more moisture it was felt he was so utterly careless that he ought to be penalised so that the farmer who did his best to bring wheat in the best possible condition could get the highest possible price the system allowed.</P>
      <P>I think the Grain Growers' Association themselves said that they had no interest in a man who in a normal year dumped his wheat in with a moisture content in excess of 28 per cent.  Upon my word, but for the necessity of controlling that type of person, I would be inclined to drop the whole moisture content business altogether.  There, again, you are faced with the dilemma that, while that would operate favourably and effectively with 85 per cent. of the farmers, you would get about 15 per cent. who would water the grain; and, unhappily, you would have to provide against them.  It would be much better if you had no moisture content at all.  But what can you do with the kind of fellow who would almost water it artificially if you had not got that protection against him?</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that after drying the wheat it has to be damped again before it is turned into flour?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure if that is altogether correct.  You have to have a certain moisture content to mill it. I think it is 15 per cent.  You cannot mill it satisfactorily if the moisture content is below that.  It is just as difficult to mill if it is below that as it is if it is above and, therefore, you have to bring it to the correct moisture content by an admixture of excessively dry wheat with wheat of a high moisture content.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1943" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The farmer is cut for moisture content but, when the wheat is about to be manufactured into flour, water is turned on it.  That is my experience.  That is why I could never understand why the farmer should be cut considering the millers turn water on it after drying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Wheat must be 15 per cent. moisture content for satisfactory milling.  The farmer is entitled to present wheat up to 23 per cent.  If he has <Col N="1135" /> 23 per cent., or less, he gets paid the full price.  It is only if the moisture is in excess of 23 per cent. that there is any reduction.  We all know the difficulty of correctly ascertaining excess moisture content and, if we start trying to pay the farmer more for every point below 23 per cent., the difficulty is that administration will become almost impossible; and, of course, fundamentally this story began by a price being guaranteed for millable wheat.  Now, gradually as the practice of wheat-growing increased and the purchase of wheat for domestic milling grew up, millable quality had to be defined and, slowly, the Government, one day or another, relaxed the standard from 21 per cent. to 22 per cent. and, finally, to 23 per cent.; and the farmer continued to get his wheat treated as millable wheat when it was 23 per cent., whereas in the early stages it might have been looked upon askance and he would have been required to produce it at 21 per cent.</P>
      <P>Now, the fixed price is payable in respect of any wheat with a moisture content up to 23 per cent.  Not unnaturally, the farmers say: &ldquo;What will you give us if we produce wheat at 15 per cent.?  Will you undertake to give us 8/-, 9/- or 10/- a barrel more?&rdquo; The answer is: &ldquo;No, I cannot.&rdquo;  And there are two reasons for it.  One is that, in order to handle the crop, we had to, and my predecessor had to, greatly facilitate the creation of drying facilities at the most convenient centres for dealing with the crop <i>en bloc.</i>  The second reason is that in the last analysis when wheat comes to be milled it is the miller who has to mill it.  Now, if a farmer tries to dry his own wheat, burns it and brings it to the mill and the miller says: &ldquo;I cannot make flour out of that wheat. I admit it is 16 per cent. moisture content, but I cannot make flour out of it.&rdquo;  What am I to do then?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1943" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What am I to do then? How are we to get over that?  Are we to say to the miller: &ldquo;You must mill as much as you can&rdquo;?  Now that is the difficulty.  At the present time any <Col N="1136" /> farmer who has wheat with a moisture content of 24 per cent., 25 per cent. or 26 per cent, can dry that wheat himself down to 23 per cent. and he will get the full price, without any reduction for moisture, for it.  Technically, I suppose, he might not be authorised to do so, but he need not tell the miller he has done any drying operations at all.  He just presents it at 23 per cent. moisture content and gets the fixed price for it.</P>
      <P>As at present advised, I do not see any means whereby you can evolve a system of paying the individual farmer a rising scale for reducing moisture content below 23 per cent.  If anybody has an administrative scheme which he thinks could be worked on a rational basis I shall be glad to hear of it.  I know of none, and I have considered this matter well.  As at present advised, I cannot see my way to meet that request.  I think in the long run it is probably better that we should have at convenient centres throughout the country adequate drying and storage facilities, leaving to the individual farmer, who wants to store his own grain, the certainty that if he brings it in at 23 per cent. or under, he will get the fixed price; and, if he chooses to bring it in wet, he will have to meet the reduction appropriate to the degree of moisture his grain contains.</P>

      <P>The main difficulty that <Col N="1137" /> I see in this Bill is the possibility of juries going wrong in the assessment of damages.  I think it is a matter that the Minister should think over again. Under Lord Campbell's Act the chief people who lost by the death could sue and juries assessed damages accordingly.  Now, I appreciate that the main people who lose are the dependents of the bread-winner and I fear that if these other categories are brought in juries will be side-tracked.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, I say the principles are quite relevant on the Money Resolution and I am only talking about principles.  I suggest the Minister should think again.  I am in agreement with the main principles of the Bill.  My contention is that, if there is a fatal accident and a widow is suing for the death of her husband, and these other people are brought in, a jury will be side-tracked; instead of assessing damages for the main dependent, because these other dependents are introduced, they will be inclined to overlook the fact that the principal loser is the widow.</P>
      <P>Taking the Bill as a whole I approve of it.  I wonder wheather the Minister, and particularly the Taoiseach, could devise some type of safeguard for the danger that I see in this Bill.  I am sure the Taoiseach will appreciate the point I am making that, whereas it is quite proper that some dependent like a brother or sister should be able to sue, the Minister goes so far as to bring in the question of the dependency of an illegitimate child.  What I am afraid of is that, having regard to all the people brought in under this Bill, the main loser might suffer in the question of damages.  Taking a hurried view, I cannot see how that can be guarded against, but I have no doubt that if the Minister, particularly the Taoiseach, looks at this matter, he will appreciate the danger I envisage under this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate what <Col N="1138" /> Deputy Moran said.  Really, the essence of what he wishes to urge was very much present in the mind of the Minister when this Bill was being framed.  There were two problems to be solved.  One was the measure of damages and the other the question of how far we should extend the scope of the dependents&mdash;how far he would stretch out the elastic.  If the elastic is stretched too far it is bound to break.  The more dependents you put in, the less there is for what Deputy Moran calls the principal person.  We were fully alive to that.</P>
      <P>On the Second Reading, we were anxious to get the views of Deputies of the House on how far we should widen the range of dependents.  The Minister pointed out that he had left out a provision which is now being inserted&mdash;to bring in those people who stand <i>in loco parentis</i> to other people, and <i>vice versa.</i>  It was felt that the number of dependents had gone as far as it was wise to go if not too far, but in deference to the views expressed by the House the Minister decided to bring in this amendment which will be moved by him to bring in people who are <i>in loco parentis</i> and <i>vice versa.</i></P>
      <P>There is the danger that if you widen the scope the damages, being only one sum, will be thinned out according as they are distributed.  On the measure of damages we would like to have had more discussion than there was.  Originally, we thought of following the principle that was laid down tentatively by Mr. Justice Casey, when Attorney-General, and bringing in a new measure of damages.  We came to the conclusion, however, that to do that would make confusion worse confounded and possibly, after a whole series of cases in the Supreme Court, we would find ourselves with a direction from the Supreme Court that the principles laid down on the decisions in the Fatal Accidents Act are still to be followed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is only one sum for all dependents and the jury will judge how to divide that amongst them.  The only safeguard against the danger adverted to by Deputy Moran is the fact that it has been decided by the Supreme <Col N="1139" /> Court that you must, in order to establish dependency, give evidence of the fact of dependency, the nature of the dependency and the amount.  That decision was responsible for the practice that grew up of giving evidence by actuaries.  Each dependent would have to make his case and prove it in court.  It would then have to be left to the good sense of a judge or jury to assess the relevant claims of each dependent.</P>

      <P>I think that would be unwise.  My experience with juries is that first of all, they give to the last penny that they can give, on the evidence given by the actuaries. Generally, they take a common-sense view of the claims of the widow.  The Deputy will agree that the widow got the major share almost always.  I think the matter will have to be left to the good sense of the jury.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (2), paragraph (a), line 26, to delete &ldquo;and&rdquo;; and to add a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(c) a person <i>in loco parentis</i> to another shall be considered the parent of that other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to cover the case of a person to whom the deceased stood at the time of his death in the position of a parent and the case of a person who stood in the <Col N="1140" /> position of a parent of the deceased when he died.  The amendment will cover informally adopted children and nephews and nieces living with, say, an uncle or aunt and being reared and maintained by that uncle or aunt.  We reconsidered the whole question of extending the range of dependents and decided that the present amendment represents the furthest we ought to go.  Uncless and aunts who are dependents are not covered where there is no question of being in the position of a parent.  The danger, as I pointed out on the Second Stage, is that if we make the provision wider it is difficulty to know where to stop.  Insurance companies might be tempted to increase their premiums.  Also juries could easily tend to award the same sum irrespective of the number of dependents so that the real sufferers, like the wife and children, would lose.</P>
    <P>A further point is that where a man contributes to the support of his relatives the amount of his contribution is peculiarly within the knowledge of those relatives when he dies, and it would be extremely difficult for a defendant in a fatal case to disprove the allegation of, say, a distant relative that he was, in fact, getting a substantial allowance from the deceased. Apart from this, a man is only bound to answer for the probable and reasonable consequences of his act and there is a very strong case to be made against forcing him to pay very large damages because the person he killed was, out of the goodness of his heart, contributing to a large and non-defined number of people.  We are confining the provision to what is normally considered the family.  We are adding brother and sisters, adopted persons, illegitimate persons and those who are treated as children.</P>
    <P>To put it shortly, we think that only those people a man has to support by reason of a legal obligation existing normally or assumed by him in a particular case and those people that he supports because of close blood kinship should be covered.  If you take in aunts and unless it is difficult to justify excluding cousins.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I have an open mind on this matter, with certain reservations, <Col N="1141" /> and what I say to the Minister is said sincerely out of my experience. I quite agree that under Lord Campbell's Act only the wife, husband, parent or child could sue.  I have come across very unjust cases where the brother and the sister were precluded from suing although the brother or the sister might be the main dependents of the deceased.  If I were in the Minister's shoes, I would be very slow to go outside Lord Campbell's Act.  Brother and sister could be included, but I would be slow to go outside these relationships.  I agree with the Minister's suggestion that &ldquo;child&rdquo; should include an illegitimate child if he is a dependent, but if you go outside these categories I think you would see no end to this matter.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Minister that it is not beyond the ingenuity of the people of Ireland, particularly in the rural districts, to attempt to prove dependency to the extent of the 31st cousin if they can get away with it.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt at all but that insurance premiums will go sky high as a result of this Bill.  I would ask the Minister or his colleagues to keep an eye on this aspect of the matter. Theoretically, they will say, that there is a new liability being imposed on them, whereas, in fact, it is only the ordinary cases that will come in under this measure.  Insurance companies will lay down as a proposition that they have so many of these mythical claims to cover up all the people the Minister proposes to bring in under the Bill.  In fact their liability in the main&mdash;in 95 per cent. of the cases&mdash;will be the same.  In fact, they will be the same people who formerly could sue who will be suing under this measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You will have the odd man out. Approximately 5 per cent. might come in under this measure.  I have no doubt that insurance companies are going to put up their rates under this Bill just the same as they did under the Workmen's Compensation Act.  I do not say that under that Act they were not entitled to increase them to a certain extent, but I have grave doubts whether they were entitled to increase their rates to 25 per cent. on top of the existing rate as they did under the <Col N="1142" /> Workmen's Compensation Act.  This is an important matter.  This is, in fact, the nigger in the woodpile in this legislation because these people outside the insurance companies are going to take advantage of this Bill as an excuse to cover what they will say are potential liabilities.</P>
    <P>The Bill might deal with certain increases in damages but in 95 per cent. of the cases the Bill will not apply.  It is only in the odd cases that it will apply.  I would like an assurance from the Minister that before any further increase in premiums under this Bill is allowed the matter will be investigated by the Government if this measure is going to be used as an excuse for increasing premiums.</P>
    <P>As far as the ministerial amendment is concerned, I am prepared to let it go.  However, my view in this matter is rather conservative.  I know the ingenuity of the people outside the main people concerned, namely, the wife, husband, parent and child and, I suppose, brother and sister.  I know how ingenious people can be in endeavouring to prove dependency claims. I would not go quite so far as the Minister.  I would confine it to wife, husband, parent and child, adding in brother and sister, if the Government feel they should go that far.</P>
    <P>I did not think I would have an opportunity of making the point I put to the Taoiseach a couple of moments ago, but I feel particularly the possibility of the main loser being lost sight of with all those people out on the wings.  I would be much happier about this legislation if it were written on the Statute Book that the jury would be directed to give 80 per cent. of the damages to the widow and let the other dependents share the remaining 20 per cent. between them.  I would feel a lot happier if that were done.</P>
    <P>Rightly or wrongly, I am convinced that when this Bill is passed, juries will be confused with all the people concerned.  I can envisage a case which I am sure the Taoiseach can envisage also.  You might have a wage earner who was killed.  He may have a widow and some children.  He has an old mother-in-law or a grandmother somewhere who says that she got £5 <Col N="1143" /> from him at Christmas.  The deceased wage earner may have a couple of other relatives on the outskirts who may say that once or twice a year they got some money from him.  The whole lot will take part in this action and the jury will be left to assess the damages and the judge will have to direct them under this measure.  All these people from the mother-in-law, the grandmother, the illegitimate child and the 31st cousin will come in.  The 12 good men on the jury&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>At all events, the Taoiseach and possibly the Minister understand the matter.  The 12 good men on the jury are left to assess damages in the situation which I envisage.  In Dublin at the present time an extraordinary development has grown up. You may have three men on a jury who consider the plaintiff should get only £200.  You will have five others who consider he should get £2,000, and then there are a few in the middle.  They are in the main busy and unpaid men. They are left in the jury-room until they reach a verdict.  What is happening is that each man writes down what he would give himself.  That is put into a hat, totalled up and divided by 12.  The Taoiseach knows and we all know that that is happening, but it certainly is an extraordinary performance. I want the Minister to visualise a jury assessing damages in a case where you would have a widow, a child and the other people brought in under this Bill.  They must be told by the judge that they are all entitled to claim.  I wonder in all this wilderness just how these 12 men will deal with the widow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My suggestion may not be the best in the world but in the case of a widow there should be some provision whereby the jury would be directed that a certain amount should be given to the widow.  I should write into the Statute <Col N="1144" /> Book that they be directed that, whatever they found in damages, the widow would get at least 80 per cent. If you leave the matter the way it is, I am afraid juries will get confused and the main loser, the widow, will be shot down under this Bill.  Whilst I accept the amendment, I think that the Taoiseach and the Minister should take second thoughts about the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete sub-section (2) and substitute the following new subsections:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2)  Only one action may be brought in respect of the death.</P>
      <P>(3)  The action may be brought by the personal representative of the deceased or if, at the expiration of six months from the death, there is no personal representative or no action has been brought by the personal representative, by all or any of the dependents.</P>
      <P>(4)  The action, by whomsoever brought, shall be for the benefit of all the dependents.</P>
      <P>(5)  The plaintiff shall furnish the defendant with particulars of the person or persons for and on whose behalf the action is brought and of the nature of the claim in respect of which damages are sought to be recovered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of this amendment is to make it quite clear, firstly, that only <Col N="1145" /> one action may be brought in respect of the death.  Secondly, the action if not brought by the personal representative within six months may be brought by all or any of the dependents. Thirdly, the action is to be for the benefit of all the dependents, no matter who brings it.  Finally, the plaintiff must supply particulars of the dependents and the nature of their claim to the defendant.  The amendment is declaratory of the existing statutory law in which it makes no change.  The provisions in the amendment were omitted from the Bill because it was thought at the time that there was no need for them.  On reconsideration, however, following the Second Stage debate we decided to write in the existing provisions in the Fatal Accidents Acts so as to remove any doubt and to avoid the danger of an argument being used to suggest that we were deliberately changing the existing law in this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister appreciates that there are difficulties in this matter.  If somebody brings an action it is presumed under the Minister's amendment that it is being brought for all parties.  I put it to the Minister that everybody else is ruled out except the person who brings the action.  Take the case of a person from Achill Island, where people are usually away over the other side for ten or 11 months of the year.  If, shall we say, A brings an action within the six months, what is the position of, say, B, who, although having a financial interest in the matter and being a dependent, is not there at the time?  As far as I can understand from the amendment, he is precluded.  I would like to know if A brings the action, has B any rights against him? It appears from the Minister's amendment that A can bring the action to the exclusion of the others.  Does it mean that other persons who may have an action are barred or have they any rights against the person who brings the action?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The position as set out in this amendment is as the Minister has stated.  The existing law and the precise problem that Deputy Moran has posed here have been the <Col N="1146" /> subject of judicial decision.  It is clear beyond all doubt that if, in the case put by Deputy Moran, A brings an action about which B knows nothing but is a dependent, B cannot bring another action.  He is not ruled out, however, because it is mandatory on A to set forth in his pleadings or to give particulars otherwise to the defendant of all the dependents. The action is brought and is bound under law to be brought not merely on behalf of A but on behalf of all the dependents.  It is the duty of the defendant, who knows he is going to be stuck, to make absolutely certain that by some method, either on the pleadings or by the necessary notice requiring particulars and the answer to particulars, all the dependents are before the court.  If the particular dependent, B, in the case put by Deputy Moran is not satisfied with the action, he can come in himself and apply to be added to the action; or, if the court does not take that course, he can attend the hearing and see that his rights are properly put forward by the particular plaintiff.  That is the existing law.  If that were not the law and if there were ten dependents, you might have ten actions with inevitable confusion and increased costs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>That is all right so far as the Taoiseach's statements goes.  It is all very well for the Taoiseach to say that the dependent B can apply to be joined.  I am posing the case of a person who is not there when proceedings are brought within six months of the death.  What happens to him once the action is brought?  I want to know is there any comeback for him against the party that gets damages?  In my view, he is out in the cold no matter what dependency he may prove and as far as I can see from the Minister's amendment, he has no redress afterwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It does happen, particularly in the West of Ireland, that you have many people who are away for the greater part of the year.  I have often <Col N="1147" /> discovered that people with an interest in a case were not there at the time and only discovered that an action had been brought when they came home, six, eight or 12 months afterwards. Once an action is brought and the person concerned does not get time to come back to somebody like myself to be joined as a plaintiff in the proceedings, he is debarred and ruled out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think he will.  The case put by Deputy Moran is one that might conceivably occur but if a man is a dependent he will know very well that the person on whom he was depending has been killed, and that he is cut off his dependency.  He is very well aware of that and if he is working in England, as in the case put by Deputy Moran, he will very quickly run back if he hears there is an action.</P>

Under the law as it stood, before we repealed the Public Authorities Protection Act, his dependents might get nothing in certain cases.  That was one of the reasons originally for the three years, not because a fellow is over in England earning money.  Anyway if he is earning money he is not a dependent usually.  The Deputy took a very bad example.</P>

    <P>This amendment is designed to ensure that whether the dependents or the deceased incurred the expenses, damages in respect of them may be recovered.  As the section stands at the moment, expenses incurred by the deceased can be recovered only where the personal representative brings the action.  As, however, the personal representative acts for the dependents it is only right that, where there is no personal representative, the dependents can recover damages in respect of expenses in the same way as if there was a personal representative. Where there is a personal representative, expenses incurred by the deceased and recovered by the personal representative go to the dependents.

      <P>I will agree to take all stages if the Minister, in his wisdom, and, particularly, the Taoiseach, think that we should let the Bill go on the Statute Book in its present form.  They are the people who have to take responsibility for this matter.  I want to assure the Minister that I genuinely feel that what I have said about juries is a danger in this Bill.  If the Taoiseach or the Minister cannot think <Col N="1149" /> of any safeguard that we in this House might apply, it is a matter for them.</P>
      <P>The Bill, as a whole, is a Bill that I welcome.  I might not go as far as the Minister has gone in this Bill but I am afraid that this question of damages is left too much in the air in the Bill. If the Minister and the Taoiseach are satisfied that it should go through the House in its present form I am prepared to give it to them.  If, on the other hand, they would consider that some provision should be made against the dangers I foresee, then they may leave the matter over until next week. I leave it entirely to the Minister and the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure Deputy Moran that the question of damages and the apportionment and assessment of damages gave the Minister and his officials and the Attorney-General and, to some extent, myself, very considerable concern and thought.  I am not as happy about the position under this Bill as I would like to be.  I would like a greater measure of damages to be given to the dependents on the death than is measured by merely pecuniary loss.  We endeavoured to find some other measure of damages but we did not succeed because any other measure of damages appeared to lead to all sorts of difficulties.  I would have liked if some Deputy or body interested in this matter had helped us in any way.  But the Deputy and the House can be assured that the Minister and his officials gave this matter the deepest consideration and read everything possible that was to be got on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of the real matter that is worrying the Deputy, about assessment by juries, that gives me least concern of all the matters that affected me on this Bill, because juries in deciding on the measure of damages in these cases of fatal accidents have before them something which they have not got in ordinary running-down cases of personal injuries to a person who survives, who is injured as a result of the negligence of another party. They have a rule: it is the pecuniary loss.  Definite evidence must be given most clearly and specifically to the juries from actuaries of the amount of <Col N="1150" /> the pecuniary loss and they measure the amount of the damages on the pecuniary loss.  Juries have not to resort and, in my view, do not resort&mdash; and if they did and it was known that they did their verdict would be set aside in the Supreme Court&mdash;to the device which is popularly believed to happen in the jury room, that is, that each one gives his own opinion as to the amount of the damages, that the total is divided by 12.  That does not happen and cannot happen in the case of Lord Campbell's Act.</P>
    <P>As regards the widow, I am all in favour of the widow getting all the can, provided she is dependent but, while Deputy Moran can give one hard case, I can give one that would not be a hard case in the same sense. Supposing the widow has a private income of her own and has more money than her husband had?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I was pointing out last night, when the Minister challenged me, the compulsory powers contained in this measure.  The Minister tried to put it over to the House that there was no such thing as compulsory powers in this measure.  He held up his hands in horror at the very <Col N="1151" /> suggestion of there being any compulsory powers or that he, in particular, would ever use anything like compulsory powers for the purpose of taking land for the purpose of afforestation.</P>
      <P>I stated last night that, taken section by section, 95 per cent. of this Bill deals with the operation of compulsory acquisition of land for afforestation. Section 1 states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In this Act &lsquo;the Principal Act&rsquo; means the Forestry Act, 1946 (No. 13 of 1946).&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Bill refers in the main to Section 23 of the 1946 Act.</P>
      <P>I want everybody concerned to understand that Section 23 of the 1946 Act is a section put on the Statute Book for the purpose of taking land compulsorily for forestry purposes. Section 23 (1) (a) of that Act reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If the Minister desires to acquire any land for the purposes of this Act but is unable to acquire the land by agreement expeditiously he may apply to the lay commissioners for an Order under this section authorising him to acquire the land compulsorily in accordance with this Chapter.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is a compulsory section.  That is the section under which the Minister can take land for afforestation purposes in the very same way as the Land Commission can take land compulsorily for the relief of congestion or for the other purposes set out in the Land Acts.  I do not say for a moment that it might not be necessary for them in certain circumstances to take land compulsorily for afforestation. What I do object to is the Minister trying to put it over on the House and the country that the last thing he is concerned with is taking land compulsorily and holding up his hands in horror at the very suggestion of taking land compulsorily for afforestation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If he does not intend to take land compulsorily for afforestation then there is no purpose in introducing this Bill in this House.  I want to make it as clear as I possibly can that this Bill is a Bill to operate compulsory powers, <Col N="1152" /> that under this Bill the Minister proposes to exercise compulsory powers. The Bill is an enabling Bill to help the Minister and the Department to operate Section 23 of the 1946 Act. When the Minister states, as he did when speaking to the motion before this House, that the last thing he would do was to operate compulsory powers, I should like to point out in reply that he is not fooling this House and that he certainly is not going to fool the country with that proposition. At column 906 of Volume 153 of the Official Report, the Minister is reported as having said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Both myself and every other member of the Government will oppose any attempt to acquire land compulsorily for forestry.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Having put that on the records of the House and coming in with this measure to operate compulsory powers, I think the Minister should at least be candid with the House and the country.  If he is going to operate Section 23 he is going to operate a section for the compulsory acquisition of land.  He is going to take land for forestry from people who do not want to give land for forestry.  Let that be made quite clear.</P>
    <P>Coming along to the particular section, I said last night that this Bill was in my view impossible of amendment. I think it is the worst drafted Bill I have ever read and I have read it carefully. That might not be altogether the Minister's responsibility but I want to point it out to him as we go along. In the first place, I want to say, on behalf of the people for whom I speak, that if the Minister was setting out to solve the difficulty that he or his Department would meet in commonages he would have all our sympathy but what I want to point out is that this Bill is not going to do it; that this Bill is, as I said last night, a stunt on afforestation and stunting does not pay either in politics or any other walk of life.  The main difficulty of the Department and the main difficulty of the commonages from the Department's point of view is that they are mostly areas where you have the people owning the commonages as vested or fee <Col N="1153" /> simple owners of an undivided share in the commonage.</P>
    <P>To start off, this Bill has no definition section.  There is nothing in this Bill defining anything.  &ldquo;Vested owner&rdquo; has a certain legal connotation; it has an artificial meaning under the 1946 Act.  There is no definition section in this Bill and one is left in complete doubt as to whether the term is meant to deal with vested land, as lawyers understand it, or whether it is to have the artificial meaning given to vesting in the 1946 Act.  We are left without a definition section but in the West of Ireland&mdash;in the Minister's and my county&mdash;there are thousands and thousands of acres of commonage where the people are owners of undivided shares. There is a reference in this Bill to the Land Act of 1939 and I thought it might solve some of the difficulties, but it does not because Section 24 of the 1939 Act says in sub-section (1):&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This section applies to every holding&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the whole or an undivided share or undivided shares of which is or are purchased under the Land Purchase Acts or is or are subject to a purchase agreement entered or deemed to have been entered into under those Acts, and</P>
    <P>(b)  which is held by two or more persons (in this section referred to as owners in common) in common, whether as joint tenants or as tenants in common.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That section is referred to in this Bill and it deals with joint tenants or tenants in common.  Tenants in common in the main occupy 95 per cent. of commonages in the West of Ireland. They are fee simple owners in an undivided share and they have what we call <i>per mea et per tuo</i> rights and they are entitled to these rights.  These rights cannot otherwise be determined as the Minister attempts to do in this Bill.  I would suggest that before this Bill goes any further, the Minister would have a word with the Taoiseach on the constitutional aspect of this section.  But if he thinks that under this section he can fence off two common owners who are vested fee simple owners in the whole area and put a <Col N="1154" /> wall around then he is fooling nobody but himself.</P>
    <P>These two common owners will burst his Bill in its present form high, wide and handsome.  I have said that, in my view, this Bill is impossible to amend because of the way in which it has been drafted.  There are cross references in it to the Principal Act, and matters occur in it like, for instance, sub-section (5) of Section 4 which says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This section shall be regarded as being contained in Chapter III of Part III of the Principal Act.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What that means is completely beyond me.  Because of the way it is drafted, it would be completely impossible to do anything with this Bill by way of amendment on the Committee Stage or to get anything done about the objectives we had in mind when we introduced the motion into this House.  I want to say that it passes my understanding why the Minister thinks the paying of compensation to an occurpier of land for six years is going to solve anything.  The Minister's objective, or proposed objective, on the surface is to get land for afforestation purposes but how this measure is going to help him and his Department is completely beyond my comprehension. I want to say that if the Minister wanted the practical machinery he could provide, as it is provided in the Land Acts, that there would be a limited administrator for the purpose of taking the land.  How this suggestion of the Minister that he can say compensation to somebody who has been in occupation for six years, and if some other fellow turns up a couple of years after, the Minister has a right to sue the first man to whom he has already lost the money, will increase the Minister's chances of getting land for afforestation is completely beyond my apprehension.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The question of compensation, except on the two fundamental problems I laid down to <Col N="1155" /> the House last night, has absolutely nothing whatever, in my submission, to do with the question of land for afforestation purposes at all.  I pointed out last night to the Minister that, in my view, you had, first, to have an organisation that will go out and look for the land, which is not being done now, and secondly, if we are serious about this problem, we must pay the people for the land we are going to acquire for afforestation purposes. Those are the two fundamental things, if we are serious about this question of getting land for afforestation, and strange to say, neither of these points is dealt with under this Bill.  I have said that the Minister and his Department have failed in this matter.  I have pointed out that in my experience, the only land that is being made available for afforestation, in the West at all events, is mainly coming from a drive by private individuals or private organisations.  There is nobody going out after them.  They have to come to the Department.  That is number one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Number two is the question of finances, as to whether we are going to pay a reasonable sum for acquisition of land for afforesation, or as an inducement to the people to part with the land for afforestation, just as we have to pay a reasonable sum now, the market value before the courts, for land acquired for the relief of congestion. There is not one word in this Bill about what is going to be paid for land for afforestation.  There is no guide laid down for our courts as to how they will assets the value of land for afforesation purposes.  I invite any Deputy to go through the Bill and see where the lay commissioner or the appeal commissioners have any machinery to guide them as to how much they are to assess as compensation. It may be market value; it may be a price determined as reasonable to the Department and to the purchaser; but there is nothing in the Bill about it.  If I go, or anybody goes, into court in the morning to appear for an objector whose and was being taken for afforestation purposes, there is nothing in this Bill that I can see to guide the court, and no machinery laid <Col N="1156" /> down for it, no yardstick, no principle, as to what is to be paid for land for afforestation purposes in this country.</P>
    <P>I do not know why the Minister has been so silent on this matter in this Bill.  I do not know why some section might not be in this Bill as, say, in the Land Act of 1950, where the principle was laid down that the party whose land was being taken was entitled to the market value.  I can suggest a reason to the House as to why this vital section, this principle that is fundamental and that goes to the very root of afforestation in this country, the question of do-de-do-do, £. s. d., is completely absent from the Bill.  If the Minister or the Government were serious about afforestation, I suggest that this House would be told about it.  If they were prepared to go out and get land for afforestation, I suggest that they would in this Bill take the opportunity of telling the countryman what he would get for his land, if he was prepared to offer it for afforestation.  But, taking this Bill from the first section to the last, not alone is the Bill completely silent as to what might be paid for land for afforestation, but there is not even a clue left to the unfortunate judge or lay commissioner who will have to administer the compulsory taking of land under this Bill as to how he will compensate the people&mdash;not a clue, not an inkling, from the Minister.</P>
    <P>I would respectfully suggest, not alone to the Minister but to the House, that, in my view, and I am sure in the view of many Deputies, the fundamental issue in this matter is what we are prepared to pay for land in the interests of afforestation, and that the Minister might be compelled to say it in his reply on this section of this debate, or at least on the Committee Stage of the Bill, because if we are not prepared to tell the people what we are prepared to pay them for their land, or to tell the courts what value they should put on land that is to be compulsorily acquired&mdash;and I underline the word &ldquo;compulsorily&rdquo;&mdash;then I say that we are largely wasting our time in debating this measure.</P>
    <P>On Section 4 of this Bill, about <Col N="1157" /> which again I really cannot make up my mind, I want Deputies to read the section and to read the Bill rather than the White Paper issued with it.  I want to emphasise that we are dealing with compulsory acquisition under Section 23 of the 1939 Act.  The section says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Where (a) the Minister has made an application under Section 23 of the Principal Act for an acquisition order in relation to any land held in commonage, (b) an acquisition order based on that application has come into force, and (c) as a result of the representation, being a representation specified in sub-section (2) of this section, of any of the owners in common of the land, the acquisition order is in respect of part only of the land.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On my first glance at this section, I could not understand it.  My second reading of the section was that it only applied to any commonage plot of land already taken by the Minister or his Department.  My third reading of the section, brought me back to my first view, that I do not know what to make of it.</P>
    <P>Then the section goes on to say that the following provisions shall have effect, that, if a vesting Order is made under Section 26 of the Principal Act, as from the vesting date, the remainder of the land shall cease to be held in common by the owners in common and shall be held in common by the objectors only, in various proportions, to the proportion of their former shares to one another in the whole of the land; and, that in respect of the interest in that remainder of each of the owners in common, other than the objectors, common rights have not been defined, whether they are joint tenants or tenants in common.</P>
    <P>Again, this section is beyond me, and who is going to interpret it I do not know; but the peculiar thing is that, in the following sub-sections, the Minister proposes that where you have a commonage and, say, there are 20 people in the commonage and five of them object, the commonage will be taken over compulsorily under this section, but the 15 people are going to <Col N="1158" /> get the compensation.  He does not specify what the rate of compensation is to be to the 15 who are to be compensated in respect of the whole of the commonage.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (3) of Section 4 provides the amount of the compensation payable under the Principal Act to each of the owners of commonages other than the objectors.  That sub-section reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The amount of compensation payable under the Principal Act to each of the owners in common other than the objectors shall be determined as if the whole of the land to which the Minister's application under Section 23 of the Principal Act related had been acquired by the vesting Order.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If words have any meaning, that means that where you have 40 common owners and 18 of them object, the other 22 will be paid the full value of the whole commonage.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;The amount of compensation payable under the Principal Act to each of the owners in common, other than the objectors, shall be determined as if the whole of the land to which the Minister's application under Section 23 of the Principal Act related had been acquired by the vesting Order.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>What I am pointing out to the Minister is if you have commonage X, and there may be 2,000 acres in it, he is providing that the people who agree to his application are going to be compensated for the whole of the Order made by him.  In other words the whole of the amount will be paid to the 22 people who row in with the Minister and the 18 objectors are left out in the cold.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I invite Deputies to read the Bill and to interpret sub-section (3) of Section 4 because that is what it says.  Here we have the position of the Minister compulsorily acquiring the commonage and if there are 40 owners and 18 objectors, the people who row in with the Minister will be compensated by somebody, I do not know if it is the Department, but the people who come in with the Minister are to be paid for the whole of the land while the 18 common owners who object are to be ruled out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saying it is correct; that that is the position under this Bill.  I invite every Deputy sitting behind the Minister to read the Bill and see what it says and decide whether my interpretation is the logical one or otherwise under this section.  If it does not mean that, then no doubt, in the course of the debate, the Minister will try and interpret for me and for the House what sub-section (3) of Section 4 does mean.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the only meaning at all events that I can take out of it. The main difficulty in Section 4, even as it at present stands, is whether it can only apply to land acquired now or <i>in futuro.</i> I have some doubts about that but I also suggest to the Minister <Col N="1160" /> in dealing with vested owners in commonages, and this is the main problem, that he will have to keep these circumstances in mind.  There are people who are fee simple owners, and I suggest to the Minister that they will stunt him under this section.  I suggest that this section is not going to disturb a single snipe in marginal lands in Mayo, Galway, Kerry or Donegal.</P>
      <P>I do not think that the Minister is well aware of the fact that the rights of partition were reserved under the 1939 Act.  Common owners in fee simple as I have stated can, if they are not able to solve their problems, file a petition, but this Section 4 is altogether a different cup of tea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I intended it to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, whatever the Minister intended, in my view this Bill, which I have described as &ldquo;stunt&rdquo; legislation, is not going to disturb one snipe in the commonages of Mayo, Galway, Kerry or Donegal.  The commonages will still be there when this Bill goes on the Statute Book.  This Bill is not going to solve the problems we have had in mind when we tabled a motion in this House.  This Bill does not provide at all for the question of rights or take any cognisance of the fact that the people on commonages may have rights&mdash;rights to go over commonages for water or different individual rights which they have acquired over a number of years by user and which would be some of the main obstacles in the path of the Department in acquiring these commonages.</P>
      <P>This Bill will not cut down the legal fence that I or anybody else can erect around these commonages from the point of view of the right of user acquired by the tenants using these commonages over generations.  This Bill has not a hope of dealing with owners in common who have undivided vested interests in commonages in law or from time immemorial.  These are the commonages that the Minister and his Department should be looking for and this machinery is not going to bring one perch of these commonages within the Minister's control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1161" /> I think some of my colleagues suggested during the debate in this House that the Minister, if he was serious about this matter and wanted to make progress, could nominate a limited administrator who might be an occupier as one who might accept proceedings for compulsory acquisition; that he should nominate the man in possession as being a limited administrator for the purpose of serving proceedings on him for compulsory acquisition.  That would be a simple procedure but it is not done under this Bill.  Instead you have the extraordinary procedure here by which the Minister and the Minister himself is going to examine titles. This is a new principle in this House and the legislation enshrined in this House.  The Minister is going to decide who should get the money.  It is the Minister now and the Minister alone who will have this decision.  This I want to point out of a new departure in Departments of State in this country.  We can well understand how that practice could be abused.  I, for one, at all events, strongly object to the principle that the Minister can decide on paying compensation to somebody who is in occupation for six years, for being disturbed.  I do not think the Minister is the person who should decide and I do not think this House should leave it to the Minister to decide whether X, who is in occupation, should get the money.</P>
    <P>The only protection for the State is that if Y turns up, the State has the technical right under the Bill to sue X for the money paid to him.  Of course, X will have left the country or will have divested himself of his assets.  The position is that, having paid compensation, the real owner comes along, and then the Minister will pay the real owner, but has the technical right to try to recover from the person already paid.  I object to the principle that the Minister should be put in the position of deciding any question of title.  He should not be in the position of deciding whether the man in occupation for six years should be paid compensation.</P>
    <P>I cannot for the life of me see why these sections should be introduced <Col N="1162" /> into the Bill, and I cannot for the life of me see how this question of making provision to compensate a temporary occupier is going to speed the acquisition of land for afforestation purposes. I invite the House to examine that proposal.  Deputies on all sides of the House will realise that it is as far removed from the practical acquisition of land for afforestation purposes as we are from the moon.</P>
    <P>The Minister avoided the question put to him that we should regard the temporary occupier as the occupier for the purpose of getting the land.  If the Minister is interested in getting land for forestry, why is this cumbersome machinery provided to pay compensation to the temporary owner?  Is the Minister serious in this measure?  If the Minister were serious, some indication would have been given to this House and the country as to what price he would be prepared to pay for land.  But that question has been let go.</P>
    <P>I think this measure has been designed for one purpose, and one purpose only, and that is to keep Deputy MacBride quiet, but evidently Deputy MacBride is not prepared to accept this measure, and I do not blame him. The best summarisation that I can make of Deputy MacBride's speech is, &ldquo;Adieu, adieu, adieu, I can no longer stay with you&rdquo;, so far as the Minister and the Government are concerned. Whether the Minister will let the parting grieve him or not I will not speculate, but that was the position here and the Minister had to tip off Deputy O'Hara to let down the guillotine on Deputy MacBride's head.  It does not appear that the parting does grieve Deputy Blowick, as Minister for Lands.</P>
    <P>It may well be that Deputy MacBride has decided that now is the time to get out from the sinking ship. However that may be, he has well and truly left it, and if this discussion has been of any interest to the House and the country, it will be that it has made it clear that all this talk about the wonderful peace and harmony between the Coalition Parties has now quite disappeared under this measure. Whether Deputy MacBride cannot see <Col N="1163" /> the wood for the trees, or whether the Minister cannot see Deputy MacBride for the wood, I do not know, but we have been left with this serious position.  I do not know whether I should condole with the Minister on the defection of Deputy MacBride, or congratulate Deputy MacBride on his escape from the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I must be a very courageous man to stand so close to the Minister, in view of his statement in column 906 when he says: &ldquo;If there is to be anything of that nature I, for one, will head men with guns to defeat it.&rdquo;  I have risked my life in coming so close to the Minister to-night and I would like to point out the fear and trembling felt throughout the country at the threat of the Minister for Lands to cause a national disruption.  I am taking my life in my hands, due to the risk of the Minister taking down his much-notched gun and firing at me across the House.  I hope the Taoiseach will broadcast to the nation, so as to quite the people's fears of what may happen when the Minister takes down his gun.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that he would take down his gun to prevent land being compulsorily taken for afforestation <Col N="1164" /> purposes, whereas he has just brought a measure to this House which is solely designed for the compulsory acquisition of land for forestry.  It would take a man such as the Minister to justify a position of that kind.  I have sufficient respect for the Minister's ingenuity and intrigue to realise that he never brought in a measure of this kind without knowing well what it means. He never brought in a measure of this kind without knowing that not a single snipe will disappear from one commonage in Mayo or elsewhere as a result of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister denied that and he was perfectly right.  This Bill was obviously brought in as a window-dressing Bill to try to retain Deputy MacBride in that wing of the shaken Coalition.  But evidently Deputy MacBride saw through it and handed in his gun to the Coalition last night. The Minister is now going to use it, but I do not think, when people study this Bill, that anybody will be under any impression that afforestation is going to advance in this country.  The Minister has clearly gone back from the target that he had his colleagues laid down and made so much talk about during the last election campaign.</P>

      <P>The Minister, in his speeches time and again, has pointed out that the commercial needs of the nation are 10,000 acres, and he is inclined to pat himself on the back that he and his Department will be able to maintain that 10,000 or 15,000 acres. Those on these benches who had 25,000 acres in mind can forget about it. That figure has gone now.  Those who went round the country to cross-roads meetings telling the people that the hillsides and the valleys would be planted can forget about it.</P>

      <P>Those who dangled the carrot before the people that the whole nation would be saved by this 25,000-acre programme can now forget about it.  Deputy O'Hara knows <Col N="1165" /> about the time when he and the Minister went round the West of Ireland, telling how trees were going to dry up the climate.  We were to have a new climate because of all the trees that were to be planted.  The people can now forget about the 25,000 acres&mdash; that has been abandoned and we are down to 12,000.  It is no wonder that the people whom the Minister described as &ldquo;the mad people shouting about trees, trees, trees&rdquo; now feel they have been sold out by the Minister and his colleagues on the aims that they set up for his Department some years ago.</P>
      <P>Not alone will there he no 25,000 acres, but the Minister is making sure that not one snipe will be disturbed on any commonage throughout the West of Ireland where the Minister is seeking land and where we know the Department could, with a bit of co-operation, get marginal land.  I suggest to the House&mdash;I have told the Minister already&mdash;that, in my view, it is impossible to amend this Bill.  It is the greatest slobber of a Bill ever introduced into this House.

      <P>I rise to congratulate the Minister on this Bill which I can foresee will help to remove obstacles in the drive for better afforestation. I was practically convinced a moment ago by the last speaker that the Minister was about to ride roughshod over the rights of the people.  I do not think he is that type of man.  I would strongly advocate an all-out drive for afforestation in the West, and especially in Connemara.</P>
      <P>The Minister recently made some references to afforestation and the programme for the West in Galway.  I am happy to note that, since 1950, we have had three forests planted where previously we had only one in Connemara, and that one on the very fringe.  From the point of view of giving employment, I think afforestation in the West would be one of the best planks in a save-the-Gaeltacht policy.  I should also point out its tourist value and its influence on climate in the West, apart from its value in providing a raw material that this country sadly lacks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that after myxomatosis young plants have a good chance to develop and that this is an opportune <Col N="1167" /> time for the Minister to forge ahead, before the return of the rabbit pest. To listen to some of the speakers here last night, and even a few moments ago, one would think that the Minister was to blame for the lack of afforestation in the West.  I wonder what was being done over the past 20 years by those who were in power?  Governments in the past have avoided afforestation because of its long-term nature and because of the fact that it is not a get-rich-quick policy.  I know the Minister cannot go out and plant like wildfire around the country; he must operate with caution.  I know what has happened in the West&mdash;there was one big flop which was well known as the graveyard of afforestation in Ireland.  The Minister is not just thinking of providing big figures for election purposes and I congratulate him on that, because what we need is the fully-grown trees, not just stunted failures.</P>
    <P>It has been said that only God can make a tree, but God helps those who help themselves.  I would suggest to the Minister that he should get all possible technical help in this all-out drive.  I welcome this Bill as a means of expediting afforestation, and especially as it affects my constituency. It will certainly provide work for which we are crying out.  It will provide raw material with a high labour content for many years to come.</P>
    <P>Finally, although big bodies move slowly, I hope the Minister will help in this all-out drive and I say: &ldquo;God bless the work and God speed the work.&rdquo;</P>

    <P>During the emergency a lot of landowners, and big landowners, in the Midlands got very large sums of money particularly towards the end and immediately after the war for extensive forests and belts of trees on their land.  In the last stages, the tree was cut and sold by the ton to Dublin sawmills and timber merchants.  Some of it was exported in the baulk.  Now it is embodied in the 1946 Act that it is obligatory on such people to replant Section 41 is defined as: &ldquo;Attachment of replanting conditions and preservation conditions to limited felling licences.&rdquo;  The section provides:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Whenever the Minister grants a limited felling licence (other than a limited felling licence relating exclusively to an exempted tree or trees)&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) he may, if he thinks fit, attach to the licence the following conditions, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i) a condition (in this section referred to as the planting condition)...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Again and again, I have taken up with the Minister's Department, from the point of view of providing employment, the fact that these men who grew rich overnight have never planted as much as a whin-bush.  I gave one specific case to the Minister's Department and I was told in the Department that the landowner had informed them that he had planted a wood in another part of his estate.  Now I am living in a forestry belt and I know that that statement was a life; I know that he never planted anything and I know that he converted a large part of his <Col N="1169" /> land into grazing.  That has occurred all over the country and, with one exception, I do not know of any big landowner who planted as much as a bush to replace what was sold for thousands of pounds.</P>
    <P>My advice to the Minister is to give a certain date.  In the beginning these people said they could not get wire; they could not get posts; they could not get proper fencing.  I am prepared, as a public representative, to give the Minister facts about all these estates and large farms.  I will give them to his Department.  I suggest that he fix a certain date for the replanting of these estates and, if the owners fail to implement that, the Minister should step in, take over the lands and replant them himself.</P>
    <P>There is a forestry unit in Castlepollard. In the initial stages that unit planted 600 acres of land.  Subsequently they took over more and more land.  That has provided excellent employment.  They are running short of land now.  Why not go in on these large estates where no planting has been done?  It is my duty to mention that two years ago the Coleman estate was offered to the Land Commission for sub-division and for afforestation.  Everything seemed to be going well.  No one lives on it. Nobody is employed on it.  Suddenly the Land Commission came to a decision, just one month ago, that they would defer any action for 12 months. Why has that been done?  The Forestry Division of the Land Commission were sure this land was coming up.  Everything was ready.  What has happened? Has the value of the grazing portion of the land gone up in the last 12 months?  Has somebody intervened in the Land Commission?  Has somebody approached the Minister and asked him not to take over the Coleman estate or defer its taking over?  The cadre for whom a considerable employment potential would be created may now pack up and emigrate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am indicating that there is a considerable portion of land <Col N="1170" /> which can be got very easily.  If provision to acquire the land does not exist in the Bill at the moment, it can be made on the Committee Stage, thereby achieving the object the Minister has in view in one particular respect.  I take it the Minister's view is also the view of the House.</P>
      <P>I live in a forest area and I know a little about forestry.  In my area Bord na Móna is operating within a couple of miles of the forestry unit, and in the bog of Bealnagun, from which 600 tons of turf go out every week, and where the minimum employment is about 250 and the maximum employment about 600, acres and acres of land are becoming available on this cut-away bog.  Here is an area in which the Minister can extend the work of the forestry unit.  Let him cut the red tape and the procedure and go ahead with replanting and providing employment for the people.  In my county the Brosna has been drained and water-logged lands have become available.  We have heard a good deal about drainage and forestry going hand in hand.  Here is an area in which the Minister can expand operations. I want to point out, too, that the Minister will have to increase the grant of £10 per acre to at least £30 per acre to make it economic for the farmers to take advantage of these grants.</P>
      <P>That is my contribution.  The particular point I wish to emphasise is that certain people have failed to comply with the conditions of Section 41 of the Forestry Act of 1946. The Minister should get his Department to investigate what has happened and he will have the full co-operation, in that investigation, of the general public.  His Department will have to be more active.  If necessary, he should get a better staff or hand over the work of forestry to someone who is prepared to put the Act into operation.</P>

      <P>I wish to refer to one aspect of Deputy Moran's speech. Deputy Moran seems to think that this <Col N="1171" /> Bill is brimful of references to the compulsory acquisition of land.  I have glanced through the Bill and, although Deputy Moran contends that 95 per cent of the measure refers to compulsory powers, I have failed to find the word &ldquo;compulsion&rdquo; or &ldquo;compulsory&rdquo; in any one of the provisions in the Bill. So much for that.</P>
      <P>During the debate on the Vote for Forestry last June the Minister promised to introduced the present measure.  He has implemented that promise now.  Having listened to many of the speakers, I think all Parties welcome the Bill.  As the Minister has said on many occasions, and as every Deputy knows, the real problem in relation to the development of forestry is the difficulty of acquiring land.  If this Bill has the effect of easing in some way that difficulty, the Minister will have done a good day's work.</P>
      <P>Many counties will be affected by this proposed legislation.  At the present time, there must be throughout the country thousands of acres of land suitable for afforestation purposes, which cannot be availed of because of legal difficulties.  I know of one instance of that in my own county, down in Omeath.  The people living in that part of the county have been agitating for many years past for an afforestation scheme, and the one obstacle in the way of the Forestry Department initiating a scheme in that area is the very obstacle that this Bill is designed to overcome, namely, the inability of local graziers to show clear title.</P>
      <P>I need not refer at this stage to the names of the six townlands involved, because all the details and data are in the hands of the Department.  Suffice it to say that the people concerned are extremely anxious for this afforestation scheme.  They realise that many advantages and benefits would result from it.  It would give employment in the area; it would protect agricultural land in the vicinity from trespassing by sheep and other animals; and it would enhance the scenic properties of the area.  In addition, it would provide a shelterbelt for the whole locality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1172" /> Some time ago, officials of the Forestry Department, and also of the Land Commission, visited Omeath. They made a survey of the area and got the signatures of the various tenants.  As I say, there are six townlands involved altogether and the fact that so many signatures have been obtained from these graziers is proof of the desire for an afforestation scheme in this part of North Louth.  I sincerely hope that this measure will have the effect of overcoming the difficulties in this particular case and that the long awaited planting of trees will materialise without further undue delay.  If this Bill is passed, as I am sure it will be, and if it has the effect of meeting the wishes of those people in Omeath, the Minister will have earned their sincere gratitude.</P>
    <P>I would like to compliment the Minister on introducing this legislation, but I do so on one condition, that he will adhere very strictly to his assurance that he will not bring into play compulsory powers for acquisition.  He said that his eventual annual target for the planting of trees is in the region of 25,000 acres.  His efforts to achieve that target should be helped considerably by this Bill.  It should also enable this acquisition difficulty to be overcome.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on his stand with regard to compulsory acquisition.  He has stated on more than one occasion that he will not be a party to forcing any man to part with his land.  We all agree that forestry is very important to a country and that it brings great benefits and advantages to it.  It provides employment; it has a beneficial effect on the climate; it brings natural beauty to a countryside; and its contribution to its industrial progress is evident.  However, I think the Minister is perfectly right when he makes it abundantly clear that no progress in afforestation can be justified, if it trespasses on the rights of a man to his own property.  I am satisfied that he will do all in his power to carry out a great afforestation drive while, at the same time respecting the rights of people.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, whilst I do not think this Bill will have the effect of a magic <Col N="1173" /> wand being waved over all these difficulties and disposing of them, at least it is a step in the right direction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFlynn" hpid="Mr. J. Flynn Mr. J. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the efforts of the Minister in trying to solve these difficulties.  I also appreciate the Minister's effort, by the introduction of legislation, to clarify this question of title.  During the previous Government's period of office, my experience was that, in one particular case, for three long years, we had to contest the question of title with the owners, sub-landlords, landlords and so on, people who were residing outside the country.  It certainly was difficult for the Department and for the Minister concerned to do anything, but eventually the position was clarified.  I am glad now that the Minister in his proposed legislation is making it possible to ease that problem of title, so that his Department can make progress.</P>
      <P>I am not at all sure as to how the Minister will succeed under Section 4 of this legislation.  My experience down in our part of the country is that, in regard to commonages, where a number of people have a common grazing right over an extensive area, it is difficult to segregate the people who will consent to the Department's proposals and the people who will not see eye to eye with the Department, in regard to allowing their portions of land to be used for afforestation purposes.  However it is good to see the effort that is being made in that direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister and his Department should move very carefully in the question of commonages. They are a vital part of the economic life of the people on mountain land. There are sheep owners who have extensive commonages and rights over extensive areas, and it would interfere with their way of life, if great care is not taken in approaching this question of acquiring the part of the commonages which may be vital to their husbandry. Even with the best intentions in the world, it may be made difficult for these people if care is not taken by the Department in the segregation and adjustment of their rights.  There may be a question of acquiring by agreement, which is quite a different <Col N="1174" /> thing.  In afforestation, you must have goodwill and agreement between the owners of the land and those acting on behalf of the State.  Otherwise, the scheme may not be successful.  You must have the whole neighbourhood co-operating with the Department with goodwill and then the scheme is bound to be successful.  If you have litigation by some group of people who are not satisfied with the arrangement, then things are not as they should be.</P>
    <P>I was listening to some points made last night in regard to what could be done by the Minister.  I am not going into the question of administration.  I suggest there is another way in which the Minister could add to the pool of land which he stated was available. When migration schemes are being operated by the Land Commission, they should bear in mind the portions of land which could be made available to the Forestry Section.  For instance, we have people whom we are anxious to migrate from South Kerry; and portions of the area from which they are being migrated are eminently suitable for afforestation.  The Minister could consider that point.  That land could be added to the pool market out for afforestation in those areas.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister whether he would accept a proposal or an amendment that the Land Commission be requested to take over portion of the holdings of migrants for afforestation, or could that be dealt with already under the administration of the Land Commission and under their forestry programme?  If not, he could make it quite clear in his reply to the point I have raised.</P>
    <P>In areas where the Department state it would not be possible for them to have commercial timber&mdash;for example, seaport districts in South Kerry, the area along Valentia, Sneem and Waterville&mdash;could the Department not arrange for the growing of timber for wood pulp, second or third-rate timber, that would create employment and be an asset to the State at a later date?  Could that not be one end of the afforestation drive, letting the commercial timber be grown on the more suitable and in other parts of the country?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1175" /> I appreciate what the Minister is doing at the moment and what Deputy Derrig did when he was Minister, for our part of the county in the South Kerry constituency.  I appreciate what is being done at the moment in trying to establish extra forestry centres.  At the same time, I would impress on the Minister, even under this legislation, the points I have put about the migration of smallholders and the adding to the area of land which he requires.  I am confident that this Bill will be a success.  It will need careful handling and it will take some time to work out the programme, especially in regard to the vast areas of commonages in mountain districts, but it is a step in the right direction.  I hope the Minister will consider what can be done with the area I have mentioned, the seaport districts which up to now have been regarded as a problem in themselves, a problem that the Forestry Department was very slow to deal with.  I conclude by wishing the Minister success in his effort to handle this problem.  As far as we are concerned, we will co-operate in every possible way to make it a success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill and I feel, as I am sure many other Deputies feel, that it is long overdue. I cannot see why several Deputies who have spoken seem to have any fear that it will impose any particular hardship on any section of the community. After all, it is only a Bill to facilited the Forestry Department in acquiring land.  There appear to be adequate safeguards in the Bill to ensure that no hardship of any sort will be imposed on any citizens of the State.  They have the full resources of the law and the Constitution to protect them in any appeal they wish to make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also welcome this Bill as it deals with commonages and common grazing plots, as an earnest that it is the policy of the Department to move from the lowlands to where they always should have been planting timber-on the highlands.  It is my experience in my constituency that great difficulties are met in trying to acquire land in <Col N="1176" /> mountainous districts, such as we have in that particular county.  It is nearly always the case that these lands that are offered are owned, not by one person but conjointly by six, seven or even a dozen people.  Under present legislation, it is impossible to acquire that land as needed.  I think this Bill meets the case and that it is sound in that way.</P>
    <P>I have personal knowledge of a plot of 500 acres which is at present offered to the Department, but which they are unable to acquire because of the numerous holders, who are held up, if even one person objects.  I know of another case where there are ten holders, and two or three objectors, in which the Department is able to do nothing.  This Bill should ease the situation and make available the right type of land for planting.  In Ireland, we cannot afford to plant land that is arable.  We have not got enough arable land as it is to give everyone a full and complete economic holding. even where land is divided up at a faster rate then at present, or even where it is acquired.  It is absolutely essential that the Forestry Department keep off that land.</P>
    <P>Another difficulty that often arises is that the Department may be offered a section in which there are hundreds of acres but which includes some 30 or 40 acres of arable land.  I do not know if there is any legislation in this Bill to simplify that.  I have not been able to satisfy myself clearly on that point. I know that where that set of circumstances obtains, we have the usual frustration and delay.  There seem to be more title transfer difficulties existing between the Forestry Section of the Department and the Department itself, than there is actually in the deals they may have to make with outside bodies.  So far as I know the position, if there is a parcel of land taken over, which contains 50 or 60 arable acres, that land has to be offered to the Land Commission.  They have to inspect it and it seems from the interminable delays that the Land Commission have a different method of purchasing land from that of the Forestry Department, which leads to these indefinite and interminable <Col N="1177" /> delays.  I would ask the Minister to consider that problem, and if he is unable to satisfy the House that such is not the case, he could bring in further legislation&mdash;we have a Forestry Bill before the House, long overdue&mdash;to make that point clear.</P>
    <P>There is another thing that militates greatly against the furtherance of afforestation.  There seems to be some idea&mdash;maybe a regulation; I do not know&mdash;in dealing with forestry that it is quite impossible to open a centre, unless it will be an economic proposition. Deputies on all sides know that we spend thousands of pounds in starting industries.  From the speeches I have heard in this debate, it has been pretty heartening to know that most Deputies maintain that forestry is one of the most important assets we have that has not been fully utilised here. Why should we hesitate to set up forestry centres, unless they are economic?</P>
    <P>I have had lands offered to me by people in my constituency.  I recollect that at one time a certain constituent came to me who had 50 acres that was fit for nothing but planting, that required nothing but planting.  It did not even need draining or cleaning and it was 50 acres on which timber had been cut down and sold.  This has happened, not once, but on several occasions.  He was prepared to transfer that land to the Department, but they would not take it because of some obsolete regulation under which, if it was more than a certain distance from the nearest forestry centre, it would not be economic.  That seems to be a matter to which the Minister could give his attention.  If there is any doubt in his mind in relation to this, I am sure the file could be found in both these cases I have mentioned and it could be shown the Department had refused to accept land which was suitable for that purpose, and no other.</P>
    <P>This debate started by the Minister has covered a fairly wide area, dealing with afforestation as a whole.  As this Bill is generally intended for the furthering of afforestation, I think it would be no harm to mention the fact that the State are not the only people <Col N="1178" /> who can afforest.  It is the duty of the State to aid and assist, in any way they can, private enterprise.  For the past 20 years, in spite of the rising cost of labour, the rising cost of trees to be bought in the nurseries and the material to protect the trees, the State subvention to people who plant privately has remained the same. Surely the Minister and his officials must realise that there is no encouragement for any private individual to plant any land he may have in the amount he will receive at present from the State.  I may be wrong, but I think the amount is £10 an acre.</P>

      <P>There is another point.  In Wexford, where we have a certain amount of afforestation, and in other parts of Ireland such as I have seen, we always seem to concentrate on the one type of tree.  At one time, we had the Douglas Pine&mdash;the Forestry Department seemed to be extremely keen on Douglas trees, and nothing else.</P>

      <P>I have been anxious to hear a discussion on forestry since I came into this House last May.  Prior to that I took a very deep interest in the value of trees in our country.  Back in 1926 we endeavoured to induce the then Government to embark on a policy of afforestation.  I think the Minister's records could prove that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In dealing with this Bill what I have to say will be very different from what <Col N="1180" /> other Deputies have stated.  It will be a litany of facts and they will not reflect very great credit on the Forestry Department.</P>
    <P>In March, 1953, an officer from the Forestry Department came to the area where I live.  By mere concidence he called on me and asked if I would be able to give him information in regard to a particular area of 1,120 acres.  I was glad of the opportunity.  I asked him how it came that he was in the area and he replied that it was as a result of an old resolution which came to the Department in 1926.  I asked him if he had any later communication from that particular body and he said he had not.  I told him that I was a member of a deputation in 1931 which sent a resolution to the Forestry Branch in connection with the same land.  There was no record of that. How the 1926 one came to light is beyond me.</P>
    <P>We had the ordnance sheets and we examined them and I was able to point out to him the type of land it was, its suitability for forestry purposes. He gave me a number of consent forms and I was to go around to do a lot of canvassing and to get the consent forms forwarded to the Department. I had not time to do that.  I did not do that but I heard no more from this officer.</P>
    <P>When I was elected to Dáil Eireann I had in mind that I would be able to render some service to my constituents with regard to afforestation.  I put down a question seeking information in connection with this visit to our part of the country.  I was unable to elicit any information.  I wrote then to the Forestry Branch in connection with the matter and received a reply dated 30th July, 1955.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I received this letter of the 30th July, 1955:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A Chara, &mdash;I am directed by the Minister for Lands to refer to the inspection by the Forestry Division on 24th May, 1955, of the commonage areas of Poulawaddra, Caherleheen and Skahanagh, County Kerry, comprising a total area of 1,120 acres, approximately, and to inform you that the inspection revealed the bulk of the ground to be unplantable and quite unsuitable for acquisition for State afforestation purposes.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances, the Minister does not propose to take any further steps to acquire these lands.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Can the report be made available on which that decision was based in regard to this land, which, to my mind, is eminently suitable for forestry purposes? <Col N="1182" /> With a bald statement you can get the brush-off if you are prepared to accept it.  &ldquo;Unsuitability&rdquo; covers a multitude.  This particular land is shown on the ordance sheet as &ldquo;The Woodlands&rdquo;.  There is ample evidence that this land had been planted centuries ago and grew timber successfully. I do not say that that would apply to the 1,120 acres but I will say that a good proportion of that land is capable of producing trees.  In my own memory and in my father's memory, this land was held by the landlords, the Blennerhassets of Ballyseedy.  It grew threes then, and it was a crime to take the trees.</P>
    <P>Now the experts of 1955 tell us this land is unsuitable for tree-growing.  I wish the Minister could give us a report on the number of times this land was turned down and described as unsuitable for afforestation.  Perhaps I am not sailing close enough to the Bill before the House, but there are other little grumbles I have with this Department. I have been approached by a great many of my constituents with regard to afforestation in our county. I may say at this stage that I do not know whether the Minister is aware of it or not, but, in North Kerry, there is no evidence that such a Department as his exists.  A big portion of North Kerry forms a Gaeltacht area and yet the Forestry Section has not given one bit of grant or planted a single tree in this four-seat constituency.</P>
    <P>I do not wonder at all that Deputy O'Hara wanted to have the <i>status quo</i> retained as regards afforestation.  We all know what is happening in Mayo. It is to get a plantation scheme involving 5,000 acres.  Naturally, the cry there is: &ldquo;Go home you, Jack; I am all right.&rdquo;  Every man christens his own child first.  Mayo is very lucky. They have under way a scheme for the planting of 12,500 acres.  One person in Kerry asked me to make representations to the Department with regard to a hill side farm of 110 acres which, in my view, is absolutely suitable for tree growing.  The man's name is Lynch and he lives at Annagh, Tralee, County Kerry.  I wrote to the Department last winter to inspect this place and report as to its suitability.  Apparently Mr. <Col N="1183" /> Lynch was communicated with and asked what price he expected.  I do not know what price he asked for, but I got back a letter to say that the price was too big.  There was no further indication that the Department was interested.</P>
    <P>Of course, I knew myself that they had no interest in the area at all.  That farm I have mentioned would have linked up very suitably with the neighbouring area of 1,100 acres of the Foley estate on which there is living evidence of beautiful timber.  The 1914-18 war did away with a considerable amount of that and with more modern machinery, with system tractors and long hawsers, it became denuded of its timber&mdash;and that land which grew trees out of which six tons of commercial timber could be taken is now described as unsuitable.  I made representations on behalf of Thomas Buckley of Banemore, Listowel, who had suitable land which had grown timber successfully.  He is prepared to offer that land which adjoins another holding which would also be suitable for afforestation.  There is more suitable land nearby at Kilbane, Ballymacelligott, near Glanageenty where the Earl of Desmond was beheaded.  All this makes up a huge tract of suitable land which is available without any reference to this Bill.  There is no necessity for this Bill at all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KathleenOConnor" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>There is more land available for afforestation than the Minister apparently knows, but neither himself nor his Department is interested. I am making that statement in all seriousness.  I wonder if I could get a statement from the Minister when he is winding up the debate assuming me that he will interest himself in the land we have to offer.  He does not have to wait until this Bill goes through before he gets this land; he can go and get it now and I guarantee him, without exaggeration, that he will get 3,000 acres of suitable land for afforestation in North Kerry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is my duty to mention in connection with all this&mdash;and I will not <Col N="1184" /> pull any punches in this&mdash;that an officer from the Department came to my house while I was here in Dublin.  At the time I had put down a question, but I was prevented from developing it because I was new to parliamentary procedure and because the question was a hard one to frame, anyway.  The officers from this Department are so sure of themselves that one dares not to question their authority or their judgment.  This officer who called at my house in my absense was quite conversant with what my question was driving at.  He made some disparaging reference to the question and went as far as to say that people should keep their mouths shut when they did not know what they were talking about. I say here and now that, if I were at home at the time, I would have dealt with that gentleman in the way he deserved to be dealt with.  I should like the Minister to call &ldquo;heel up&rdquo; to these gentlemen.  After all, the Oireachtas are the bosses; they are the boys who have the final say.  I think the boot is on the other foot though, because they are being thwarted by anonymous civil servants.</P>
    <P>What is our approach to forestry at all?  I can tell you that I am interested in it not since I came into Leinster House.  I can produce evidence where away back in 1931 I made puny efforts, if you wish to describe them as such, to do something about trees; and if we had a Government then that would treat afforestation as it should be treated, if we had statement instead of politicians, we probably would not be in the sorry plight we are in to-day. If we had a Government who would take it seriously, what raw materials we would have to-day to establish our newsprint factory and all the other subsidiary factories which would accrue from a reasonable effort at the time it should be made!  Surely we can leave something to posterity.  If men went out and gave their lives and died in the effort, they had nothing to gain; we have nothing to gain, and we are not asked to give our lives, but to give our time and reasonable thought to afforestation and leave something tangible to posterity which they can use and be thankful for.  I must quote the Minister's statement: <Col N="1185" />&ldquo;We are now planting at a rate sufficient to meet our commercial timber needs in 45 to 50 years' time and there is nothing more we can do on that from except to ensure that the Forestry Division is given a proper opportunity to maintain and develop the plantations in the proper way.  I want to say on that score that when I first took office as Minister for Lands, I did not fully appreciate the extent to which a rapid increase in fresh planting could detract attention from the requirements of the existing plantations.  That fact did not become apparent until 1951 and the Minister who took over from me in that year announced to this House in introducing the Forestry Estimate for 1952-53 (Volume 132, columns 1966-68, debate of 1st.  July, 1952) that it would be necessary to reduce the planting rate for that year to 12,500 acres in order to make sure that arrears of work in the existing plantations received attention.  We cannot quarrel with him for that, as every Deputy must realise that the care of existing plantations must take precedence over fresh planting.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Does it require an expert to look after trees at the different stages?  Surely it is a labourer's job, with a skilled man to every dozen.  Was it necessary to suspend operations to take care of the younger flock coming up while we exported manpower day after day, year in year out, from the country? We will have to have a more realistic approach to that problem than we have had heretofore.  That should never be offered as an excuse, that shortage of labour prevented you from pursuing your programme or policy with regard to afforestation.  Caution should never be the watchword with regard to it. If we are over-anxious, if we have to have an assurance that every effort of ours will be 100 per cent., then we will get nowhere.  There should be a little element of chance, and sacrifice this caution for a bit of speed.</P>
    <P>I am parochial in my outlook in regard to this thing, as I stated at the outset.  This Department, as far as North Kerry is concerned, might not <Col N="1186" /> exist.  There is no activity there; there is no tree planting there.  They have never gone there, as far as I am aware, except in my limited experience to turn down an offer of suitable land. I forgot to mention that&mdash;an area west, but an area stretching for ten miles long and any depth you like.  It is hilly land, but I would say without fear of contradiction that you would get 6,000 acres of suitable land for afforestation in that territory without reference to the proposed Bill.</P>
    <P>I am going to make it my business to hear the Minister's reply.  I would like an assurance from him that there will be an even distribution of the benefits accruing from the policy of afforestation.  We are entitled to some consideration&mdash;a four-seat constituency in a Gaeltacht area and no appearance by the Forestry Department in that area yet.  This thing is under way since 1930, since when I would say there is some talk about afforestation.  I made up my mind when I was elected to Dáil Éireann &mdash;this is not hysteria about trees at all as I am not a bit hysterical &mdash;to make myself a nuisance as long as I was in this House with regard to that and to fight for what I call our rights.  Our claims to a fair proportion of the expenditure and of the wealth that will accrue from afforestation are just.  I intend to make myself, as I said before, a nuisance, and if I never did anything else in my sojourn in Leinster House, if I succeed in getting at least that I will say that I have justified my existence to my constituents.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I gathered from the Minister that the object of this Bill is to make it easier to acquire land for forestry, especially land held in commonage. I have just a doubt in my mind about the provisions of the Bill in that respect.  While I am with the Minister about getting more land, and getting it as easily as he can, nevertheless he is aware, and all Deputies are aware, that there are many people who have commonages on mountains at the moment with small uneconomic farms in the foothills of those mountains. A big portion of their livelihood is drawn from sheep grazing on the <Col N="1187" /> mountains.  Without the commonage on the mountain, many of them could not exist in their present holdings. That is a well-known fact.</P>
      <P>I want to suggest to the Minister that if this Bill gives him further far-reaching powers in respect of acquiring large areas of commonage, he should take into consideration what the loss of that commonage may be to many of the small farmers living in the foothills, and some arrangement should be made to provide other land for them.  That is of the greatest possible importance.  I can think of a fair number of farmers with small acreages of arable land, having a large commonage on the hills, whose livelihood is derived principally from sheep on the hills and who could not possibly get a fair standard of living from the arable land they are living on.  I hope that it will be the concern of the Minister and his Department in acquiring lands not to force out many of these people on the commonages.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to see forestry going ahead even faster than it is, but nevertheless there are a great number of people having in the foothills on small farms in areas in Wexford suitable for forestry and they use these commonages for grazing. Now if the Minister acquires portions of these commonages, these people will be forced out; that is, the people who object.  What I ask the Minister is that, in acquiring these commonages, consideration should be given to these people who are depending on them for a livelihood and alternative land should be made available to them.</P>
      <P>I want further to suggest that, when lands come into the hands of the Land Commission in eastern counties, they should be kept in a pool in order to be given to these people who are put out of the commonages as alternative land.  That land should be used for that purpose, and that is the plea I am making to the Minister.  The Minister, on the motion by Deputy Blaney a couple of nights ago, stated, I believe, that a couple of objectors who might not agree to acquisition voluntarily would be squeezed out, or words to that affect.</P>

      <P>I will give the Minister's words as reported at column 907 in the Official Report of November 16th, and, as I read through them, I can see a certain amount of danger.  The Minister said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The Bill I propose will deal with that matter.  I intend to leave them their share in the common, but only their share.  Say, for instance, that we have 18 shareholders in the common, and there are 15 or 16 of these who are willing to sell.  What I propose to do is to buy these out.  I <Col N="1189" /> have taken the power to partition the common and leave the other two or three there.  If they find themselves left there with their own little bit, they will soon come around all right.  That is one of the clauses which I hope to put in the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">

      <P>They will come round all right, but it is a very different question from being forced out.  There would be no doubt about that.  There would be nothing wrong in what the Minister suggested.  I would not have any objection to their being forced out, provided the Minister makes provision for them, as an alternative.  That portion of the commonage should not be taken from them, leaving them with an uneconomic holding.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>That is my point of view and I think this is the proper time to put it to the Minister.  At another stage in the speech, the Minister said he is going to become a gunman&mdash;God forbid&mdash;to lead a move against compulsory acquisition.  The Minister gave the impression that he was going to lead a column of toughs to fight compulsory acquisition, and they were to have guns.  I would not like to see the Minister do that.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Many sections of the Bill are concerned with the acquiring of commonages and the creating of titles for commonages.  That is the main principle in the Bill and to what extent the Minister may get land, I do not know.  I suppose he has got the advice of his experts in the matter and <Col N="1190" /> of their experience over many years past, and that this Bill is a result of that.  While it may help in giving title and all the rest of it, I do not think the Bill will help to bring commonages into the pool.  I do not think it will, unless the Minister takes steps through the Land Commission and through voluntary acquisition to provide, within reasonable distance alternative land for these people.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister has sufficient information and knowledge of the value of some of these commonages and of the people who live in these foothills, with small portions of land, to understand their position.  The Minister should make provision in any compulsory acquisition for alternative holdings for the people concerned.  If he is in a position to offer fair alternative holdings, then the use of compulsory powers at that stage could not be wrong, in any way.</P>
      <P>On the general question of forestry, there has been a good deal of criticism about what has been done in the past 30 years, but nevertheless what was done was done well.  I am convinced of that.  I have always said that of all the Departments of State, although I do not want to throw any bouquets at the Minister or his Department, the Department of Forestry is the most efficient of them all.  They do their work in an orderly manner; they know their objective and they reach it all the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Land is difficult to acquire.  I do not agree that all the barren mountains of this country are capable of growing timber.  Many thousands of acres are not capable of growing it.  To grow good timber you need more than a barren mountain with nothing on it but rocks and if people who are talking to-day of the neglect of the Department of Forestry would look at these barren mountains and think that they are capable of growing timber, then they have been misinformed if they have been told that that is so.  Mr. Cameron suggested that we should plant for social purposes in the West of Ireland but I do not think we have yet reached that stage.  While it is very desirable to give employment in the West of Ireland, I do not think <Col N="1191" /> that all the barren land we see there is fit for growing timber.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Mr. Cameron did not confine himself to the social programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Government has any intention of trying to develop the West of Ireland, there is plenty of scope for it in other directions than in planting trees from which we have no hope of producing anything but scrub timber.  For 30 years we have had people in this House advocating the planting of timber from which we would get nothing but scrub trees.  I do not think the Government should allow that to happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The social programme never envisaged planting for scrub.  It envisaged the planting of second quality stock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>We have seen small areas of timber planted where there has been no proper shelter and as a result these plantations have been failures.  I was often told that the west wind, while it is generally mild, is most dangerous for forestry and where an area is exposed to the west or north-west wind, it is most difficult to grow timber on it.</P>
      <P>On the general question, I think there is a measure of agreement all over the House that we must step up the area planted each year.  If this Bill brings in a large pool of land, I am sure that within a couple of years the Forestry Department will find itself planting a larger area.  I have strong views on the amount of employment that will be given by afforestation. There is nothing that grows on the land that will provide as much employment as forestry.  It may be that afforestation will not give a return for 50 or 60 years but it will give a considerable amount of employment in its development.  If the land is available, it will step up employment in the areas where planting takes place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a Forestry Bill and I suppose I would not be out of order in mentioning another aspect of forestry that has been neglected.  The Minister <Col N="1192" /> mentioned that the total area available for forestry is about 1,000,000 acres. However, we will still have about 15,000,000 or 16,000,000 acres of hill, bog and mountian and of that what are probably 13,000,000 acres capable of being planted.  We are looking forward to only 1,000,000 acres being planted in our time but you still will have at least 12,000,000 acres in the hands of private owners.  I want to suggest that there is greater scope for the development of the growing of trees on those other 12,000,000 acres than the Forestry Department can ever hope to achieve.</P>
    <P>If there was some encouragement given to the private owners of land to plant more trees, it would be much better.  It should be the slogan of the Department of Forestry and the Minister to every landowner that he should plant some additional trees every year. I would go further and suggest that the Minister should persuade the Government and the local authorities to allow committees of agriculture to have a wholetime forester on their staffs who would aid the private owners of land in the planting of trees.</P>
    <P>Thousands and tens of thousands of acres of private forests owned by private people were cut down in the first and second world wars and very few of them have been replanted.  During the last 15 or 20 years powers were given to the Forestry Department to tell these people that they must replant but I do not think that there is any compulsory power in the hands of the Minister to compel these people to replant.  Something must be done about that although I am not suggesting that it is necessary to have compulsory powers.</P>
    <P>This country has been denuded of whatever commercial timber was held in private ownership.  People engaged in the native timber sawmill industry will tell you that they find it impossible to get timber from private owners.  All that timber was felled during the two wars and a great deal of it was exported from this country in the first World War.  This matter should be taken much more seriously and the Government should take the matter more seriously.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1193" /> The grants given by the Department of Forestry are said to be the same as they were 20 years ago.  That is so, and the grant of £10 an acres should be doubled at least in view of present rates of wages, present prices of land and trees and the cost of planting and fencing which have certainly gone up over 100 per cent.  I want to plead with the Minister for Lands to allow&mdash; and provide for it in legislation&mdash;any local authority willing to do so, to have a whole-time forester on its staff. Wexford County Council some years ago were willing to do that but got no encouragement in official quarters and never received sanction for the appointment. It was put up to the Department but nothing more ever happened. They have no power to do that at the present time.  If we had a forester who was also a propagandist and who would act as technician and adviser to each landholder who wanted to plant trees, we would get more trees planted in a year than the Forestry Department would be capable of planting in five years.</P>
    <P>There is a huge amount of waste land on every holding and the trees cut down over the last 30 or 40 years &mdash;in a large number of cases&mdash;have not been replanted.  Farmers may have unsuitable lands from the Forestry Department's viewpoint because they are too small and the cost of fencing and maintenance and protection would be far too high.  The owners of the land should be given every possible encouragement by increasing the grant and making technical assistance available to them.</P>
    <P>On the question of the prices, if the Department are prepared to pay for land which they wish to acquire for forestry, I think those are mean and unfair prices from the owners' point of view.  These are the prices that were offered 20 years ago.  Land prices have gone up like everything else and the owner of the hillside, bog or commonage&mdash;whatever it may be&mdash;is entitled to fair compensation for what&mdash; ever property he owns.  Definitely the Forestry Department will have to reject offer of land which come in <Col N="1194" /> from time to time when the land is quite inferior and would not grow the best trees, but apart from that there is quite a lot of land which the owners would be prepared to make available if they got a reasonable price.  While the Forestry Department or the Land Commission or the Department of Finance are measly and mean about what they are prepared to pay, the rate at which land will come in will be much slower than it need be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture (Mr. O. Flanagan)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister pointed out, the Bill is designed to facilitate the acquisition of land for forestry purposes.  The first two lines of the Explanatory Memorandum issued with this Bill give Deputies a complete idea of the purpose of the Bill.  When we see a Bill with this aim and object in view being introduced we must come to the conclusion that the Bill is of a progressive nature.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and I would welcome any measure which would equip the Minister with the powers and facilities necessary to go full steam ahead with afforestation.  In the course of this debate there has been a good deal of criticism.  Some of it may be necessary, more of it may be unnecessary, but the Forestry Department has been under fire in this House for the past two days.  A number of Deputies stated that there were creaks from the bones of the Forestry Department. I think that is a very good thing.  I think it would be a bad thing if the Forestry Department's bones were just left to rest in peace.  It is a healthy sign to hear creaks from these bones.  Despite the very serious criticism that has been hurled at the Department it must be borne in mind that in the past seven years 80,000 acres of land have been planted and that, I feel, is no mean acreage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very heartening for Deputies who support the Government to hear the speeches of the Minister for Lands and of Deputy MacBride on forestry because if there had been more people like the present Minister for Lands and Deputy MacBride, with the same energy, ability and sincerity, working for afforestation 25 or 30 years ago, we <Col N="1195" /> would not be talking about planting to-day but we would be giving serious consideration to the best means of disposing of our surplus timber.  I am sure it must be the great envy of the Fianna Fáil Party that we on this side of the House have such afforestation enthusiasts as the Minister for Lands and Deputy MacBride.</P>
    <P>It is quite true that the bones of the Forestry Department are now creaking, and if they are, it is entirely due to the great energy, zeal and determination of the present Minister and of Deputy MacBride when he was a Minister.  I think it is also to the credit of Deputy MacBride that, when he was Minister for External Affairs in the first inter-Party Government, the efforts and emphasis he placed at that time on afforestation have borne good results and have had effect through the years since.  I feel if there had been people like the present Minister and Deputy MacBride in the public life of this country as administrators years ago, much of the talk as to the first steps in afforestation that are now being taken would be well over.  We would not be listening to the volume of criticism that is being hurled at the Forestry Department now.</P>
    <P>The present Minister for Lands is sincere and I have no doubt that under his administration there will be very great progress so far as planting and afforestation are concerned.  I have no doubt that, with the co-operation of the House, very important steps will be taken to have more public attention focussed upon the activities of the Forestry Department.  Afforestation is very important from the point of view of providing employment.  There are people employed by the Forestry Department to-day who were not employed by that Department six or eight years ago and I venture to say that in five or ten years to come there will be a considerable improvement due to the facilities which the Forestry Department will be given under this Bill to expedite the acquisition of land for afforestation.</P>
    <P>The employment given by afforestation is of the utmost importance.  We have heard Deputies say here that <Col N="1196" /> they could see no progress in that respect in their constituencies and they could see no employment.  Indeed, one Deputy stated that not a single tree had been planted in his constituency.  Certainly I have not that pitiful tale to tell in so far as my constituency is concerned.  The constituency I represent has been very closely associated with the work of the Forestry Branch for a number of years past.  There are four forests in the area and they form the greatest single concentration of State forests in the country.  They cover some 17,500 acres, of which about 11,000 acres are productive.  There are very extensive forests on the Slieve Bloom ranges.  I only wish that some of the Deputies who participated in this debate had some first-hand knowledge of the very valuable work that the Forestry Branch have done and the very valuable work that is in progress on the Slieve Bloom mountains.</P>
    <P>The Minister had occasion to visit that area recently in connection with a further important development in relation to afforestation.  He came to open a new forestry training college in Kinnitty in Offaly.  There are a number of students in that college now actively engaged in training.  These young men will be the future forestry experts.  When their training is completed they will be sent out to various centres all over the country, centres in the constituencies that have been referred to here, where not even one tree has been planted, and they will pass on there the benefit of their expert knowledge and training.  In that way the forestry prosperity that I see in my constituency may prove in time the happy and pleasant experience of Deputies in other constituencies and they, like me, will be able to pay the same tribute to the Forestry Branch that I in justice feel bound to pay them.</P>
    <P>Apart from the planting of trees, there is the thinning and the care and attention which must be given to the young trees.  That provides work for many men.  Indeed, one of the difficulties that presented itself in Laois-Offaly was the problem of finding enough labour to participate in the employment offered in certain areas.  It <Col N="1197" /> is true that the work may be far away from the towns and workers may have a considerable distance to travel, but it must be remembered that land suitable for afforestation cannot always be found as convenient to a town as the workers would like it to be.  In some parts of my constituency, thinning operations had to be suspended and a good deal of inconvenience was caused to the officers of the Forestry Branch because sufficient labour could not be procured.</P>
    <P>In Laois-Offaly we have been very fortunate in so far as afforestation is concerned.  We are fortunate in having the new college opened there.  The establishment of that college is a step in the right direction.  Indeed its establishment was long overdue.  Whatever else may be said about the Forestry Branch, this Bill is a definite sign of life and the opening of the new training college in Kinnitty is a definite sign of activity.  But, so far as I am concerned, the best sign that I see is the energy and zeal and earnestness displayed by the Parties comprising this Government in relation to afforestation.  Deputy Allen need have no fears so far as this Government is concerned.  Whatever he may accuse the Minister of, he need have no fear that there is any danger that the Minister will every say, in so far as the acquisition of land is concerned, that he will fill ten fields full of inspectors so that he can chuck out all the old &ldquo;cods&rdquo;.  There will be no fences pulled down and no threats such as we have heard in connection with the acquisition and user of land from other Ministers in the past.</P>
    <P>I think very useful work will result from this Bill because, when land can be more easily acquired for afforestation purposes, there will be more planting done; there will be more preparation of the land, more drainage and more thinning.  As Deputy MacBride has pointed out, all these things form an important source of employment.  When I hear Fianna Fáil Deputies lamenting that greater progress has not been made in afforestation, I remember, as I have very often had occasion to remember, that when Fianna Fáil are out of office they are <Col N="1198" /> full of the most marvellously progressive ideas; when they are in office, on the other hand, we do not hear so much about the ideas or the very progressive plans.  It would have been a wonderful asset to the country if Fianna Fáil, when they held office for 20 years, or thereabouts, bent the energy about which their members have been so vocal in relation to this Bill towards developing afforestation.</P>
    <P>As a result of the genuine efforts of Deputy MacBride and the sincerity of the Minister for Lands, more work was done by the inter-Party Government in four years than was done in the 17 or 18 years of the Fianna Fáil Administration, in so far as afforestation is concerned.  That cannot be denied. We feel that is a proud record.  It is no harm to repeat, because it is no harm ever to repeat what is right, that whilst we have men on this side of the House showing the same energy, zeal and progress in afforestation as we have, there is no danger but that very great progress will be made.  Future prospects are extremely bright.  In the not so far distant future, the Forestry Division will have to their credit the further acquisition of land, new forests and the provision of more employment.  It is very easy to say here: &ldquo;Plant trees&rdquo;, and it is very easy to plant trees with a pen on paper or speaking from a public platform: it is a different day's work to plant trees, as the Forestry Branch has had to plant them, on the actual site.  That fact must be borne in mind.  Deputies Derrig, Allen and every other Deputy know that the simplest thing in the world is to stand up at the cross-roads and say that thousands of acres will be planted.  I am sure that Deputy MacBride will not be offended if I say it is a very easy matter to take up a pen and say that tens of thousands of acres can be planted.  That looks lovely on paper and it sounds grand from the platform, but it is a different day's work to plant the trees on the land.</P>
    <P>I feel that the Forestry Department are making a genuine effort.  This Bill is proof of that effort.  The training college opened recently is another proof and a further proof is the <Col N="1199" /> number of students undergoing forestry courses.  I feel that a word of praise would be more helpful than unwarranted criticism at this stage. Progress in this connection has been made.  We can only hope and trust that the Minister for Lands and the Forestry Branch will see to it that, when this Bill becomes law, the powers given under the Bill will be put into effect and that we may expect better results.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connor made a reference to discourtesy, if I may describe it as such, by an officer of the Forestry Department.  I do not know what merit was in his complaint.  I have always found those connected with the Forestry Department very reasonable men.  They are civil servants and the ordinary man in the country cannot be expected to view things in the same light as civil servants.  Deputies, and particularly Ministers or ex-Ministers, who spent a number of years in very close touch with the Civil Service, find that after a while they become like the civil servants themselves even though they have been far removed from them.</P>
    <P>In so far as I am personally concerned, I am even using Civil Service phrases at home and I am doing that absolutely unconsciously.  I am almost asking for files in the house as a result of the close personal contact I have with civil servants.  The big trouble is that, when Civil Service phrases are used in the country, the ordinary countryman finds it extremely difficult to come to the same level as the civil servant.  I find that when a lot of the complaints concerning civil servants are investigated they are entirely due to the absence of a proper understanding of the Civil Service mentality. I am not saying it is the fault of the people not to understand them but it is the manner a civil servant has of putting his case.  All civil servants are the same in that respect.  If there were a little more knowledge of the manner in which civil servants work I feel that there would be a better understanding in this country and <i>vice versa.</i></P>
    <P>A very good deal of credit must also <Col N="1200" /> go to the ordinary forestry worker who has a very difficult job.  He has a very special type of labour to perform.  I hope that now, just as we have the county councils with pensions schemes, we will have the Minister for Lands giving some consideration to the ordinary forestry worker by bringing in some pension scheme that will cater for the forestry worker in his years of retirement.  The forestry worker is as much entitled to his pension and superannuation scheme as the ordinary county council worker and I hope the Minister for Lands will bear that in mind.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the question of the private planting of trees. Muintir na Tíre, Macra na Feirme and even, as Deputy Allen says, committees of agriculture could do considerably more in this connection.  If parish guilds or guilds of Muintir na Tíre find land suitable for planting in their areas they should by united effort plant these areas themselves.  I feel that a local committee could do much to encourage private planting.  It is something that should be encouraged considerably.</P>
    <P>I should also like to refer&mdash;as another Deputy did&mdash;to the fact that permits were given to fell trees on condition that replanting would take place.  We all know that in recent years, particularly during the war and after, permits were issued for the feeling of trees.  Associated with those permits was an undertaking to have certain replanting done.  Then, when the inter-Party Government took office, the land rehabilitation scheme was introduced.  Where trees were cut down and an undertaking given for the purpose of replanting, we found that the landowners availed themselves of the benefits of the land rehabilitation scheme and, instead of replanting, they decided to avail themselves of the benefits of this scheme and reclaim the land.</P>
    <P>I hope that in cases where the landowners are satisfied that the lands have been converted to a better type of land, those people will not be obliged to abide by the undertaking to replant because they have done a greater national service by having <Col N="1201" /> their lands reclaimed for the production of food for man and beast.  They deserve the greatest credit in that respect.  Where land can be reclaimed due to the efforts of the Department of Agriculture and the land rehabilitation scheme the Forestry Department should be slow to enter into such lands for afforestation purposes if there is any hope of those lands being properly reclaimed.</P>
    <P>In so far as the acquisition of land for afforestation purposes is concerned, I hope the Minister for Lands will emphasise the importance to inspectors of reporting to him on the suitability of lands for afforestation and that every effort will be made to see that these lands are suitable for afforestation and not for any other purpose.  It would be very regrettable, indeed, that any lands would be planted if they were suitable for the production of food.  That is particularly the case where we have small holdings and where the smallholders are endeavouring to eke out an existence. They find that their livelihood and income depend entirely on what they earn from those holdings.</P>
    <P>It has been my experience in the past and, in fairness to the last Government, it was my experience during the term of office of Deputy Derrig as Minister for Lands that, in acquisition of lands for forestry purposes due consideration was always given to the quality of the land.  If the land was in any way suitable for purposes other than afforestation it was not acquired. I hope that line of policy will be pursued by the present Minister for Lands.</P>
    <P>From the experience I have had and from the many representations I have had occasion to make to the Minister for Lands, I can say that the main replies issued, probably to most Deputies, state that the reason that schemes could not be undertaken is the difficulty in acquiring the land. I am very glad the occasion has presented itself to this House whereby we all have an opportunity of giving the Minister an Act by means of which the acquisition of land may be made more simple and may result in greater progress.</P>
    <P>We all know quite well that wood is <Col N="1202" /> an essential raw material, both in peace and war.  There is nothing more important than timber.  Deputy MacBride himself, in the course of his address to this House and an address which he gave in Cork, or somewhere in the country, emphasised the importance of wood, both in war and peace. I am 100 per cent. in agreement with him.  There is nothing whatever more important.  I feel that the Forestry Department in future, when they are equipped with the facilities of this Bill, will go ahead more speedily and give better results.</P>
    <P>I am quite satisfied of that, but I could not subscribe to the idea of Deputy MacBride that forestry should be handed over to a board like Bord na Móna.  I do not agree with that. I can see the Deputy's point of view. He has the idea that if the Forestry Department and Bord na Móna were working under the same board, their terms of employment would dovetail and at a time when work cannot be done on the bogs it could be done at forestry, at planting and thinning.  I have experience of Bord na Móna. Whilst Bord na Móna has made very great headway, I wonder if forestry would make the same headway under a similar board.  I doubt it.  However, it is a matter of opinion.  I would prefer to see afforestation as it is at present.</P>
    <P>No matter what Minister is in office or what board is appointed, unless there is power to acquire land and go full steam ahead, it is all the same whether a Minister or board is in charge.  Now that legislation is being passed to equip the Minister with additional powers, it is much better to give the present system a further trial, and when these difficulties have been removed I feel that a good deal more progress will be made.</P>
    <P>I want to tell Deputy MacBride and the House that the country owes to him a very deep debt of gratitude.  I am making that statement for the records of this House, and sincerely, as one who admires Deputy MacBride's ideas on afforestation.  While we are very proud indeed to have that great contribution coming from Deputy MacBride, we are equally proud of the determined manner in which the Minister <Col N="1203" /> for Lands has so actively interested himself in afforestation.  There has been no Minister for Lands since this State was set up who has displayed the same interest or made the same progress as the present Minister.  That is evident by the introduction of this Bill to simplify matters for his Department. It is also evident in the areas which he has visited&mdash;he was in Glengarriff recently&mdash;in many parts of the country, including Wicklow and elsewhere.  It is evident by the manner in which he has been responsible for the setting up of the training college in my constituency.</P>
    <P>It is to men like Deputy MacBride and the present Minister for Lands that we who are anxious to see afforestation go ahead look with hope and trust. I am glad that we have men of their type here with drive, determination and energy.  There can be little doubt in the minds of people who are anxious about forestry that, while we have men of the type of Deputy MacBride and Deputy Blowick, urging and emphasising the importance of afforestation, the civil servants will not be allowed to rest without serious and constant prods from those who are actively interested in it.</P>
    <P>In addition, afforestation is one of the greatest sources of employment. To Deputies who have not the experience of State forests in their constituencies, I say again that we in Leix-Offaly appreciate the very valuable employment given there over the years to hundreds of workers.  I should like to know if the Minister would have any objection to arranging for Deputies who are genuinely interested in afforestation to go on a tour of the Slieve Bloom mountains or of any other forest area.  I am sure the head officers of the Department would have no objection to showing interested Deputies what progress has been made on the State forests.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>They are quite welcome. I would be delighted to give every facility.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O. Flanagan Mr. O. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Thanks very much. I would ask Deputies who are interested <Col N="1204" /> to visit the State forests in Laois and Offaly, where they will see the valuable and useful work that has been done.  They might also visit the new training college in Kinnitty.  If Deputies were brought by the officers to the top of the Slieve Bloom mountains, to Clareen, to the Valley of Bawnree and down to the Killenure mountains, they would see that the bones of the Department are not creaking but moving actively.  Afforestation in Laois is very much alive.  I would like Deputy MacBride to see for himself the progress made in the Slieve Bloom mountains. He would appreciate it and would share our desire that similar schemes should operate in many other parts of the country.  I know very well the progress that has been made over a number of years.  It is something the Minister for Lands can feel proud of. Anyone who visits the State forests can see that very useful work has been carried out.  I am sure that Deputies' knowledge of afforestation would be improved considerably if they had time to spend one day in the State forests on the Slieve Bloom mountains.</P>
      <P>I welcome the manner in which the Minister has invited Deputies to visit those forests, offering them every facility and co-operation from his officials.  I can remember some years ago when Deputies were brought on a tour of Bord na Móna works, and I hope and trust that arrangements will be made to bring Deputies to the State forests, particularly the forests of Leix-Offaly, the Slieve Bloom mountains, where they will see for themselves the extraordinary amount of work that has been carried on.  The country has been so transformed that the older people living there can hardly believe that it is the same country.  When people of the age of 70 or 75 look around the Slieve Bloom mountains and the districts around Bawnree and that part of the country, they pause and say &ldquo;Has not an extraordinary change taken place in our lifetime?&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry that people in other parts of the country have not the same story to tell.  We are proud of our forests, of the forestry work that is taking place, and of the workers who <Col N="1205" /> are working hard in draining and preparing the land, and we in the Midlands desire to see the great benefits we boast of extended to other parts of the country.  I hope that some day Deputy O'Connor can come into this House and say the same thing for North Kerry as I am saying to-day in respect of Laois-Offaly.  I am sure the Bill which is now in course of passage in this House will enable something to be done in Deputy O'Connor's constituency, and that the energies of Deputy MacBride and the Minister will be facilitated again by the passage of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I may be forgiven if I remark this, that I think Deputy MacBride and the Minister for Lands are trying to outdo each other by their energies for afforestation.  I feel that is the way it is, that it is like the old song between the Minister and Deputy MacBride &ldquo;Anything you can do I can do better.&rdquo;  That is a helpful sign and a useful one.  It is a sign that those of us who are behind the Government in their afforestation policy are proud to be associated in this Government with Deputy MacBride and to have the present Minister for Lands displaying such great abilities and energies in the cause of afforestation.</P>
    <P>Forests and trees and timber play a very important part in our lives, because the timber provides firing in our homes and provides us with the furniture we have in our homes, with our buildings and even with the coffin which is our last resting place.  A tree, again, played a very important part, probably the greatest that was ever played, in world affairs&mdash;the great tree of Calvary&mdash;by which the world was saved and redeemed.  I hope and trust that the Bill will have a speedy passage, because it is a progressive piece of legislation, and I feel that when, in years to come, we review the work of the Forestry Department as a result of this Bill we will be able to say that it is a piece of very useful legislation and that we should all be very proud to be associated with its speedy passage.</P>

      <P>My contribution to this debate will be very brief, because <Col N="1206" /> I notice quite a number of speakers want to get in on it to-night.  A very big amount of ground has been covered last night and to-night in the debate, and while I also want to join in the wish that the Bill will achieve something for which we all hope&mdash;an easing of the position in obtaining land for reafforestation&mdash;frankly, I must confess that I am slightly disappointed, because I thought the Bill would go much further.  However, I think it is only fair that it should be given a chance and passed through this House, when we will be able to judge it on the result when it becomes an Act. We will see whether or not it will achieve what the Minister for Lands said it will achieve, or will fall as flat as Deputy MacBride suggested last night it might fall.</P>

      <P>I never said one word of criticism about the Bill.  I said I thought it was a step, anyway.  It was not the Bill I criticised.  I am sorry for interrupting the Deputy, but another Deputy also said the same thing and I want to get that established.</P>

      <P>I accept fully Deputy MacBride's correction.  I understood him to take a different line, but he knows what he said and I fully accept his correction.  Afforestation should not be made the plaything of political Parties, and I was glad to find that a number of people on all sides of the House were prepared to agree that the Bill was a step forward. There were, however, a number of people who made contributions which I thought were unworthy of them.  It is a very sad thing to find something which is so serious and which affects the life of the country so much being used here for the purpose of scoring a political point against an opponent. That was done here last night and to-night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that, I want to add that I am not quite satisfied that the Minister, at the present rate of progress, will, even under the new Bill, achieve what we hoped could or can be achieved in this country in a few years time.  I want to refer particularly to the speed at which things are done. Another Minister last night said that <Col N="1207" /> everything he had done was done quickly.  I am afraid that the Minister for Lands would not be able to say that, if he is answering for his Department. He must take responsibility for delays which have occurred in his Department, not alone in the acquisition of land for afforestation but in such matters as staff matters which affect afforestation just as much.  I want again to refer to a famous interview which took place on 23rd October, 1954, dealing with staff matters.  No decision has yet been made by the Forestry Branch on that interview.  If that is the way the trees are going to be planted, we will have to wait a very long time before we can cut down and use the trees which will be planted as a result of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I agree entirely with the Parliamentary Secretary when he says that this is a very big industry, which gives very much needed employment.  There is only one small forestry section in my constituency.  I visit that place occasionally and am very glad to say that every year the number employed there has been growing.  As secretary of a trade union I have visited practically every forestry section in Ireland and am very glad to say that the employment is growing year by year. That is very heartening in rural areas, where employment is so badly needed.</P>
    <P>I do not think the suggestion of the Parliamentary Secretary, that Deputies should visit the forests just as they visit Bord na Móna bogs, would be acceptable.  Deputies can travel around the bogs by car but would have to travel on foot in order to see the forests and that represents a hard day's work.  If Deputies did visit the forests their ideas would be altered and they would realise that there is a great deal of very useful work being done, a great deal of very necessary employment being given.</P>
    <P>I must say that the Forestry Division, when dealing with their employees, do not deal with them in a fair way.  In Northern Ireland, which is not a Christian State according to our concepts, forestry employees are paid in respect of Church holydays whereas, in the Twenty-Six Counties, <Col N="1208" /> such workers lose a day's pay if they do not work on a Church holyday.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I know it is but I have got it in.  The Minister yesterday referred to the requirements of the home market.  Is there any reason why we should be confined to the home market?  Is there any reason why we could not export our surplus timber to England, for instance, as countries like Finland and Sweden do? I understand that of the total exports from Finland 95 per cent. is timber and timber products.  They are doing quite well.  There is Finnish and Swedish timber coming into this country.  There is an old wives' tale that Irish timber is not suitable for certain purposes.  If it is not, it is because it is not properly treated.  There is no reason why Irish timber could not be properly seasoned and used for the same purposes as foreign timber is now being used. There is no inherent quality that makes foreign timber suitable and Irish timber unsuitable for certain purposes. It should be part of the duty of the Forestry Division to see to it that timber that is produced by the forestry section is properly treated before it is released for building and other purposes.</P>
      <P>In reply to a question which I addressed to the Minister for Industry and Commerce a few days ago, I was told that the question of producing wood pulp was being actively considered.  I hope it will not take as long to consider that matter as it is taking to consider the interview which I referred to a few minutes ago.  I hope the question of producing wood pulp will be decided, that the question of establishing mills in places to which the forestry section can deliver the timber will be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this country there is a number of woods of old timber owned by people who do not really know or care about it.  These areas could be taken over by the Forestry Division, the old timber cut down and processed and new plantings made.  The Minister is as well aware as I am of the existence of <Col N="1209" /> these woods.  It is a shame that they should be left there.</P>
    <P>Much more encouragement could be given to farmers who are anxious to grow trees, even shelter belts.  I know that if they agree to plant a certain area they will be given all the assistance the local forester can give but the area prescribed is so large that very few farmers can undertake it.  The area prescribed should be reduced and every encouragement should be given to farmers to plant trees.  Every tree counts.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kennedy referred to people who cut trees during the emergency and who signed a guarantee that they would plant three trees for one they cut but who did nothing about it.  I am surprised that Deputy Kennedy waited until to-night to mention that.  The time to bring that to the notice of the House was when it did happen.  He said he was aware of the fact that it was not being done.  I do not wish to cast any slur or to doubt Deputy Kennedy's word.  I know that it did happen.  I was not in a position to bring it to the notice of the forestry section.  If I were, I would have done so at that particular time.  We know that it happened all over the country. We know that people got away with it. Something should be done by the Department, even at this late stage, to force those people who have not reclaimed the land to plant the trees. I appreciate the Parliamentary Secretary's point that if the land has been reclaimed it would not be fair to ask them to put it under trees.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that it would be such a terrible thing to divorce the Forestry Division from the Department of Lands.  An innovation is required to put the necessary drive behind reafforestation.  A board such as Bord na Móna may possibly be the answer.  On the other hand, we might eventually find that we had made a mistake in setting up such a board. I would suggest to the Minister that he should not dismiss this question from his mind.  He should actively consider the matter and then he might agree that there is something in the suggestion to set up an independent board <Col N="1210" /> which would not be involved in the red or green tape of Government Departments and that that might be the answer to the present stagnation in the Forestry Division.</P>
    <P>Possibly I am criticising the Forestry Division unduly.  Perhaps they are doing all they can.  But, to the casual onlooker it appears that, while great efforts have been made, and it cannot be denied that there have been great achievements over the past few years, a far greater effort could be made.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister very well with his Bill and I hope that the Bill will succeed in doing what we all hoped it would do when the question of its introduction was first mentioned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope my remarks will be somewhat less platitudinous than some of those that I have been listening to for the last hour or so. There is one platitude that requires a passing comment, one of the many delivered by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture: &ldquo;It is quite easy to plant trees with pen and paper&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I think there is no political Party in this country that realises the truth of this platitude more than does this Party.  We have never attempted to satisfy the people's aspiration in regard to the growing of trees by filling their minds with these platitudinous hopes.  There are very many on this side of the House, despite some of the jibes that have been levelled at us from the Government Benches, who did not set out at the beginning to produce trees by pen and paper; there were many of us who instead took the spades into our hands on Sinn Féin Arbor Day in 1918 and who had our first experience of arboreal efforts and went out and put down the green plants in the soil.  Maybe there was more enthusiasm than technical knowledge behind the effort but in any event it was not a pen and paper effort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was a practical effort and I personally took part in it with a small group which planted hundreds of trees on that day.  I know there were very many more members of this organisation <Col N="1211" /> in and outside the House who did the same thing and therefore, because of this practical beginning in the matter of tree planting, we can let these cheap jibes pass over our shoulders.  I put my name to a motion in relation to afforestation in the congested districts and there is nothing the Minister for Lands has said about the taking of potential agricultural land away from the farmers that I do not endorse.  But there has been a fundamental change in this matter and one of the remarks made, I think by Deputy MacBride, that we sat for 20 years and did nothing, has been refuted very ably to-night, not in any speech made by a member of this side of the House but by the statement of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture when he described the scenic beauties that have been created throughout this country during the same 20 years.  Nobody I think will mistake the political aegis to be associated with that result; nobody will mistake the nature of the banner that should be floated over it. Is it the Coalition or Fianna Fáil who was responsible?  If half of what Deputy Flanagan said is true then he has quite adequately and fully repudiated the jibes that have been made by many of the Government speakers about the results of the last 20 years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>As I was saying, I put my name to the motion with three of my colleagues and, as the Minister knows, it referred mainly to the congested districts.  That brings me to what I am satisfied has been a fundamental change in afforestation policy in this country.  Whether it has been inspired by a Fianna Fáil Government or by a Coalition Government I cannot say and in any event it is immaterial. The emphasis in the Forestry Division always has been on the production of timber.  For the greater part of the time Fianna Fáil was in office, the Forestry Division had considerable areas of good plantable land about which they had no doubt whatsoever as to its capabilities, not of growing trees, but of producing timber.</P>
      <P>For many years after Fianna Fáil took office in 1932 any Deputy who went to the Forestry Division with offers of land was told quite definitely that there was not much point in offering the land unless it was capable of producing commercial timber.  Very often, from their knowledge of the particular land, they were able to tell us whether or not it was of that quality. They always carried out an inspection within a reasonable time, but the position was that the Forestry Division had during all these years quite sufficient land to keep them fully occupied in the planting of timber producing trees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the acreage target was enlarged, I take it the Forestry Division officials had, willy-nilly, to allow the less productive type of land to be brought into their reckoning.  I heard a Deputy last week refer to the acreage in County Galway and make reference to the fact that the acreage mentioned by the Minister for County Galway contained a considerable proportion of that sort of land.  That is so. I, personally, was responsible prewar for the formation of a committee in West Galway which produced on <Col N="1213" /> paper a great deal of land.  We were then told by the forestry experts that it was not timber-producing land and that, in the circumstances at the time, it would have been both waste of time and money to go ahead with large scheme of tree plating since they had good quality land still unplanted. Now I take it as a tribute to the work done by the Forestry Division on that pool of good timber-producing land that they are now being driven to go after the land of the less productive kind to which we have one or two sections of the Bill devoted.</P>
    <P>It is because of that fundamental change in policy that Fianna Fáil quite obviously deliberately took an interest in this in recent years; it is because of that that I put my name to a motion being discussed in conjunction with this Bill&mdash;because I want the forestry services now to come back to these areas which were then offered to them and, if they cannot produce timber on them, in any event to plant them with trees which they themselves acknowledge will grow on this land.</P>
    <P>In that connection I have a few criticisms to offer of the provisions in the Minister's Bill.  I do not think he can dispose of Deputy Moran's criticisms quite so airily as his interruptions of that speech seemed to indicate.  The Minister refers to commonages and according to the terms of one of the Bill's sections what he proposes to do here is where there are joint owners, to acquire their land, or to get the Land Commission to acquire it on his behalf.  The objectors to the acquisition will then make representations to the Lay Commissioners against the acquisition and if their objection is upheld there will be a partition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>If I might interrupt the Deputy, that is not the procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>Then what is the meaning of the term &ldquo;representation&rdquo; in the section?  It is used in a very specific way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister applies to the Land Commission for an Order to acquire the whole commonage.  That does not give him the commonage.  It is the Land Commission who decide <Col N="1214" /> what portion will be taken up and what portion will be allotted to the objector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister explain to me what is the meaning of the term &ldquo;representation&rdquo;, which is very deliberately inserted in subsection (2) of Section 4?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>It means that when the Minister for Lands applies to the Land Commission for an acquisition Order for the whole commonage, due notice must be given to all concerned as to what it is intended to do.  That gives a chance to the two, three or four people to lodge an objection with the Land Commission against the Minister taking over the whole commonage, saying: &ldquo;We are not selling our shares.&rdquo;  From there on, it is the Land Commission who will decide.  The Minister is not taking compulsory powers to himself at all and those who are objecting will be left their shares by the Land Commission and I am providing that the Land Commission will give a just proportion of the common to the objectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that quite well and that the word &ldquo;compulsion&rdquo; as Deputy Coburn said to-night, is not mentioned in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Moran said the Bill was actually dripping with the word &ldquo;compulsion&rdquo;, and it was so stupid that I did not even interrupt him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy Moran put his thoughts in those particular words he erred, but I think I understood clearly enough what was agitating Deputy Moran's mind, and it is much the same as is agitating my mind.  I know the Minister will not go into a commonage and say to those people: &ldquo;We are going to take your land and you can make representations.&rdquo;  What the Minister will do is to make inquiries, either through the Land Commission officials or the forestry officials. He will find out that on a particular commonage a number of people are prepared and willing to sell their land for forestry purposes.  During the course of inquiry it will be ascertained <Col N="1215" /> that there is a number, whether it is large or small&mdash;let us assume it is only a tenth of them&mdash;who do not wish to part with their land.  They have a right of making representation.  The Minister must know, as Deputy Moran knows and I know, that in that very process there is inherent as subtle an element of compulsion as was ever contained in any section of an Act.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;But there are the one, two or three who are nearest to the common and who may have the capital to stock the common.

      <P>There is another method whereby compulsion is being applied.  Take a small village where there is, say, a rundale system&mdash;in any event, where the people have very small quantities of land.  Whether it is rundale or not does not make any difference, because the fact is they have not got very much land anyway. Near them is land which becomes available and which would probably solve their problem or go a long way towards solving it.  You find that the Forestry Division sets its eyes on that land and either acquires it itself or gets the Land Commission to step in and acquire it.  It is then planted with trees and these people are told that a much more important purpose has been served.  It is planted with trees rather than given to those people to enlarge their holdings, or as additional grazing or for some other agricultural purpose.</P>
      <P>The Minister knows that type of compulsion is often used.  If the Minister in cases of that kind came to these people and said, in the first instance: &ldquo;I would give you that land, but we want it very badly for the growing of timber&rdquo;&mdash;I use the word &ldquo;timber&rdquo; as distinct from &ldquo;trees&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;and therefore you cannot have it&rdquo;&mdash;if he does make that decision, I think there is an obligation on him to say then to these people: &ldquo;I will provide you with alternative holdings.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The Minister got into a bit of a sweat about the fact that I suggested there was compulsion, and here now he is going to compel them to take work on the building of fences, while planting is going on, and in the planting of trees, but that is only temporary work.</P>

      <P>In any event, the Minister retains and withholds these lands from these people.  They are under-employed on the amount of land they have got, and he comes in and provides work in the planting of trees. Are there not economic circumstances in that compulsion?  They are compelled to take the work because of economic circumstances.  It is the Minister who is blathering.  What compulsion is more compelling than economic compulsion?</P>

      <P>The Minister for Lands is becoming very irritated because he knows the particular land to which I have been referring, and which illustratre the case I have, been making.  I do not have to specify it because the Minister knows all the details and, because he does so, he is becoming irritated. <Col N="1220" /> Much as I am in favour of planting timber, in that particular case, I would have seen that adjoining and I would have seen that adjoining small landholders would have been given the benefit of that land.  Furthermore trees have been planted there in contravention of what I understand is a new policy in the matter in virgin bog, or what the Minister referred to as blankets bog.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not understand exactly why this is being done, because I was told on several occasion by expert of the Forestry Department that if the bog is deeper than three feet, the trees will not thrive, but will decay after a few years, and in any case we have been promise that this virgin bog will be conserved for the supply of hand-won turf for our own electricity generating stations.</P>
      <P>I put my names to the motion because I do want the Forestry Division to give attention now to the lands they rejected some years ago because they then had a sufficient supply of much better land, and because apparently the Forestry Division now has suggested large scale planting for scenic purposes&mdash;I think the expression used here by the Minister was &ldquo;social purposes.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I would like to make the case for the utilisation of our cutaway bogs in this connection.  The co-operate of every Department of State would, of course, be necessary&mdash;the Special Employment Schemes Office, the Land Commission, Bord na Móna, and, if possible, the E.S.B. in those areas where we have power stations, and the Department of Agriculture in relation to land reclamation.  You would need that co-operation in the utilisation of these cutway bogs, and I do not think that the Minister would require any Act of Parliament for acquisition in any areas like West Galway, if he were to devote his initial efforts to that type of ground.  It would be very useful in turf production.</P>
