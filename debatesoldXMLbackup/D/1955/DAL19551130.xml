      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (General Mulcahy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Representations were made by local parties last year regarding the need for special facilities in the matter of providing transport to city schools for children living in the Walkinstown area, pending the provision of new schools in that area.  It was found on investigation that the number of children involved was not sufficient to <Col N="1224" /> warrant the establishment of a special school bus service in the case.</P>
      <P>Additional accommodation on a temporary basis was, at that time, made available in the old Crumlin schools for the children from Walkinstown for whom no other convenient school was available.</P>
      <P>I am arranging to have the present position examined at an early date with a view to ascertaining whether the provision of special transport facilities for the conveyance of children from the area to city schools is necessary pending the erection of the new proposed Walkinstown schools.</P>
      <P>Work has commenced on the building of a new school for boys in the Walkinstown area, and grants have been sanctioned in aid of the erection of new schools for girls and infants in that area.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Courses in the Montessori method of education are not sponsored by my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Managers of national schools may, if they so desire, introduce the Montessori method into their schools, where circumstances permit, and where the teachers have had training in that method of teaching.  Teachers in national schools are appointed by the managers of the schools, subject to <Col N="1225" /> their possessing certain minimum qualifications required by the rules and regulations.  It is open to any manager to appoint a teacher possessing the additional qualification of being able to use the Montessori method.</P>
    <P>Apart from any comparison of the relative merits of the various specialised systems of education, it would not be feasible to recommend the adoption of the Montessori method in the schools generally owing to the particular difficulties of staffing, accommodation and equipment which its use would raise.</P>

The number of staff employed in the office is adequate to cope with the volume of business transacted there.</P>
      <P>I should, however, mention that recently the companies office was moved to new premises and the disturbance caused by that move necessarily upset the normal service provided by the office.

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 63 and 64 together.</P>
      <P>In January last following an examination of the entire position concerning the Health Act, 1953, I caused a circular to be issued to all health authorities notifying them that I anticipated that the necessary arrangements would be concluded and the facilities provided to enable the Act to be implemented practically in full during the latter portion of the current financial year and I advised them of the need to make appropriate financial provision in their estimates.  I excepted specifically dental services under Section 21 of the Act for additional groups and maternity services for voluntary contributors.  As regards dental services, I explained subsequently to health authorities that the extended services could not be provided until the corresponding services for children and the lower income group had been improved considerably. The same considerations apply to ophthalmic and aural services under that section.</P>
      <P>In the case of maternity services for voluntary contributors, I do not propose to take any steps in regard to this very limited group, the provisions for which appear to embody some elements of insurance, until I have received and considered the report of the body I have set up to advise me on the general question of a voluntary health insurance scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards Section 50 of the Act which deals with rehabilitation services, the portion of that section dealing <Col N="1250" /> with the maintenance of disabled persons has been in operation since the 1st October, 1954.  I have recently established the National Rehabilitation Association whose task it will be to examine the more general question and to advise me and health authorities on measures which might be taken to establish rehabilitation services on a national basis and to place rehabilitated persons in employment.  The portion of the section dealing with this aspect of the service will be brought into operation as soon as this association has completed its examination of the problem.</P>
    <P>From the foregoing it will be seen that I am prepared to implement the Health Act, 1953, in full before the end of the current financial year except in regard to the relatively minor services which I have mentioned and the reasons for the deferment of which I have explained.  As I have stated on several recent occasions, I am prepared, being satisfied that it is possible to do so, to implement the Act as a contribution to the ending of controversy and thus to permit of a more realistic approach to and an expansion of health services for the individual in particular and the public generally.</P>
    <P>As regards the date on which the expanded services will come into operation, the position is that during the past year I have conducted numerous discussions and negotiations with various interested bodies and individuals whose co-operation is essential for the operation of these services.  These discussions and negotiations are still in progress and I am endeavouring to ensure that they will be brought to an early and satisfactory conclusion.  Provided that this can be achieved, arrangements for the operation of the extended services to which I have referred should be substantially completed before the end of the current financial year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>All I can say is that I was not aware of it until I put my name to the motion.  However, it is not necessary to labour that point. What I had in mind particularly, when I put my name to the motion, was the fact that to secure this increased acreage which everybody wants, apparently there has been a fundamental change in outlook on this question of forestry.</P>
      <P>Gibing references were made to the record of the Fianna Fáil Government in respect of this matter.  I want to say that the policy of the Forestry Division during the term of office of the Fianna Fáil Government from 1932 until the end of the war, was the production of timber.  That is what I was told by the experts of the Forestry Division every time I went to them with offers of land to be considered with a view to their acquisition for planting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apparently that attitude has been modified.  The emphasis now is on trees and, as a matter of fact, the emphasis has been pin-pointed by the <Col N="1253" /> activities of an association which calls itself &ldquo;Trees for Ireland.&rdquo;  It is on that aspect of the question and this new orientation of policy that I want to speak very largely on behalf of the areas which are common in my own constituency.  I want to make a case for the cut-away bog.  I have in mind the enormous damage that has been done by the recutting of lag portacha where turbary has become scarce and where the bog has been scrawed down to the very stone.  Now, if the Land Commission has power to prevent that being done, I think they feel unequal to the task of enforcing these powers.  It is a blot on the landscape to see these cut-away bogs being skinned down to the bare rock.  Now that we have Bord na Móna for the development of peat fuel, that we have the E.S.B. interested in peat as a fuel to be used in the generation of electricity, that we have a very useful organisation like the Special Improvement Schemes Office and that land reclamation is also taking place, I want to make the case for the congested districts that the Forestry Department, or whatever co-ordinating agency is to be used in relation to these various Departments, should concentrate their attention, in the first place, on this type of land.  The experts of the Forestry Division have now decided that this land ought to grow trees but they have always tried to impress on the minds of Deputies, and others making representations, that in their conception of forestry there is a very marked and important difference between the two terms&mdash; there is a tree as a tree and a tree as a timber tree.</P>
    <P>I remember on one occasion asking them if they could indicate to me some rule of thumb method whereby this distinction could be made ordinarily recognisable.  I was told that, taking it by and large, where the girth of a tree compared favourably with the girth of a man's body, it could be put properly into the category of a timber tree.</P>
    <P>I am not going to delay the House by making a long speech this evening. There is a number of things which I <Col N="1254" /> would like to speak about, but I think this matter is of such major importance to the congested districts that I should like to confine my remarks entirely to it.  The planting of virgin bog or of commonages should, in my opinion, be avoided in those districts.  One reason is that the turbary in those districts, because it is so shallow, is cut away more rapidly than the turbary of the bogs in the central plain and as time goes on the turbary is further removed from the populated villages.  The second reason is that the type of commonage in which the Forestry Department is interested in the West of Ireland is looked upon by its owners as being very valuable for the purpose of stock grazing.</P>
    <P>I do think that the land about which there would be no question, the land to the taking over of which there would be no objection, ought to be concentrated on.  If we are looking to afforestation in the congested districts as a very important means of employing labour then the amount of work which this type of tree planting would give should make it very attractive to the various Departments of State which have to deal with those areas.  There would be a good deal of labour required for the making of fences and a good deal of the preparatory work, from the nature of the ground, will have to be done by hand labour.  It does not seem to me that such an enormous amount of extra money would be necessary having regard to the sums already spent by the offices to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>The question of scenic beauty immediately arises but that is not the most important aspect of it.  The shelter which would be given would be of very great importance and would probably range next in the value of such work from the employment point of view.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister very seriously to consider the method by which he proposes to acquire lands held in commonage.  The Minister waxed very eloquent against those Deputies who seemed to think that compulsory acquisition was a matter to be treated lightly where forestry <Col N="1255" /> was the purpose.  He waxed equally eloquent and seemed to be much more agitated when Deputies seemed to take the opposite line.  I know that in the remarks that I have made I have left myself open to the Minister gibing at me as being against forestry.  I want to say that tree planting in any part of these waste areas is a very vexed question and that when it comes to looking for timber I think the Forestry Department can get plenty of it in other areas.  I also think that if the Land Commission and the Forestry Department together decide that they want land now used by smallholders the owners of that land should be offered alternative holdings elsewhere if their livelihood is going to be seriously interfered with.</P>
    <P>It is not enough to say that they will get employment while the work of planting is going on.  That work will cease when the trees have been planted and the amount of permanent employment given will only be a small part of the total employment given while the work is in progress.  I would prefer to see the Land Commission going to the owners of these commonages and asking them if they would wish to have the commonage partitioned. The Minister has stated that in certain circumstances where a commonage holder is, by force of circumstances, not able to stock up to the limit of his stock band, his neighbour is in fact stealing his share.  In effect that is so.  It often has happened that the reason why a particular holder is not able to stock up to the limit of his band is because of some domestic trouble or other.  It has also often happened that these people have got over their trouble and have been able to utilise their land to the fullest extent.</P>
    <P>I make the point that the people who were so handicapped when an offer of this sort is made to them by the Forestry Department are not in the fullest sense of the word free agents in the sale of their interests in the commonage.  The Minister made some remark about my being on the side of those who want to steal the neighbour's <Col N="1256" /> share but the boot is on the other foot because it was the Minister who was on that line and not I.  I was supporting the man who is not able to utilise his full share and suggesting that he should be put in the position of being a free agent and I have suggested a method by which he could be made a free agent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the Land Commission can give them back their shares again.  The fact that the Minister, under this Bill, says he wants the whole commonage, may, if you like, be taken as a gesture but it does not mean that the Land Commission willy-nilly is going to get the whole commonage because the Land Commission as a separate body has to adjudicate between me and the tenants and will see if three or four tenants want a share that their claim will be considered and that the land will be given to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand quite well that anybody who does not want to sell his interest is not compelled to do so.  That takes me to the objectors. I have been referring to the man who is willing to sell very largely for the reason that he is too poor to stock up his share to his full right, but now we come to the objectors.  Say we have two objectors, two people who have the most stock and for that reason do not want to sell as they have been making more money in raising sheep than they would by selling their interests in this commonage to any public authority.  What I would like to say in regard to them on the matter of compulsion is that if you take over the land and put the obligation on the objectors to come back again by direct positive action, you put on them the onus of making a direct positive approach to the Forestry Department or to the Land Commission in order <Col N="1257" /> to get their share back by this method of representations which is the term used in the Bill.</P>
      <P>In my opinion a great many people will not fully appreciate the rights they have under the Bill when they see the Land Commission coming along to take over land and find that they are told:&mdash;&ldquo;If you want to get some land back again, get form so-and-so and get a solicitor to fill it up and it will be duly considered.&rdquo;  I would rather see, in fairness to those who are too poor to stock and utilise their share and also in fairness to the objectors who are in the opposite position&mdash;the Minister may laugh, but I am telling the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am making a practical suggestion.  It may not be as practical as it sounds or as it seems to me, but in any event I have offered criticism and now I am offering what I think is a solution to the problem to which I have been referring.  I would go to the commonage holders and say to them; &ldquo;Do you wish to have this commonage <Col N="1258" /> partitioned?&rdquo;  That power already exists; the Minister has told me that. Then let these commonage holders say &ldquo;yes.&rdquo;  Suppose the commonage be divided, and when you have done that and when you are able to point out by metes and bounds where the interest of each commonage holder is, you can say to them: &ldquo;Now, are you prepared to sell?&rdquo;  You will have made them free agents, the objectors as well as the unfortunate poor ones among them who are unable to utilise their shares.</P>
      <P>I do not think there is any purpose in my talking any longer on this. What I have been saying up to now&mdash;I do not want to magnify it&mdash;is not an enormous objection, but I do think, seeing that the Minister himself is so pernickety on this question of compulsion, that I am offering him a method by which he can save himself from criticism on this score of compelling people to sell.  I certainly think that the lands which have been&mdash;and in my opinion still are&mdash;looked upon as unsuitable by the Forestry Department but which they are now, apparently because of political pressure, compelled to include in the forestry programme should be taken over.  These lands will grow trees but will not produce timber. Apparently that fundamental change in policy has taken place, and I want to see constituencies like my own cashing in on it because it would be a very suitable development in those areas.</P>
      <P>I know it is going to be very costly to develop that type of land, cut-away bog, and that the fencing of it is very expensive but we have been talking a lot about people emigrating from these places and leaving the country and we have been trying to find employment for them with Bord na Móna and on other schemes.  We have public works schemes also.  If we can add to these the planting of trees, even if these trees are not timber trees, I still think the matter could be looked upon as one which is, say, 50 per cent. economic. The very desirable objective of preventing any more cut-away bog being scraped down to the rock would be obvious; shelter would be given and the scenery would be improved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Candidly, I am a bit perplexed as to how far we can go in this discussion of policy in relation to afforestation.  From what I have heard Deputy Bartley say just now, I take it that suggestions will be accepted by the Minister and the House for the improvement of afforestation generally. Indeed, I was tempted into the debate by Deputy Bartley's use of the phrase &ldquo;practical suggestions,&rdquo; and I rise now to make a suggestion which, in my opinion, is the most practical of all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the Minister in this Bill is looking for certain rights in relation to the acquisition of land from the point of view of administration, the important thing is to get on with the programme of afforestation generally. I believe that in the administration of the Forestry Division, as in many other State Departments, there is too much emphasis on the Government angle of things and I believe that much more could be done with voluntary help and by voluntary effort.  Within the last two years on two big mountain ranges within four or five miles of the town of Fermoy, in which I reside, there has been considerable progress.  By means of voluntary effort or, at least, voluntary initiation vast areas of these two ranges have been planted.  In regard to the mountain known in the Forestry <Col N="1260" /> Division as Corrin the work of planting there was initiated by a few individuals from the town of Fermoy who decided it would be a good idea if this range were planted.  Now I do not say that it was these individuals who did the actual planting&mdash;that was done by the Forestry Division&mdash;but they helped to a considerable extent in getting over difficulties of title and so forth because of their ambition, having initiated the work, to get on with it.</P>
    <P>Within the last six months, and this is on record in the Department of Lands, in the parish of Araglen, between Fermoy and Mitchelstown, the local branch of Muintir na Tíre have interested themselves in planting an extensive range.  They have given, and are still giving, the Department every assistance in finding title and getting on with the job there.  In my opinion they are doing that much more expeditiously than it would be done by the Forestry Division itself, particularly in relation to offers coming from private individuals.  The Minister should consider the question of encouraging people like Muintir na Tíre and other rural organisations to interest themselves in this very important work.  No matter what we may say, no matter what Bills we may pass to help the Minister and his Department to acquire land, the emphasis, I think, must be on the desire of the people to get the job done.  It would be a good thing for the Minister and for every public representative on both sides of this House, and a good thing generally, to use every opportunity to encourage organisations such as Muintir na Tíre and Macra na Feirme and give them some appreciation of the importance of the contribution they can make where land is available and suitable for planting purposes.</P>
    <P>I think, too, that much useful work could be done through the county committees of agriculture.  The forester employed by the Cork County Committee of Agriculture is doing very useful work.  I think, however, that even amongst the members of that committee, of which I am one, there is not enough importance placed on this side of what we may describe as agriculture. <Col N="1261" /> I think it would be well for the Minister to ask the advice of the agricultural officers in the county committees or, at least, to ask them to encourage planting.  The county forester should attend the meetings of the agricultural committee.</P>
    <P>Whatever we may say and whatever legislation this Minister or any other Minister may introduce, it is my considered opinion that the really important thing is to get the people interested by letting them know the advantages of afforestation.  That done, I believe that a lot of the legislation here for the acquisition of land, the proving of title and all the rest of it, will be simplified and the difficulties which are now encountered will be more easily overcome.</P>
    <P>There is a difficulty, and an annoying difficulty, as I know, with regard to payment for land acquired for afforestation. While it may not be very desirable for the Department of Lands to enter into competition and offer more for land than private purchasers might offer, I think that if the people generally knew that the Department of Lands, acquiring land for forestry purposes, were prepared to pay just a little bit more than somebody else a lot of this angling and tangling&mdash;that is the only way to describe it&mdash;would disappear.  At the moment when an offer is made for lands, which it is the intention of the Forestry Division to acquire, it takes anything from three to four years before agreement is reached and the vendor is paid.  I know the snags that exist from the point of view of the Department, but, at the same time, I believe that if there was a little more generosity and liberality shown by the Department it would become generally known that the Department was not angling or tangling, as we now know them to do.  For that reason, I suggest to the Minister that it would be a good thing, from the point of view of the interests of the country as a whole and from the point of view of the acquisition of land, if he would show his good will in a practical way to those who are offering land for sale.  If he does that, those who have land for sale will offer it more readily to the Department <Col N="1262" /> of Lands.  Deputy Bartley talked about &ldquo;practical suggestions&rdquo;.  It was that which drew me into this debate.  I think the suggestion I have made is a very practical one and I hope and trust the Minister will seriously consider it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaugeBrennan" hpid="Mr. P. Brennan Mr. P. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill before the House is designed to give greater powers to the Forestry Division in the acquisition of land or, at least, to make it easier for the Department of Lands to acquire land for reafforestation.  The majority of Deputies who have contributed to this debate have spoken of the Bill as it affects their own constituencies. If I were to do that, then, as far as Wicklow is concerned, I would have to say that there is no need whatever for this Bill.  Almost one-fifth of the total area of my county is under State forests.  That shows that the people there are proving very cooperative as far as the Forestry Division of the Department of Lands is concerned.  I understand there is very little difficulty in acquiring land in Wicklow, and I have no doubt that from time to time a number of estates in the county will be placed at the disposal of the Department for afforestation purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to deal with a few points on the question of the acquisition of land.  It has been brought to my notice that at present a couple of holdings are being offered to the Department in my constituency, holdings that are mostly mountainous.  At the foot of the mountain, there is a small uneconomic holding, but on many such farms there is a small acreage which would be described locally as arable land.  It might not be so described in County Kildare or, for that matter, in other parts of County Wicklow, but to those people who have lived at the foot of the mountain, the few acres of arable land are a great asset.  When such farms are offered to his Department for reafforestation purposes, the Minister should get the Land Commission to acquire the acreage at the foot of the mountain that is arable and divide that amongst the other farmers in the area.  In the case of farms where there are 100 or 200 acres <Col N="1263" /> of land being offered for sale, there might be ten or 12 acres which could be considered arable.  That acreage would be a great asset to some of the farmers in the area, and I believe the Land Commission should consider taking it over and dividing it.</P>
    <P>There is a lot in Deputy Barry's suggestion about co-ordination.  The farmers of Wicklow have certainly cooperated with the Department by offering land to them and helping them to solve their difficulties.  It is to the people's advantage also and that is appreciated in the county.  We have something like 40,000 acres of State afforestation and that, in itself, is responsible for keeping almost 1,000 men in County Wicklow in constant employment.</P>
    <P>A great deal has been said in this debate for and against this annual target of the Department.  I do not know whether the Department will ever achieve the 25,000 acres annual plantation, but a great deal could be done by the Department in trying to make the farmers of the country tree-minded. If they encouraged the farmers to plant small portions of their own holdings, eventually there would be a tremendous acreage of land under forests.  Nearly every farmer of 40 acres or over has half an acre, or one or two acres, of land that is not of much value to him, except for planting purposes. The Department and the Government should encourage the farmers by increasing the State grant of £10 by at least 100 per cent.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies have suggested that each county council should be allowed to appoint a forester, either directly from the county council or through the committee of agriculture, who would, in turn, give his services to the farmers and pass on his knowledge of tree planting and the rearing and care of trees to the farmers.  In that way, we would be doing a good day's work.</P>

If that is the case, I believe we will go a long way towards meeting the wishes of Deputies who seem to be unanimous in saying that we have not gone far enough in relation to reafforestation. I do not know whether the Department can ever hope to achieve a target of 25,000 acres, even if and when this Bill is passed.  In any event, we can achieve a great deal by encouraging our farmers to plant that portion of their land which is at present unsuitable for any other agricultural purpose.</P>

      <P>I propose to be very brief in my contribution to this debate, because I have no intention of repeating what I have said before in connection with forestry generally and the advantages that would accrue to the country from the pursuing of an energetic programme of reafforestation. One of the main reasons why I intend to say a few words on this Bill is that I will be on record, at any rate, for some future occasions and I will not have it thrown at me that, when a Bill was going through this House in connection with forestry, poor and all as those measures may have been in my opinion, I made no contribution whatever to improving the Bill, in so far as lay in my power.  I want to have on record what my views are on this present Bill.</P>
      <P>The Minister himself, in the last fortnight, spoke here on a motion in connection with forestry.  He said in the course of his remarks that if I said something that could be construed as praising him or any other Minister, he would fall over backwards in a faint.  I can assure the Minister that he can postpone the faint on this occasion.  It is not in any personal sense that I am going to attack him or criticise him, but in relation to this Bill.  I regret very much I cannot offer any great praise to the Minister.  I am sure he expects that viewpoint and that it does not come as a shock to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of us in this House have in the last few years been told that new legislation <Col N="1265" /> was being considered and that, when that new legislation came before the House, we would have a chance of seeing our desires in connection with forestry achieved; in other words, the planting programme which was adopted by the Dáil, namely, a minimum planting of 25,000 acres per annum, would be got under way as a result of this legislation.  The White Paper issued with the Bill is much longer than the Bill itself.  It seeks to explain the Bill, but, in my humble opinion, it is more involved and complex than the Bill.  Possibly there was a reason for that.  Possibly the idea was to give the impression to Deputies that there were some great points being covered in this Bill that would prove of immense benefit in the acquisition of land.  The Minister has laboured hard and long and succeeded in producing a mouse.  I am sorry about all the pain he has endured in the production of this miserable Bill.</P>
    <P>A serious position is disclosed.  The speech of the Minister introducing the Bill should be studied carefully by all Deputies and by those outside the House who are really keen on afforestation. I do not know whether or not the normal procedure in Departments is for the advisers to prepare a speech for a Minister.  I presume that is normal procedure, but I do think there is a duty imposed on a Minister to study carefully the speech provided for him, whether he is Minister for Lands, or Minister for Agriculture, or Minister for Industry and Commerce or for any other Department.</P>
    <P>This Bill will be remembered for all times and the Minister's speech must be taken as an indication of the Forestry Division's mentality with regard to afforestation.  In spite of the fact that the Minister in his speech has skilfully tried to cloak the opposition to a large-scale development programme, running right through the speech is a warning note that it would be inadvisable, according to the experts, and so forth, to embark on a scheme of 25,000 acres planting per annum.</P>

      <P>The difficulty about quoting that is that the Ceann Comhairle would not allow me to quote the entire speech and, in order to bring it home forcibly, it would be practically essential to quote the entire speech of the Minister.  The speech is skilfully prepared, but to anyone who makes a real study of it, it is quite apparent that there is no real enthusiasm for or no real intention of putting into operation a large-scale programme.  My personal opinion is that if I were to meet the Minister outside the House, I would find him as keen as anybody else, as an individual, to embark on such a programme.  There is danger involved for any Minister in accepting a speech prepared for him without realising that he will be held responsible for that speech for all time.</P>
      <P>The Bill will ease a couple of problems.  It will speed up the acquisition of land where there is at present a hold-up, but the Bill will not do anything in a big way to bring land into a pool for use at a later stage for planting.</P>
      <P>The Minister may recollect that, in 1950, he introduced a Land Bill.  Prior to the introduction of that Bill, he expressed himself as being very anxious to ensure that more land would come into the land division pool for the relief of congestion, and that the 1950 Land Bill, as it was described, would bring in more land.  That Bill was passed.  My remarks in connection with it are there for anybody to see. I said that I believed that one of the difficulties involved was the question of finance, that, although we all welcomed the Bill, I felt it would not bring in the land.  I have been proved right 100 per cent.  That Bill has been in operation since 1951 and has done absolutely nothing to relieve congestion. The very same thing can be said when this Bill is passed, as far as land for forestry purposes is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1267" /> We hear of all the difficulties involved in the acquisition of land.  The circle has been completed from rabbits and netting wire to legal difficulties. I repeat that the real difficulty is finance, that the money is not being made available for the purchase of land.  There is land on offer to the Forestry Division at the present time in many parts of the country in connection with which there is no legal difficulty of a serious nature.  Yet there is no attempt made to acquire the land for forestry purposes.  We do not utilise the land that can be purchased without legal difficulties.  Why do we concentrate now on land in connection with which legal difficulties are involved? Why not accept the land in connection with which legal difficulties do not exist and which is suitable for afforestation?</P>
    <P>I will give the Minister one example. In 1953 when his predecessor, Deputy Derrig, was Minister for Lands, I gave him particulars of an area in West Roscommon, which can be described only as a slum area, Kiltullagh electoral division.  The Minister at that time was good enough to send a forestry official to inspect the land.  I received a letter from the then Minister stating that the Forestry Division report was that the land was suitable for afforestation purposes.  What has been done since 1953?  No attempt was made to purchase the land until I kept on the telephone month after month to the Minister's Department and until I got sick of asking what would be done in the area.  Then they decided to make an offer to one individual in the locality.  In the past two months, this individual has received from the Forestry Division a purchase agreement. A man beside him offered land at the same time.  In neither case is there any difficulty with regard to title; it is not necessary to make any search as to the rightful owner.  Both men are anxious that the Forestry Division should purchase the land and that a scheme of forestry should be got under way.  Why is it not done?  This Bill is not necessary to deal with that problem.  In spite of the fact that the land is available, it is not being planted for the very simple reason that <Col N="1268" /> the financial accommodation will not be made available to this or any other Minister responsible for afforestation. The opinion of forestry experts on this particular locality was that it was ideally suited for afforestation.  The position there at the present moment is that there are approximately 200 men looking for work and the only work provided for them is the steam-rolling of a mile of road by the county council.  Employment is given on a rotation basis: a man starts work on a Tuesday and he is put off the following Monday in order to allow his nextdoor neighbour to get another week's work.</P>

      <P>I am criticising the Department for bringing in a measure like this to hoodwink the public.  The inference is that unless this Bill is passed there will be real difficulty in the acquisition of land for afforestation purposes.  I was trying to draw a picture for the Minister of a locality that is eminently suitable for afforestation and in which no attempt has been made to start a forestry centre.  There is too much bluff going on on this question of afforestation.  We have this business of the know-alls and the have-alls in this House who maintain that nobody is entitled to talk about afforestation unless they have 100 acres or upwards of land.  I have listened to the present Minister suggesting in this House that he would oppose strongly any use of compulsory powers for the acquisition of land for afforestation. There was also the suggestion that Deputies like myself were out to destroy the smallholders in the West of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1269" /> I am sounding a word of warning to the Minister that he will regret the day he made such suggestions.  I am just as anxious to improve conditions in the West of Ireland, in Mayo and Roscommon, as is the Minister or anyone in the Department.  The Minister is doing no good to the people by trying to raise their fears by suggesting that Deputy MacBride and myself are out to acquire their lands and remove them from this country.  These people are living in poverty and misery and they have done so for generations. There is no future for them but the emigrant ship, and when I suggest that the Minister's job is to acquire large farms in the Midlands, divide them and remove to them the people from the West of Ireland, my suggestion then is that the vacated lands in the West should be planted.  I am not doing any injustice to these people and I will not take such a suggestion from the Minister, who knows rural Ireland as well as I do.</P>
    <P>He is going on a very dangerous trend when he says I am being unjust to the small man.  The injustice has been perpetrated over generations and it is up to the Minister and the Department to see that there is amelioration.  I hope it is the last time that I will hear from the Minister an attack on me, that I want to ruin the smallholders in the West of Ireland.</P>

      <P>I am standing on my two feet.  The Minister is dancing a jig, a political jig.  In so far as the Bill before the House will help to solve difficult cases and knotty problems connected with acquisition I welcome it.  I think every Deputy in this House would welcome any legislation that would help to solve such problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1270" /> This is a puny effort, but we cannot oppose it just because it is puny.  The tragic thing about it is that it will take a number of years before people will realise how ineffective the Bill will be when it is enacted, and by that time we will have had more emigration, more unemployment and people fast leaving areas where land for afforestation is available.  Possibly some other Minister, in years to come, will say:&mdash;&ldquo;We find that after trying to work this Bill we will have to use other measures in order to bring the afforestation programmes into full operation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am out to put on record that I do not believe this measure is going to help us in getting 25,000 acres a year planted.  The Minister himself has more or less gone back on his public statements in which he said that he believed 25,000 acres as a minimum should be planted annually.  He has definitely gone back on that.  I was a member of a Party at one stage which suggested 100,000 acres should be planted and the Minister, as a member of a Party at the same time, did not go quite as high as Clann na Poblachta but maintained that 60,000 at any rate should be planted each year.  I would conclude by reminding the Minister that I have just as much interest in afforestation as he has.  I feel I would not be in this House now if it were not for afforestation; it was the interest I took in afforestation that brought me in here in the first instance and I am feeling more depressed now on the subject after six years than I was when I came in here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>The last Deputy who spoke talked about the bluff that has been uttered in this House.  I agree there is a lot of bluff from most of the western Deputies, As far as I see it, each of the western Deputies in the House hates the others and if there was more Christian charity among them there would be much more progress. This Bill was brought in with the best intentions.  The Minister thinks that through it he will be able to make better progress with afforestation. I am satisfied that better progress will be made by reason of this Bill but I think the Minister will have <Col N="1271" /> great difficulty in getting land from the mountainy people.  It will take him all his time to get these people to give up the land they use for mountain grazing without compulsion.  I am satisfied that a great lot of the economy of the country, the West and the Midlands alike, is linked up with that mountain grazing.</P>
      <P>We, from the eastern Midlands, buy our sheep and cattle from the men who own such stretches of grazing and there is a very good trading agreement between us.  If this system continues as it is, I am satisfied it will be hard to take land from these people.  Thirty years of native Government has achieved quite a considerable lot of progress in afforestation.  The present Minister and previous Ministers have contributed to this.  Now we hear that we are going to plant the whole of the West of Ireland.  I have driven through the West and it is almost a barren rock.  I am satisfied that you will get patches here and there, but you will never be able to plant big forests in it.  You can hardly see a whin bush in any of it.  Any bush you see there, is stunted, leaning over to the East waiting for the wind to blow it down.  Do not think that we can plant trees in that area and go against nature.  You just cannot do it.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the Forestry Department can do much more in the eastern and midland counties.  In the East there is just as much wilderness as in the West.  There are too many whin bushes and waste bits and ditches that have never been cleaned out. There is not a farmer with 40 acres of land who should not have two or three acres of forestry on it and that should be put in by his own hands.  If they did that, they would be laying a foundation for the future of themselves and their children.  If a man put down an acre of commercial timber on his holding when he was married he would have, before he has a son or daughter of 30 years of age, £1,000 in that timber as a dowry for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are thousands of acres of waste land in the eastern part of the country which are never used by man or beast.  What we want is an inducement <Col N="1272" /> to our farmers from the Minister so that they would begin to plant trees for themselves.  That would provide shelter and would beautify the country. This country could be the most beautiful in Europe if it were properly planted and managed, but there is no proper planting or managing.  The Minister could get much more done by private enterprise if he would set a big drive on foot, but there is no drive. There is no drive by the committees of agriculture or by the Department of Agriculture.  Two acres of timber on each 40 acre farm would give an enormous acreage all over the country.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal of whining and crying about the West of Ireland.  It is said that the people are running away from it as if from a plague.  They are doing no such thing.  They are running out of it because they can get better money in England.  I saw houses in my area where there was £30 a week going in and the sons threw down their picks and shovels and went away to England.  It is not poverty that is driving them out, but this insane running after wealth.  There is no use in our getting up and saying that the present or past Governments have put the people out of the country. They have done no such thing.  The Governments of the past 30 years have done everything they could to provide work for the people, but this is an impoverished country and there is no use in denying it.  When we were a few years in control of our own affairs we had £50,000,000 or £70,000,000 dead weight debt placed on us from fighting each other.</P>

We should not be whining at one another all the time.  At all stages in this country's history for the last 30 years, everything that could be done for the betterment of the people was done by the successive Governments. The different Governments set <Col N="1273" /> out to give every man in this country a home for himself and do away with the little hovels.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickGiles" hpid="Captain Giles Captain Giles">
      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>But the building of houses costs money and if we had not done that we would have plenty of money to-day for forestry purposes.  I am quite satisfied, coming from the eastern seaboard, that there are bees in the bonnets of the western Deputies. They are afraid that a whole lot of their people would be sent over to settle in the East and that a whole lot of their votes would be lost.  They are busy trying to see that the people who would not vote for them in any case would be sent out of their area.  Do not think that we will be able to give these people much more employment in forestry.  There is a forestry belt of about 300 acres beside me which is well laid down and well supervised but all the employment given on it is only for about a score of men.</P>
      <P>Western Deputies want to see the displacement of about 10,000 people overnight.  Where are you going to put them if you do displace them? There is a reasonable amount of land yet to be divided but it is not a very large amount and it is gradually getting smaller.  You cannot disrupt the economy of the country overnight for the sake of a few trees.  You can drive out the owners of these lands but you are also disrupting your own economy. Some Deputies seem to think that you can plant 10,000 acres of trees and that you would have wealth overnight from them.  It would be 40 years before you could cut one commercial tree out of all that timber so that all that money must be left there during all those years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is all very fine to talk big and to lambast the Minister and his Department but it is far better to tell the truth, to be honest and decent about it and to cut out all the bitterness that has made this House so rotten to-day.  Where our cut-away bogs are concerned, we should work hand in hand with Bord na Móna.  We should begin our afforestation programme on the cut-away bogs.  From Dublin to <Col N="1274" /> Galway on both sides of the railway line there are thousands of acres of land that could be planted where there is not even a bush being grown at the moment.  It seems to me that some State Department should investigate that land and all the derelict areas lying alongside the railway.  The railway is practically closed down and the canal there is useless.  Alongside both of them there are tens of thousands of acres without anything planted on them.  That is good land and I am quite satisfied that, if we get after it, we can acquire it without much difficulty.</P>
    <P>There are hundreds and thousands of acres lying idle and these should be taken over.  We could then cut out this nonsense of bringing in Bills year after year to squeeze people as tight as we can.  We cannot compel them but we can keep squeezing them until eventually they give in.  These mountainy people are sturdy, hardy men who have done much for the economy of this country.  I think it is unfair to push them around to suit the whim of a few boys whining about the forestry drive.  I think the forestry drive is reasonably good for a small impoverished country, and since 1948 progress has been stepped up.  Whether it is a 12,000, 15,000 or a 25,000 acre target we have, it will satisfy me, and if we do no more than 12,000 acres a year we are doing good work.  As it is, going across the Wicklow Hills, we can see with pride where lovely trees have been raised up under native Governments. It makes no difference whether the Government comes in or goes out afforestation goes on year after year and good work is being done.</P>
    <P>I am sick of all the whining from the West that we hear.  We had Deputy Moran lambasting the Minister and implying that compulsion was in every inch of the Bill.  Deputy Bartley took the same line, that the Minister was the rottenest type who ever lived. Then we had Deputy McQuillan, who, according to himself, was the only man responsible for putting trees in the country.  He said he believed in getting on the phone and that the telephone brought results.  What actually brings results is the Department and <Col N="1275" /> the machine working smoothly to plan and ensuring that whatever work is done is well done.</P>
    <P>If we plant the West of Ireland, trees will not grow up overnight.  We must realise that many of these acres we plant in the West of Ireland will never produce trees.  They will reach a height of perhaps eight or ten feet and will be just stunted and warped like skeletons.  I would ask the Government to concentrate on private enterprise and ask each farmer with an acre to spare&mdash;in my own county there are hundreds of thousands of acres to spare&mdash;to plant trees on it.  The farmer should realise that the £1,000 that he has to put into the Ulster Bank or to send across to England&mdash;where he thinks it is safely invested&mdash;would be better if put to work in his own soil and would bring in a return which would enable these farmers to give dowries to their daughters when they come to marry and provide for the sons so that one of the young men would be able to take over and marry into the old homestead.</P>
    <P>Those are things I want to see done by private enterprise.  We need a new crusade of self-sacrifice in the interests of this grand little country.  If we do not have that and if we do not avoid bringing in Bill after Bill and lambasting each other here as if we were a lot of Mau-Maus, we should be ashamed of ourselves and of what goes on here. I would like to see the Bill debated on its merits with this bitterness and hatred cut out.  I know that the speeches I heard this year and last year I shall hear again next year, word for word, as I have heard them for the past ten or 15 years.  But what results have they got?  Very little.</P>
    <P>We have the same schemes and the same programmes but we all whine and cry at Budget time when perhaps taxation is increased.  We have here a certain amount of money and we are spending that money as best we can. We cannot waste hundreds of millions on schemes that will never bring results.  By all means we should get all the land we can on which to plant <Col N="1276" /> trees and plant as quickly as we can, but we should take no nonsense from those with bees in their bonnets, those who are afraid their colleagues will be sent to the East.</P>
    <P>We have too much rotten politics in Irish life west of the Shannon.  I have never met the like of it elsewhere. Deputies in the Midlands and the East can meet each other and talk to each other, but in the West there is hatred and bitterness that no one can contemplate&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe more could be done by committees of agriculture. The county committees of agriculture have a scheme for shelter belts but beyond a few lines in the papers now and then to say that £10 is given to a farmer to put up a shelter belt it does not get out to the people.  That scheme should be put across and I am quite sure there are farmers who would do the work even without the £10.  They should not need £10 to plant timber on their own land because that is just good business.  At the same time they would make their farms beautiful and get a return in money while making the country a better place to live in.</P>
      <P>This Bill may do good but, short of compulsion, you cannot get a great deal of land from the people of the West. I do not blame them.  It is essential for their economy that they should produce cattle and sheep to be finished off in the Midlands before being sold on the world markets.  By all means, the cut-away bogs and land lying idle should be planted but do not let us destroy the hardy people of the western area.</P>

      <P>Deputy Giles' approach to emigration is very interesting and I hope the people of Meath will not read the speech he made to-night and compare it with the speeches he made during the election.  They will think he is an entirely different man because I am afraid they will find the speeches completely different.  That is all I have to say on that.</P>
      <P>I intervened in the debate because I want to get some information.  I have in my pocket a letter I got a few days ago&mdash;since this Bill was introduced&mdash; from a man in North Leitrim.  This man gave land&mdash;bog and cut-away bog &mdash;to the Land Commission about six years ago.  Since then nothing has been done about it.  The Land Commision acquired it or told him they were to acquire it.  This man has not a good title&mdash;he has not the money.  If he had money he could go to a lawyer and he could immediately get a squatter's title to this land, but, because he has not the money and because there is no lawyer magnanimous enough to take on his case, he has to sit there.  He is still waiting for the Land Commission to do something.  I want to know from the Minister if this Bill will cover that kind of case.</P>

      <P>I will do that, but I can tell the Minister now that the difficulty is that the man is just sitting there.  He is not going to bring it into court to establish a squatter's title.  The Land Commission has taken the land but will not pay for it until he establishes title.  They will not take it over on the title he has.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilbride</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give the Minister particulars.  There is another point in relation to the White Paper on which I am not clear.  Paragraph (b) states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Provision whereby a commonage (other than common grazing or similar rights).&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Does that mean that where people have a grazing right only this Bill does not apply?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 5 deals with the grazing right, and with the person, or persons, who has or have a grazing right over a commonage in which he or they do not own the fee simple of the common.  Sections 4 and 5 deal with two different types.  In one case the <Col N="1281" /> section deals with the group that actually owns the common and has it in common; the other section deals with those who only have grazing rights and in which an outside party holds the ownership of the ground underneath.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EugeneGilbride" hpid="Mr. Gilbride Mr. Gilbride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilbride</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="EugeneGilbride" hpid="Mr. Gilbride Mr. Gilbride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilbride</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="EugeneGilbride" hpid="Mr. Gilbride Mr. Gilbride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilbride</NameTxt>
      <P>A good many that I know of have only grazing rights where the landlord cut away the turf and the neighbouring farmers got grazing rights.  These are the places in which I am interested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">

    <Speaker pid="EugeneGilbride" hpid="Mr. Gilbride Mr. Gilbride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilbride</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another matter that concerns me.  I will give a case in point.  I know a commonage at the end of six men's holdings.  Their holdings, as is usual in the West, consist of long strips of land; this commonage runs at the end of the six. Five of these are anxious to have that commonage planted, but one will not agree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Is he getting the profit of the whole commonage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EugeneGilbride" hpid="Mr. Gilbride Mr. Gilbride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilbride</NameTxt>
      <P>Probably.  We will take it that one, two, four, five and six are agreed, but No. 3 will not agree.  What will the Minister do in that case?  He says he will give him an equal right, but where will he give him that right?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The Land Commission will decide that.  The Land Commission will apportion a part to him which will give him exactly the same liberty as if he had abandoned the common prior to that and all the other tenants were using their land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EugeneGilbride" hpid="Mr. Gilbride Mr. Gilbride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilbride</NameTxt>
      <P>In this particular case, each man has put down a kind of claim <Col N="1282" /> to what is exactly opposite his own holding.  If No. 3 refuses to give up his share he will insist on getting what is opposite his own holding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, no.  The other tenants surely have rights as well as the tenant who does not want to sell.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilbride</NameTxt>
      <P>Not if one man can hold up the whole thing, and claim a share in a commonage like that.  I want to be very plain about this.

      <P>I see no reason why this man should not be compensated. This planting will be of general benefit to the other five people concerned.  It <Col N="1283" /> seems to me there is more than one kind of compulsion.  That is my opinion. I come up against this problem not only in relation to forestry but also in relation to culs-de-sac where one man at the end will block all the others. I think it is time some steps were taken to deal with that situation.  I think the Minister would have the support of the House if he took such powers.  I wish to join with those who raised the matter of the grant for private planting.  I think an acre is the smallest unit for which a grant will be given by the Land Commission.  I think the £10 grant should be increased. If it was increased, more people would plant trees on their land. If the people who have waste land got a grant of £20 many of them would be inclined to plant it themselves.  It would save the Department a lot and would be a great benefit to the country. In regard to this Bill, the Minister believes he is taking a lot of power but when he goes to work it he will find to the contrary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Even though this measure has been debated at great length, I should not like the discussion to conclude without adding some remarks.  Coming from a constituency which is deeply interested in afforestation, it is only natural that I should mention a few matters that I have in mind.  It seems rather peculiar to me that a non-contentious measure, such as this Bill undoubtedly is, should give rise to a great deal of controversy and heat.  During the debate we had certain Deputies on the one hand telling the Minister that he was not going fast enough to work, and on the other, saying that if they themselves happened to be in his position, every farmer in the country would be growing trees inside a couple of years.  It is all very fine for some of these people to be putting forward their theories here but, if they were asked to put some of these theories into practice, afforestation <Col N="1284" /> would not be one step further ahead than it is to-day.</P>
      <P>Side by side with that type of argument, we have other Deputies accusing the Minister of adopting Cromwellian practices, claiming that he seeks to compel people to sell their land for forestry purposes.  I cannot get any such impression from the memorandum which states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Bill is designed to facilitate the acquisition of land for forestry purposes.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I know the Minister well enough to know that he has not in mind the taking of land by compulsory methods. Neither the State nor public authorities like to take lands by compulsory methods.  There is nothing in this Bill, despite what legal people such as Deputy Moran claim to be able to read into it, that ordinary folk as we are cannot understand.  Despite their claim that this Bill tends towards compulsory acquisition of land, I cannot see any such intention there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a measure that is long overdue and I have no hesitation in offering my congratulations to the Minister for Lands on introducing it here.  I know very well that the purpose he has in mind is to push forward, as forcibly and as vigorously as he can, the afforestation programme of his Department. A good deal of the criticism was spiteful criticism and could be said not to be in any way constructive. Possibly a few members of this House may have some personal dislike for the Minister and may avail of the opportunity of expressing it in this discussion. However, I feel sure that any reasonably-minded members in this House, whether they be on this side or in the Opposition, will agree that the present Minister during the four or five years that he has been in charge of the Forestry Department is doing the utmost to advance that Department. As one who has approached him again and again on forestry matters, I can say I never got anything but complete satisfaction from the Minister.  Were it not for the type of criticism levelled at him in the course of this discussion, I would not deem it necessary to make <Col N="1285" /> these comments at all or waste the time of the House in making them.</P>
    <P>No member here who spoke on this measure, even those who are most critical of it, said it was a bad Bill. They all agree it was a necessary measure.  It is very peculiar that, even though they agree it is a step forward in our afforestation programme, they should be so critical.  One big advantage I see in this measure&mdash;and I think it will be most helpful to West Cork&mdash; is that it will overcome the big difficulty which has confronted Ministers in this country for a number of years in acquiring land, that is this question of title.  This Bill deals only with title.  We all, who are dealing with public business, realise that the majority of the titles in some parts of this country&mdash;and I could apply that to my own constituency of West Cork &mdash;are defective and that the present method of taking over land is a slow and difficult process due to these defective titles.  I am hopeful that under this measure a good deal of the work that had to be done in the past in dealing with these titles will now be eliminated and that land that has been offered to the Department freely by the occupiers and by the owners, even though they may not be registered legally as owners, will now be taken over speedily by the Minister and that we will have no further hold up of that nature when this Bill passes through both Houses of Parliament.</P>
    <P>Speaking from a local angle, I can see many benefits accuring to West Cork from this measure.  We have, as the Minister knows, large acreages of land in the Dunmanway-Inchigeela districts ready and available for forestry but due to defective titles the Minister was unable to deal with this for some years past.  I am hopeful that now the Minister will be able to proceed without any more undue delay and also that we will have this scheme under way in the very near future.  The same remarks apply to Schull and in Goleen.  There is no question, so far as West Cork is concerned, of taking land by compulsion.  We have plenty of suitable land to offer to the Minister and he can rest assured that he will never have any need for compelling <Col N="1286" /> any person in West Cork to give him land.  I feel sure that that is what the Minister would like, that he does not want compulsion in any shape or form.</P>
    <P>In western districts and in Southern Ireland we have commonages that are suitable for afforestation.  Deputy Gilbride, in his remarks a while ago, was rather perturbed about the acquisition of some of these commonages in his area.  I think that is specifically dealt with in this Bill and in a very fair and reasonable way.  I am quoting from page 4 of the explanatory memorandum and I think this would get over the point Deputy Gilbride was raising:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Where land is subject to common grazing rights and one (or more) of the holders of these rights is unwilling to lose his right, his case can be met by substituting for the existing easement a new easement by way of a sole right to graze a limited area of the land proportionate to his previous share in the grazing rights over the whole of the land.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I assume from that statement that if ten people own a commonage, say, of 1,000 acres and that nine of those people are willing to hand over their rights to the Department of Lands, and if the tenth person is unwilling, what the Minister has in mind is that he will give him a proportionate area, an exclusive right, to 100 acres of land.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>That is exactly right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The other 900 acres will be available to the Department of Lands.  Such objector would welcome the exclusive right to 100 acres of land in preference to one-tenth right to 1,000 acres.  From that point of view alone the Bill will be very helpful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In West Cork and, probably, in other parts of the country, commonages sometimes cause conflict amongst neighbours.  There may be disagreement as to grazing rights.  One party may claim that another party has more cattle and sheep on the commonage than he is entitled to.  I know that a number of these commonages will now be handed over.  The people who do not wish to hand over their rights will <Col N="1287" /> be given exclusive right to a proportionate share of the land.  Nothing could be fairer than that.  I cannot understand why some Deputies should have complained about communist tactics or compulsory methods.</P>
    <P>The question of interference with private ownership is a big question.  It is only done, I feel sure, where the State believes that such a step is warranted. Any Deputy who has any fear of compulsory acquisition arising from this measure should forget it.  I feel sure that the Minister and future Ministers will always see to it that there will be no interference with the private ownership of land except in remote cases where it is for the common benefit of the community as a whole.</P>
    <P>The difficulty of acquiring suitable land in some districts was mentioned. Price-fixing is very old, dating back some years.  When the Minister fixed an average price of not more than £10 an acre for land offered to his Department prices were not like what they are now.  The price of land has increased since that provision was made. That is only natural, having regard to the sharp increase in the price of cattle and sheep that graze a good deal of the land which is offered to the Department for forestry purposes.  The Minister should consider carefully the advisability of increasing the price which the Department is at present empowered to offer for this land.  There should be more flexibility with regard to the price.  It is very embarrassing to the Department that their hands should be tied in the matter of the price.</P>
    <P>Assuming that three farmers offer 200 acres of land to the Department for forestry purposes and that there is a small area of land dividing these three parcels and that the owners of that small area were reluctant to part with it having regard to the fixed price, it involves the Department in expense in fencing the three separate enclosures whereas, if there were more flexibility regarding price, the entire area of land could be acquired for the same amount of money as would be used in acquiring the three parcels separately and <Col N="1288" /> fencing them.  That position has arisen and is likely to arise in a number of districts.  I do not know whether or not at this stage the Minister could give more power to the Department in regard to the question of price, but I would ask him to give the matter careful consideration.  Greater flexibility would be of great advantage to the officials of the Department in negotiating acquisition.</P>
    <P>In addition to beautifying the country, afforestation gives a good deal of productive employment.  I do not like the attitude of Deputy Giles in sneering at Irishmen for emigrating and not being inclined to work.  In that respect he indicted, in the main, his own constituents when he told us about the wild land in that constituency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Giles meant to convey that the land is neglected wilfully and that the people are not too mindful of cultivating it or bringing it into reasonable production. That may be the case in Meath where there are big holdings and where there is a big proportion of very good land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>And no forests, although they have a forestry office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel sure that Deputy Giles knows what he is talking about and, possibly, the people who emigrate from Meath may be doing so in order to see distant lands, but I can assure the House that that is not the position in West Cork or in other parts.  I know of no one leaving West Cork to seek his livelihood in a foreign land save those who are compelled through the force of economic circumstances. The people would be only too anxious to stay in their native land if there were any opportunity of earning a reasonable livelihood.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, we lack industrial development. I am hopeful that, through the afforestation programme, a reasonable amount of productive employment will be given.  There is no use in talking about employment other than productive employment.  Productive employment is the only type that I believe in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1289" /> I do not wish to delay the House.  My principal objects in speaking were to offer my congratulations to the Minister for introducing this measure from which, I hope, will develop freer acquisition of land and, secondly, to suggest reconsideration of the question of price.  I would like to emphasise that matter.</P>
    <P>Naturally, I join with other Deputies in fostering private enterprise so far as farmers or others are concerned.  Any help, advice or technical assistance that they need should be provided so that they could have plantations on their holdings which would be of immense benefit in providing shelter and so on.  I conclude by wishing the Minister Godspeed in his drive for afforestation and with the hope that as a result of this measure he will be able to move somewhat faster than he is at the moment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>One might reasonably say this has been a really remarkable debate.  It has afforded opportunities to Deputies on all sides of the House &mdash;and I say &ldquo;all sides&rdquo; advisedly because, in a matter dealing with afforestation or any kindred activity, one must look upon it from a national and not a political viewpoint.  It has given Deputies on all sides of the House the opportunity for varied expressions of sentiment, and varied suggestions.  It has given them an opportunity to deal with particular parts of their own constituencies which they probably would have liked to mention.  It has given other Deputies an opportunity of claiming that they were the first in this great afforestation drive.  It has given Deputies opportunities probably to be more bitter than they intended to be; it has given them opportunities of saying things they never intended. It has even given opportunities to Deputies to rise away above the highest treetops into the flights of almost spiritual melodrama.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a measure, taken in conjunction with the motion, to deal with the speeding up of afforestation and in spite of the various sentiments expressed and the various suggestions made, overriding it all, it must be conceded at once, there is a sincerity that can only have its origin in the full appreciation, either conscious or <Col N="1290" /> subconscious, on the part of every Deputy that this is a national question and one that deserves treatment from either a special Ministry of its own, a commission or a board.  I have a completely open mind on these matters but I do think it is a project that requires special treatment and preferably treatment outside the realm of politics.</P>
    <P>When one looks around and sees the great progress that has been made by semi-State bodies such as the E.S.B., Bord na Móna and other kindred activities, one must be forced to the conclusion that anything connected with the national wealth and national production must of necessity be better looked after and catered for by such an organisation.  There is no doubt that afforestation and the growth of trees from the point of view of business and industrial development is an asset to be sought after.  In addition altogether to the beauty that it lends to our countryside, it has possible effects on the climatic conditions prevailing in an area.  Be that as it may, I must turn to this Bill and deal with the question which it really sets out to deal with&mdash; the question of difficult title and the acquisition of commonages.  There is enshrined in the Constitution of this country the right to private property and that right should not be lightly interfered with.</P>
    <P>I do not say that the acquisition of land for afforestation purposes or for the relief of congestion would be lightly undertaken because it is my experience, in the courts of the lay commissioners, that every possible angle is looked into before a man's land is taken and every possible opportunity is given to him before his lands are acquired for any of the purposes set out in the Land Acts for which such acquisition is sought.  What is difficult title?  The answer simply is that difficult title is no title.  I want to say fairly and squarely to the Minister that in my opinion&mdash;and I am expressing a personal opinion&mdash;his Department are treading on extremely dangerous ground when they decide, as they will when this Bill becomes law, to give compensation to a man who has only six years' occupancy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1291" /> In this morning's post there was the draft Bill for the new Statute of Limitations and I went promptly to the relevant section to find out what was the limitation period in the proposed new Bill against action for the recovery of land.  I find there the old 12 years' provision which dates back to 1833 and which has been maintained in the 1874 and subsequent statutes. The 12 years' provision deals with land and the six years' with simple contracts. I do not know what will happen when such compensation is paid to a man who occupied land for a period of six years if the rightful owner can come along in the intervening six years and make a claim, not for compensation for the land itself, but for the possession of the land which has been acquired for forestry purposes.</P>
    <P>This commonage question will raise a number of complications I fear, and it may mean that injustice will be done to the common holders.  A common is not made up of the same kind of land from mearing to mearing.  There is the high part of it and the low part, the part which grows good grass and the part that yields bad grass, the part that has water and the part that has shelter.  In allocating portions of that commonage, how is anybody going to allocate as compensation a sufficient quantum of good grazing, rough-grazing for the winter, water and shelter?  There are problems to which I think the Minister and his legal advisers could well address themselves between this and Committee Stage. While I say all these things, I appreciate to the fullest the sentiment behind this Bill was to develop afforestation to the very fullest extent.  I would advise that the Department would proceed with the greatest possible caution.  From my own personal and professional viewpoint I would say this is going to be a gold mine for practitioners.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>It is for that reason that I wished to criticise the Bill at this stage.  Perhaps I lack experience in this question, but I think the answer to this commonage question is the <Col N="1292" /> shelter belt of forest at the back of the holdings with adequate and suitable rights of way through for the people from their holdings.  It is in that way that the qualities of commonage, to which I have already referred, will be left untouched.</P>
      <P>I would like to know from the Minister what has happened to all the offers of lands made to his Department for forestry purposes.  In my own constituency I must have offered to the Land Commission for forestry purposes upwards of 10,000 acres.  I would like to know whether these lands, and all the other lands that must have been offered by Deputies from other constituencies, have been surveyed and suitably examined and if they have been rejected, before it was decided to come into this House to seek a measure such as we are debating to-day.</P>
      <P>I think that much more could be done as regards social planting and the encouragement of private owners to plant.  Again, I think that the planting of shelter belts should play a big part in the afforestation programme.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to the third paragraph of the explanatory memorandum in dealing with the present rights enjoyed in commonage.  The simple explanation of what tenancy in common means is that a man has a right, not alone to one-tenth of the land, but he also has the right to travel all over that land.  If you put him into a limited area of that land, are you going to give him the right amount of land to enable him to continue to eke out his livelihood as he has done up to the present?  I would be extremely jealous, whether or not I was a member of the House, of any kind of measure going through this House that would tend to interfere in any way with the fundamental rights of private property and the fundamental right of every citizen to earn his livelihood by a proved economy.</P>
      <P>On page 4 of the Minister's statement he deals with what he calls a slowing up and quotes some reasons for it.  He states:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;We are now planting at a rate sufficient to meet our commercial timber needs in 45 to 50 years' time <Col N="1293" /> and there is nothing more we can do on that front except to ensure that the Forestry Division is given a proper opportunity to maintain and develop the plantations in the proper way.  I want to say on that score that when I first took office as Minister for Lands, I did not fully appreciate the extent to which a rapid increase in fresh planting could detract attention from the requirements of the existing plantations. That fact did not become apparent until 1951 and the Minister who took over from me in that year would have had my full support when he announced to this House in introducing the Forestry Estimate for 1952-53&mdash;Volume 132, columns 1966-1968, debate of 1st July, 1952&mdash;that it would be necessary to reduce the planting rate for that year to 12,500 acres in order to make sure that arrears of work in the existing plantations received attention.  We cannot quarrel with him for that as every Deputy must realise that the care of existing plantations must take precedence over fresh planting.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am not going to take the Minister to task on that statement but I am going to take to task the administrative outlook that is responsible for the presentation of that statement to this House by the Minister.  Does that statement mean that the Forestry Department were not prepared to employ more people as they went along and to leave behind them an ample quota of labour to deal with the plantations in all stages of their various activities?  That is the part of the Minister's speech on which, I think, an explanation is due to this House and for which I personally do not blame the Minister but rather the administrative outlook responsible for that part of the speech.</P>
    <P>I cannot, in conclusion, when dealing with measures of this kind, avoid referring not alone to the atmosphere of the House but to the whole atmosphere of the Minister's speech itself.  This atmosphere is not characteristic solely of legislation dealing with forestry but is common to legislation dealing with every aspect of <Col N="1294" /> life.  There is, running through it, what I feel is a pitiful anticipation of failure.  It is for that reason that I conclude this speech by urging upon the Minister that before he puts any of the provisions of this Bill into operation, he will see that every offer of land is investigated.  I would advise him to take counsel with his own legal advisers and the legal advisers of the Government for the purpose of finding some sort of autonomous or semiautonomous body to deal with this particular branch of what must be, either in this or any other country, a source of great national wealth.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCrowe" hpid="Mr. Crowe Mr. Crowe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
      <P>Speaking as one who was brought up and reared amongst woodland I am anxious to see that the target which the Minister has set out to achieve is achieved.  I have every confidence in the Minister and I am sure that he will achieve that target if there is less of the obstructionist tactics that we have seen here in this House.  I welcome this Bill because there is no indication of compulsion in it and I know that the Minister will be prepared to give a reasonable and equitable price for any land that he acquires.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tipperary, the county which I represent, has plenty of land suitable for forestry, but there is a great need to speed up the machinery for taking over the land.  The machinery was very slow up to 1948 when the present Minister came into office and speeded it up somewhat.  In the district where I live, there was a State sawmill working in a small way in 1948.  To-day it is one of the finest in Ireland.  In the three years of inter-Party Government, very much was done for forestry in my area. I was very impressed by what the Minister has said about forestry, coming as he does from a western district and being a farmer.  I was amazed at how much he knew about it.  I cannot agree that Bord na Móna or the E.S.B. would do a better job nor can I agree with the proposal to hand any of the work over to them.  Young men have been trained in the work for the past three or four years.  They are qualified for the job and I am quite sure that they will do the job and do <Col N="1295" /> it well.  They will qualify for the job and I am quite sure they will do the job well, by speeding up the acquisition of land suitable for forestry.  I think there should be more encouragement for farmers to plant shelter belts. Trees are becoming costly and county committees should get more financial aid and encouragement for planting these isolated shelter belts.  I would again appeal to the Minister to give fair and reasonable prices for land acquired for forestry purposes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Norton) William Norton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Norton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann hereby confirms the Transport Act, 1950 (Additional Powers) Order, 1955.</P>
      <P>This Order will not come into operation until it is confirmed by a resolution of each House of the Oireachtas. The purpose of the Order is to enable C.I.E. to construct a railway about three miles long to connect the cement factory at Castlemungret with Limerick railway station.  At present cement from that factory intended for distribution by rail is carried by road by C.I.E. to the railway station at Limerick.  This arrangements is both inconvenient and uneconomic.  The provision of the railway will eradicate costly double handling and delays and will enable C.I.E. to reduce the charge for transport of cement.  The resultant saving to Cement Ltd. will be passed on to the users of cement.  Moreover, C.I.E. will be enabled to earn a profit whereas the present arrangements show a loss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There can be no doubt about the need for this railway which will be of benefit to the consumers as well as to C.I.E. and the cement industry.  C.I.E. were able to reach agreement with the local authorities about the proposed route of the railway, but as there were objections from a number of local people who considered that their interests would be adversely affected, <Col N="1296" /> I arranged for a public inquiry to be held at Limerick in August last.  The report of the inquiry recommends that any inconvenience or disturbance to the persons mainly affected would be reduced if the proposed route of the railway, where it crosses the Limerick-Croom Road, were moved a short distance in a northerly direction.  C.I.E. has agreed that this proposal is practicable, and at my request they have also agreed to the diversion.  I am satisfied that the revised route is the most suitable having regard to all the interests involved and that it meets, as far as they can reasonably be met, the interests of the objecting parties.</P>
    <P>It is expected that construction of the railway will commence early in the new year.  The project will provide increased employment in the area for a period of about 12 months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Everyone in Limerick &mdash;local authorities and private individuals&mdash;is unanimous regarding the desirability of having this link between the railway station and the cement factory at Castlemungret, but there are some aspects of the Minister's Order which even at this late stage I should like to bring to his notice.</P>
      <P>The first of these is that there is no mention whatever in the Order of the proposed construction of a bridge at the point in question.  It may possibly be that the local authority&mdash;Limerick County Council&mdash;proposes to erect a bridge at some future unspecified date but the Minister has not dealt with that here to-day.  I would like to impress on the Minister not only the desirability but the absolute urgency or having a bridge connected at this point.  It is a complete waste of money, in my opinion and in the opinion of very many competent people, to put this line across the road, and go to the expense of providing level crossing gates when the bridge could be built at the same time.  The former Government allocated a sum of £20,000 from the National Development Fund for the specific purpose of contributing as much as possible towards this bridge. That has been scrapped&mdash;the Minister has not made any mention of this bridge at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1297" /> Another aspect of it is that the Limerick Regional Hospital which was opened last October is quite a short distance from this route.  This proposed level crossing, this crossing of the roadway, would take place on the main trunk road from Limerick to Cork and it is a very busy intersection and I would ask the Minister to bear in mind the appalling position which will arise should an emergency case being rushed by ambulance to the regional hospital for an emergency operation find the crossing gates closed.  The plan appears to be neither modern in conception nor in design and the only thing I can suggest at this late stage is&mdash;as the Minister mentioned just now work will start next January&mdash;that the bridge should start at the same time.</P>
    <P>The bridge, as far as I can gather&mdash; the Minister did not mention it&mdash;is to be provided by Limerick County Council.  I know Limerick County Council as well as the Minister knows them and when they say at some future date they will provide a bridge, that could possibly mean five or ten or 15 years, if ever.  The main point is that it is just throwing public money down the drain to put this level-crossing there and then have the bridge later.</P>
    <P>Coming to the Order itself, it says in Article 3, Deposit of Plans and Sections and Book of Reference:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The board shall deposit with the County Registrar of the County of Limerick as soon as possible after the making of this Order true copies of the plans and sections and the book of reference to such plans and sections which accompanied the application for this Order.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Surely the application for this Order showed a different plan?  Would the Minister not tell me if I am not correct in that?  C.I.E. applied with a certain route in mind and now this Order which the Minister is to make to-day shows that route being brought further towards Limerick City, towards Ballinacurra Creek.  In fact, the plans which accompanied the application from the board have now been changed and therefore this Order is <Col N="1298" /> now being made on a new changed route.</P>
    <P>There is an important point in Article 4, Power to make Railway, which says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Subject to the provisions of this Order, the board may, within the townlands, lay down, make and maintain in the lines and according to the levels shown on the deposited plans, the railway and railway line hereinafter described...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is the feeling of the Limerick Corporation, the Limerick County Council and other interested bodies which appeared at this inquiry that this line should be brought as near as possible to Ballinacurra Creek.  If the Minister has the map before him he will see that that proposition is quite a feasible one.</P>
    <P>There are a house and lands belonging to a Mr. Arthur McMahon shown. It will be seen that the proposed line will cross part of these lands.  The price paid for this residence and lands was in the region of £14,500.  It is one of the most highly rated residences, if not the most highly rated, in the whole of County Limerick.  If the Minister would be good enough, even at this late stage, to re-route slightly the proposed line and run it nearer to Ballinacurra Creek Mr. McMahon's land would not suffer to the same extent.</P>
    <P>Now, I want to draw the Minister's attention to the holding of Mr. Hayes on the other side of the road.  The Minister will notice that when the line crosses the road it swings in the direction of the cement factory.  That is up-lying land and represents the three best fields Mr. Hayes has.  By continuing the line parallel to Ballinacurra Creek one goes into the bottoms or low-lying land and Mr. Hayes will thereby not suffer any serious loss at all.  Not only will Mr. Hayes be satisfied but the board will make a saving because in due course compensation will have to be paid under the Order. That compensation will be assessed by an arbitrator and it is obvious that the compensation for low-lying land, as against upland, will not be anything like as heavy.  This field has a frontage <Col N="1299" /> of some hundreds of feet on the main city road.  If the Minister adopts my suggestion the compensation will be negligible.  On that frontage there are approximately 60 building sites.  I do not know what method the arbitrator will adopt but putting those at a figure of £10 per annum would represent £600 in all; capitalise that at 15 years' purchase and one arrives at a figure of £9,000.  Whether the arbitrator would give that figure I do not know.  But my suggestion will satisfy all parties.  It is not an unreasonable one even at this late stage.</P>
    <P>I agree that the inquiry took place last August and all the interested parties had an opportunity of going along there and objecting.  No later than three weeks ago the Limerick County Council had a meeting at which it passed a resolution urging the Minister to run this line parallel to the creek and the Limerick Corporation subsequently adopted the same resolution. My suggestion now does not mean that the Minister will have to withdraw this Order because the line can be run within certain limits and through certain specific townlands.  I appeal to the Minister to consider the suggestion.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that work would start in January and he considered that it would be completed within 12 months or so.  No. 5 of the Order deals with the period for the completion of the railway.  I think there is a mistake.  It says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The board shall complete and finish ready for use the railway and the proper equipment for working same within two years from the date of this Order or such further period not exceeding one year as the Minister may allow and on the expiration of the said period of one year or such further period as may be allowed...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Surely that is not right.  The Minister starts by saying &ldquo;not exceeding one year&rdquo; and then the Order goes on to say &ldquo;on the expiration of such period of one year or such further period as may be allowed&rdquo;.  I respectfully submit that the Minister is not empowered to go beyond the three years in all. The necessity may not arise in this <Col N="1300" /> case.  It probably will not arise, but the Minister should clear up that point.</P>
    <P>Another matter of grave concern to us in Limerick is the fact that there will be a level crossing.  Will there be a permanent gatekeeper?  I do not think it is good enough for the Minister to say that the onus will be on C.I.E.  In one portion of this Order reference is made to the necessity for illuminating the crossing at certain times, namely, when visibility is less than 200 feet.  Now, if a resident caretaker is not employed the consequences might be very serious.</P>
    <P>For many years, agitation has been going on under successive Governments to have the port of Limerick connected to the railhead.  Under the Order before us, there may be only two trains running at two or three o'clock in the morning from the cement factory, but the Minister should look ahead and take cognisance of the fact that in all probability the Limerick docks will, within the next three or four years, or possibly earlier, be connected with the railhead.  That would mean that trains would be running not only from the cement factory at night but all day long from the docks over this very busy throughfare, the main Limerick-Cork road, to say nothing about the regional hospital, the housing schemes and all the workers going to and fro.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister will appreciate the very serious position which could arise.  Possibly he may say that the county council will build this bridge at some future date.  I do not know who will build it, but if it is the county council, why not start next year?  There is a section here empowering the board in consultation with the Limerick County Council to alter the level of this line where it crosses the road.  Are we to have yet another typical example of waste of public funds or C.I.E. funds?  The Minister will allow a certain action when this Order is confirmed.  At the same time he is making provision for the possibility of alterations in the future.  If this line has to be dropped two, three or four feet this capital expenditure now envisaged will be expenditure of a temporary nature.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1301" /> The Minister does not mention in this Order that the competent planning authority for this area is the Limerick Corporation not the Limerick County Council.  This area where the Ballinacurra Creek is situated, is in the contiguous planning area and the Limerick Corporation have control of that. I want to remind the Minister again that the gravest anxiety exists in Limerick about this proposal.  It has created no political controversy at all, but a general anxiety among all these people on the question of the level crossing, the bridge and the desirability of coming nearer to the creek. The Limerick Corporation were unanimous that it should run parallel to the creek.  The Limerick County Council were unanimous, and even protested when they saw the Minister's new proposals, that this line should run as suggested and as requested at the inquiry. Would the Minister consider at this late stage investigating my suggestion? Even though the Order would go through to-day he could still meet everyone's wishes because it is specified in the Order that the board is empowered to run a line through certain townlands.  That gives scope to the board to use their discretion and try to satisfy the wishes of the citizens of Limerick City and the occupants of the land who will be so adversely affected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carew</NameTxt>
      <P>As this is purely a Limerick matter, I should like to say a few words on it.  I must first thank the Minister for having this link line brought about and now that he has come to the House for the necessary Order we are very glad to hear from him that the work will be undertaken shortly.  We are all aware of the importance of having a railway link with the cement factory which has fulfilled its obligations and has given, not alone the Government but the people of this country, the greatest satisfaction in the quality of the product that has been produced there.  There is also the fact that during the past year they have completed a further extension of that factory.  I understand that the directors of Cement Limited have for a very considerable time been pressing C.I.E. for this link line and I am very glad it is coming about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1302" /> It is true, as Deputy O'Malley has said, that the Limerick Deputies have been brought into conference with local residents in the matter of this railway.  I think there were three routes suggested: one of them was ruled out.  There was another that I thought might be the best one, and that was one to run at the back of the regional hospital.  I understand the expense was too great and it was turned down for that reason.  Another was to run on a more direct line through a residential area.  The present one is the one that is running over Mr. McMahon's lands.  I was very glad to see that the line that was under discussion at the recent inquiry has evidently by agreement with C.I.E., been altered slightly, which has to some extent removed the grievances of Mr. McMahon but not as fully as perhaps we would like them to be.</P>
    <P>Let me say here that Mr. McMahon is not anti-railway.  He is not hostile to the railway but like Deputy O'Malley, his point of view is that he built a house there some years ago which cost, I understand from Deputy O'Malley, something in the region of £15,000.  At that time he had to seek permission from the Limerick Corporation to build that house and because it was in the contiguous area over which the corporation had control, the Limerick Corporation, as the authority, gave him permission to build the house and to put that considerable amount of money into it on which he is now paying very heavy rates.  He felt that if the railway could be brought nearer the creek it would remove any objection he had.  I live very close to that area; it is only a matter of three or four hundred yards away.  I know every inch of the ground.  I have known the land in summer and winter; it is flooded in the wintertime.  I believe that if this creek were drained properly that railway could be built much nearer to the creek.  However, when I inquired into the matter I found it was purely because of the cost that C.I.E. did not go nearer the creek than they originally intended.  I am glad they have to some extent relieved the anxiety of Mr. McMahon.</P>
    <P>I hope when this Order goes through <Col N="1303" /> it will be possible still further to ease his anxiety.  It is only a matter of cost, to what extent I do not know, but certain engineering people who seem to know something about this business informed me that if C.I.E. were prepared to spend extra money there would be less interference with Mr. McMahon's property.  I feel that that should be done.  Even though Mr. McMahon is only an individual he has rights.  I have sympathy with him as has everybody else.  He is not an unreasonable person and he certainly would be facilitated if some further slight alteration were carried out in the plan.  I am not in a position to say what that alteration would be.  In any event, Mr. McMahon is very grateful for what has been done already.  I would like to tell the Minister that Mr. McMahon is wholeheartedly with the idea of the railway.  He is one of the people in Limerick who are large suppliers of cement and timber and is one of the larger purchasers of cement.  He is not hostile to the idea of the railway.  He feels, however, that C.I.E. could have had greater consideration for his problem when they were deciding on the route that this line was to take.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, let me say that we are grateful in Limerick that the Minister is putting this Order through and, as Deputy O'Malley has said, we do look forward at some future date, when this line is constructed through Mungret if the harbour commissioners so decide to have a link line to the docks, to having the railway moved out much nearer to us.  Perhaps some further discussion could take place between C.I.E. and the owners of the property concerned so that a happy solution would be brought about.  We know from past history that, no matter how we try to meet certain problems, people will object but I feel that in a matter of this kind C.I.E. and the Government concerned should be, as they are now in making the Order, at all times helpful even to an individual interest.  As far as we in Limerick are concerned may I say that we welcome the extension covered by the Order?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1304" /> The other matter to which I want to refer is the bridge.  Undoubtedly close up to a city, a level-crossing is not a very desirable thing to have and if it is a fact that this bridge will not be constructed for the moment, we would like to have some assurance that it will be erected at some future date. The Minister may not be able to give an answer to that question now but I should like that he would consider it at some future date.</P>

      <P>I can quite understand that a matter of this kind is bound to agitate local feelings and to fertilise a lot of local views, to such an extent that they tend to get out of focus in approaching the problem in a general kind of way.  I do not think there is any likelihood of the inconveniences arising which Deputy O'Malley mentioned. I should like to bring some matters to his notice in the hope of getting this matter back into better focus.</P>
      <P>First, one would think that the trains to be run on this line would be passing to and fro with the same velocity and the same regularity as trains pass in and out of Kingsbridge or in and out from Westland Row to Dún Laoghaire.  There will be two trains a day and it is quite on the cards that they will both run at times when the local residents will be sound asleep.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Lemass often passed that road in the morning and did not see very much activity there.  I do not believe the health of the residents will be seriously affected in this matter.  Two trains per day will pass on this line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not worrying about health.  We are worrying about the ultimate connection to the docks. Then you will have a busy line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be two trains per day.  Nobody can seriously suggest that that will cause any domestic disquiet or discord in the circumstances set out here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1305" /> Mr. McMahon's case has been mentioned. I do not want to discuss Mr. McMahon's private affairs at all.  What are the facts?  The railway which crosses the land of Mr. McMahon on the north side is about 400 feet from the house at its present point and the proposal is that the line will be pushed away another 100 feet from the original intention so that, so far as Mr. McMahon is concerned, he is quite a substantial distance away from the railway line.  The way in which the case was put here would give the impression that the train was running around Mr. McMahon's house.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is going through his tennis court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Mr. McMahon has approximately 15 acres of land and the total which will be occupied will be less than half an acre.  That is the proportion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Mr. McMahon's house will be 400 feet away from the railway line at the nearest point.  I do not think the sight of an occasional train will seriously disturb the amenities of the McMahon household.  In any case, Mr. McMahon's house is already bounded by, and in clear view of, a very busy road.  If the McMahon household can withstand the shock of being within clear view of a very busy road, two trains, moving gently, twice a day, are not likely to disturb seriously the amenities of the household.  The house will be further from the railway than it already is from the two roads which bound the property and I think, therefore, that Mr. McMahon can face up to this whole situation feeling confident that the even tenor of his ways will not be disturbed and that this railway line will in no way inconvenience the McMahon household.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Possibly, it would have been better if the erection of a level crossing had been avoided but I do not think that level crossings, as such, are things to be deplored in every set of circumstances. Only a couple of years ago the Department of Local Government made a grant to demolish a railway <Col N="1306" /> bridge on the Naas road and put up a level crossing in its place, feeling that the level crossing, used infrequently as it is there, and as it will be at Limerick, was better than a railway bridge. That railway bridge was torn down by the Department of Local Government a couple of years ago for the purpose of having it replaced by a level crossing.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley is a traveller and knows perfectly well that all over the Continent people manage to get to hospitals, doctors, nurses and dentists although many of the roads have level crossings on them.  The level crossing, and not the bridge, is the common thing on the Continent and I do not think it has been seriously suggested that it impeded people getting urgent medical treatment when the necessity arose.</P>
    <P>The original intention in this matter was that the railway should be routed in a particular way, but it was found possible to pull the railway out in a long fashion and then, arising out of the inquiry which was held, it was decided that certain deviation would be provided for; in other words, that there would be a certain tolerance in the laying of the railway line.  The inspecting officer has been able to arrange with C.I.E. that the line would be pitched further away from the houses and that is the maximum amount of pitching that can be done with this railway at the present time because of its proximity to the Ballinacurra river.  If the Ballinacurra river did not exist or if it were banked in concrete and if it had substantial foundations, it might be possible to pull the railway over close to it but the Ballinacurra river, as it exists at present, cannot take the railway nearer to it than is proposed in this new scheme, including the variation.</P>
    <P>The Limerick County Council had every opportunity of putting their views about putting the railway nearer to the Ballinacurra river but they did not raise this point at all at the inquiry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>They withdrew the objection when they got a guarantee <Col N="1307" /> that C.I.E. would bring the line as near as feasible to the river.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

By leaving the line where it crosses the road in its present position and by drawing back the line, by straightening the curve, Mr. McMahon would be satisfied.  Then, in the westerly direction, if the Minister allows the line not to curve immediately towards the cement factory but straighter for another 60 feet, Mr. Hayes' uplands are safe.  So, by these two simple matters the landowners on either side are perfectly safe.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether this is technically possible.  The net point raised will be put to the railway company to see if it is possible to adopt the suggestion.  At all events, the inspector who carried out the inquiry was an engineer himself and testified to the fact that the railway could not be brought any nearer to the river than was indicated in this plan.  Deputy O'Malley said that the Limerick Harbour Commissioners were anxious to have the harbour connected by rail with the Limerick terminus.  Some years ago the harbour commissioners were invited to apply for a grant for such a railway link but so far they have made no such application.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">

      <P>Then we can consider the question but at the moment the ball is in Deputy O'Malley's court and not in mine.

      <P>I am sure that is a matter that can be effectively argued with the Department of Local Government when the local authority decide to build the bridge.  Surely the local authority must make up their minds that they want a bridge before any action is taken to have the money made available.  The local authority may decide that they do not want a bridge.  If they decide that they do, the Deputy's footsteps will guide him to where the necessary funds are for projects such as this.  I think the Deputy is misreading Section 5.  The general intention is to construct the railway with the utmost expedition and these further periods provided for in Section 5 are in case unexpected difficulties should be encountered but it is hoped they can be avoided.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been said that every member of this House would welcome any advance made in the afforestation drive.  Personally I question that there is any advance provided in the legislation now before the House.  I would have thought that the Minister would be prepared to deal with all the land readily available and easy to acquire before he would find it necessary to seek legislation to deal with the difficult problems with which this Bill was designed to deal.  It seems from the Minister's statement that afforestation is no longer held up by the Government groups as the panacea for all our economic difficulties.  In the past it was supposed to be a cure for all our problems&mdash;unemployment and emigration&mdash;and that it was to play an important part in the country's economic future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Fianna Fáil's term of office we pushed afforestation to a fairly creditable extent but we were decried at that time by the Opposition who said we were not going fast enough.  We were anxious to go faster if we could but it was not always possible.  Now, the <Col N="1311" /> others concerned must agree that it is not such an easy matter as they led people to believe earlier.  We are now told that we must be content with a little progress.  There are many parcels of very suitable land available for afforestation and I am surprised the Minister did not explore all these before he thought it necessary to seek extra powers to deal with difficult cases.  We had in the past a director of forestry whom, I understand, we have no longer.  Perhaps much could be done in this direction if there was greater harmony, co-operation and effort towards a uniform purpose as between the administrative and technical effort at the top.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is any county, with the exception of the very congested areas along the western seaboard, which is more suitable for an intensified plantation programme, than County Donegal.  Very often a large proportion of the lands offered for planting may not be plantable but it is always necessary to take the good with the bad and I am satisfied that there is a vast area of plantable land in the county which has not even been explored.  I am also satisfied that many areas offered for planting have not been fully examined to see if they are suitable for forestry.</P>
    <P>I would urge on the Minister, if I may take this opportunity of doing so, to give the matter of the need for employment in these areas where unemployment and emigration is rife, his most prior consideration.  Much of the land which heretofore was considered unplantable has now been proved quite suitable for the planting of particular varieties.  At the present time it is hardly possible to find any type of land that is not suitable for some type of afforestation.  We have proved, in those areas which were planted with what I might call pilot plantations, that most of the areas available for afforestation in this country are suitable for the planting of some particular variety.</P>
    <P>I had visions at one time of an all-out drive, such as we had never previously envisaged, being made towards reafforestation&mdash;a drive which would <Col N="1312" /> absorb all the unemployed, give a new look to the bleak western seaboard and give the necessary employment to so many people who so anxiously require work, as well as supplying us with as much commercial timber as this country would need within a short time.  I think that many people who were led to believe that such an all-out attack on the afforestation problem was going to be launched must now be disillusioned.  I am not one of those people who give up hope that we cannot yet intensify our activities and I believe that we can yet undertake a plantation of those vast areas which are readily available.</P>
    <P>I have given notice of a question next week asking the Minister to give me some particulars of the derelict holdings in the congested areas of the western seaboard; the number of holdings vacated by the owners and let to neighbouring farmers; all of which would be available for acquisition by his Department for afforestation or any other purpose.  I think that we should have pursued the acquisition of such lands which would not require any special legislation or any other facilities than those at the Minister's disposal at present.</P>
    <P>I have also advocated in this House the question of the Forestry Department's being content to acquire smaller parcels of land for afforestation than those which they now regard as the necessary minimum.  The late Minister gave me, time and again, very good reasons why that was not a practical proposition.  My suggestion is that, if we should get a number of these within close proximity of each other, there is no reason why they should not be considered as one comprehensive area.  That would, to some extent, overcome some of the difficulties where we have people who wish to hold on to their holdings.  If the Forestry Department would agree to take a speckled area of that type it would make a nice overall scheme and might eventually be of much greater value from the scenic point of view than if we had one entire area completely in a plantation.  I do not know what the Minister's views are with regard to these smaller parcels but I <Col N="1313" /> would like to hear the views of his advisers on the matter.</P>
    <P>The late Minister pointed out that this proposal presented problems in the matter of fencing but that could easily be overcome, in so far as where you got a parcel of land adjacent to the holding of a farmer, you might very often get co-operation from the occupant of that adjoining holding.</P>
    <P>The only other matter I wish to deal with is one which I cannot fully understand. It is with regard to the attitude of the Forestry Department towards the shelter belt scheme advocated by the county committees of agriculture. I do not think the Forestry Division looks with favour on the shelter belt scheme which we administer in our county committees and which I believe is a very commendable type of afforestation. Thousands of trees are given out heavily subsidised&mdash;almost free&mdash;to tenants of certain valuations each year to provide shelter belts in certain clumps convenient to the farmhouses. Any committee with due regard for the future success of the trees allotted under this scheme will ensure that their inspectors occasionally visit the holding to make sure that the trees are properly cared for and that they survive.</P>
    <P>I think one of the reasons why the shelter belt scheme met opposition from some quarters in the past was that there was not always sufficient supervision afterwards by the county committees' inspectors and very often the percentage of trees surviving was rather small in proportion to the numbers allocated under the scheme.  Our view in the County Donegal Committee &mdash;of which I have the honour to be chairman&mdash;was that if 33? per cent. survived it more than justified the amount of money spent on the scheme. We were not always satisfied that the Forestry Division looked with favour on that particular scheme for reasons which were never fully known to me.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is anything further I want to say on this Bill except to assure the Minister that anything which we think would accelerate the rate of planting or the afforestation drive generally is undoubtedly welcome on this side of the House, but I must <Col N="1314" /> say we cannot feel other than disappointed, like many people throughout the country, at the Minister's admission that afforestation cannot be pressed forward with the same rapidity as he led the people to believe at one time could be achieved.  There are many difficulties in connection with it and finance is one of them but that is one which could be got over if the merits of the scheme justified the provision of the necessary money to make it a success.  I do not think that the difficulties which the present Bill proposes to surmount are so serious as to warrant any haste in introducing this measure.  There is no harm in bringing it in now, I am sure, but will the Minister deny that he had not exhausted all the land which was readily available and easily acquired before he found it necessary to ask the House to pass legislation of this kind?</P>

      <P>First, I want to say that I am grateful to all the members of the House who have taken part in this debate for the way they have assisted me and given me a vast amount of encouragement in regard to this Bill.  The very liveliness of the debate and the number of Deputies who have taken part in it are indications that one of the things I feared some time ago is not now going to happen&mdash;that it would be almost impossible to arouse public interest in afforestation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember when the inter-Party Government was in office before and when it was decided to expand the forestry programme I got the feeling that it was received both in the House and in the country very coolly.  If someone had proposed some entirely uninteresting matter I thought it could not have been received in a cooler spirit.  I am glad to say that even though there was some heat in the debate here and there, there was also a good deal of what I might describe as lack of application to the Bill before the House.  On the whole, I am delighted that afforestation is now a subject that this House and the public are surely aware of.  One can scarcely take up a newspaper now in which there is not a letter from somebody&mdash;very few of them criticising &mdash;with some suggestion, regarding <Col N="1315" /> forestry, even though on examination it may not always prove very useful. But this indicates an interest which is very pleasing to me.</P>
    <P>While on that subject, I want to let members of the House know that in my opinion three of the greatest undertakings faced by Governments in this country&mdash;no matter which Governments&mdash;were afforestation, land rehabilitation and arterial drainage. Looking back over the years, we see vast improvements in housing and in roads, and we are very proud of the progress made in industry; but when we look at these three major projects and look also at electrification which was started in 1926 by the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy McGilligan, who is now Attorney-General, these four projects are outstanding achievements for a country as small as ours, born, I might say, only 30 years ago.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>If I am leaving out any, it is not that I am belittling them but, coming from the country myself, I do say that those four projects, with afforestation at the top, are definitely outstanding.  They give the lie to those who in the past said Ireland was not fit to govern herself. I think those projects alone are ample proof that in the short time of a little more than 30 years of self-government, we have proved our ability to govern ourselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Deputies thought we were not going fast enough and I have a certain amount of sympathy with them, but I would ask them to come over to the Department or to any of the officials, either technical or administrative, and every information will be given to them so that they will know exactly what is going on in afforestation. There is no concealment or deception because there is nothing to keep back. I am intensely proud that all Deputies who spoke, with the exception of two, paid high tribute to the forestry service that has been built up.  I think I should mention in passing that on one occasion&mdash;I believe it was in the <Col N="1316" /> winter of 1950&mdash;when I saw our forestry officials up against, if I may use that expression, officials of a neighbouring country who had greater experience, I was given a new appreciation of our own forestry men because I saw at a glance that our men were head and shoulders over those they were up against at that time.</P>
    <P>One of the points made was that we should set up a forestry board.  As far as I can see, no great argument has been put forward in its favour but the suggestion that we should have a board makes me think.  I do not want and I think no member of the present Government wants any kudos out of afforestation.  I think we are agreed on all sides of the House that this country needs afforestation, and any Government in office has a duty not to hold back forestry but to do everything to further it.  When we see the twisting and turning that is done in the newspapers at the present time, some declaring for a board and others against it, I wonder is it a fact that some of these are getting on the band wagon now that forestry has made such great progress?  I have no objection to their trying to do that provided they do not interfere with the reins because the forestry programme at the present time is going ahead particularly well when we take into account the difficulties encountered in regard to acquisition and other things.</P>
    <P>The suggestion has been put forward that we should set up a board, and I think it was Deputy MacBride who mentioned that we should set it up on the same lines as Bord na Móna.  I must confess I do not like that suggestion.  Perhaps that is because I am a farmer and own a bit of land myself; and I come from a part of the country where the ownership of land is a red-hot question.  I do not like that suggestion when I examine the powers of acquisition that Bord na Móna has.  The only advantage a board could possibly have over the present Department would be in relation to sweeping powers of acquisition. If this House decides to give those powers, let them do so, by all means; but let us know exactly where we stand.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1317" /> In bringing this Bill before the House I am perfectly satisfied that the draftsman and the officials of the Forestry Division have succeeded in getting around difficulties of title, without violating the Constitution.  I have brought in this Bill for the purpose of acquiring land without compulsion, though some Deputies, notably. Deputy Moran, from my own constituency, think it is &ldquo;dripping&rdquo; with compulsion.  It is only right that Deputies should realise that Bord na Móna has extraordinary powers of acquisition; but Bord na Móna does not acquire the same type of territory or terrain as the Forestry Division. Bord na Móna acquires huge expanses of blanket bog, bog which in most cases does not form part of the farmer's means of livelihood, but is, on the contrary, a liability to him because he must pay rent and rates and taxes for that bog, which is nothing more or less than a death-trap for his live stock.</P>
    <P>I must take it that the suggestion is that we should hand over the Forestry Division as it stands to Bord na Móna, with Bord na Móna's powers of acquisition. It is here I want to hoist the danger signal.  We cannot have sweeping compulsory acquisition and I am glad to note that rural Deputies agreed with what I said on that subject on the motion the week before last.</P>
    <P>Bord na Móna at the moment can plaster a notice on a man's fence. Without going to any more trouble, within one month from putting that notice up, that particular bog becomes the property of Bord na Móna.  The land we are taking over for forestry will, however, have some agricultural value.  Its value may be low in some cases; it may be medium in others. Is it proposed to give the same sweeping powers to acquire this land for forestry?  Members of the legal profession here have suggested that. I want to put this question to them: How would they like it if Deputy Blaney from Donegal, Deputy Moran or Deputy O'Hara from Mayo, Deputy Palmer or Deputy Flynn from Kerry tabled a motion here suggesting we set up a board of legal men to plead all cases before the courts?  How would they like it if that <Col N="1318" /> board could go down to the Four Courts and to every court in the country, and put a notice on the front door saying that Mr. So-and-So, S.C., or B.L., could no longer plead in these courts?  He would then be out in the cold and another board would have to be established to award him some compensation. That is exactly what those who are proposing a board along the lines of Bord na Móna want to do with the farmers.</P>
    <P>If we want to get the landlord's bailiff or the minute men to do our dirty work and grab the small farmer's land for afforestation, then let us do it here openly, so that the small farmer, listening to the radio and reading his daily paper, will know exactly where he stands and who it is proposes to dispossess him.  Deputy McQuillan grew very hot under the collar and wanted to dissociate himself from the idea of compulsory acquisition.  I admit Deputy McQuillan never directly advocated compulsory acquisition in so many words; but, if he wants a board with the same powers as Bord na Móna, the fact remains that he wants compulsory acquisition.  Not alone that, but he wants to do that under a cloak, as the landlord did it by getting his bailiff to knock down the tenant's house and throw his chattels out on the roadside. Such a board would be our bailiff, appointed to do the dirty work, and we could come in here and act like Pontius Pilate, washing our hands and saying: &ldquo;It is the board did that; we can do nothing about it&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I know the position I am in myself in relation to the Irish Land Commission. Every consideration is given to the merits of each case by the commission, but I, as Minister, am not responsible for what is done simply because this House, in its wisdom, has by statute handed over certain functions to the lay commissioners.</P>
    <P>It would be a disaster to divorce Forestry from the Land Commission. It may surprise Deputies to know that, of the total acreage Forestry now hold, the Land Commission has been responsible for giving them no less than 75,000 acres.  In relation to subdivision, which under the 1923 Act is an intrinsic part of most sales, it would be surely adding red tape to <Col N="1319" /> red tape to divorce Forestry from the Land Commission.  The proper course is to have both under the same roof, so that officials can go backwards and forwards for consultation and carry out the work successfully, as they are carrying it out at the present time. Any change in this would, in my opinion, be a retrograde step and would do damage which it would take many years of subsequent effort to overcome.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>If I might interrupt the Minister, I think a great many people believe that, from the point of view of running forestry as a commercial business, it should be run by the same type of organisation as other businesses on a nationwide scale are run.  I do not want to hold up the Minister, but, at the same time, I do not want him to feel that those who advocated a board are necessarily in favour of the board taking over land in the way he described.</P>

      <P>I can easily see that, in 20 years' time, the inflow of mature timber and thinnings might necessitate a complete change of outlook.  If I live that long and if I have a tongue to wag, I will possibly want to have forestry passed over to a board run on commercial lines, provided they have not the sweeping powers it is proposed to give them now.</P>

      <P>No board could do better in present circumstances than the Forestry Division has done.  I doubt if they would have done as well as our present Forestry Division has done, and that is saying a great deal. That is the view I have come to, having studied the matter very deeply.  In time to come, a commercial undertaking may be feasible and it may even be desirable to set up a commercial undertaking.  But by that time we will have gone well over half-way, perhaps three-quarters of the way, to the 1,200,000 acres we all hope to see planted.  That is the goal of every person who has afforestation at heart. When we reach that, the time will be <Col N="1320" /> ripe to halt and examine the position to see exactly where we are going.</P>
      <P>Deputy Coogan was particularly anxious about planting in the West and in Connemara.  In that regard let me say that Deputy Bartley left me completely puzzled.  I do not know exactly what he wants.  He spoke of planting in cut-away bogs as if that was something the Forestry Division had never done before.  They have planted a huge acreage of cut-away bogs and are doing so very successfully. At the same time Deputy Bartley mentioned that the Land Commission should not be allowing the tenants to cut bogs down to the bare rocks&mdash;I think that was the expression he used.  That is quite true, but in most of the areas where this is being done there is only about one sod of turf over the rock and in order to procure fuel the tenants have no other way out. I think Deputy Bartley will agree that the average holdings in Connemara would not stand up to getting supplies of fuel for the house outside the holding.</P>
      <P>Many Deputies spoke on the question of planting in the West generally. This Bill is largely for the West. While I hope it will apply to offers in other counties of the Twenty-Six, I think it will apply particularly to the West for this reason, that most of the commonages and a greater part of the mountains of our country are along the west coast, that is, from Donegal down to West Cork.  It is true&mdash;I think it was Deputy Derrig raised the point&mdash; that there are commonages in Wicklow. There are commonages there and in fact there is a peculiar type of commonage problem in Wicklow, but I think I am not over-optimistic when I say this Bill will help us also to get over the difficulty of that situation in County Wicklow.</P>
      <P>Let me explain to Deputies that there are two types of commonage. One is the type where the tenants own the fee simple, where they own the commonage themselves and where it is registered as part of their holding; the other type is where, say, the Land Commission or the successor of the former landlord owns the commonage and has allowed grazing rights on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1321" /> Section 4 deals with the people who have a commonage right and own the fee simple and another section deals with the people who do not own the fee simple but have grazing rights over the land. When we came to examine the matter, we found these were very thorny problems from the legal point of view and that was the principal reason why we needed the Bill.</P>
    <P>I would like to state clearly that I had hoped this Bill would have been green-printed and circulated before the Dáil rose for the summer recess and although all concerned with it&mdash;the Chief State Solicitor's office, the Attorney-General's office, the officials in the Department of Lands&mdash;were working very hard on it, it was extremely difficult to achieve all we have achieved in this Bill without violating the constitutional rights of the owners of land.</P>
    <P>Deputy Derrig, I think, asked me to state what acreage approximately would come under this Bill.  I cannot. Deputy O'Donovan, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Government, tried to give an estimate of it; he did not attempt to give more than a round figure.  I cannot either.  All I can say is that for many years past there has been a huge number of commonages offered to the Forestry Division that have fallen through simply because of the objections, and never, as some Deputies seemed to think, because of price.  There is a large number of commonages and I should not be surprised if the extra land that will come in as a result of this Bill would amount to 10,000 acres a year.  I would be disappointed if it does not exceed 5,000 acres and that will be a very welcome addition to the inflow at the present time.</P>
    <P>In speaking last week I told the House that our ultimate aim cannot be limited even to a planting rate of 25,000 acres a year if we can succeed, as I personally believe we will, in finding even more extensive acreages capable of making a contribution towards the country's good by their afforestation.  If further earnest of the present Government's determination to push ahead rapidly with forestry were needed, it is to be found in the annual <Col N="1322" /> Votes for Forestry presented to this House.  In the three years in which the present Government was in office before, the Vote for Forestry rose from £357,430 to £1,127,200.  On coming back into office, I was happy to come to this House this year and seek an increase in this year's Vote to £1,560,300 compared with £1,272,850 last year.</P>
    <P>These are some points about which Deputies will be glad to hear, at least those who seem to think we are not going fast enough.  With the exception of a few Deputies, I want to compliment Deputies who spoke on their sane approach to the whole question&mdash; realising that we had not the prairies of the United States or Canada or the vast plains of the Transvaal to play with.  This is only a small country; we are only getting on our feet.  Let me repeat that the Forestry Division has done an outstanding job of work, I would say, the biggest and best in the country.</P>
    <P>On the question of safeguarding constitutional property rights, Deputy Derrig seems to think we were seeking in this Bill to safeguard particularly the rights of people with defective title.  I think the Deputy must have misread a part of the explanatory memorandum which we circulated with the Bill.  The reference there was to the problems presented by defective title as distinct from those presented by commonage rights and interests. The real point is that where we deal with a person whose title is defective, we must, in conformity with the Constitution, safeguard the rights of any other person with a true title.</P>
    <P>His misunderstanding is one that could easily arise but it is better to have it cleared up.  The real point is that we are trying to safeguard not only the person who appears to be the owner but also we must effectively safeguard every other person who may be a claimant under this Bill.  When the Committee Stage comes up, I will be expecting Deputies to have perused the Bill as carefully as they can, particularly rural Deputies who have a knowledge of the complexity of the situation and who can give me their best assistance.  I will be quite prepared to accept any <Col N="1323" /> amendments if I am satisfied that they are going to make the Bill better.</P>
    <P>Deputy Derrig mentioned also the desirability of using forestry to absorb seasonal unemployment from Bord na Móna and elsewhere.  It is only right to tell the House that the work in forestry nowadays is fairly steady and the number of men left off are very few even during what I might describe as the slack months.  As a matter of fact, out of total of 5,000 men the number left off each year is only about 600.  We are in communication with Bord na Móna and with others at the present time to see exactly how best we can take up any slack that might be unavoidable in the course of the employment of their workers.  It is a very good point and if there is anything we can do we will be only too glad to do it.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacBride seemed to be under the impression that I dropped the target of 25,000 acres altogether. If it were any Deputy other than Deputy MacBride, I would not mind, but he could not possibly have made that mistake.  When I challenged him to say where we had dropped it, he was absolutely unable to quote such a statement.  I feel Deputy MacBride is sincere and honest in his views on the whole forestry question but it does not help to read into my speech something that was not there.</P>
    <P>He was also of the opinion that I was at war with Mr. Cameron.  I do not know whether there is any precedent for a Minister making such a statement to the House, but whether it has been done before or not I think I should express to Mr. Cameron on behalf of this House and on behalf of the Government our very sincere gratitude for the work he did for us. He came here and made a survey of the land of this country and gave us a lot of useful information.  We are deeply grateful to him for the advice that he gave and I was more than surprised that Deputy MacBride tried to picture me as finding fault with or, at least, picking out errors in Mr. Cameron's report.  It certainly was not my intention to do that because, having gone around a good deal with <Col N="1324" /> Mr. Cameron when he was here, I formed a high opinion of him and can say that he was genuinely anxious to give the best advice he possibly could.</P>
    <P>I pointed out in my opening speech that I had moved away from Mr. Cameron on two particular points.  One was on population trends.  The other was the question of the timber yield of our land.  I was challenged that it has taken us three or four years to find the mistakes or errors in Mr. Cameron's report. The truth of the matter is that, on the question of population trends, Mr. Cameron estimated an increase of 50 per cent. in the population.  In 1954, three years after, the Commission on Emigration furnished its report.  If I read the summary on population trends to the House, it will show that we have much more up-to-date information now than was available to Mr. Cameron.  It was on that ground that I pointed out to the House in my opening speech why I disagree with Mr. Cameron's report in that respect.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 469 of the Report of the Commission on Emigration says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The projections expose the unreality of such estimates and indicate the degree of optimism involved even in an expectation of a population of 3,500,000 to 4,000,000 in 30 to 40 years. Even this would represent an increase of about one-fourth on our present population size and would constitute a spectacular demographic achievement out of keeping with the whole trend of our population size for more than 100 years, though it should be borne in mind that this trend in itself has been different from that of European countries in general.  Such a population increase would be possible only on the basis of a degree of resolution, never yet exhibited, to develop the economy fully, and a ready acceptance of the sacrifices and hard work which this would involve.  It must also be realised that in the absence of such resolution and its implied sacrifices the alternative may well be a worsening of existing fertility and emigration trends, a lowering of density and a population of little more than 2,500,000.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1325" /> That in itself makes gloomy enough reading and is a pill I find it hard to swallow.  They tell us that in 30 to 40 years time they do not expect any increase in our population.  I hope they are wrong when they point out that it may actually drop by 500,000&mdash;a thing I find it hard to visualise.</P>
    <P>I pointed out that Mr. Cameron had not information like that and lacked information on the question of Irish timber yields.  That information has since come to hand.  It has now put Mr. Cameron's report, in these two regards at least, completely out of date.  I gave that information to the House in my opening speech and that was taken by Deputy MacBride as an indication that I wanted to run away from the original planting programme.</P>
    <P>The extract from the Report of the Commission on Emigration that I have read is an estimate of what the commission think may happen in regard to population inside the next 50 years. That is not, surely, a forestry matter and I think Mr. Cameron would be the first to agree with me when I take a lead in that matter from the Commission on Emigration which examined the matter in a careful and expert way.</P>
    <P>The second point related to the average annual yield which we may expect to derive from Irish forests. Mr. Cameron spent a fortnight in this country in July-August of 1950.  Of that fortnight approximately eight to nine days were devoted to a tour of the country during which he saw something of our existing forests but saw rather more of potential forest areas not yet acquired.  He had no opportunity of estimating the yield from Irish forests. He could not have attempted to estimate that yield on the basis of such a short tour of inspection and he did not attempt to do so.  Mr. Cameron based his reckoning on this question of yield on data produced by the Forestry Division's own technical staff, that is, our own technical advisers in this country.  Available data which are set out in the appendix to his report did not relate properly to the average species actually being planted in this country or the qualities of timber which might be expected under Irish <Col N="1326" /> conditions in these various species. That is made perfectly clear in the published report.  Mr. Cameron found himself in a difficulty in using such figures and he said so.</P>
    <P>When I rose to speak in this House last week I had the benefit of an up-to-date estimate, not produced by a pseudo-forestry expert Minister for Lands or any other body of that nature but by the expert technical staff of the Forestry Division.  That estimate is based on the amount of land we are planting in this country, the species which can be grown on that land, and the qualities of timber that may be expected.  It is based, too, upon yield-data which became available only in 1954, and that is why it is only now, and not three or four years ago, that we have been able to take this matter further.  Deputies should not make the mistake of thinking that the Department is beset by red tape in these matters.  That is not true.</P>
    <P>Mr. Cameron's unhappiness about using such yield figures as we then had sprang partly from doubt as to the desirability of expecting a high proportion of quality II plantations.  Our technical experts' revised figures assume nothing higher than quality III except in relation to contorta pine which will give a higher yield on poor land than any other species.  Mr. Cameron was also in a difficulty in relation to contorta pine, with which he would be less familiar than our own foresters.  The yield figures used by our experts for this species are quite conservative and there is no reason to doubt them.  Indeed, I have here a report from the Director for Wales of the British Forestry Commission which shows that in Wales, as here, far better results have been obtained from contorta pine than Mr. Cameron expected and better even than from sitka spruce.</P>
    <P>The figure of 84 cu. ft. which I have used is in fact far lower than is being obtained already in many of our plantations.  Even in the appendix to Mr. Cameron's report, Deputies will find actual specimen figures in regard to Irish yields which are twice the average I have used in estimation. The specimen figures were based on <Col N="1327" /> plantations of only about 25 years of age which will show in higher yields as they approach maturity.</P>
    <P>To put the matter simply, Mr. Cameron worked on the basis that our present population, at the present rate of consumption, needed a timber supply from home sources of about 37,500 standards of commercial timber a year to leave the country independent of imports.  This supply would, according to the up-to-date data of the experts whom we must accept, call for an annual planting of only about 3,000 acres.  To allow for a per head consumption increased four-fold for the present population, we would need an annual output of 150,000 standards or an annual planting of 12,000 acres.  If we were to allow for consumption per head at four times the present rate and for an increase also of 50 per cent. in the population, Mr. Cameron reckoned the annual need at 200,000 standards or an annual planting of 18,000 acres.</P>
    <P>Let me repeat some of the details that caused confusion on this particular matter.  We have data now about the yield of cubic feet of timber per statute acre which were not available then.  Mr. Cameron, on the basis of such figures as we then had, came to the conclusion that 69 cubic feet per statute acre was what could be expected from Irish forests.  But his conclusions were not accepted by the then Director of Forestry who, for example, gave a yield from sitka spruce in Glenmalure forest at 169 cubic feet per statute acre.  Japanese larch in the same forest would yield 125 cubic feet per statute acre according to the same report.  Douglas fir he estimated would yield 113 cubic feet per statute acre and cupressus macro-carpa would yield 112 cubic feet per statute acre.</P>
    <P>As I have said, Mr. Cameron gave us a figure of 69 cubic feet per statute acre.  Our experts now have given me different figures.  These figures have come from actual felling and production and prove that our Irish forests will yield, at the very best, 84 cubic feet per statute acre when mature.  It was on that figure that I based my <Col N="1328" /> opening speech and it was apparently on that point that Deputy MacBride took me to task.  I have to look at three sides of the question-one the figure of 69 cubic feet given by Mr. Cameron; another, the 125 cubic feet given by a former Director of Forestry and the present information of 84 cubic feet per statute acre which the expects tell me they are getting from our forests of mature timber to-day.  Which is right? I am taking our own experts because I have every confidence that they are all proficient officials who are painstaking and accurate and when they arrive at this figure of 84 feet per statute acre.  I am quite satisfied with it.</P>
    <P>On the separate issue of consumption rate, Mr. Cameron worked from the fact that our consumption of timber per year is 12½ standards per 1,000 of the population.  He suggested that our consumption in 50 years' time would amount to four times that amount&mdash;50 standards per 1,000 of the population.  If we accept that suggestion, which would need an annual-planting of 12,000 acres to meet home needs, this year we are planting 15,000 acres, which, over and above our own requirements, will leave 3,000 acres of mature timber for export and that is what some Deputies are decrying; that is what is causing them to say we are not making sufficient progress.</P>
    <P>I want the House and the country to know that this year the planting of 15,000 acres will mean that even if we are using four times as much timber in 50 years as now, we will have a surplus of 3,000 acres of 40,000 standards of timber to export per year.  While that is a bright picture, one of which the Government and the country should be proud, I am not content with it.  I am not satisfied with planting sufficient timber this year to meet our needs and to provide a surplus of 3,000 acres in a few years' time.  If I were, there would be no need for this Bill.  I want to say clearly and emphatically that the 25,000 acres which have been set up by some Deputies as a limit which should not be surpassed does not satisfy me at all.</P>
    <P>I want to say that I, for one, will <Col N="1329" /> not be stampeded into accepting that limit.  I am quite prepared to go ahead with the greatest speed but also with the requisite amount of caution.  We are only a small country in which the inflow of land is not by any means what I would like it to be.  We must solicit from each farmer the particular piece of land we want for afforestation.  Some Deputies have already hoisted their colours on the question of the compulsory acquisition of land for afforestation.  To them I say that there will be no compulsory acquisition for afforestation.</P>
    <P>It is quite sufficient to have compulsion as far as the Land Commission are concerned for the relief of congestion and compulsion for other minor purposes.  Deputies who would like to see themselves playing with the very lives and livelihoods of thousands of our people, thousands of the very poorest of our people, will have to be disappointed unless they set up a different type of State from what we have.</P>
    <P>There were so many points raised in this debate that I must confess that it would be almost impossible to remember all of them.  Deputy Lindsay was worried about the question of title &mdash;what happens when a person who is six years in possession sells to the Department of Lands for afforestation and then the old owner comes back.  First, I do not know of any case where the real owner has left property completely untended for six years.  Apart from that, there is ample provision in the Principal Act to notify each single interested party in this matter and it is our desire that every interested party should be notified. We will do our best in this regard.  Interested parties will get every chance of voicing their grievances if they have any.  I thought Deputy Lindsay had discovered a flaw but when I looked into the matter I discovered such was not the case.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brennan of Wicklow raised a question concerning a parcel of arable land which might be acquired in a big holding when it is being taken over by the Forestry Division.  He suggested that the arable land should be given to a smallholder.  I have no <Col N="1330" /> objection to the Forestry Division doing a deal in a particular area where they buy a holding portion of which is arable and where it might not be advisable to plant it.  I have no objection to the Forestry Division giving a local farmer the arable part in exchange for a useless or non-arable portion of his farm together, possibly, with a cash adjustment either way.  I am quite prepared to help out in cases which the Deputy or other Deputies might bring to my notice.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barry mentioned local organisations such as Muintir na Tíre and the Young Farmers' Clubs.  I assure Deputy Barry and other Deputies who mentioned the same subject that we will welcome any help that comes from them on the one hand and on the other hand that we will give them any possible assistance they may need because every acre of private forest is as useful an asset as an acre of State forest.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moran got into a white heat about this Bill and jumped from one foot to the other.  When on one foot, it was a useless Bill, a stunt Bill; when on the other, it was dripping with compulsion.  I think that the mistake the Deputy made was, first, he did not read the Bill and secondly, if he took a little bit of care or took some interest in afforestation he would have seen that the Bill is not a stunt Bill on the one hand or dripping with compulsion on the other.  He seemed to have a grievance about the forests being started in County Mayo.  I have not the full figures on hand but in the new forests started in County Mayo since 1948 over £72,000 in wages and cartage have been paid to the people in those districts.  In the one particular forest that he seemed to have all his grudge against there has been £14,000 paid out in wages and an excellent forest of something like 1,300 acres has been established, every tree in which is doing well.  Deputy Moran should not have taken that attitude towards forests in Mayo.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connor of North Kerry made a complaint about a forestry official, who, apparently, was discourteous when he called to his house. I deplore an incident of that kind very <Col N="1331" /> much and I want to assure the Deputy that I will not stand over any such discourtesy if it take place and I would be slow to question the Deputy's word about it.  Forestry officials, as a rule, are most courteous but it is quite possible that one particular official may have outstepped the limits to which he should have gone.  I am having the matter investigated, and if he did so, I can assure the Deputy that he will receive a very severe reprimand.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connor referred to areas in North Kerry which he thought should have been taken over for forestry purposes.  I want to point out to him and other Deputies that there may be discontent because a particular area which they thought should have been taken over has not been taken over.  I have since investigated the area he mentioned and I have found that the Forestry Division has come up against difficulties which are not easily surmounted.  That mountain is owned by 35 different tenants in common.  When the Bill is passed I will have another investigation of that area and I hope it will come within the scope of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies seem to think that when they bring to the notice of the Department a particular piece of land it should be planted.  The fact is, however, that when the inspectors survey that land they may find it unplantable. The same thing has happened to myself.  On several occasions both as a Deputy and a Minister I have brought areas of land to the notice of the officials and they have turned them down.  Sometimes I have felt very furious with them but on reflection I have decided that if we have experts we must be guided by them.  They do not turn these areas down for political reasons but because they do not think that trees will grow on the particular site.  If our experts turn down these offers let us pose this question to ourselves: &ldquo;What business have we with experts if we do not take their advice?&rdquo;  We have frequently questions about the Land Commission and every other Department and we undoubtedly have the tendency to set ourselves up as experts and to think that a thing <Col N="1332" /> should be done according to our own particular view.</P>
    <P>There is nothing we can do if the experts decide that the job cannot be done, but there are some areas which many years ago were found not to be plantable which can now be planted under the new technique introduced in 1951.  I want to say that, as this is not the last Forestry Bill, so the new technique of 1951 will not be the last technique to be introduced, and perhaps in time to come new methods will enable certain areas, now deemed to be unplantable, to be planted.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I want to thank the Deputies of the House for the way in which they have met the Bill, and I want to say that I am intensely gratified to find the interest which a Forestry Bill has aroused in this House and through the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>That point has escaped me at the moment.  Deputy Moran seemed to be under the impression that all we had to do to get over the question of a defective title was to appoint a limited administrator.  We would not get many voluntary offers in the case of a limited administration because it would involve tying up the purchase money with a trustee and a person would find himself out of both his land and his money.  If a limited <Col N="1333" /> administrator were appointed, the whole purpose of the Bill would fail.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government have decided that I should, on their behalf, make in this House to-day a further statement on the subject of <Col N="1337" /> Partition and the unlawful use of force.  This is a statement which, in its main substance, I have had in contemplation for some time.  There now exists a situation of such grave potentialities that a further clear and explicit pronouncement on behalf of the Government is, in our opinion, vitally necessary in the interest of the nation as a whole.</P>
      <P>The fundamental character of that situation and the history of the events that have led up to it are well known. This ancient nation, whose geographical extent is defined by nature as clearly and as unquestionably as that of any nation in the world, has for many years been divided in two by the act of a more powerful State, against the will, repeatedly expressed, of the overwhelming majority of the Irish people.  That division was effected shortly after the conclusion of a world war, in which the victors had proclaimed it their great object to establish freedom and self-determination for the smaller nations of the world.  It was enforced on this nation when it was struggling to assert its right to self determination against the ruthless opposition of one of the victors in that war&mdash;a country that held itself out as the champion of freedom.  It has ever since been sustained by the military and financial power of that country, whose present rulers find it possible to condemn the evils of territorial partition in other lands, while, in cynical disregard of principle and consistency, they continue to enforce it here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That the Partition of Ireland is a grievous wrong is a proposition which I do not need to put forward for the assent of any member of this House. Its injustice is recognised outside Ireland, among fairminded people in many countries of the world, including Britain itself, the perpetrator of the wrong.  Like all acts of injustice, it is the source of many evils, for which there is no true remedy except the removal of the parent cause.  Within the separted part of Ireland, under a Government and Parliament subordinate to those of Britain, there is no true peace.  Those who desire national reunion are subjected to <Col N="1338" /> various forms of discrimination, aimed at minimising the influence on public affairs to which, by their numbers, they are fairly entitled.  Almost daily we read of petty acts of intolerance that outrage every principle of justice and good government.  Feelings of resentment and frustration among the Nationalists of the Six Counties are kept alive not only by such acts but by the public statements of men in places, of power, statements that seem to deny all hope of peaceful redress.</P>
    <P>It is not surprising, in such circumstances, that some of our people should despair of securing a rational settlement by non-violent means.  One of the evils that have their roots in Partition is that some men's thoughts have turned to force as offering a possible means of bringing Partition to an end. The responsibility for this particular evil rests on the British Government and Parliament, which originally devised the expedient of Partition, and on their successors who have persistently supported and enforced the division of Ireland's national territory. The responsibility is shared by the subordinate rulers of the Six Counties, who have implacably opposed the setting right of this great wrong and have made it all the more bitter by their intolerant treatment of the large Nationalist minority within the area of the Six Counties.  If the Six-County rulers would adopt a reasonable approach and join us in working out a constitutional solution of Partition, acceptable to the majority and containing proper safeguards for the rights of those who are at present opposing reunion, those rights would receive the fullest protection of all the constitutional forces in every part of Ireland. Political offenders infringing those rights in any way would then receive, with universal assent, the treatment deserved by people who had manifestly dishonoured the nation and its Consitution. In the absence of such a reasonable approach, a heavy weight of moral responsibility rests on the Six-County rulers, who have incessantly maintained a tradition of ruthless, undemocratic and even illegal employment of force to secure their own objectives, without regard to the damage they have been doing to the <Col N="1339" /> paramount interest of the people of these islands, which is peace.</P>
    <P>In stating where the responsibility for the evil lies, I do not condone the evil itself.  The Government's position on the question of the use of force for the ending of Partition has been made clear in a number of previous statements. I dealt with this matter myself in a speech in this House on the 28th October, 1954, shortly after the present Government took office.  On that occasion, I stated our conviction that no real solution of the Partition problem could be found by force.  I pointed out, moreover, that, even if the contrary view prevailed, force could not legitimately be employed unless it were directed by the Government, acting, with the asset of Dáil Éireann, by means of the armed forces maintained by the Oireachtas.  I said, in effect, that force, by whomsoever employed, would involve us in civil war with those of our countrymen who are opposed to reunion and that, if their physical resistance were overcome, Partition would still remain in the form of a deep division of feeling, a bitterness and resentment that would poison our national life for generations to come.</P>
    <P>Other members of the Government have spoken more recently on similar lines.  The matter is one, however, on which our attitude requires to be stated repeatedly and with emphasis. It is a primary duty of those who are entrusted with the functions of Government, and of all others who occupy positions of responsibility and leadership, to guide public opinion according to the best resources of their wisdom and to state clearly, from time to time, the principles, as they see them, by which public policy in matters of such grave importance should be informed and directed.  It is with a full sense of this duty that I have decided to make a further statement on the attitude of my colleagues in the Government and myself towards this matter of the use of force.</P>
    <P>The raids on British military posts in the Six Counties and Britain which have occurred during the past year, or so, are attributed to an organisation <Col N="1340" /> describing itself as &ldquo;the Irish Republican Army&rdquo; or &ldquo;the I.R.A.&rdquo;  Let me say, first, that no organisation exists that has any rightful claim to describe itself by that name.  The Irish Republican Army was the military arm of that great national movement which, after the resurgence that followed the Rising of 1916, represented the struggle of the Irish people for political independence in the years 1919 to 1921.  The successors of that Army, and the true heirs of its spirit and tradition, are to be found to-day in the Defence Forces of Ireland, the armed forces maintained by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>To the great national movement to which I have referred, and to the labours and sacrifices of those who took part in it and of the whole people, we owe the existence to-day of a sovereign, independent, democratic Irish State.  It is true that we have not yet achieved the full realisation of our rightful national aspirations.</P>
    <P>A large part of the historic territory of Ireland is separated from the whole and remains effectively under British control, while having a regional Government of its own with subordinate powers.  It is true that, within that separated part of Ireland, those who desire national reunion are subjected to intolerance and unjust discrimination. These are grievous wrongs, and every member of the Government is at least as keenly sensible of them as the most ardent of those who would use force to redress them.  But what, in this part of my statement, I wish to emphasise is not the extent to which we are still deprived of our national rights but the magnitude of what has been gained through the efforts and struggles of the past.</P>
    <P>The older men and women amongst us remember well a time when no Irish State existed, when the whole of Ireland was governed as a British province, when alien influences sought to dominate every aspect of the community's life, when, for legislative reforms&mdash;however urgently needed&mdash;we depended on the grace of the British Parliament, when civil administration and the administration of justice were controlled from outside, when the British army occupied the whole of <Col N="1341" /> Ireland and the very police force was used as an auxiliary body of that army, when our national language and traditional culture were all but outlawed throughout the whole of our country, when, in time of need, we had no Parliament or Government of our own entitled to be heard amongst the nations of the world.  There are younger men and women who do not remember those conditions.  There are many who were not born until, in the greater part of our country, those conditions had already become a memory. I ask these younger people to try to realise the immensity of the change that has occurred.  We have now an Irish State, with effective jurisdiction over 26 of the 32 counties of Ireland. We have our own institutions of Government.  The full sovereignty of this State is unquestioned throughout the world.  We, in the Twenty-Six Counties, are free to make the most of our resources, spiritual and material, and to shape our life in harmony with the traditions of our own people.  We determine for ourselves who are to be the rulers who shall speak and act for us.  We have, I repeat, a sovereign, independent, democratic Irish State.</P>
    <P>Let me emphasise the word &ldquo;democratic&rdquo;. The entire system of government in this State is based on ultimate control by the people, &ldquo;whose right&rdquo;, in the words of the Constitution, &ldquo;it is to designate the rulers of the State and, in final appeal, to decide all questions of national policy, according to the requirements of the common good&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is the people, by the votes of all adult citizens, who elect the President and the members of Dáil Éireann.  The sole and exclusive power of making laws is vested in the Oireachtas, consisting of the President, Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann.  It is Dáil Éireann that decides who the members of the Government are to be.</P>
    <P>The Government are responsible to the Dáil for the exercise of their functions.  It is laid down in the Constitution that &ldquo;War shall not be declared and the State shall not participate in any war save with the assent of Dáil Éireann.&rdquo;  The right to raise and maintain military or armed forces is vested exclusively in the <Col N="1342" /> Oireachtas, and the Constitution expressly forbids the raising or maintaining, for any purpose whatsoever, of any armed force other than the forces raised and maintained by the Oireachtas.  The executive authority, including the control of the armed forces, is exercised by the Government, which, as I have said, is responsible to Dáil Éireann.  At every point, the people's right to exercise the ultimate control is safeguarded and preserved.</P>
    <P>What, then, is to be said of any group that arrogates to itself the right to decide, regardless of the Oireachtas, the Government or the people, the means by which the restoration of territorial unity should be sought?  What is to be said of any group that assumes itself to possess some higher wisdom, some more exalted authority, some purer patriotism, that entitles it to wage war in the name of Ireland?  Some of them may say that they are not fighting the Irish Government or the forces which it controls, that their efforts are directed against Britain&mdash; the power that is responsible for the Partition of Ireland&mdash;and that they are aimed at ending British control of the Six Counties.  But the matter must be looked at in another light.  One such group, through its spokesmen, expressly denies the legitimacy and authority of the Oireachtas and the Government.  All of these people, by their actions, defy that authority and challenge the basic principles on which our democratic institutions of government are organised.  Lacking, as they do, any authority or representative status, they are, nevertheless, pursuing a course that might involve the entire country&mdash;and, particularly, the Nationalists of the Six Counties&mdash;in turmoil and suffering.</P>
    <P>These men have no shadow of right to take decisions involving the peace of Ireland, in disregard of the great body of public opinion and of the judgment of the people's elected representatives. Their unpatriotic conduct dishonours the national institutions established with so much difficulty over so many years and challenges the <Col N="1343" /> Constitution freely enacted by the people.  The very mark of a civilised State is that the guns are all under lock and key and that the control of life and death is governed by judicial process, in exercise of power derived, under God, from the people.  The alternative is anarchy, and those who would suffer most are the weak, the poor and the defenceless.</P>
    <P>Now, it seems that we have not merely one group but two rival groups contending for the privilege of being the authors of civil war.  We have a spokesman for one of these groups purporting to warn young men &ldquo;not to join sentimental or microscopic organisations such as those who attacked the R.U.C. Barracks at Roslea&rdquo;, while a body which &ldquo;neither admits nor denies responsibility for the raid&rdquo; appears, by implication, to have accused one of the two private &ldquo;armies&rdquo; of felon-setting.  The existence of one body organised for unlawful action by force of arms has been a sufficient threat to peace and to the achievement of our national aims.  The emergence of another such body shows in a clear light the necessity for bringing all these unlawful activities to an end.</P>
    <P>The number of those who have engaged themselves in organisations of this kind is small.  Numerically, indeed, they form only a trivial part of the population.  But the harm that can be done by such organisations is great. Young men enticed into their ranks find themselves required to expose their own lives and the lives of others in defiance of the moral law.  Their activities cannot hasten&mdash;but must, rather, postpone&mdash;the achievement of national unity and are already beginning to assume the aspect of a civil war.  We have had the spectacle of Irishmen attacking Irishmen, in disregard of the presence of a woman and her children.  Bloodshed, as we know too well, leads to more bloodshed, and the end could well be a national catastrophe which no Irishman should be capable of contemplating without abhorrence.</P>
    <P>We have heard praise of the men who were engaged in some of the raids <Col N="1344" /> of the past year.  It is suggested that they acted through patriotic motives and displayed intelligence and courage in the planning and carrying out of their operations.  But patriotic sentiment, intelligence and courage must be guided by judgment and respect for authority, if they are to be truly directed towards the advancement of the nation's interests.  We are sometimes reminded that men who, in the past, took it upon themselves to rise against British rule in Ireland are justly held in honour for their deeds. But the people who thus appeal to the past for justification forget that there is a difference&mdash;a vital and essential difference&mdash;between the circumstances of the past and those that obtain to-day. That difference resides in the fact, on which I have already laid so much stress, that now we have an Irish Government and Parliament, free and democratic, to speak and act in the name of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Men who take part in these activities risk their own lives and liberty.  But they are seeking to create a situation in which the life and liberty of the nation itself would be placed in jeopardy.  If excuse is to be found for them in their motives and their youth, what excuse is there for men ripe in years and experience, who may be guiding or encouraging them in their activities?</P>
    <P>It is time for us all to think clearly about this matter.  It is one in which we cannot afford any ambiguity of thought or attitude.  The vast majority of our public representatives and of the people share the conviction of my colleagues and myself that the solution of Partition is not to be found in force.  There are some&mdash;a small minority&mdash;who hold a different view, and for them there is a clear choice to be made, a choice from which, if they are honest men, they cannot escape.  It is the choice between upholding and denying the authority of the people of this State, through their representatives in Dáil Éireann, to determine questions of policy and the choice between upholding and denying the authority of the Government chosen by Dáil Éireann to exercise their functions as the rulers of the State.  They cannot have it both ways. <Col N="1345" /> They cannot profess loyalty to the democratic institutions of the State and, at the same time, applaud minority groups which defy those institutions by word and by deed.</P>
    <P>A grave responsibility rests on us all in this matter.  It rests with special weight on Deputies of all Parties, on Senators, on the members of local authorities, on the various political organisations, including their branches throughout the country, and on all those who are in a position to give leadership and guidance to others.  If people of influence in the life of the community seem uncertain in their attitude, or inclined to look indulgently on illegal activities of a military kind, the men already involved will be encouraged and others will be tempted to join them in their disastrous course.  There is a need for public opinion to be clarified and to make itself felt, if we are not to have further incidents, with the further loss of young lives and irreparable damage to the nation and to the cause of national reunion.</P>
    <P>The problem of the unlawful use of force is one which has been created for us by the actions of the British Government and Parliament and by the unrelenting opposition of the Six-County authorities to any reasonable approach to the ending of Partition.</P>
    <P>There have been complaints by the Six-County authorities that we are not prepared to enter into an extradition agreement, by which we would undertake to hand over, for trial, persons accused of offences in the Six Counties or in Britain who have taken refuge in the territory under our jurisdiction. Before I go any further, it is necessary to clarify the position in this regard.</P>
    <P>It is being suggested that we have displayed neglect of our international obligations in showing no enthusiasm for negotiating an extradition treaty with the British Government.  Let me say, to begin with, that there has never been any serious difficulty about the reciprocal enforcement of warrants in respect of ordinary criminal offences between the British and ourselves and that we are executing the warrants of English and Scottish courts in such cases as freely as they are executing <Col N="1346" /> ours.  I would not go so far as to say that the existing arrangement in this respect is an ideal one and it has, in fact, been the subject of some criticism both in the Dáil and in the British House of Commons.  But it has at least this practical merit, that it works.</P>
    <P>It must be admitted that in our relations with the Six Counties the position is not so satisfactory.  For the first few years after the establishment of the State there was the same reciprocity in the execution of warrants between the Six Counties and Saorstát Éireann, despite the fact that there were doubts as to whether the execution here of warrants emanating from the Six Counties was in accordance with law.  This question was tested in our courts in 1929, and the High Court then decided that there was no authority for the practice of executing Six-County warrants in Saorstát Éireann, and we had no option but to discontinue the practice.  As a result, the authorities in the Six Counties ceased to execute our warrants and have not done so since except in a single instance.  This situation is one that can only be remedied by legislation. We see no objection in principle to such legislation applying to persons accused of offences that have no political complexion, since it benefits no one to permit persons who have committed ordinary crimes in any part of the country to evade arrest by crossing the Border, but we think that in any such arrangement provision should also be made for the reciprocal enforcement of maintenance orders and some other matters of the same kind and that there should be parallel legislation by the British and ourselves. The difficulty up to the present has been that the British Government appears to be unwilling to recognise the necessity for such legislation on their part and to contemplate an arrangement, so far at least as maintenance orders are concerned, which we feel would be inconsistent with the sovereign status of the State, that is to say, an arrangement based on the application of the Maintenance Orders (Facilities for Enforcement) Act, 1920, to this part of Ireland by an Order in Council.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1347" /> The question of extradition stands on a different footing and is governed by the principles and practice of international law, which are well settled and with respect to which I do not doubt that the British Government and ourselves are of the same mind.  International law is not a mutual insurance system for the preservation of established Governments, although it is generally accepted that a State is bound to use due diligence to prevent, within its territory, certain kinds of revolutionary activities directed against another Government.  But this is not to say that international law requires a State to surrender persons who have engaged in revolutionary activities in another State.  On the contrary, it is well settled that every State has the right to grant asylum to political offenders and to decide for itself what is a political offence.  And it is common form for every extradition treaty to include a provision specifically excepting political offences from the category of extraditable offences.  This is, indeed, the basic principle of the model bilateral Convention which has recently been prepared by the legal experts of the Council of Europe and which has been submitted to the several Governments concerned.  This is no novel departure but is one of the few principles of international law that are universally accepted and have never been seriously challenged.</P>
    <P>In this connection, it is worth recalling that when the League of Nations sought, in 1937, to secure agreement for some modification of the generally-accepted principles of international law on this particular subject by adopting a Convention for what it called the Prevention and Repression of Terrorism, its efforts met with no success.  What is significant is not that the Convention was signed by the representatives of 23 of the countries that were members of the League at the time (for this is understandable in the special circumstances that had given rise to it, namely, the assassination of King Alexander of Yugoslavia some years before) but, rather, that the Convention was ratified by none of the countries that were signatories <Col N="1348" /> with but one exception.  And it is not without interest that the British Government refused to sign for reasons which were stated by one of their representatives, Sir John Fischer Williams, a distinguished international lawyer, to be as follows (and I quote):&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Before the United Kingdom could ratify a convention on the lines proposed, it would have to make important changes in its criminal law and such changes would no doubt not be accepted readily by the British people.  The changes in the law would relate especially to the freedom of expression of opinion, which had been dear to the British people for centuries.  The same difficulties would arise as regards the proposals relating to the export of arms and to extradition for political offences.  The United Kingdom Government would, therefore, have to scrutinise the provisions adopted by the Conference carefully when it had ended, in order to consider whether it was possible to become a party to the future Convention.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I must, therefore, emphasise, in order to prevent any future controversy or discussion on this point, that there can be no question of our handing over, either to the British or to the Six-County authorities, persons whom they may accuse of armed political activities in Britain or in the Six Counties.</P>
    <P>Let me repeat, with emphasis, that this evil&mdash;the unlawful use of force&mdash; has its roots in Partition, and the primary responsibility for its existence rests, therefore, on those who have created and who are sustaining Partition. But it is, none the less, an evil&mdash; one which deeply affects Irish national life and which cannot be tolerated by the Government of Ireland.  Since the present Government assumed office 18 months ago, we have based our policy in this matter on a detestation of repressive measures against any section of our people and on the hope that the previous statements by myself and other members of the Government, and, I am glad to say, by the Leader of the Opposition, would have the <Col N="1349" /> effect which we desired.  Our detestation of repressive measures remains, but our hope of influencing the men concerned by reasoned statements has not been fulfilled.</P>
    <P>During my first period of office as the Head of the Government of Ireland, I spoke more than once about &ldquo;taking the gun out of Irish politics&rdquo;.  No object has been more earnestly desired and sought after by me in the course of my political life.  When I was appointed to be the Taoiseach in 1948, I sincerely believed&mdash;I would not otherwise have accepted the office&mdash; that, with the co-operation of my colleagues and as a result of our policies, the gun would, in fact, be taken out of Irish politics.  Before we left office, it seemed that that object had been achieved.  After the formation of the present Government, when the incidents to which I have referred began to occur, my colleagues and I placed our faith in a policy of patience and forbearance.  We trusted that the challenge to our democratic institutions which those incidents implied would not be persisted in&mdash;that, in a short time, the men who were responsible would have it borne in upon them, by their own conscience and by public opinion, that such a challenge could not indefinitely be tolerated.</P>
    <P>Let me emphasise once more that these activities are a challenge of the gravest kind to the democratic rights of the Irish people and to the rightful authority of the Oireachtas and of the Government.  It is in that light that they must be regarded, and it is by reason of that fact that the duty of ending them devolves upon us all.  It is with the deepest earnestness that I appeal to every man and woman, to the leaders of public opinion and, not least, to the members of the organisations concerned to do their part in seeing to it that these activities will end now, forever.</P>
    <P>If my appeal to the members of the organisations concerned meets with no response, then the duty of the Government is clear.  We must assert and vindicate the people's right to determine national policy and the right of the Oireachtas and the Government to maintain and uphold the authority that <Col N="1350" /> reposes in them.  We are bound to ensure that unlawful activities of a military character shall cease, and we are resolved to use, if necessary, all the powers and forces at our disposal to bring such activities effectively to an end.  It is for Dáil Éireann and for the people of Ireland, in the interest of this generation and of the generations to come, to give us full and unwavering support in the performance of that duty.  I am confident that that support will be forthcoming.</P>

      <P>My views and the views of my colleagues on these benches are known.  Our attitude is unambiguous; our views are on record in the proceedings of the House and in the public Press.  I rise now, therefore, merely to express the hope that the appeal of the Taoiseach will be listened to, that his warning will be heeded and that those who can influence public opinion will realise fully the direction in which we have been drifting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>The statesmanlike and constructive statement made by the Taoiseach probably reduces the necessity for saying very much in regard to the present situation.  There are, however, one or two things that I think it is probably necessary to say in order to maintain a perspective in the situation that exists.  The events that have given rise to the statements made on behalf of the Government by the Taoiseach are inseparable from the results of the situation which has been imposed upon the country.  Whenever the infringement of the sovereign national rights of a nation occurs, inevitably the people of the nation whose rights have been infringed, or a section of the people will seek to undo the wrongs inflicted upon their nation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Partition of Ireland, as the Taoiseach has rightly pointed out, is a clear infringement of the sovereign rights of the Irish people.  It is a clear invasion of the democratic rights of the Irish people.  The establishment of the democratic system of Government in the world took a long struggle to achieve but it has certainly now been firmly planted in this part of the <Col N="1351" /> world.  That democratic system of government depends for its existence on the right of the people to determine their own affairs freely without outside interference.</P>
    <P>In the case of Ireland, as in the case of any other country which is partitioned against the will of its people, it is inevitable that there will be an attitude of revolt on the part of the people who are separated from their motherland.  The only real solution, as the Taoiseach has pointed out, in the long run, is to remedy the wrong which has been inflicted upon the nation.  I do not want to say anything here to-night that might be construed as an encouragement to acts of violence.  One of the difficulties of discussing a situation such as the present is that anything one might say is always open to misconception.  The prime responsibility for the situation which exists in the country to-day and, indeed, the situation which has existed in the country for the last 35 years, is Britain's responsibility.</P>
    <P>In so far as the Taoiseach has intimated that this Parliament is sovereign and that it alone has the right to wage war or to maintain an army here, I agree with him.  I do not believe myself that acts of violence, unsupported by the resources of the State, can achieve the goal which, presumably, we all want to achieve.  If I did, I would say so and I would either participate in or lead any movement that was engaged in the pursuit of such a policy.</P>
    <P>I would join with the Taoiseach in urging those who speak on these questions to refrain from making what might be described as inflammatory speeches.  I can quite well understand the attitude of any young Irishman who considers that his attitude should be one of open revolt against the infringement of our sovereignty.  I can understand, and sympathise even, with the attitude of an Irishman in the Six Counties who is prepared to use any means at his disposal to undo that wrong but I have little sympathy with those who would, from a distance, encourage in this situation, young men <Col N="1352" /> actuated by patriotic motives to endanger their lives and their liberty.</P>
    <P>This, however, does not end the matter.  We must throughout be careful not to place ourselves here in the position of acting as the instruments of British policy in Ireland.  For over 20 years successive Governments have, from time to time, been placed in the position of virtually fighting a civil war against a section of our own people in an effort to maintain a limitation of the sovereignty of the Irish people in Ireland.  This has distorted our whole political life and has hindered and practically stultified the progress of this State.  It is a repetition of this tragic history which we must now avoid.  We must avoid placing ourselves in a position where we will be virtually fighting a section of our own people in order to maintain the <i>status quo</i>, in other words, to maintain Partition.</P>
    <P>For these reasons I join with the Taoiseach in appealing to those who, in our midst, are in an attitude of open revolt, to refrain from creating a situation in which they will come into conflict with our own people here. They, like the Government, must realise that such open conflict between any section of our people, particularly between any sections of our people who share the same ideals, can only weaken the national effort and retard ultimately the reunification of the country.  While making that appeal, I must at the same time urge that, in the situation which has been imposed upon us, there is a special responsibility on the Government and on Dáil Éireann to provide an active leadership in the nation's determination to secure reunification. We may differ in this House as to the extent of the steps, or the nature of the steps, which an Irish Government should take.  In my view, an Irish Government is entitled to use every means at its disposal including, if needs be, and in certain circumstances, the use of the armed forces of the State.</P>
    <P>I know that that view may not be shared by the different Parties in the House: I know that there is room for discussion on these views and I am <Col N="1353" /> not asking the present Government, or indeed the Leader of the Opposition, to adopt those views.  I know that they probably would reject those views but I do ask them in other spheres to give a definite lead and provide a leadership which I think is necessary in the situation.  That is why I have been so anxious for a number of years to persuade this House that the first logical step towards the creation of an all-Ireland Parliament is to secure representation of the people of the Six Counties in this House itself.  I do believe unless we provide a leadership ourselves from this House for the people, not only of the Twenty-Six Counties but of the Six Counties as well, we will convey the impression outside that we are ourselves maintaining Partition, in other words, that we are failing in our duty to provide leadership for the nation.</P>
    <P>I would, therefore, like to appeal again to the two main Parties in this House to consider that.  I do not propose to repeat the many arguments in favour of that course to-night.  I know that these arguments have been and are understood both by the Taoiseach and the Leader of the Opposition, but I would appeal to them sincerely in this situation to consider that step again.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter to which I would like to advert just for the sake of clarification.  The Taoiseach in the course of his statement to the House referred to two rival groups in the country who both, apparently, use or are prepared to use physical force.</P>

      <P>The only thing I wish <Col N="1356" /> to say in conclusion is that it is necessary to understand clearly the position and attitudes of the different groups or sections that are involved in the events which have been discussed. There is unfortunately in the country a lack of information generally as to events within the Six Counties themselves. In so far as the Taoiseach's statement may be intended or be understood to refer to Fianna Uladh I would like to place on record the actual constitution and the objects embodied in the constitution of Fianna Uladh, which seem to me to be in accordance with the attitude of this House.  I do so merely to clear up any possible misunderstanding.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The object of Fianna Uladh is to secure the reintegration of Ireland as a complete, free, independent Republic, and its cultural and spiritual rehabilitation.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Fianna Uladh recognises and accepts the Constitution of the Republic of Ireland enacted by the people on the 1st July, 1937, and does not recognise the right of any body or authority, other than the Irish people, to exercise sovereignty in any portion of Ireland.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It then sets out the means:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The organisation of Republicans in occupied Ireland into a disciplined political movement, and the use of every legitimate means to bring about the reunification of the territory of the Republic of Ireland.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I find it necessary to place that on the records of the House for the information of members.</P>

      <P>When the House adjourned on the last occasion I was giving some figures.  I had dealt with the question of cow-plots. I want to assure the movers of the motion that I am all the way with them as regards the provision of cow-plots wherever the Land Commission is in a position to provide them.  The <Col N="1358" /> record in Meath has not been a very happy one, as I told the Deputies on the last occasion Meath County Council offered back all the cow-plots they had to the Land Commission, but subsequently the Land Commission succeeded in getting trustees to manage 15 of the 28 that were handed back.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take the Deputy's word.  I have no information on the subject.  We are quite prepared where reasonable cases are put up and the land is available to provide cow-plots. I have already said that the distance of five miles is too great. While it might appear at first sight to be a benefit, I can assure Deputies it would be of a very temporary nature and would eventually cause more harm than good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Take the mileage out altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well.  With regard to (b) and (c), the suggestion there would be quite impracticable and unworkable.  I have already given one reason.  A second reason is that if we <Col N="1359" /> throw a circle of five miles around every farm to be divided the Land Commission inspector will have to visit every household within that circle. That would mean that the inspector would have to comb approximately 30 square miles.  At the present time the inspector must visit every house within a mile radius.  A five mile circuit would have a diameter of ten miles and the inspector's work would go for nought because there will always be found within one mile enough congestion to use up every bit of land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>But the people are not getting it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The facts show that they are.  It is becoming increasingly difficult for the Land Commission to get holdings for migrants from the West of Ireland.  Sometimes it may appear to Deputies from the eastern counties that we in the western areas are turning envious and greedy eyes on the East.  Such is not the case.  In the West in the congested areas every available farm was taken up and there is therefore more easing of congestion within the congested counties themselves. Only a tiny overflow finds its way to the Midlands, to Louth, Meath, Dublin, Kildare and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>A couple of hundred a year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a couple of hundred a year.  Now (d) asked for the provision of holdings for landless men requiring accommodation plots.  There is no limit there and I think I can meet the Deputies there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps I will not be able to meet them to their complete satisfaction, but I promise to do my best because we have, in fact, given land to landless men.  While it does appear, as a result of replies to Parliamentary Questions and information with which the Minister for Lands has to come to the House, that the landless man is altogether out, such is not the case, because last year we gave plots and small holdings to 28 landless men throughout the Twenty-Six Counties. What Deputies might misunderstand in this regard is the actual selection of the allottee to whom land would be <Col N="1360" /> given.  It does not matter what category he falls into, whether he is a landless man, a displaced employee; an uneconomic holder, or a migrant; the selection of the particular allottee is a judicial matter for the commissioners and one in which neither the Minister nor Deputies have any right to interfere because the law of this House hands that matter over to the commissioners.  It is a judicial function.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Has not a direction been given to the Land Commission by your predecessor on the question of land to landless men?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the Minister's function to give a direction about a particular class provided the class is within the law, but when it comes to the selection of the allottees the Minister has no function and if he were foolish enough to give a direction the commissioners would simply disregard it because this House has told them it is their function to select the particular person to whom land will be given just as it is their function to determine the particular land that is to be taken up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Has not the Minister to direct that a certain class is to be included or excluded and has not your predecessor excluded landless men?  Will the Minister change that? That is what I want to know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to hold up the House but I can assure Deputies that I will give them the fullest assistance within my power in regard to paragraph (a) and (d) of their motion.  I would ask them, however, to withdraw the other two paragraphs now that I have pointed out how impracticable they would be.  There was a time before I came to the Land Commission and had not an opportunity to look at things from the inside when I thought exactly as the Deputies who put down the motion thought.  I do not want to appear to belittle the Deputies or to cast a slur on their intentions when they put it down, because I thought the same as they do now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I had a chance to go back on the records perhaps a motion fairly similar <Col N="1361" /> would be found in my name and in the name of the other Deputies of the Clann na Talmhan Party.  I do not know whether we put a motion down on that subject but I would not be surprised if one were found.  I would like to make it clear that it is not a labour of love on the part of the commissioners or the Minister for Lands to refuse land to a particular man or a particular class of individuals.  We would like if there were sufficient land to give it to everybody. It is much easier to give things away than not to give them.  It is not for the purpose of victimising anybody that land is not given; it is just because there is not enough, because of the commitment of 10,000 uneconomic holdings in all parts of the country. However, I will do the best I possibly can in regard to paragraphs (a) and (d) and ask the Deputies not to press the other parts of the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to hear the Minister on the suggestion I put forward in regard to local uneconomic holders.  I do not agree with the five mile idea at all, but I suggested that all local uneconomic holdings should be dealt with first.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a fair question. The Land Commission has very strict instructions, before they parcel out one perch of a farm to a migrant, to relieve congestion in the immediate locality which is a mile or&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a joke.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Deputy knows of certain people with small-holdings who were left out.  That is where the Minister's function ceases and where it is a matter for the commissioners. Perhaps a particular man, say, Mr. X, has a small holding of land. If the Land Commissioners do not consider him they have some sound reason, because they must go into each case on its merits.  Perhaps the Deputy could quote cases for me where small farmers did not get land in such circumstances.  If he gives me the names I will go into the matter to see if there has been an oversight or if an injustice has been done in any particular case.  Further than that I <Col N="1362" /> think the Deputy would not ask me to go.</P>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Hilliard's point, the Land Commission have very strict instructions to settle all the congestion in the locality first.  But when it comes to the examination of the claims of the individual men, it is a matter for the commissioners and if they decide not to give land to a man, they have very good reasons for it and I can assure Deputies on all sides of the House that there is no question of victimisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>We accept that.  I was making the plea for a greater use of internal transfer to relieve all uneconomic holdings in counties such as Meath, Westmeath and Kildare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to support the part of the motion dealing with the cow parks.  I come from a county where they have made a complete success of the cow parks, at Killucan, Delvin, around where I live in Castlepollard, and in several other places in County Westmeath.  The county council have given the cow parks and the cottiers and smallholders round about have cows on these parks.  They have them during the summer and during the winter.  There are different charges for the summer and the winter.  They run them economically and they show a slight profit in some cases, so much so that we have been able to avail of Government grants for lime and fertilisers; we have got soil tests in all these cow parks and have made a great success of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Ardillon, outside Mullingar, the Land Commission in recent times gave a cow park on one estate there.  There is a great number of cottiers; I cannot be exact but it would be an understatement to say that there are 12 cottiers living in a row and the cow park is not large enough to meet their requirements.  Every man who can get accommodation and who lives in these cottages has a cow and a calf on these cow parks.  It is the only chance for these people to have live stock and to supply their family with milk.  I want <Col N="1363" /> to make the case to the Minister in regard to that area that, if there is another estate being considered for acquisition by the Land Commission they should extend the cow park and given an addition to the Ardillon cow park.  They inflicted one hardship on these unfortunate people.  The officials sited a cottage on that cow park, and to take away even half an acre from a cow park is a grave hardship on these people.  There is a number of estates under consideration at present in County Westmeath.  When these estates have been acquired and divided in the parish of Dysart, the O'Beirne estate will provide the only chance that these people will ever have of getting any accommodation for live stock.  They are out of it as far as a farm is concerned.  Therefore, I want to make a particular plea in the debate on this motion put down by Deputy Tully that on the O'Beirne estate in Dysart a cow park will be provided for the cottiers.</P>
    <P>Whatever may be said by Deputy Tully or the Meath Deputies in answer to the charge that they were a failure in Meath, let them be a failure in Meath; they are a complete success in County Westmeath.  We invite the Minister and Deputies to come down and examine our accounts in County Westmeath.  There they will see how the cow parks work.  There they will see that we are not taking everything out of the land and putting nothing back.  The cow parks are better land now, under our management, than they were when we got them, and the more we have of them around the towns of County Westmeath, the better.  The cow parks, for instance, around Raharney and Delvin are a great credit to the county council.</P>
    <P>This motion deals, in clause (c), with the provision of holdings for landless men who are living within five miles of the land to be divided and who are in a position to work the land.</P>
    <P>I know that if you were to drain the Atlantic Ocean and make land of it there would not be enough farms in it to give all the farmers' sons who look for land in Ireland a farm.  Common sense tells me that.  I do not need a <Col N="1364" /> map or a rule to enable me to come to that conclusion.  The pool of land is small.</P>
    <P>I want to make a particular plea for a kind of landless man that I know in my locality.  I have a particular man in view when I make this statement, a man who lives in my own parish.  He is married; he has a large family, a young family; he is in a cottage; he gets work with a horse and cart on the road and he has built up a stock of seven or eight cattle for which he takes grazing; he has a couple of cows which provide milk for the family and his wife makes butter.  They have built up an economy around the cottage in that way.  Yet, this man is told that he cannot get land because he is only a cottier with half an acre.</P>

      <P>The Land Commission gave the land in these cases and gave <Col N="1365" /> it in good faith.  They had no precedent and they did it as an experiment which has been a failure.  I am making the case for the man in the cottage with a wife and young family, who has proved himself and who, under the particular form of administration we have at present is ruled out.  I want earnestly to plead that he will get a farm.  I know the difficulties in that case, particularly in the north of Westmeath, the poor part of Westmeath, where I live and where the holdings are small and where we acquired estates of 100 acres and estates of that order and, if you were to give economic farms, you would give only two or three whereas you could service many uneconomic holdings with 100 acres.  An exception should be made of the individual whom I have described here.  In his case, I would not mind translating him 25 miles, not to mind five.</P>
      <P>In my contribution to the debate, I do not want to trip up Deputy Tully. I want to be helpful.  One of the causes of the failure of Land Commission division heretofore was in giving the additions too far away from the parent holding.  The persons concerned had to go several miles.  They got tired of it and, when they were advanced in age, they got rid of it.</P>
      <P>Twenty years ago, I pleaded in this House, and I am now more convinced that my plea was right, that there should be no vesting of anybody for 20 years and that at the end of that time they must have proved themselves to be carrying out good husbandry on the land and that they would not have it let on the 11 months' system which, unfortunately is the position in a large area of the Midlands to-day.</P>
      <P>The two points I have made are, one, in connection with cow parks and, secondly, in connection with the particular kind of landless man whom I have described, the married landless man with a young, thriving family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Clause (d) of the motion refers to the provision of holdings for landless men requiring accommodation plots.  It is a very arguable thing.  I am almost conceived that it was right, although many of my Party do not agree, and <Col N="1366" /> Deputy Hilliard referred to it here, to give five acres around his cottage to the cottier.  It works very well in parts of Meath and I would like to see it being done.  The argument that is put up by my colleagues against it is that the cottier then is neither a farmer nor a labourer.  At the same time, there is a good deal to be said for it.  The stage is being reached when, in Ireland, the only man who will have land is the man who will go out and save and thrive and build up a fund and, if he has not the money, his son will have it and eventually become a farmer. When all the land division has been carried out, that is what you will be faced with.  They will have to stop dreaming for a farm and go out and work for it.  Deputy O'Hara knows a man who went to England and saved up hard-earned money and came home and bought land.  I know lads around Delvin who went to Canada and worked inside the Arctic Circle in the last ten years and saved up and bought farms around Delvin.  That is going on the records and I am standing over that statement.  I am digressing and nearly forgetting the argument that I was making.</P>
    <P>I was on the subject of the five-acre plot.  There is this much to be said for it&mdash;the man who keeps a cow or two and a few calves and a few pigs becomes farm conscious and will watch every penny.  To him £1 will consist, not of a note, but of 240 pennies and he will strive with his wife and they will build up and eventually become farmers.  There is that argument in favour of the accommodation plot or the five-acre plot.</P>
    <P>To come to a conclusion I want to make the case that the most needed thing around a town or a village is a cow-park.  A lot has been said in condemnation of the landlord system; very little has ever been said in the landlords' favour except that generally they had cow parks round their estates.  When the estates were divided the cow parks went and the cows went to the long acre.  As far as Meath is concerned I am making a plea to the Minister to get the Land Commission to keep on with the question of providing cow-plots.  The commission will be <Col N="1367" /> doing a good day's work.  I should also like to make another plea in connection with five acre plots for cottiers.</P>

      <P>As land division is a very vexed problem in the eastern counties, it is only right that we should avail of every opportunity to speak on it.  This motion gives us a chance of speaking on the subject again.  I cannot support this motion in its entirety, although there are one or two points with which I agree.  I consider the suggested five mile limit as ridiculous. The division of land in this country is nearing completion; the necessity to divide land will have gone entirely in 50 years' time and the nearer we get to that situation, the tighter the Land Acts are being operated.  If this motion does nothing more than make the Minister realise the importance of the debate it will be doing good but I am satisfied it is not going to do anything like upsetting the Land Acts.</P>
      <P>A Deputy made a speech here the other evening with which I wholeheartedly agree.  It was a speech full of facts and was made by a man who was not afraid of losing votes.  There is no use in my telling the people in Meath that they are all likely now to get land.  That would be only fooling the people because only one in a thousand is likely to get an acre.  We know that the national policy is directed towards the relief of congestion and for making uneconomic holdings economic.  The Minister is inclined to disregard suggestions about the provision of cowplots because they failed in County Meath.  He is wrong in that.  Cowplots failed there because there was a racket in them.  They were not administered by anybody with competent authority; interested in them were a few thugs operating them for their own benefit.  In my opinion the cowplot is the most essential thing in our county and I would ask the Minister to consider very seriously their provision there. We now know that there is very little chance of providing land for landless men; we are aware that for every one landless man who gets a holding, thousands will not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no use in trying to hide that fact.  There are areas where cowplots are absolutely essential and where they will be of great national benefit if they are provided in volume.  I would accordingly ask the Minister to receive a deputation to discuss the subject with him.  A great deal of the land of Meath has been given to migrants from the West. As I have said, there is little or no land for the landless there.  I agree that the commission have worked hard to make uneconomic holdings economic but we find holdings where men were passed over.  I would like to see much more resettlement in these areas.  When a big estate is being divided and when there are in the vicinity many small farmers with uneconomic bits of land, the Land Commission should give these men decent holdings from the estate, take over the bits and pieces in the neighbourhood and rearrange them into decent holdings. Such a procedure would take care of a great deal of resettlement problems in County Meath.</P>
      <P>In making that point, I would not like it to interfere with the provision of accommodation plots.  I think that is a matter which the Minister said he would consider.</P>

      <P>Where there is a good man, who works his bit of land carefully and well, a man who is rearing a good family, that man is deserving of a good deal of consideration. Several of that type are living beside me.  There is also the question of the hard-working men who lived in cottages on acquired demesnes.  Most of these people were never a day idle in their lives and any of them for whom acquisition means disemployment should be given careful consideration. If necessary I will give the names of these people to the Minister. They could be given six or seven acre plots.  I know a group of them in whose neighbourhood there is a fine <Col N="1369" /> field which could be divided among them at very little cost.  Such plots would help them to provide milk and butter for their families.  It would also help out immensely the economy of the country as a whole.</P>
      <P>There is a cow-plot of about 30 acres in my constituency which was taken over by a group of people about 35 years ago.  This group of men paid for the cow-plot and they worked it very well; most of them had two cows on it.  Then land division occurred in the area and 90 per cent. of the people using the cow-plot got new holdings and new homes.  But at the same time they retained their rights on the cow-plot with the result that the poor people in the area who had no land were unable to put their cows into the plot.  I think this is a question into which the Land Commission should inquire.  The people who have got new holdings are much less needy than the others of whom I speak.</P>

      <P>I want the Land Commission to go through all the machinery of compulsory acquisition in the interest of the people in the area who have got no land.  I do not see for the life of me why the Minister will not go straight ahead and acquire this plot.  I do not see why the Minister should be so mean with the people whose interests I am putting before him.  The people who hang on to <Col N="1370" /> the plot were each given £2,000 worth of valuable property and it is absolutely mean of them to deprive their poorer neighbours of the use of this plot.  I have nothing against the people who are now using the cow-plot but I am interested in the people who are more deserving because they are more needy.</P>
      <P>As we know, the people in Meath become very aggravated when they see migrants coming in.  We tell them there is nothing that can be done about it, that it is national policy.</P>

      <P>No matter where they come from there is one thing certain and that is that they take off their coats and go to work.  They are making good and buying new farms.</P>
      <P>I do blame the Land Commission for the policy of 25 and 30 years ago which was nothing more than a national shame.  They gave land to every Tom, Dick and Harry, to men who refused to live in the houses and who set the land and had a good time while it lasted and then sold the land when the price was high enough.  That policy was the cause of all the damage that we have to-day.</P>
      <P>This motion may have done good in causing a debate in this matter and as a result of it we may get the ear of the Minister.  If the Minister gives more favourable consideration to the cow-plots, where they are now a success we will be satisfied.  There is no use in us fighting for landless men.  Out of thousands of landless men one may be lucky.  There is no use in leading people up the garden path and making fools of them.  They know now the position with regard to land distribution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>On that part of the motion dealing with the five miles, I am not satisfied that the one mile is adequate at all.  We have in County Dublin a number of conacre farmers who travel ten and 12 miles on their tractors to try and get land for tillage. When a holding of land is being divided the Land Commission will not regard these men as uneconomic <Col N="1371" /> holders because they are more than one mile from the farm to be divided notwithstanding the fact that they travel up to nine and ten miles to get land.</P>
      <P>The position in County Dublin is that there is not very much land to be divided, but any time that there is land to be divided we are in the awkward position that we have more uneconomic holders than any other county in Ireland for the size of it.  For that reason I do hope that the Minister will make representation to the Land Commission to consider going further than the one mile.  The day of fast travelling and up-to-date machinery is here.  The horse is gone and it is the lorry and the tractor now. I wish to press the Minister to have that matter reconsidered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that the problem is there but nevertheless I am speaking of an area where there are conacre farmers travelling seven, eight, nine and ten miles to get land for tillage.  When you consider men of that type travelling that distance to get land and then when a Land Commission holding is divided in their area they will not be considered because they are more than a mile from the holding it is very bad.  They come along to me and tell me that as their public representative.  I would ask the Minister, in view of the change in times, to consider this point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A lot has been said about the people who got land and did not use it, but in every group there are individuals who will fall by the wayside.  As a matter of fact in Dáil Éireann and outside of it, the human element will have to be taken into account.  There are a number of cottiers in my county who got five-acre plots.  It made them independent and industrious and made their children industrious.  It did not make them completly dependent on a week's wages.  For that reason, although the five-acre plots are small, I am anxious to see them reintroduced. <Col N="1372" /> By it you are making these men more self-confident and more self-reliant.</P>
    <P>The conacre farmers in County Dublin are still being regarded as landless men, although they have been able to get conacre here and there and everywhere and make a living out of it.  I think men of that type are an asset to the nation and that they should be favourably considered when there is land to be divided in the district. That is one of the points on which I have often spoken before and I shall continue to speak on it.  It is a matter which concerns Deputies of County Dublin very seriously.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>Running all through the speeches on this motion, especially from Deputies from Meath, Kildare, Westmeath, Carlow and Dublin, is the cry that the people from the west of the Ireland are rushing up and getting holdings from the Land Commission to the disadvantage of the people from those counties.  Speaking as a Deputy from the West of Ireland, and on behalf of every honest Deputy from the West, including the Minister, I want to tell the Dáil that it is the one thing that we hate&mdash;that our people from the West of Ireland have got to come up here.</P>
      <P>The night before they leave the West of Ireland, from Mayo, Galway and other counties there, is known as the &ldquo;night of the wake&rdquo; because, I regret to say in many cases, many of them do not live very long when they go away from the great hospitality to which they are accustomed in the West of Ireland to meet the cold shoulder which they get from many of the people in the Midlands.  Why do they go?  Because they are selected by officials of the Land Commission as the most suitable people, because first and foremost they are satisfactory in their holdings at home and secondly because even though they have only nine or ten acres of land, that little patch when they leave can be divided up and added to other uneconomic holdings in the neighbourhood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position in the West, or in many parts of it, is that if a man wants to put a ladder up against his house, he <Col N="1373" /> has to ask his neighbour's permission because the foot of it would very often have to rest in his neighbour's garden. It is only by the greatest coaxing by the Land Commission that those people consent to go at all even with the promise of better holdings in the Midlands.  It suits the Land Commission to give them three times the amount of land which they have in the West because the land which they leave can be added on to five or ten uneconomic holdings in the area.  That is why they come up here.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the part of the motion which suggests that land be given five miles away from the congested holdings.  I want to remind Deputies that we had Land Acts in 1923, 1927, 1931, 1936, 1939, 1946, 1950 and 1953.  In mentioning the 1923 Act I would like to pay tribute to the late Mr. Paddy Hogan who was Minister for Lands at that time.  He, in his wisdom, thought it would be good to give land four or five miles away from their holdings to congests but I remember after that, I had to make representations myself to the Land Commission to allow the very people who got that land to sell the extra few acres they got five or six miles away because it was driving them to the poor house.  They had to walk to that extra land every morning and walk home every night with the result that not only was the additional land neglected but the land they had previously was also neglected.  I would say to the Land Commission and to the Minister, it is the task of the Land Commission to bring land together, not separate it. Land separation is no good to anyone and the suggestion of having portions of land five miles apart could cause the greatest harm.</P>
    <P>I am not opposed to giving land to landless men if there is land available but, according to statements we have heard, we have 10,000 uneconomic holders in this country, 10,000 living in slums so far as land is concerned.  I know people living on holdings with valuations of £3 and £10s. and the man in many parts of my area who has a £9 valuation is a big farmer.  I hope Deputy Tully is listening.  Why leave these men on low valuations of £3 or £4 in slavery?  Why put another man <Col N="1374" /> in slavery by giving him an uneconomic holding?  Is it not better to deal with these uneconomic holdings?  I believe they should be the first charge on the Irish Land Commission because they are the slums of the land in this country.  Every one of the Land Acts I mentioned was aimed at improving conditions.  The 1946 Land Act, which Deputy Killilea mentioned, had to be brought in.  I am not going to blame Fianna Fáil for bringing it in any more than I would blame the present Government because certain people got land, as Deputy Killilea pointed out, and had houses built for them probably at a cost of some £2,000 and the 1946 Act had to be passed to get the land back from them.</P>

      <P>The Deputy can speak when I am finished if he likes. If the land in those areas had been given to uneconomic holders at the time, there would probably have been no need to build houses at all for them and they would have worked hard.  I would like to protest very strongly against another development in the West of Ireland&mdash;I do not know whether it happened in Meath or Kildare. I have seen cases where, when land is to be divided certain Deputies come together and say: &ldquo;We will hold a meeting and decide who is going to get it&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>They do.  I know in certain places in the West of Ireland where, when a man has agreed to leave and go to the Midlands and his land is to be divided, Deputies go into that area and called a meeting.  Admittedly, the people are land hungry and when They hear about this they all gather round.  One Deputy says: &ldquo;I will get that piece for you, Tom, and that piece for you, John.&rdquo;  That is all wrong.  It is deception.  The Minister for Lands &mdash;and he is listening to me&mdash;has no authority to give land to anybody and I hope he never will have.  It would be a bad day when any politician could <Col N="1375" /> give land to anybody because we have a certain amount of human nature in everyone of us and naturally we would give it to our own supporters.  The officials of the Land Commission are in a different position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I have watched their efforts for many years.  I am in the heart of a very congested district in North Galway and I know of cases where the Land Commission had to spend over 12 months going round from house to house trying to please everybody when a piece of land of about 50 acres had to be divided into three-acre plots.  I will pay this tribute to the Land Commission officials&mdash;they generally do a good job. Frequently a man comes along and says:&mdash;&ldquo;I did not get land and my valuation is only £6.&rdquo;  He does not deserve any land because he would not keep it in any better condition if he got it.  In order to judge a farmer, one should go in in the month of October, look at his haggard and see the way he looks after his stock, his crop and his implements.  His valuation is of no importance.  There are people who go round trying to convince others that they, and they alone, have the giving of land.  Deputies here have not the giving of land.  The Minister has not the giving of land.</P>
      <P>It is my hope that land will always be given to those who need it most.  I want to make it quite plain to Midland Deputies that, so far as our people in the West are concerned, it is very hard to prevail on them to leave the West. They would rather have the breath of the heather on the mountains in Mayo and Galway.  It is only when the inducement held out to them by the Land Commission is so great that they are prepared to move away from the West.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>The policy of the Land Commission in regard to land division is that congestion in any area should be remedied.  I am afraid that policy cannot be applied 100 per cent. everywhere in the country.  You have in the West of Ireland, especially in <Col N="1376" /> Mayo and Galway, very severe congestion. In other western counties there is less severe congestion.  Then, in Meath and the eastern counties generally, the land is good and the farms are large.  In Donegal, the situation is quite different.  In Donegal we have some congestion in the west of the county.  These congests are not prepared to go to Meath or to other parts of the country.  In East Donegal we have some very good land.  The farms are large and the Land Commission has taken over quite a number of them.  It was the custom of the Land Commission, having acquired farms in East Donegal, to divide them and offer them to congests from the west of the county.  Now the holdings taken over by the Land Commission in East Donegal are lying derelict.  New houses have been built on them.  The congests of West Donegal have inspected the farms and the houses and have refused to take them.  I think we have there a case for giving such holdings to landless men, to the conacre farmers.  We have many such in Donegal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In East Donegal, the area I represent, there are no small farmers.  The majority of the farms are fairly large. The result is that the conacre farmer, and I know many of them, pays up to £25 and £28 per acre.  I know many who paid that for potatoes and wheat. Their conacre bill may amount to anything from £200 to £500.  I know a few whose total expenditure last year was well over £500 for the year.  Now these people cannot afford to buy a farm when it comes on the market.  They never will be able to afford to buy a farm because the price is too high. They cannot possibly pay £5,000, £6,000 or £7,000 for a farm of 100 or 150 acres.  The result is they have to go round the county taking conacre, here, there and everywhere.  They try in that way, and they succeed, in making a fair living for themselves and their families, but the work is very hard.  If smaller farms were available these people would be able to purchase them.  At the moment, they cannot purchase the farms that are offered because they are too big. Despite the fact that No. 1 priority, <Col N="1377" /> so far as the Land Commission is concerned, is the relief of congestion&mdash;and I agree with that priority&mdash;I still maintain that the situation which exists in East Donegal should be remedied and can be remedied by making an exception.</P>
    <P>No matter how hard and fast a rule may be, there are always exceptions. I would urge that we should have exceptions in the case of land.  Indeed, we can make very good cases for exceptions.  After all, it is impossible to draft a regulation and apply it everywhere all over the country and in all cases.  One does not act fairly in trying to do that despite the fact that it may be a good regulation.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, said, in reference to the 1946 Act, that many people who got land had subsequently to be evicted from that land.  But he did not say that it was erstwhile landless men who had to be evicted.  His statement does not prove or disprove anything, unless he goes a step further and says that the 1946 Act, which was passed in order to remedy a certain defect, caused the eviction of men who got land from the Land Commission.  He did not say that these were Mayo men or Galway men.  I can give the Minister the names and addresses of landless men who did get land and who are making very good use of that land.  The Land Commission in these particular cases did not build houses on this land because they had decided to give it to landless men.  But to-day there are good houses built on these farms, better houses than the Land Commission ever built.  I maintain that if land is given to landless men, of the type to which I have referred, they will make a far better use of that land than some of the congests who have had no experience of present-day methods and modern husbandry.  A conacre farmer with a tractor and a plough has experience. If he is given a medium-sized farm, he will be prepared to work that farm as he is at present working land on the 11-months' system.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Donnellan, described the painful picture which presents itself in the West of Ireland when some of these <Col N="1378" /> small farmers leave and head for the holdings in County Meath.  It is a more painful picture to see a person who has, say, for 15 years, been taking conacre, a landless man, at the end of that period, gathering together a tractor, farm implements, a few head of cattle, some sheep, all the paraphernalia that goes with the working of land, putting those articles under the auctioneer's hammer and taking a boat to England or Scotland.</P>

I know places where conacre, landless men, get good livings from the large estates, work them well and worked them well during the emergency and produced their quotas of wheat, oats and potatoes.  I have seen the Land Commission step in and purchase those holdings and those farms.  I have seen the articles I have mentioned come under the auctioneer's hammer and I have seen those scientific farmers leave the country and take employment in the beet fields of England, in the coal mines, building schemes and hydroelectric schemes in Scotland.  I think those two could run side by side, the relief of congestion and the enabling of the conacre farmer to get land that he could call his own, and land which would form the nucleus of a larger holding when his family would grow up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister knows that the situation which I mentioned exists in East Donegal.  He knows that there are large farms there which have been worked for the last 20 years, and well worked, but not by the owners.  We have reached a situation now where the Land Commission is faced with doing one or other of these two things: they must stop taking over large estates, or, if they continue to take over large estates, I would suggest, they must give them to landless farmers.  I do not think they will decide, or can decide, to stop land acquisition.  It would be for the benefit <Col N="1379" /> of this country if many of the large and medium sized farms which are being let year by year were given to this class of farmer who has proven experience. There is a large number to pick and choose from.  The Land Commission can pick the best from a good selection.  From the point of view of the economic interests of the country and from the point of view of agriculture, they would be settling in land men who have a life's experience, or experience at least from their young days, of farming on medium-sized farms.</P>

      <P>That is enough for any man.  While catering for the very necessary job for which the Minister and the Land Commission are responsible, that is, the relief of congestion and the rearrangement of small uneconomic scattered bits of land in the West, they could put side by side with that the building up in this country of a type of farmer who is of value and an asset to the State, the farmer who would be given by the Land Commission 40 or 50 acres of good land, not because he is a person who can give up five or six acres in Mayo, Galway, Kerry or elsewhere, but because over a period of years, although he is a person who has no land, he has contributed to the well-being of this State through the food he has produced on land which did not belong to himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If you settle a fair number of these people in the different counties of Ireland, nobody will blame the Minister or the Land Commission.  We thought one time in our county that such men never could become landowners for the reason that the congests in the west of our county were not anxious to take holdings.  Then luckily the Land Commission gave land to some of these people.  They are examples of what I personally am proud of and of what the Land Commission has every reason to be proud <Col N="1380" /> of.  That does not at all interfere with the general policy.  It is a pity, I know, that the predecessor of the present Minister was 100 per cent. for the relief of congestion.  That was his policy; that is the present Minister's policy and the policy of the Land Commission.</P>

      <P>Before Deputy Kennedy rises, I should like to make a point.  The Land Commission were considering the acquisition of the whole of this estate.  Their decision has been to differ action in the case of the whole of the estate for a year.  I would submit that, in that case&mdash;completely at your discretion, Sir&mdash;you might take into consideration whether this could be considered as <i>sub judice</i>, because a definite decision to withdraw from the proceedings has not been taken&mdash;only a decision to defer. I think it may be worthy of consideration that the case is <i>sub judice,</i> in view of the fact that no final decision has been reached.</P>

      <P>Yes.  Perhaps I am not making myself clear.  The whole of this farm is still the subject of consideration and is awaiting decision by the commissioners.

      <P>On a point of order, I do not want to interrupt Deputy Kennedy, but it would be important in a matter of this kind that you should rule on the question of whether this matter is <i>sub judice</i> or not.  While I do not want to deprive Deputy Kennedy of an opportunity of speaking, it appears to me that there are two interests involved.  On the one hand, there is the Land Commission. My interpretation is that, while they <Col N="1382" /> have not made up their minds, or as a definite decision has not been made, the matter could be regarded as being <i>sub judice.</i></P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I want to make, through you, Sir, to the Minister <Col N="1383" /> and the House is that we are faced with a position of considerable unemployment in the forestry unit at Castlepollard.  For 20 years, that unit has given a fair amount of employment. There is a basic group of 16 men fully employed all the year round and that number is increased in the peak period. That unit has operated on the Gravel estate, where it has planted 600 acres of land, and has taken over part of the Pollard estate and other places in the district.  That unit is faced with unemployment.</P>
      <P>The deferment of a decision in the Coleman estate for a year is too long a postponement.  I advocate that the Minister and the Land Commission should reduce that period and, if necessary, take over the whole of the Coleman estate, so that these 16 breadwinners may continue in employment and the number employed may be increased.</P>
      <P>There is nothing to prevent the acquisition of the entire estate.  It is non-residential.  Nobody has lived on it for years.  It has been an uneconomic proposition for a considerable period and, as far as I know, there will not be much resistance on the part of the owner who is a very big landholder in County Kildare.  The particular part of the Westmeath concerned is in my parish where there are only about six people on five square miles of land.</P>
      <P>The men who work in the forestry unit travel five and six miles to their work.  They are very glad of the employment and very proud to be doing this work.  They take an interest in it. The Minister and the House and the Land Commission should take great pride in this forest and should expand from there.  The forest is in the Inny valley.  The Inny will be drained.  The Coleman estate adjoins the area.</P>
      <P>I want the Minister and the Land Commission to change their minds.  If they do not, the land will slip away from them and the employment given in converting the land to forests will be lost.  That is the point I wished to make and I have made it now to the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>As I told the Deputy in reply to his question to-day, the Land Commission recently negotiated for the purchase of this property but the owner declined to sell it.  The Land Commission have decided to defer further consideration of this matter for about a year.  That involves the whole 193 acres.  I want to assure the Deputy that any time I hear of a piece of land which might possibly become the nucleus of a forestry centre I am only too delighted to get moving, but in this case my hands are tied because the Land Commission, in saying they have deferred action for a year, are intimating that they have not washed their hands of it.  It is not the same as if they had said they would take no further action.  That would mean that they had examined the lands and that they were not interested further in them.  Deferring action for a year means that the commissioners are still interested, that they have not decided either way.</P>

      <P>I will put up as strong a case as I can before the commissioners to have this matter reexamined with a view to an early decision one way or the other.  That is as far as I can go.  I shall bring the Deputy's remarks to their attention and point out also that a Deputy does not go to the extreme of raising a matter on the Adjournment unless it is of fairly grave importance in a particular locality.  The commissioners may stick to their original decision or they may re-examine the position and decide they will take no further action.  If that should occur, I shall try to secure a portion of the lands for the accommodation of the people in whom the Deputy is interested. I shall expect the Deputy's assistance in that if such action becomes necessary.</P>
