    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will make a statement concerning his reasons for making the Wheat Milling (General Quota Variation) Order, 1955, by which the quotas of all licensed mills are increased by 10 per cent. and, particularly, if he will state the anticipated effect of this Order on the future of the smaller mills.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Norton) William Norton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Norton)</NameTxt>
      <P>Home-grown wheat of the 1954 crop had an abnormally high moisture content, estimated at about 13 per cent. as compared with 7 to 10 per cent. in a normal year, and a given quantity of native wheat would after drying produce a correspondingly smaller quantity of flour.  Because of this and of the high proportion of home-grown wheat in the grist which is milled into flour, the quotas appointed in 1953 were insufficient to produce the country's requirements of flour, and had to be increased by 10 per cent.</P>
      <P>As the individual quotas have been increased by a uniform percentage, and as flour requirements do not vary widely from one year to another, I do not anticipate that this Order will have any effect on the future of the smaller mills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it intended that this increase in quotas should operate for this year only?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  It can be reviewed from time to time in the light of both the moisture content and the grist mixture.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that the insurance rate on agricultural tractors, now being renewed, is being increased by 50 per cent. where tractors are used outside the tractor owner's lands in the course of assisting a neighbouring farmer, and if he will give reasons for this increase.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state the amount of premiums collected by foreign insurance companies in the Republic of Ireland for each of the years 1952 to 1954, inclusive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The total amount of premiums collected here in 1952 and 1953 by non-Irish owned insurance companies and by syndicates of Lloyds' Underwriters was £9,130,350 in 1952 and £9,393,875 in 1953.  These <Col N="431" /> figures related only to insurance business particulars of which are required to be furnished under the Insurance Acts of 1909 and 1936 and do not, therefore, include marine, aviation and transit business to which the Acts do not refer and for which returns are not required to be made by the companies. The figure for 1954 is not yet available as the statutory returns for that year are not yet due.</P>
      <P>It should not be assumed that the premium income collected is the amount of the drain on the national economy as the amounts paid by way of claims to policy holders and the expenses of management incurred within the State have to be deducted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that minced steak is being sold by some Dublin butchers at between 3/- and 3/6 per 1b., and if, in view of the fact that these prices are comparable with and in some cases exceed the prices of standard cuts such as leg beef, round and rib steak, he will make an Order which will ensure that the mincing of beef is not done until the purchaser decides which cut is required to be minced, and that the price is based accordingly with an additional small charge to cover the cost of mincing.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands whether any survey has been made to ascertain the numbers of unoccupied holdings in congested districts counties and their suitability for acquisition by the Irish Land Commission and whether he can give any estimate as to the number of such holdings in each such county.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>A special survey on the lines suggested has not been made but the inspectors have standing instructions to report on all lands in their districts which are suitable for acquisition.  In this sense a continuous survey is going on.  I am aware that there are many unoccupied holdings in these districts and while a close estimate of their numbers is not readily available I can assure the Deputy that no effort is being spared to acquire whatever suitable land becomes available there for the relief of congestion. The general position regarding the occupancy of land is subject to much variation through settlements, sales, deaths, etc., so that land which is not available for acquisition at the present time may be available next year and vice versa.  For this reason, a special survey would quickly run out of date, thus dissipating much effort for little or no practical return.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that, in its general application, the provision referred to by the Deputy, which allows a month's grace before interest is charged on overdue payments, has operated harshly or unfairly and I do not propose to introduce amending legislation.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

The position is governed by statute and neither I nor the trustees of the fund have any discretion in the matter.

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the Minister states that he has no function in the matter, due to the way in which the legislation is framed, would he not consider introducing amending legislation so that exceptional cases like this could be dealt with?

      <P>I do not know if it is desired to discuss these amendments separately.  Perhaps I should explain that the majority of the amendments relate to matters which were raised on different stages in the Dáil, matters which I promised to look into further. For example, the Dáil will recall the discussion on the substitution of the term &ldquo;multiple factory&rdquo; for the term &ldquo;tenement factory&rdquo;.  I undertook to look into that matter further when it was in the Dáil and, in the Seanad, I introduced the necessary amendments. My decision to do that was responsible for amendments Nos. 2, 3, 4, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 and 17.  Other amendments also were a carry-over from discussions which took place in the Dáil and still some more amendments were amendments which I accepted in the Seanad and which, in <Col N="458" /> the main, represented agreement from all sides of that House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 5:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (2), paragraph (c), line 50, &ldquo;and have not been incurred in or about any unsuccessful legal proceedings&rdquo; added after &ldquo;person&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The question was raised in the Seanad about the right of the Minister to recover costs against the sanitary authority where the Minister, having taken action in the courts in default of action by the sanitary authority, was subjected to expenses because of his action in that respect.  As it stood, the Bill provided that even if the Minister were unsuccessful in his action in court he could still recover costs in respect of the unsuccessful action in the courts against the sanitary authority.</P>
      <P>It was urged in the Seanad that the decision of the local authority to decline to take action might be due to a belief on their part that action was not warranted and that if the Minister then moved in, despite the decision of the local authority, to take action against what was believed to be a defaulting occupier of a factory and if the Minister were unsuccessful it would be unreasonable for him, having been unsuccessful in the courts, to try to recover the costs from the local authority of his unsuccessful action in the courts.</P>
      <P>As the issue is probably not likely to arise often, if at all, I agreed to move an amendment making it clear that the local authority, in that case, could not be made amenable for the Minister's costs when the Minister's action in the courts was not sustained by the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not press that point of view to the extent of making the Minister go back to the Seanad to argue it there, but the Bill was drafted to provide that, in the event of default by the sanitary authority in the discharge of their functions under the Act, the Minister's inspector could go in and take proceedings and enforce the regulations and bill the sanitary authority with the costs, if costs arose.  As it now stands, the inducement to the <Col N="460" /> sanitary authority not to take any action is very strong because, if they do not do it, the inspector will do it and if the action fails the sanitary authority can be at no expense.  It seems to me that, by this device, it is made practically certain that the sanitary authority will not proceed to take legal action even where it is required, leaving it to the Minister to do so.</P>
      <P>I should have thought that the other direction would have been wiser to take and warn the sanitary authority that if they fail to enforce the law, and the Minister has to step in, they will be liable for any costs even if the action is unsuccessful.  It may be argued that the sanitary authority should not be liable for costs in an unsuccessful action taken against their will, but the whole purpose of the section is to ensure that somebody will have power to take proceedings if the sanitary authority refuse to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is only when, having taken the action, he fails: it is only when the Minister fails because the court feel there is no transgression of the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody suggests that the Minister will taken vexatious actions.  He will taken action only where the Attorney-General says action should be taken and when he is likely to succeed.  There was little likelihood of a sanitary authority being billed with costs under the section as it stood unless the court held that the intention of the Oireachtas, as expressed in the Act, was different from what we now assume it to be.  By this provision here, it is made almost certain that the sanitary authority, looking to preserve their own funds, will never take proceedings. They can put the Minister in the position of having to take these proceedings, knowing that, even if the proceedings are unsuccessful, the sanitary authority can never be liable for the costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>There was the argument that, after all, the reluctance of the local authority to take action might be due to a conviction on their part, reinforced by their legal adviser, that there was not sufficient evidence to sustain a prosecution in a <Col N="461" /> certain case.  They might say: &ldquo;We do not feel justified in taking action in this case because we are advised there is no breach of the Act or of the regulations.&rdquo;  If, however, the case goes to court and the court decide against the Minister for Industry and Commerce I think it might be argued that the Minister for Industry and Commerce, having moved in against the advice of the local authority, reinforced by their legal adviser, and losing the case in court, should not ask the local authority to underwrite his tenacity in going ahead in circumstances which the court decided did not justify any prosecution at the instance of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The power to take the case himself is given to the Minister because we suspected that local sanitary authorities might not be as vigilant in the enforcement of the Act as the Department's inspectors.  Is it not almost certain that a sanitary authority will tell their legal adviser to advise them that there is risk associated with the action and to let the Minister carry that risk?  This is putting the pressure in the opposite direction to that which we intended.  We wanted to ensure that the sanitary authority would have no inducement to fail to take action but now there is every inducement not to take action.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister explain what the position will be?  As it stood, an inspector under the Factories Act could not go into a reformatory school except in accordance with the provisions set out here. An inspector would not have the right to consult with an inmate of the school without one of the masters or the head of the reformatory being present. Generally it was intended that the enforcement of the Factories Act in the reformatory schools&mdash;where they are not really applicable at all&mdash;should be done only where there was obvious need to do so and then in consultation with the authorities in charge of the school.  Now all that has been taken out and, so far as I can see, the sole provision of the Act will be that the Minister's inspectors will have the right to enforce these regulations and provisions in any reformatory school. I presume the Department of Education has been consulted before this change was made and I would like to know if that is so and if it has agreed with this desire that the inspector, for example, should have the right to go into a reformatory school, discuss with any person any <Col N="465" /> matter affecting the carrying on of business in the school, without any masters or people responsible for the school being present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill as it stood when it left this House provided that certain institutions where certain things were made were in fact factories, whether they were factories or not, for the purpose of the application of the provisions of the Bill, subject to certain modifications.  The modifications&mdash;which I have since deleted&mdash;provided that the Minister for Industry and Commerce might, if he so decided, appoint the medical officer of the institution as the certifying doctor for the purposes of the Bill, that is, for the examination of persons engaged in the activities carried on there and, secondly, before the inspector could interview an inmate of the particular institution it would be necessary that he should get the permission of whoever was in charge of the institute, if whoever was in charge had previously indicated that he desired to be consulted when an inmate was being interviewed.  But, again, the Minister could dispense with that requirement, that is, in both cases.</P>
      <P>These two provisions were in the 1907 Factories Bill and they have operated down through the years.  They have operated for so long, in fact, that that has been the established practice in dealing with bodies such as the institution which this section is intended to cover, but which it does not precisely define.</P>
      <P>I accepted an amendment to delete these two provisions&mdash;firstly, because I thought they were inconsequential and I thought it was not necessary to write them into the Bill in a definite kind of way.  The first modification that we might contemplate, the appointment of the medical officer of the institution as the certifying doctor &mdash;that can happen whether the section is in the Bill or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the second question, as to who interviews the inmates in the particular institution, I presume that in the exercise of ordinary intelligence, the inspector who desires to interview a person there, would call to see whoever <Col N="466" /> is in charge and say he wants to interview such and such a person.  He then, if he wishes, would interview the person in the presence of whoever was in charge.  That requirement has been discontinued in the Bill and the inspector can if he wishes&mdash;and if he does not wish he need not&mdash;see the inmate without whoever was in authority being present.  I think that has to be left to the good sense of the inspector.</P>
    <P>So far as the reformatory and industrial school are concerned, sub-section (2) says that this Act shall not, except in so far as the Minister may by Order direct, apply to any premises which do not constitute a factory, if the premises are subject to inspection while under the authority of a Minister of State.  If, as happens at present, reformatories and industrial schools are subject to inspection, and indeed control, by a Minister of State, then this Act does not apply to them.  That was the Bill as originally introduced and that section still stands.  It is not proposed in these cases that there should be any interference there, nor should this Bill apply to such cases unless the Minister makes a specific Order.  That was the provision of the Bill as originally introduced in the House.  It still remains in the Bill.</P>

      <P>Sub-section (4), page 57, deleted and the following sub-section substituted:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(4)  Any person undertaking any such building operations to which this Act applies as may be declared by regulations of the Minister to require notice under this sub-section shall, not later than seven days after the beginning of the operations, serve on the Minister a written notice stating the name and postal address of the person so undertaking the operations, the place and nature of the operations, and whether any mechanical power is or is to be used and, if so, its nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the section where, the Minister will recollect, we <Col N="467" /> had difficulty in determining the type of building operations to which this obligation to notify the Department of the commencement of work would attach.  There was originally in the Bill a limitation relating to the length of time during which building operations were carried out.  The person doing the work was not required to notify the Department unless it was anticipated the work would last more than six weeks.  I argued also that there should be a further limitation in regard to the number of people employed on it.  The Minister has taken all that out and will have power to administer by Order. From the drafting point of view, that is probably a cleaner way.</P>
      <P>In so far as the problem discussed has not yet been solved, I think the Minister should give an indication of the type of Order he has in mind to make.  I argued before, and I still think it is desirable, that we should not put in this obligation to notify the Department of the commencement of building operations unless the building operations are on a reasonable scale, that it should not apply to a farmer having an outhouse built for his farm or someone having an extension built to his home.  It would be unwise to put upon those people obligations to notify the Department, because the majority will not do it and it is always wrong to have a law on the Statute Book which people are disposed to ignore.</P>
      <P>I take it the Minister is accepting that point of view that there is need to give notification&mdash;and presumably it will be followed by inspection&mdash;only when building works of reasonably substantial size are in contemplation. I am agreeable to the amendment which enables the Minister to deal with this by Order, because it permits the Minister to change his hand if the Order appears to require amendment, rather than try to deal with the matter by statute.  I think it would be no harm for the Minister to say what type of Order he has in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is really an effort not only to make the <Col N="468" /> section work better and make it more flexible than when it was originally introduced, but it is a desire also to meet the point of view expressed by the Deputy in this House and at the meetings of the Special Committee on this particular section.  In a given set of circumstances, the number of men employed does not matter very much. You must consider many things, not merely the number of men employed and the duration of the work but the kind of job they are doing.</P>
      <P>For instance, I do not think it would matter very much if 60 people were concreting a street.  Possibly nothing very much could happen in a case like that but it probably would be serious if four men were up on a scaffold surrounding a spire because the risk of something happening there would be great; whereas, unless they tripped over one another, nothing much is likely to happen if they are concreting a flat surface.  Similarly, if workers are opening a trench to a depth of a foot or two, it is probably not serious but if they open a trench to the extent of ten feet and are down at the bottom, you would want to make sure it is properly shored.  There the need for notification and inspection arises much more urgently than in regard to the shallower trench.</P>
      <P>These are some things which have occurred to me but there would be such a variety of cases to be legislated for that I do not think we can do it satisfactorily by relating it to an arbitrary number, of say six people, employed or an arbitrary duration of the job, say six weeks.  What I propose to do is to try to make a regulation which might apply to a variety of jobs having regard to the risk involved.  The Deputy will have seen that during the passage of the Bill through the Seanad I asked that I should be given power to appoint the advisory committee after the passing of the Act instead of at the commencement of the operation of the Act.  My object there was that the committee might participate in the consideration of the regulations which will be prepared for cases such as these and regulations covering every section of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I was proposing to do was to <Col N="469" /> invite the co-operation of the committee representative of workers and employers and say: &ldquo;Here is what we think should be done in that particular matter.  Here is the regulation by which we propose to give effect to our intentions.  Will you let us have your views?&rdquo;  We would, therefore, be guided by the practical experience of people who every day in the week are responsible for planning jobs of that kind and seeing that they are properly carried out.  The aim is to keep away from needless inquisitions into small jobs and only to carry out the inspections where the job is one which involves danger to health or to the safety of the workmen concerned.</P>

      <P>If I understand the Minister rightly, the regulations will apply only where machinery is used, where scaffolding is used or where trenches are being due to a depth which might involve danger to the workers concerned.  I think he is right in that.  He must confine his regulations to specific matters with which factory inspectors can deal; they can see if the machinery is properly fenced, if scaffolding is safe and trenches are properly shored; in certain cases they might have to consider the provision of protective clothing.  But it is only in cases of that kind that the inspector can be effective and it is only there, in my opinion, the regulations apply.</P>

      <P>I want to refer to one specific matter which came to my notice recently in relation to the operations of the Land Commission where the division of land is concerned.  There is a certain amount of land, about 2,500 acres, in the hands of the Land Commission at the present moment in County Limerick.  I want to appeal to the Minister on behalf of a specific class of which the Land Commission rules governing the distribution of land do not sufficiently take cognisance.  Perhaps this position which I am interested in bringing to the Minister's attention does not apply in many other counties besides Limerick.  In the dairying districts we have a class called dairymen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are people who rent land for a certain number of years, stock dairy <Col N="471" /> cows and supply milk to creameries. I would ask the Land Commission to take the position of people like those into consideration.  I have known a few of them who were provided with farms by the Land Commission in the past.  They are deserving people because they have no land of their own.  They have proved to be very efficient workers when they rented farms, stocked them and produced milk and other commodities on that land. Unfortunately, they have often had to leave at a moment's notice.  That is the type of person who should be taken into consideration in any place where land is being acquired and divided, that is, of course, when the demands of local uneconomic holders have been met.</P>
    <P>There is another class of people who are very deserving in my opinion.  As I have said, the Land Commission rule them out more often than provide for them, that is, the cottiers who only own the county council plot they get with their cottage.  These men, through thrift, industry and hard work, succeed in taking grazing land and stocking it with milch cows.  I know of instances where cottiers, without owning a perch of land except the cottage plot, own six, seven and eight milch cows and keep those cows on land they rent for grazing and pay for very dearly each year and have been doing that for years past.  There are a number of these people and they deserve well of this country and deserve the special consideration of the Land Commission.  I have been making inquiries about this and the only time, I understand, that cottiers of any description are considered is when they live within a half mile of the estate to be divided.</P>
    <P>In the case of a cottier who does not own land of his own who cannot purchase it, but who is renting it from year to year and who has five, six and sometimes ten cows on that rented land, I think he is deserving of consideration no matter what distance he lives from the estate.  Even if he lived five or six miles away, he would deserve consideration.  He would be <Col N="472" /> written down, of course, under the Land Commission rules for the division of land as a landless man.  I put it to the Minister that in a position such as obtains in County Limerick, cottiers who rent land in the way I have described should receive more favourable consideration from the Land Commission than they have received heretofore.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the distance limit of a half mile which applies should not continue to apply where you have men who, to all intents and purposes, are at present in the same position as small farmers but who unfortunately do not own the land they are farming. These people should be made tenant holders and given allotments by the Land Commission.  The stock is there already, the equipment is there already, the ability to work is quite apparent from the fact that these men, year after year, are paying heavy rents for land in their locality and are working it to the best of their ability.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of Land Commission policy and Land Commission regulations to which I should also like to refer.  Some Deputy here yesterday referred to a recent practice of the Land Commission in refusing to accept the decision of the Appeal Tribunal now and again as regards price.  I think that is an unfair attitude to adopt.  I suppose it is a question maybe of the Department of Finance making representation to the Land Commission in connection with that matter so that too high a price would not be paid but I think it is wrong that when there is an appeal on price by the owner of land and when the tribunal fixes the price in the last appeal that can be made by the owner, the Land Commission should not honour the decision of that court.</P>

      <P>I understand; the Commission feels that if it does not cut the price suggested by the tribunal the allottees would have to pay too <Col N="473" /> high a rent in order to recoup the portion for the payment of which they are responsible, but is it not a fact that where land is acquired and divided the allottees have only to pay half the price paid for that land?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Donnchadh Ó Briain</NameTxt>
      <P>In my opinion that question does not arise when people are hungry for land.  The people about whom I have been talking are paying far more rent per annum for the land they rent for grazing than they would were they asked to recoup the Land Commission for any allotment they might get.  There are also a few areas in County Limerick which I would describe as practically desert. Some of it is the finest land in the county, but the Land Commission does not do anything about it because there is no congestion.  Some of the finest land in the country is available there for acquisition and division if the commission would only agree to take it and divide it.  They would find allottees for it and good ones.  But apparently there must be some problem of congestion in the immediate locality in order to justify the Land Commission stepping in and acquiring such land.</P>
      <P>There is one parish where there are 1,000 acres of land which I regard to a great extent as a desert.  It is magnificent land but the Land Commission will not touch it because there is no congestion there.  I intervened in this debate principally to say a word on behalf of the type of applicant for land whom I have described as the cottier who owns no land but who rents it every year and who keeps anything from five to ten dairy cows.  This man can get nowhere nor can he own a farm of his own because he has not the wherewithal to purchase it.  If these people had the price of land they would not be depending on the Land Commission but would get out into the open market, but with the inflated price that is paid for all kinds of land now these people cannot purchase on the open market, despite all this talk about the flight from the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="474" /> It is very difficult for the people who are working hard like they are but who are not able to put sufficient money together to purchase a farm of their own.  Men of that kind who did succeed in saving sufficient money did go out and purchase and they made eminently successful farmers.  The vast majority of them, however, cannot purchase land on their own and I plead specifically for a relaxation of the rules governing division of land where applicants like that are concerned.</P>

Tá fhios ag chách go mba cheart go mbeadh dlú-bhaint níos láidre idir an Roinn Tailte agus muintir na Gaeltachta.

Sa chaoi sin, beidh sé ag tabhairt cabhair mór don chúis.  Molaimse anois <Col N="475" /> go gcuirfidh an Roinn atá i gceist anseo tosnú ar an obair sin.</P>
    <P>Deputy McQuillan spoke, yesterday, about possible savings in the Land Commission in the number of officials and in other aspects of expenditure. My opinion also is that there could be a considerable saving.  While some may be pulling their weight, the great majority are not pulling their weight, and they are not giving a full day's work for a full day's pay.  That holds for the field staff as well as for the office staff.  I think that there could be great retrenchment and a great saving for this State in the Land Commission. I have that opinion of the whole Civil Service, but in this particular Department there is a call for retrenchment and it should be examined.</P>
    <P>I am not one of those who say that the Land Commission should be abolished, when it does no useful work, that in the policy of migration it is very slow and is not meeting with the spectacular success that people anticipated, and that, therefore, it should be abolished.  I do not agree with that at all.  I think that in the rearrangement of rundale and in migration, the Land Commission have done a very big work and a great lot of good for the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>I have been in Connemara several times and I have seen the homes from which people were translated to Meath and to other parts.  They were never translated to Tipperary because the Government and the Land Commission were always afraid of Tipperary, but that is another question.  Anyway, I have seen the homes from which they were migrated.  The land from which they were taken was added to other homes.  I have seen, after a number of years, the sons in the houses which got an additional holding building houses on the old holding, so that you had the congestion all over again.</P>
    <P>You see all that from Donegal to Kerry, but that does not deter me from praising migration, and it does not suggest to my mind that the Minister or the Land Commission should change that.  It does indicate, however, that <Col N="476" /> you have no quick solution for this problem of migration or congestion. Candidly speaking, I would far sooner see a rural slum than a slum in a city area because in the former independent men and women have a better chance of developing their individuality and their citizenship in a rural congested area than they would have in a congested tenement area in a city.</P>
    <P>There is another point with which I should like to deal.  The Land Commission had been operating before there was ever an independent State in this part of Ireland.  One notable fact about the old Congested Districts Board was the slovenly, half-hearted way in which they did things, and the way in which they left things unfinished.  They divided an estate say in Meath or Kildare.  The old British Government voted so much money to make ditches and roads into the homes of the people.  We will say that the sum was £50, which was a lot of money at that time.  They made the road half-way or three-quarters of the way and left it there.  The people at the end of the estate were left without any road.  That is a fact, and you can see evidence of it in County Clare and in County Westmeath.  That evidence is there until this day where you see people having to carry their goods across the unmade part of a road, if one can call it a road because it is little more than wheel tracks.</P>
    <P>Things have improved a bit since then.  The grants are meagre and the officials do the best they can with these grants.  But, again, there is often neglect in completing the work.  I know an estate in my own parish, the Hempenstall estate, which is situate at Ballinascary.  I wrote to the Land Commission recently about it.  There was very bad mishandling in the matter of administration there.  I want to draw the attention of the House, the Department and the Minister to certain details.  The ditches were never completed; they were never fully made.  The ditch between a man named Reynolds and a man named Philip O'Reilly was never finished.  The pump was never properly sunk, and who is to blame for that I do not know. <Col N="477" /> The fact, however, is that these men have to pay their annuities and their rates and there is no protection to keep their cattle and sheep from crossing one another's land.  The Minister is not to blame for that, but I am drawing his attention and the attention of this House and of the Land Commission to that particular estate.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I should like to draw the attention of the Minister, and of the Government, is that when an estate, like the Chapman estate, at Southill, near Delvin, County Westmeath, is acquired where you have big belts of woods or forests, the Land Commission, with its child, the Forestry Department, should put their heads together and see what is to be the ultimate national result in a few years in the wiping out of those forests. The Minister and the Land Commission know of that.  You have it from Galway to Dublin and from Cavan to Kerry in the case of big estates which have been acquired.  Whatever we may say against landlords, and there is very little good that we can say of them, one thing they did was to preserve any forests that we had in the country.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal with the question of the division of estates on which there are belts of trees.  Take the case of Joristown.  There you have one of the finest belts of elm and larch to be found around any estate in the country. I cannot tell the exact depth of it. What is going to happen to it?  It is going to be knocked down and sold by the incoming occupiers of the land. Is it going to be replaced?  Not a whin bush will be set in its place.  Any afforestation that takes place will be of a nature which will not grow timber that will be one-tenth as good, because it will be on cut-away bog, and will not yield timber of the quality that you have in Southill and in Joristown and on a number of other estates.</P>
    <P>I should like the Land Commission and the Minister to look very seriously into this matter and see what can be done about it.  I can see young larch and mature larch, I can see elm and oak, mature and immature, being <Col N="478" /> felled every week that I come to Dublin.  What is going to take their place?  These are posers for the Minister and are of national importance. I suggest it would be very desirable if the Minister could deal with them when he is replying.</P>
    <P>On the question of migration, local requirements should be met as far as possible.  Sometimes they are not; sometimes there is a lack of justice on the part of the Land Commission, and deserving people are put out.  I do not want to minimise the problem that there is in the West.  I know that where you have a lot of small holdings with valuations of £10 and £15 you have to deal with them, but I would ask the Minister to bear in mind that, in the Midlands, we also have small valuations.  For instance, if anyone looks up the <i>Statistical Abstract</i> for 1938, the latest one that I have seen, he will find that there are 8,000 or 9,000 holdings in my own county under £10 valuation and you have quite a big number with valuations of £2 10s.  I suggest that the position of these people should be considered when they are near an estate and that they should not be left out.</P>
    <P>Coming now to the question of the big migration to Delvin, you are going to deal with an estate in Adamstown. Why not give the locals there a chance?  You brought decent people, good citizens, who are a credit to the country, up from the West.  Now give the local people a chance when you are dividing the Adamstown estate.  In the same way, why not give the people in a comparatively congested area like Dysart a chance?</P>
    <P>In the Kilbeggan electoral area, the farms are all small.  It is not the grazing part of Westmeath.  It adjoins Offaly, and the farmers there are great growers of barley and all grain crops. Why not look into their claims when dealing with the 100 or 200 acres of land which you are about to divide in Dysart?</P>
    <P>Deputy Donnchadh Ó Briain dealt with the question of cottages.  We have successfully gone from the conditions when the British were here in regard to the number of cow parks in the <Col N="479" /> County Westmeath.  The cottiers there may have one or two cows and calves and may need accommodation.  I am making the case that the people from Dysart should get a cow park.</P>
    <P>You have an estate at Joristown, which I mentioned before, and on which there is a big holding.  I think its valuation is £35 or £36.  You brought innumerable people, as you were entitled to do, from the West, to inspect that holding, to see if they would give up their holdings in the West, and take that over.  The valuation on the house frightened them, and they have gone back.  I will give you 20 people within 20 miles of that holding who will not be frightened of the valuation, and who will give up their holdings and go into that.  I appeal to you to give them a chance. They will make good farmers, will not bog down on the rates, but will pay every cent of them.  Every one of them is a good mixed farmer, and will make a success of it.  You are two or three years tinkering with it now.  Give the Westmeath and Meath people a chance&mdash;it is only a couple of miles from the Meath border&mdash;of proving themselves and going in there, after yielding up their own farms.  This will aid the relief of congestion.</P>
    <P>I do not subscribe, for one moment, to the doctrine that a man should have a limited amount of land.  If a man had 10,000 acres of land, gave good employment for which he paid a good wage, and drew a good yield out of it, more power to him.  Why limit the amount of land he should hold?  It is only the man who is a chain-grazing farmer whom I would make work.  The size of a man's farm does not frighten me in the least.  One of my constituents wrote to me, condemning us for the handling of the Land Commission.  He wrote:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If I had the handling of the Land Commission, I would get a map of Ireland and divide the land into squares.  You would do it in 12 months.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not believe in that kind of thing. As I said, if a man is giving good employment, and getting the best out <Col N="480" /> of the land, he should be left in his holding.</P>
    <P>But, side by side with that, you have the Land Commission going after Westmeath holdings of 20 or 30 acres, in the vicinity of Dysart.  I know the case of a widow who was left, unfortunately, with a number of children to rear.  She got into debt with the bank, and some wiseacre said that the Fine Gael Party were making war on the children.  She is dead now, and the children are all working, trying to pay the bank.  They are like a lot of hounds after a fox in a field.  To take 20 acres from the children of this woman is most unfair and uncalled for.  The children were well entitled to go into that holding when they got on their feet.  If ever anything made for Communism that kind of thing makes for it.</P>
    <P>In my career as a public representative, I know of nothing where we can be more unfair and unjust than in this question of land division.  Go into any political meeting of any political organisation.  You can talk about social welfare, or about any other matter relative to this State.  You will get fair and, maybe, hard criticism at times, but eventually you will smooth things out.  But when land division is mentioned the lid is off, there is &ldquo;meela murder&rdquo;, and anything can be said.  If people take advantage of the political Party they are in to make war on the person taking land, the Land Commission should not lend themselves to that kind of action.</P>
    <P>There is another matter with which I would like to deal.  The only person, whether he is a migrant or not, who should get consideration in the allocation of land, is the man bringing up a family.  If he is a successful farmer, the political Party to which he belongs should not enter into the matter, whether it be Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil, Labour, Clann na Poblachta or Sinn Féin.  This should not be taken into consideration.  Any Deputy who uses his influence&mdash;and I know of something that happened four years ago&mdash;and says: &ldquo;Do not give that man a farm&rdquo;, is doing a disservice to the nation. There will be repercussions later.  That man may be a family man with 12 <Col N="481" /> children, maybe with seven acres of land.  If he is put into another holding, no Deputy should say: &ldquo;Do not give land to that fellow because he is a rabid Fianna Fáil man.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>It happened in my constituency.  It went so far that the Land Commission would not speak to the man when he made representations to them.  It went so far that when I wrote to the chief inspector I could not get the courtesy of a reply.  Yet, when another Deputy made representations he had a letter back by post saying that his representations got consideration.  After all, I have been elected for the past 27 years in my constituency and I think I am entitled to as much courtesy as the members of other political Parties.  I apply that rule all round.  I know when we came into office it was said to us: &ldquo;Oh, you are giving the land to Fine Gael as well as your own&rdquo;.  We had not the ultimate say; and I certainly would not like any Minister to interfere to such an extent that he would say who should get it.</P>

Unfortunately we have none of them in Wexford.  Very often when we seek information here about the activities of the Land Commission we are told the Minister has no say; it is the commissioners.  The result is we do not know where we are.  Deputy Kennedy talked about politics.  Last year in my constituency the Galbally estate, on which a number of small farmers and others had been accustomed to take conacre, was given by the Land Commission to two single men.  They were taken from one farm and transferred to the Galbally estate. The Land Commission took over the Ellis estate and I was surprised to see the house on that estate being demolished and an auction advertised. Surely that policy is wrong.  We are always talking about lack of housing. Why then knock down a house?  That house could have been given to a small farmer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No later than a week ago people approached me asking if they could get a few acres of land on that estate.  I asked them if anyone had called on them and they told me no one had called; but the strange thing is they were able to tell me who was going to get the land.  Surely there is something wrong there.  Now I have written to the Land Commission as frequently as any other Deputy here.  I might as well have been writing to the Dead Letter Office.  So much for political influence! Anybody on whose behalf I ever wrote <Col N="483" /> never got as much as one acre.  At the same time political influence was used; but it was not the Labour supporters who got the land.  In my area it was the people Deputy Kennedy was talking about.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Derrig was Minister for Lands I put down a question in relation to a certain farm in my constituency. I asked him to give me the names of the people who got the land. His reply was that it was not in the public interest to give the information sought.  Nevertheless I could be told before I ever came into Leinster House who the allottees were.  In some cases land has been given to old age pensioners with no families.  If that is the way the Land Commission works it is time we scrapped it.  Farmers' sons and labourers' sons cannot get one acre; and then we talk about the flight from the land.  The young men in Wexford are willing to work the land if they get it.</P>
    <P>When there is land for division in Wexford the wrong people get it. Allocating land to suit politicians should stop.  I believe the Land Commission will have to change its ways. It is the slowest working machine of all Government Departments.  The number of questions tabled here shows how slow the machine is.  An estate has been acquired outside Enniscorthy and the people are waiting for it to be divided.  The general practice of the Land Commission is to set such land for a year as conacre.  The allottees who ultimately get the land find all the good has been taken out of it and it is these unfortunate people who have to lime it and fertilise it and put it into good heart.  That system is wrong.  Houses on these estates that are taken over should not be demolished if they are in good repair. The house should be given over together with 30 or 40 acres of land to one of the allottees.  Now I think anything less than 40 acres of land is useless.  Fortunately we are not troubled very much in Wexford from the point of view of land but a few things have happened which have caused some contention.  I have never seen an inspector of the Land Commission. <Col N="484" /> I do not know but that the gentlemen sitting on the Minister's right may be the inspectors.</P>

      <P>Yes, but I do not think he is responsible after that because, as far as I can see, the Land Commission is doing what it likes and causing a great many grievances among landless people by dividing land as they are dividing it.  I think something should be done to speed up land division and to give the people who want land a chance of getting it.  We talk about keeping the people on the land and about the flight from the land, but we should give the applicants the land they need and not give it to people who already have acres of land.  I think the first people to get land should be the landless men.  I was told one day that if you had no land you had no chance of getting land; according to that landless men are ruled out.</P>
      <P>I know that some very bad decisions were given in the Enniscorthy area and I am prepared to stand over that statement if necessary.  People were given land who were not entitled to get it at all and genuine cases with three or four acres, people who were trying to live by working on the roads and so on, were turned down.  I hope the Land Commission this year will do more, and do it more honestly and in such a way that they will see that applicants who want land will get it.  I hope the Land Commission will stop this trucking and swapping to suit certain political Parties.</P>

      <P>I want to add my voice to those who have stated that they resent the attitude of the Land Commission in refusing to take land which has been subject to a decision fixing <Col N="485" /> the price.  I think it is very wrong of the Land Commission.  It should not have any more right to refuse such lands than have the people from whom the land is being taken.  I think all that is due to the fact that the 1950 Land Act was a bad Act.  The 1950 Land Act led us to understand that the market value would be paid for land.  If the Minister is satisfied that he was right in saying that market value would be paid for land then he should also insist that if a price is fixed on farm land the Land Commission should definitely pay that price.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should wake up and realise one thing: it is not a question of it being too dear for you.  Those lands, as far as I know, are mostly lands&mdash;many of them at any rate&mdash;that are let in conacre and unfortunate people with small valuations of £5 or £6 are mulcted to the extent of £14 or £15 per acre which they have to pay for those lands in conacre year after year.  I think that is what the Minister must face up to.  If the Land Commission is to relieve these people, they must be given the lands they are crying out for even at greater prices, because conacre has them robbed; where are their profits going to come from when they have to pay up to £15 or £18 for conacre in my part of the country?  I know the Minister chimed in when Deputy Ó Briain was speaking with the remark that the land would be too dear on the people.  Is it going to be anything like the same price as when they are taking it in conacre?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know of any holding taken over under it, and that is a clear statement.  I live in a constituency that is very congested and day after day holdings are being sold. Some of these holdings were actually offered by the people who own them to the Land Commission but the Land Commission refused to step in.  They refused to offer the people alternative lands or buy them over from them.  I wonder why that is the case and I wonder if the Minister will say that that must stop.</P>
      <P>The question of migration is a very important one, but at the same time where good holdings of land are for sale in a townland and where these are suitable for the rearrangement of holdings in the townland I see no reason why the Land Commission should not step in and take over those holdings. I heard it said here yesterday, and I suppose all of us resent the fact, that we had during recent years&mdash;or was it confined to last year&mdash;racketeers starting wheat-ranching in certain parts of the country.  If there is any sort of ranching like that going on we should realise that we have been a long time fighting in this country against cattle ranching, and if there is any other type of ranching going on, it is up to the Land Commission to wake up and step in.  All that type of stuff can be stopped overnight.  The cutting of the price of wheat by 12/6 is not a solution to the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">

    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaSnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>If the acreage of wheat is down this year it is down because of the fact that the price is cut.  That does not get away from the problem. If you want to stop any racketeering in land for cattle-ranching or wheat-ranching it could be done if the Land Commission became a little more active and stepped in and took over those lands.  You would not then have Deputy Tully resenting the migrants <Col N="487" /> from the West coming in because there is plenty of land available in the Midlands for these migrants if the Land Commission only woke up, or if the Minister exerted himself a little more.</P>
      <P>Another thing I have been coming across from time to time, particularly in latter years, is in regard to the rearrangement of holdings.  We have a number of holdings that the Land Commission has on hands for 14 or 15 or even 18 years and they have been letting these lands in conacre year after year.  Of course much of this land is let in tillage and the heart is knocked out of it.  It is then handed over to some unfortunate individual, a small struggling farmer with perhaps a £5 or £6 valuation, and it is given to him in an impoverished state incapable of growing any crop other than rushes or weeds.  I must say that the previous Minister, Deputy Derrig, did a bit of land reclamation work last year on impoverished lands before they were handed over.  Let us hope the present Minister will continue that and extend it more and more.</P>
      <P>Liming and manuring was done on some of the lands and although these are not handed out yet, an effort is being made to build them up before they are handed over.  If impoverished lands incapable of producing a crop are handed over to a small farmer who is usually a man without much capital he is not in a position to manure those lands or bring them up to fertility so as to produce a decent crop from them.  I think it is the duty of the Land Commission to try to hand over to those people lands that are fertile and lands that are not choked with weeds or in want of manure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to press ahead with that work.  They also hand over lands that are flooded out and unable to grow anything but rushes or heather and are useless to an uneconomic holder and he is as well off without such land. Again, lands are handed over which are all shrubbery and in no condition for anybody to do anything with them. It is all right to say that the Department of Agriculture are dealing with that aspect in the land reclamation <Col N="488" /> scheme, but it is the duty of the Land Commission to hand over to any small farmer lands on which he can start to work right away rather than that he should be in the position of having to endure hardships in trying to get the land into a condition in which he can knock something out of it.</P>
    <P>I might draw the Minister's attention to a statement he made at the Archbishop's meeting in Tuam when he promised to give immediate attention to the migration of people willing to migrate from the flooded areas in North Galway.  I regret to say that no Government Department gave an ounce of assistance, outside the Army, in those flooded areas.  We were expecting and hoping that the Department of Agriculture might do something, but nothing was done.  There are at least four families there&mdash;I put this matter to him on a few previous occasions&mdash;who are willing to migrate immediately and I ask him to have the matter examined as he promised in Tuam and to get something done about it.  I told the Minister the night he made the promise in Tuam that a scheme had already been submitted to his Department, with the names of the people concerned.  If this flooding recurs this year, we will have Government lip sympathy with these people, but now is the time to remedy the situation and I sincerely hope that we will get more than lip sympathy for them.</P>
    <P>While I agree that the basis of valuation is about the only line on which we can go in the division of land, at the same time, the Land Commission should take into consideration that you have small holdings adjoining certain demesne lands, the valuation of which is exceedingly high.  In numerous parts of my constituency, you will find people with a valuation of £14 and £16 who still have only six or seven acres of arable land.  When a holding of land is being divided convenient to these people, they are not eligible for any increase because they are over £12 10s. valuation.  I think we should give a little attention to the size of the holding because a man does not derive his livelihood from the valuation of a holding.  While the valuation is an indication, it is, at the same time, very <Col N="489" /> detrimental to many people in the West of Ireland who have to live on eight or ten acres, which is not an economic holding, although the valuation may be £14, £16 or even £18. The Land Commission should be a little bit more liberal when dealing with such land and should try to stretch a point in favour of these people and give them at least an economic holding of 25 acres of arable land, no matter what the valuation of the holding.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Leary said that the Order Paper is half filled every day with questions regarding land and all asked by western Deputies.  Deputy O'Leary happens to be living in a part of the world where Cromwell was kind to them&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">

    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaSnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but the people he pushed out had to come down to the mountains and bare spots of Connacht and it should not be forgotten that they are still trying to eke out an existence there.  I could say that the man living in a labourer's cottage in Wexford, which I know pretty well, is better off than a lot of people living on £2 10s. to £5 valuation holdings in the West, and, if we put down questions, it is because we are making an effort to focus the attention of the Land Commission on the plight of these unfortunate people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A few things happened recently in my constituency that have been very much resented.  I had a question down here last week asking the Minister what the Land Commission proposed to do regarding certain lands at Belclare.  There is a publican who lives in the City of Galway and who has another public-house in Tuam.  He is a married man without a family and his wife has another big business in Galway, and an old man died a few years ago and left him a holding out beside where I live of 12 or 13 acres. It is in the area where the flooding took place last year.  The old man had three acres of the holding on a temporary letting and the Land Commission are now going to take over these three miserable acres and leave the <Col N="490" /> rest of the holding to the man in Galway.  The peculiar feature of it is that the holding was sold a few months ago, and, because the man sold these three acres along with whatever vested land he had, the Land Commission refused to sanction the sale and the sale was broken off.  Now this man proposes to sell the other nine acres, but the Land Commission will not go in and take the holding over.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1943" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>They are too slow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaSnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no pressure on them.  I had a question down some time ago regarding a farm known as Blackacre at Tuam.  The Galway County Council built a number of cottages there some years ago and the owner of the land then was very decent to these cottiers.  They had the farm for the grass of their cows.  Tuam is a town that has not an oversupply of milk and those people were serving a very useful purpose by relieving the town supply in producing their own milk but the Land Commission allowed this farm to be sold.  The day after it was sold, all their cows were shoved out on the high road and pushed on the market and those unfortunate people now have to purchase their milk requirements.  In my view, that was a slow move on the part of the Land Commission.  I protested before it was done and I protested before the sale was sanctioned.  Actually, the Tuam Parish Council were in touch with the Minister about the matter but nothing was done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want the Minister and the Land Commission to wake up and push ahead more vigorously with the acquisition of land.  At the moment, there is a very congested area between Headford and Shrule and a very good and large farm is about to be put on the market.  I should like the Land Commission to step in there.  They can help to solve the remaining problem in that area by taking over this particular farm.  Some time ago they let a farm on the Galway side of Shrule slip through their fingers and I hope that will not happen again in this case.  Another congested area is Cloonacat.  The Parliamentary Secretary <Col N="491" /> to the Minister for Finance knows all about the position there.  It is bad enough that the Land Commission should give permission to sell a vested holding but it is far worse when permission is given for the sale of an unvested holding.  There was an unvested holding in that area and the Land Commission gave permission for its sale.  The same happened in Clooncum W.  An unvested holding was sold to a shopkeeper.  If a man is a shopkeeper then that is his way of earning his living and if a man is a farmer he must be allowed to make his living out of his holding of land.</P>
    <P>We have now arrived at the stage when we are again creating ranches all over the country.  Any man who has a bit of money can go out to-morrow morning and purchase every small holding that is for sale in the country, one after the other.  Something must be done about that situation.  There is no point in breaking up ranches to-day if we allow them to be created again to-morrow.  Yesterday I met a young man and his wife who were leaving a ten-acre farm and hitting off for England.  That is happening every day in Ireland at the present time.  If we allow holdings of land to be sold and allow people to become ranchers again after all the efforts from the Land League days down to the present time then the position will be even worse than it was.</P>
    <P>To the uneconomic landholder, it does not matter whether the rancher is the old type of landlord or the new type of rancher except that under the old landlord system he might have had a chance of getting an acre one way or another.  However, with the present land grabber who is building up this type of holding by the purchase of every patch of land in his vicinity, there is little or no hope for the small fellow who is trying to eke out an existence even by the purchase of conacre. There is no hope for him when these fellows jump over his head and purchase every patch of land that is for sale.  I trust that the Minister and his Department will push ahead with the acquisition of such lands.</P>
    <P>I want to refer now to the type of <Col N="492" /> road the Land Commission are making. In County Galway we have the greatest road mileage of any county in Ireland.  Day after day the Land Commission are adding to that road mileage.  Nobody would be a bit worried about those Land Commission roads if they were decent roads but, on a farm, they pick out the crookedest wall they can find and then they think it is economic to build a sod fence along it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaSnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>I withdraw it.  When the Minister starts telling me that I do not know what I am talking about when, in fact, I am talking about roads that I know from A to Z, I cannot describe him as straight.  Not alone are those new Land Commission roads crooked but in no case are they more than ten feet wide, and if two donkey carts happen to meet then one of them must pull up on the side of the ditch so as to enable the other one to pass. If our county council were to take over those roads our county engineer would say that we would have to remove fences here and there and the position would be that the removal of the fences would prove a greater expense than the making of the road itself.  He will not take over a road unless we have at least 14 feet carriage-way and a minimum of 21 feet between fences.</P>
      <P>The result is that, with rates at their present level, the finances are not available for taking them over.  In my view, the Land Commission could easily give us straighter roads and an additional three feet or four feet in their width because to leave them with a carriage-way of less than 14 feet is useless.  The donkey cart is now more or less done away with and lorries are travelling on most of the roads.  If lorries meet one another on roads with less than 16 feet carriage-way the position is obviously very difficult, and if a donkey cart meets a lorry then the donkey cart has to go over the ditch in order to let the big fellow pass. I hope the Land Commission will look into that particular item.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to deal now with roads that were started into bogs but were never completed.  The Land Commission should examine that matter with <Col N="494" /> a view to ensuring that those roads are put into such a condition that the people can use them.  I feel it is a breach of contract on the part of the Land Commission to hand over a bog to people in such a condition that they are unable to use it.  Down through the years, turbary has been handed over to people who cannot make use of it because of the condition of the roads and they have to rush into other places where turbary is already scarce so that, because of competition, you may have to pay as much as £7 for your turf.</P>
    <P>If the Land Commission carried out their drainage and road-making when they were dividing up the bogs the problem would be eased.  We have in areas not too far from Glenamaddy, County Galway, huge stretches of bogs that cannot be used because they are inaccessible while people elsewhere have scarcely enough for themselves. The Land Commission should complete this sort of work and the Minister should make money available for the completion of jobs such as those I have mentioned.</P>

      <P>Listening to Deputy Killilea one would imagine that the Land Commission exists for no other purpose than to give out scrub, brush and water.  I think the Land Commission serve a very useful purpose, but I do not agree with the Deputy at all that they should get the land limed, fertilised and all that sort of thing and hand it over to people.  My feeling is that they should hand over the land and let the people themselves do that. They have many schemes under Government Departments for doing such work, as I did myself lately, and so did Deputy Killilea.</P>

      <P>He knows that he was a member of a Party which was the Government here in 1933 when they passed an Act called the 1933 Land Act.  He was in this House when the 1950 Act went through.  This House handed over control to the Land Commission and they and they alone are the people who can acquire land, divide land or bring migrants from one place to another.  That is the law in this country to-day.  Mind you, I very seldom have any interference.  I am not one of those who go around the country when I hear that a farm of land is going, get a few innocents to come together and say: &ldquo;We will see Mark about that.  He will divide it for us.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The position is, and I tell the people throughout the country, that Deputy Killilea has no more say than I have nor have I any more say than he has, because it is the people whom the Land Commission consider are suitable tenants who get the land and it is the people whom the Land Commission decide on from whom land is acquired. That is the position as I know it since I came in here, since 1943, and it is the position to-day.  I must compliment Deputy Hilliard.  I am sure that if Deputy Killilea was listening to him he would blush because he just told the real truth about it.  Deputy Killilea says that the 1950 Act was a great mistake.</P>

      <P>It is like every other <Col N="497" /> Act.  There may be loopholes in it such as Deputy Lindsay rightly referred to here last night when he said that under that Act the Land Commission come along to a man, decide on a price and acquire the land; the man appeals, the case goes before a higher court and lasts probably for two years.  Then the Land Commission say that the price is too high and that they will not accept the land.  The owner is not in a position to say that the price is too low and that he will not give the land.  I think that that section of the Act should be amended so that fair play can be given to that man, who has probably a lot of expense also.  I am sure that Deputy Lindsay as a man of his own profession did not want to mention that, but the owner probably has a lot of expense, and finally the Land Commission will not accept the land.</P>

      <P>I am speaking here on this matter.  Perhaps it is a pity the Land Commissioners are not here.  If they were it might make them wiser men.  But probably they will read the debate and with the Minister present during the debate they may have these things brought before their notice.  There are good points in the Act as Deputy Killilea knows well.  I know a certain farm of land in County Galway where on three occasions the Land Commission made attempts under the 1933 Act to acquire the land. Every single time the Land Commission inspector went there the owner of the land had ten or 15 fellows rounded up and pointed out that each and every one of these people had to get a holding out of the land, and the result would be that the Land Commission inspector had to go away, because after giving a holding to each of these supposed labouring men there would be no land at all left for distribution in the area.  So if there is a bad point that can be removed, there is also a good one.  I cannot agree that a man who works for a few years for a weekly wage on a farm should get a holding <Col N="498" /> while there are uneconomic holders living around that land.  That was a good point in the Act and I hope the bad ones will be amended.</P>
      <P>Of course, Deputy Killilea could not forget the flooding.  He says: &ldquo;If what happened last year happens this year...&rdquo; As regards migrating some of the people who are there, I know well that the Minister is working in that direction.  I will try to raise Deputy Killilea's heart a bit: any day he stands outside his own door now and opens his eyes, surely he will see places where works are going on to make quite sure that that flooding will never occur again.  This year the Board of Works is spending £150,000 on the River Clare that broke its banks and was responsible for the flooding in that area.</P>

      <P>The fact is that it does not.  I will ask the Minister to give the figure when replying.  Even if it cost that, it would be a very good thing and money well spent.  Coming up through Midland towns to Dublin I remember some years ago they were ghost towns.  If you call to any of the business people in them now, you will find they appreciate the fact that the area is populated now and they will praise those people who come from the West of Ireland, from Kerry or elsewhere; and they say it is a good job it happened, as their towns are no longer ghost towns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appeal again to the Minister to look into the 1950 Act.  I am dissatisfied that in many cases holdings put up for sale were not purchased by the Land Commission.  I know of a case where an inspector went to a sale and did not bid.  From the information I <Col N="500" /> got, he made a recommendation to the head office that the land was worth it and should be taken, but apparently the commissioners decided otherwise and did not take it.  That happened in the Williamstown area.  Things like that should not be allowed.  To a certain extent, the fact of the Land Commission under the 1950 Act being able to say after the whole thing being investigated: &ldquo;We will not accept&rdquo; is slowing up the taking over of these holdings.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see the increase in subhead I, where last year £621,100 was spent on taking over those lands and paying for them.  This year the Estimate is £623,100.  That is an increase, but I believe there should be twice as much.  A couple of thousand pounds increase is of no use.  I would ask the Minister in his Estimates next year and for many years to come to increase the amount.  He himself is a man from a congested area and knows the difference. As Deputy McQuillan rightly remarked, although there were many wrong things he said, without money you can do nothing.  I hope the Minister will get more money every year and that in a short time congestion will be relieved&mdash;and the sooner that happens the better for us all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Beirne</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate has been carried on in a more or less friendly spirit up to the present and it is a great thing that there has been such a close bond between all sides.  There was some wit and humour brought in and we all enjoyed it.  This is an important Estimate to people from the western areas, where the problem of congestion is acute.  I suppose no Deputies, Senators or experts could draw up a set of rules and regulations or formulate a policy that would be suitable for all areas, a kind of uniform policy.  That would be impossible, as the social and economic conditions in many parts of the country differ so widely.  Let us be honest about it.  The Land Commission, with all its shortcomings&mdash;and they are many and I will deal with them later on&mdash;formulated a policy to cater for all sections of the community and all parts of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our main problem in the West, of <Col N="501" /> course, is congestion.  How long it will take to solve it, God only knows.  I do not think it will be solved in my time or for several generations.  People complain that it is slow&mdash;that is true and I will deal with that later on.  I do not think the Government or the Department are tackling that problem as vigorously as they should.  Some steps have been taken to remove that evil from our midst but we are proceeding just at a snail's pace.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies have accused the Land Commission of being slow but in some cases I must say there is justification for that slowness.  A Department dealing with public money voted by this House, has to be careful in the expenditure of that money.  I have known of estates in my part of the country which it took the Land Commission over three years to acquire and I as a new Deputy came into this House and inquired why they were not taken over more expeditiously.  I was a little bit severe on the Land Commission because I discovered afterwards that there was a solid and sound reason for their slowness in dealing with those estates.</P>
    <P>Estates in this country are in a peculiar position.  You have estates where title has to be traced back over several years.  It is a complex problem for the Land Commission to get clear title and the Land Commission will not take land, any more than a private individual will take land, without getting a clear title.  In this respect I believe they are quite right and their slowness can sometimes be attributed to that fact.  However, where I think unjustifiable slowness often occurs is when the lands are acquired.  As I have said, it may take them three years to acquire land.  First of all, the owner of the land objects; secondly, there is the question of price.  The price is fixed but the owner objects and there is appeal after appeal. Finally the land is taken after a period of three years and I say that this is when they begin to slow down.  I often wonder why it is that they do slow down at that particular stage.  I know that in certain cases there are sound reasons for moving cautiously but these cases are very few.  The other cases are in the vast majority.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="502" /> There are cases where the Land Commission buy over an estate, and another estate might be in the offing and convenient to that estate.  I say it would be a foolish thing for the Land Commission to deal with the first estate they have taken over without acquiring the second estate so as to have a comprehensive scheme.  That very often causes justifiable delay but those cases do not arise very frequently.  I know of estates in the hands of the Land Commission for years for no apparent reason.  Whether it is because of lettings for grazing, tillage or some other reason, I do not know.  The Land Commission is not so small that they should hold back land in that connection.  I think it is unfair to the people in the area who are starving for land.</P>
    <P>At this particular time land is fetching a high price.  Some people seem to quarrel with the 1950 Act which gives permission to the Land Commission to go into the open market and buy land. I think that is a good idea.  I see one flaw in it which has been pointed out by Deputies who spoke here, a flaw which can be remedied and which acts more against the seller of the land than against the Land Commission, that is, where the price dispute is taken into court, where the court decides that the price is to be, say, £5,000 or £10,000 and the Land Commission decides it will not touch it. I know a couple of cases where the Land Commission could have bought land and I think this position should be remedied.  We all realise that the Land Commission, dealing with public money, must spend it prudently.  They cannot buy land that costs too much because this may eventually react on the poor unfortunate tenant.  Nevertheless, in these times when land is so dear, I do not think the Land Commission should stagger at a small increase and withdraw from buying land as they have done.</P>
    <P>It has been said here on various occasions that there is scarcely enough land available to bring every holding up to economic level.  However, provision should be made in the congested areas to give some kind of employment and to move people out of the really <Col N="503" /> congested areas.  Even though progress has been slow some good work has been done in those areas as far as the rundale system and the rearrangement of holdings are concerned.</P>
    <P>As regards my county in the eyes of the Land Commission, perhaps in the eyes of Deputies in this House, and of many other people, Roscommon has the name of being a county composed mainly of ranchers.  That is not the case by any means.  Land Commission activity down there has been very marked over a number of years.  I would not like the Land Commission or the members of this House to have the impression that my county is a county of ranchers and that there is no such thing as congestion.  There is very acute congestion there.  In mid-Roscommon you have the economic type of holding, but north, south, east and west you have slum conditions and people are living on land with valuations from 30/- to £3 or £4.</P>
    <P>Very little has been done for Roscommon as far as migration is concerned. I have been pressing for an improvement in conditions there since I first became a member of this House; I have been pleading that these people, living in congested or slum townlands throughout the county, would be taken away, given economic holdings elsewhere, and that the land which they occupy would be given to adjoining holders.  I should like that more attention would be paid to the problems of congestion and migration from these towns.  I think it is absolutely necessary, essential and vital.</P>
    <P>Someone spoke in the course of the debate about the action the Land Commission should take against absentee tenants.  Some Deputies seemed to be rather drastic in their approach to the question of the action the Land Commission should take against people who would leave their farms and emigrate to England or elsewhere in order that they might improve their conditions. To my mind that tenant left due to economic, or should I say, uneconomic circumstances; he left his little farm due to poverty or other reasons.  It <Col N="504" /> was a tragic thing in the first place that such circumstances compelled him to leave his holding because he was forced to try and make a bit of money to enable him to come back later and work his land.  I think some Deputy said that there should be no mercy shown by the Land Commission to such an absentee tenant&mdash;that his land should be acquired forthwith.  I am afraid I cannot agree with that.</P>
    <P>I think that a reasonable length of time should elapse before the Land Commission would take any action so that that man would be given a chance of making good abroad, of saving a little money and of returning and working his land.  I think the Land Commission should be slow to tackle such a holding until a reasonable length of time after the tenant had left.  Of course there is a limit to the time that should be allowed as there is a limit to everything.  If the man does not return within the space of, say, six or seven years, everybody is having a pick out of his farm and is ruining its fertility.  I would say that after a period of five years the Land Commission should give that man notice that the land is not being used and that action will be taken if he does not return and work it.</P>
    <P>Quite a lot has been said here about Land Commission roads; the tradition here has been anything but good. There have been certain improvements during the course of the last few years but up to then the Land Commission had been doing roads in a very lackadaisical style.  They left eyesores in many places.  I have seen Land Commission roads which were made perhaps ten or 12 years ago.  They are nearly impassable now.  There is not even the possibility of cycling over them not to speak of trying to take a car over them.  But, as I have said, within the past few years there have been some improvements.  I must, however, find the Commission guilty where bog roads are concerned.  The Commission have at the moment considerable areas of bog in their hands. They have divided quite large tracts but they have made no provision for access to those bogs; they have made no roads into them.  Though they <Col N="505" /> collect rents from the tenants or occupiers they have made no provision for the easy removal of turf.</P>
    <P>Also in the drainage of those bogs they have been lackadaisical and careless. All these bogs should be handed over to tenants in an approachable and productive condition so that the turf could be cut and the banks approached over a well constructed road.  As regards fencing also I have a few words to say.  I suppose fencing depends to a great extent on the contour and surface of the land, but I would suggest that as far as possible all fencing of Land Commission land should be done by concrete posts and wire.  I think there is a terrible lot of wastage of land through stripping the top-soil off and taking the roots with it for the purpose of erecting clay fences which, anyway, do not withstand time.  I have seen clay fences erected on Land Commission farms in years gone by and they have crumbled away so that now there are no fences. Wherever possible, the commission should put down concrete posts and wire.</P>

      <P>I am glad to know that the Land Commission took my advice. I should like to draw attention, too, to the carelessness of the Land Commission about providing water supplies to farms for domestic use and for live stock.  When allocating farms and houses, the Commission did not make provision for water supplies for either live stock or domestic uses.  I hope an attempt will be made to do that in the near future and that there will be no further need to complain about carelessness or neglect in that regard.  I would go further and suggest that at this stage surely to God provision <Col N="506" /> could be made to provide Land Commission dwellings with sewerage facilities.  I think that is not too much to expect.</P>
      <P>Going still further&mdash;it may be said here that I am going too far&mdash;I would suggest that, in any area developed by the E.S.B., when the Commission are building houses they would have them wired for electric current, even if they were to charge the incoming tenants a little for this service.  It would be much cheaper to have the wiring done when the houses are being constructed, and when it would be easy to wire walls and ceilings, than later on when the houses are completed.</P>
      <P>I do not think there is much more I wish to add about the Land Commission except, perhaps, to refer to a suggestion made during the debate that migrants coming into, say, Meath from Connemara or elsewhere, misuse their land, that they have let their land in conacre and so on.  Perhaps there is an excuse.  I shall make a counter suggestion.  Supposing a poor small farmer from the West of Ireland comes up to Meath.  He has left a farm which had a valuation of £2 or £3 or maybe £4, and finds himself in possession of one which has a valuation of £20.  He brings with him his little bits of furniture, his live stock consisting of a couple of cows and calves, and very little else.  He has very little or probably no money.  He is put into a big house which undoubtedly is a very big change for him.</P>
      <P>That man has not sufficient money to stock his land, and what is he going to do?  I suggest that the Land Commission, in the case of a man like that, should do something in the way of giving him financial assistance to enable him to utilise his land to the best advantage.  If he were given say £300, to be repaid over a number of years, it would be the means of enabling him to put his land to good use.  The Minister shakes his head.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">

    <Speaker pid="JohnBernieJnr" hpid="Mr. Beirne Mr. Beirne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beirne</NameTxt>
      <P>If he got an interest free loan it would enable him to use <Col N="507" /> his land to the best advantage, and he would, therefore, be in a position to repay the loan.  When people talk about a man in that position misusing his land, I suggest that it is really not his fault.  He has not the means to stock the land.  What I am suggesting is that financial aid should be given to him to enable him to make a fresh start.</P>
      <P>I want now to say a word about the officials of the Land Commission, both local and central.  I do not intend to be profuse in my praise, but I should certainly like to say that in my contacts with all the Land Commission officials, local and central, I have received both courtesy and co-operation.  I think they are giving good service to the country.</P>
      <P>I should like to conclude by saying a word about the division of land.  For very many years I have taken an interest in public life, during Fianna Fáil times, inter-Party times and Fine Gael times, and I must say that I have never seen very much political influence used as regards the division of land, particularly since I became a member of the House.  I could not pin point any case where political influence was used in the division of land.  I say that as one who lives in an area where land is being acquired and divided almost every day of the week.  I could never say that anyone had been selected as an allottee for a holding because of his political leanings.  I think that is a good thing.</P>
      <P>We may not all be saints on this side of the House, and I am sure those on the opposite side would not claim that they are all saints either.  You will find good men and bad men in all grades of society.  I should like to pay my tribute to the officials of the Land Commission and to the head of its administration.  Politics, as far as I know, have never entered into the work of the Land Commission.</P>

      <P>My contribution on this Estimate will be very brief.  I am not going to start off by abusing the Land Commission and saying that they should be done away with, or by reminding <Col N="508" /> the Minister or Deputies opposite of speeches which they made on the Estimate for this Department when they sat on this side of the House.  I think that we will have to take the Land Commission as it is and make the best of it.  Neither would there be much use in my saying that the 1950 Land Act was a good Act or a bad Act.  I have no doubt that, when the present Minister introduced it in 1950, he did so with the best intentions in the world, and that it did some good.</P>
      <P>The Minister, I think, is a big enough man to agree with me when I say that the 1950 Act did not do some of the things that were expected of it.  It was said in this House at the time that the Land Commission would go to public auctions and buy land, but they have not done so.  The Act did not achieve the things that were expected of it.  On the other hand, I am afraid that the Act did a lot of damage because it stopped people from putting land up for auction.  They are now resorting to the plan of selling their land privately, and I think the Minister is aware of that&mdash;that farms are being sold privately.</P>

      <P>I maintain that is being done for the reason I have given. I know of cases where people were approached and their answer was: &ldquo;Well, if we put the land up for auction the Land Commission will come in and acquire it.&rdquo;  As the Minister knows, the Land Commission are, first of all, very slow in taking over land and slower still in paying for it.  I know farms of land which were taken over more than ten years ago and the people who owned them have not yet been paid.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The money is in the hands of the public trustee, and they can claim it any time they prove their <Col N="509" /> title to it.  The Land Commission have parted with the money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EugeneGilbride" hpid="Mr. Gilbride Mr. Gilbride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilbride</NameTxt>
      <P>I had occasion to go to the Minister, and I find that there is great difficulty about this.  I am not blaming anyone, but I am pointing out what is happening.  Probably there are faults on both sides, or it maybe a question of lawyers keeping this thing hanging on.  The fact remains that farms were taken over a number of years ago and the owners of them are still without their money.  That is something that should not happen.  If the Minister feels that this is something which needs correction he should have no hesitation in bringing in legislation to amend the 1950 Act.</P>
      <P>I want to endorse what Deputy Bartley said last night, that in the congested areas, where a farm of land is for sale or where it is known that it is going to be disposed of, the Land Commission should have no hesitation in going in and taking it for the relief of congestion.  I said that here years ago and I now say it again.  I repeat what Deputy Bartley said, that the Land Commission should have no hesitation in going in and taking that farm of land at a fair price.  There is machinery available for the fixing of the price by arbitration.</P>
      <P>In view of what was said when the 1950 Land Act was going through this House, it was thought that the commissioners would go in and buy land at the public auctions.  On different occasions, when farms were put up for sale, I approached the inspectors in the area and asked them if they were prepared to go in and bid on these farms.  They told me that they had no power to do so, except in the case of a rearrangement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Rearrangement and migration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EugeneGilbride" hpid="Mr. Gilbride Mr. Gilbride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilbride</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, I say that the 1950 Act did not fulfil the expectations that were held out at the time in regard to it.  We were told here that the effect of it would be to relieve congestion in no time and that power was being given to the Commissioners to go out and buy land at public auctions.  We now find that their <Col N="510" /> power is limited in that respect to land which is required for rearrangement and migration.  We have had that admission from the Minister himself.</P>
      <P>In view of the fact that so very few farms have been bought at public auctions, would the Minister not consider that some change is necessary in the existing legislation?  The Minister should not take it that I am finding fault with him.  I know that the 1950 Act was brought in with the best intentions in the world but I believe that a change is now required to enable the Land Commission to take land when it becomes available.</P>
      <P>I believe that, if a fair-sized farm of land is required for the purpose of relieving four or five small farmers, it would be less of a hardship to put out the owner of it than it would be to take over the land belonging to these small farmers.  I heard the Parliamentary Secretary saying a few minutes ago that it costs between £3,000 and £4,000 to send a migrant. It would not cost anything like that to buy a farm of land and accommodate four or five congests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Parliamentary Secretary said was that it would take £2,400.  He was correcting another Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EugeneGilbride" hpid="Mr. Gilbride Mr. Gilbride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilbride</NameTxt>
      <P>Even £2,400.  It would not take that amount to move half a dozen congests.  Another difficulty I find in dealing with the Land Commission is that their idea about farms is different from that in the West.  I heard Deputy Giles saying that he would not live in the West owing to the conditions. He is making an awful mistake.  These people in the West can live quite happily on their small holdings, and an addition of three, four, five or six acres would mean a terrible lot.  They may not be able to go to Harold's Cross and put £5 on a dog, or own a swanky car in which to run around the country.  They live good Christian lives, and I think the more of them who are put on created holdings the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another argument which I have heard put forward here is that some of the migrants from the West do not <Col N="511" /> make a good turn-out.  I think the percentage is very small.  How can Land Commissioners foretell that such people will not make good?  I do not think that the Land Commission should be accountable for such a small percentage of failures, men who get good farms, make good profits, but squander them.  This talk about failures is, in my opinion, a lot of nonsense.</P>
    <P>Deputy Beirne spoke about title.  I think the Minister should have no hesitation in passing an Act in regard to this matter.  Where the title is not clear something should be done to short-circuit all this legal work in taking over farms.  I think there should be no difficulty in doing that. I know of cases where the Land Commission, after examining farms, held on from year to year.  Nothing was done, and the excuse was that they could not get title.  I think the Minister should see that something is done to short-circuit this kind of trouble.</P>
    <P>I know, in my county, fairly large farms were offered to the Land Commission, but were not taken.  One case, in particular, was not very far from Sligo.  A fairly large farm was actually being thrown at the Land Commission, and I do not see any reason why they did not take it.  The local inspector says that he has recommended it should be taken, but that he cannot get sanction from Dublin.  I do not know where the blame lies.  There is a fairly substantial house on it, but that should not stand in the way.  There is a congested area near enough to that farm, from which men could be transferred. This would prevent migrants being sent to Meath.</P>
    <P>There is another estate nine or ten miles from Sligo.  It, also, was offered to the Land Commission for years, and no effort was made to take it over. There is yet another estate of which I know.  Half of it was taken over, and the other half left.  When land of this description is being given freely, I do not see why there should be hesitation in taking it.  I think it would be a better policy to take these farms, and not bother about the smaller <Col N="512" /> patches.  This is a policy I cannot understand, and the Minister should do something about it.  The taking over of these farms would relieve a lot of congestion in the county, and, as I have said, would stop people crying, asking to be taken to Meath.</P>
    <P>Any small farmer would sooner get land in his own county than be migrated.  I know that, because I learn that the Land Commission has great difficulty in getting people to migrate. This is, I suppose, a natural inclination. No one wants to go far away from where he was reared.  There is nothing wrong in seeking to get back to those estates in the Midlands from which people's forefathers were evicted.  There is a different outlook now from what it used to be some years ago.  I know that a lot of those migrants from the West have made good.  Deputy Beirne pointed out the improvements they made in the Midlands. I am glad that people are beginning to realise that migration from the West has been a help to them.  It is about time they did realise it.</P>
    <P>I should like to impress upon the Minister that, where a farm in a congested area is offered for sale, there should be no hesitation in acquiring it. I think the Minister should use any power he has, or acquire more powers, if they are necessary, in order to do that.  Quite often, a farm is put up for sale, and someone buys it privately. That finishes the matter.  These farms should be taken over to relieve congestion, and the cost should not be detrimental to doing so.  If it costs £2,400 to move a migrant into Meath, it will not cost £2,400 to improve a small farm. In my opinion half a dozen small farms could be improved at that price.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to look into the 1950 Act.  If it does not give him enough power, I think he should scrap it, and bring in a Bill which would give him more power.  I think he would have the support of the whole House if he did so.  It is the only way. No hardship is being inflicted on anyone in doing that.  The big farms should be taken over when offered, and it would stop this running after the small patches.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to the various speakers in this debate, including a fair proportion of representatives from the West.  One of the things common to every speaker representing the congested districts in the West was that, in the main, criticism seemed to be directed against the mechanics of land acquisition and land division.  But nobody tried to analyse the problem of congestion itself.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance anticipated that the solution was at hand or would be found in the foreseeable future.  I would remind the Parliamentary Secretary and others that their hopes of an early solution can be measured by one yardstick; that is, by the progress that has been made in the acquisition of land and the progress that has been made in solving this problem over the last 30 years.  As far as I am aware, the surface of the problem has only been scratched; and taking into consideration the amount of land available, I cannot see that the problem of congestion in the West will reach any-think like a reasonable solution.</P>
      <P>I was amused last night when listening to Deputy Giles.  There was a complete change of front.  Remembering debates in this House in the past, Deputy Giles springs to memory as one of those who tried in the shadow of Sergeant Custume to prevent the on-rush of migrants from the West to County Meath.  Now that a <i>via media</i> has been arranged he is in the happy position of being able to receive the migrants from the West with open arms and a warm embrace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Long before I became a member of this House I thought over this problem. I have studied the formation of the Land Commission and its history over the years.  It is somewhat regrettable that land re-settlement has been motivated by what one might describe as the terrible wail from the West.  I do not think that is a good approach.  In every county and in every constituency there are a considerable number of uneconomic holdings.  We have them on the slopes of the Galtees, on the Knockmealdowns, the Nagle and the Comeraghs; we have there people living in a more acute state of congestion <Col N="514" /> than most of the people in the West&mdash;people from whom and on whose behalf we never hear a word spoken. The reason, of course, is that the pattern of agriculture there is very different from the pattern of agriculture in the West.  There one has an intensive form of agriculture while in the West one finds what might be legitimately described as an extensive pattern.</P>
    <P>One of the greatest tragedies of the last 30 years is the fact that the West rejected the co-operative system.  In the West the dairy herds are small.  There are no creameries.  There is no market for liquid milk.  The smallholders there utilise as much milk as they can themselves and suckle a few calves on the remainder.</P>

      <P>I am speaking now of the basis of their economy.  That is the type of economy that one might describe as the intensive pattern.  As I said on the debate on the Vote for the Department of Agriculture, a reasonable figure for land per acre under grazing is £18; a reasonable figure for land under dairying is £33, or thereabouts.  One can see from that the considerable difference that exists. You have then the tragic and ludicrous off-shoot from that system, the ranching of 50 acres of land; and there has been a side-throw from that too.  The province of Connacht contains by far the biggest number of cattle jobbers, or cattle dealers, if you like; that is a side-throw of the particular system operated there.  There is no capital investment required; all one needs is an ash plant, the open road, and take your chance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>I said earlier that the pool of land available is limited.  In nearly every county there are uneconomic holders.  Even when all the land is exhausted there will still be this problem of congestion in the West. There will still be the uneconomic holders.  We have 62 per cent. of all the farms in Connacht under 30 acres and I think something like 60 per cent. of the farms of Ireland slide down the scale from 50 statute acres.  We have in that picture a disproportionate number of small holdings; we have holdings so small that on the present pattern of our agricultural economics they are uneconomic.  The creation of a further addition to those small holdings will only render the position more acute because the farmer's son or daughter who remains on the land is apt to measure the return for his or her labour in comparison with the return for his or her brother or sister in the factory town.</P>
      <P>I have always maintained that a farm to be economic in the rather static pattern of our set-up should be about 50 or 60 acres, and the creation of holdings by the Land Commission of 25 or 30 acres is not a solution.  It is really creating another problem.  These small holdings form the basis for more and increased social services.  We have this peculiar pattern here of the Land Commission creating 400 or 500 holdings every year while at the same time we have the natural consolidation of small holdings at between two and three times that rate, so that we have one Department of State creating at one end, and then we have the pattern of our economic set-up eliminating three times that number at the other end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="516" /> I have said many times, and I think I have said before in this House, that migration and land division will not solve the problem of congestion in the West.  It needs something more.  If we could only decentralise the hive of industry around Dublin and bring some of it out to the West&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If we had in the rest of Ireland afforestation and industries developed based on timber I think it would go much further to solve the problem of congestion and to rid us of the rural slums in the West.</P>
      <P>All over the country some impression has been made on the reclamation of bogs but nothing whatever has been done to reclaim the marginal lands.  If any impression were made on the reclamation of marginal land we could add considerably to the pool of land available for distribution to uneconomic holders.  In my constituency, on the road to Cork, in the vicinity of Kilworth Camp, a considerable amount of land was acquired and utilised in the old days by the British as a shooting range.  That has been under the control of the Department of Defence, I think, for a number of years.</P>

      <P>Considerable tracts of land are being acquired in some areas for forestry and there is a certain danger there.  I had a complaint recently, which I forwarded to the Land <Col N="517" /> Commission, where portion of the land acquired was land which one would describe as marginal.  There is the danger that land of that type would be absorbed for forestry purposes when it could be reclaimed and divided among smallholders or small land owners on the small farms adjoining.</P>
      <P>Recently, I was approached in connection with a very large parcel of land and it was pointed out that almost 200 acres of that land were land which was at one time farmed successfully. There was a danger that this big tract of land would be acquired and that the whole parcel would go under forest plantation.  I would remind the Minister that it would be a pity to use for forests land which could be reclaimed and put to some use as agricultural land when we have such a considerable quantity of land on our foothills and well up the hills that can still be used usefully for forestry purposes.</P>
      <P>I think there is a considerable tendency to acquire farms which are of an economic size and to carve them up. There is that temptation.  We have too many small holdings and the multiplication of small holdings is a very undesirable thing to my mind.  Recently, not far from where I live, a farm of something over 90 acres was offered for sale and in that particular area there were dozens of sons of small farmers who had capital and wanted a farm.  After considerable persuasion the Land Commission was compelled to loosen its grip on this particular farm and the farm was sold and was purchased for something like £4,000.  There was no very big case there for the division of the land among uneconomic holders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have often wondered whether from the point of view of the proper utilisation of land the congest is the best type of farmer.  In the southern counties where we have a tradition of mixed and intensive farming we have considerable emigration of sons of small farmers and I think many of these people who have served their apprenticeship to a type of farming which would considerably increase our agricultural output should be considered <Col N="518" /> from the point of view of their training and their efficiency as farmers.</P>
    <P>In my area, too, there is a considerable acreage of land which heretofore could not be touched and could not be acquired but under a recent Act the Minister has power to acquire that land.  I refer to the Moore Park estate where there is something in the region of 1,000 acres.  I should like to know if the Department has any plans for dealing with that land.  There are also some 2,000 acres or more on what used to be the old shooting range nearby.  On the fringe of that area, there are quite a number of smallholders living in the foothills and I think that, in the present pattern of our set-up, the necessity to utilise that enormous stretch of land as a training ground for soldiers no longer arises and the Minister should examine the possibilities of that very big tract of land in the Kilworth Camp and Moore Park areas.</P>

      <P>This is the only opportunity which those of us who have an interest in the acquisition and distribution of land get in the year to discuss the question of land division. Having listened carefully to speakers on both sides, I feel that the debate has centred around the merits or demerits of the 1950 Land Act. Speakers on both sides set out to condemn it and I think that they were rather unfair in their judgment.  When that Act went through the House piloted by the present Minister, there was a full and free discussion and the Act finally got the full imprimatur and blessing of the Oireachtas.  Those of us who are interested in land acquisition and division thought that, after some 30 years of native Government, we had found a solution of this very vexed problem.  In Section 27, all the goodness of that Act lay, but we now discover that that section&mdash;possibly not through the Minister's fault&mdash;is not getting the implementation which all sides thought it would get.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section gives the Land Commission power to give what is described as the market value for land. We have had many cases where land was not voluntarily surrendered and <Col N="519" /> where the Land Commission used its machinery to acquire land because of congestion in the area and because there was a <i>prima facie</i> case for its acquisition and division.  The matter of price went along the chain of command until it finally reached the price fixation tribunal and therein we find the snag in that section, which we all welcomed.  If, in the opinion of the Land Commission, the price decided on by that tribunal is too high, the Land Commission have power to refuse to acquire the land in question.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not in the 1950 Act&mdash;it is in the 1927 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesJCollins" hpid="Mr. J.J. Collins Mr. J.J. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.J. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Did you make any provision in the 1950 Act to remedy that defect?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>No; we did not touch that section at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesJCollins" hpid="Mr. J.J. Collins Mr. J.J. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.J. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact remains that the acquisition of land, no matter under what section or Act of Parliament it is undertaken, is seriously retarded when there is vested in the Land Commission the power to refuse land after a price has been fixed by the price fixing tribunal, whereas the vendor or owner who is contesting the price issue has no appeal whatever. That matter should be remedied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was really surprised when the Minister, when my colleague, Deputy Ó Briain, made a point with regard to it, more or less gave the commissioners his approval in the exercise of that power and said that the allottees might object to the price or to the fixing of the annuities thereafter placed on them.  That is not the case because there is such a demand for land, both by people who till land and who dairy land, that allottees will never grumble about whatever price is fixed by the Land Commission in respect of any parcel of land being handed out to them.  If that is the only excuse which can be made by the Minister to shelter the Land Commission, I think it should be exploded.  In County Limerick, we have people taking land for dairying purposes and <Col N="520" /> for tillage purposes, and no matter what price the Land Commission pay for land they acquire and no matter what price is levied on the successful allottees, it would be far less than the current market price which the people I mentioned are paying for land at present.  If he has not got the power already, I should like the Minister to take that power and remove from the Land Commission the right they have at the moment in that regard.</P>
    <P>A lot has been said more in criticism than in favour of the officials of the Land Commission, both in rural areas and in central offices.  The officials both in central offices and in rural areas are just part of the machine. They are as the machine has made them and if they have been subjected, as they have been, to great criticism in relation to their work, to my mind, it is due to the machine in operation at the moment&mdash;the obsolete machine, as we might describe it.</P>
    <P>I have listened to speakers blaming the officials in connection with the division of land.  The position is that these officials have their instructions set out and declared by the Land Commission, and, if a particular farm is to be acquired in any part of the country, they work to a prescribed plan and to conditions laid down for them. When the lands have been properly transferred, they take an area of half a mile and sometimes more, and they get together the people working farms nearest to the economic unit or ceiling. That has always been the practice of the Land Commission and no matter what Government is in power, they adhere rigidly and fairly to it.  They find out the number of people who are described as being nearest to the economic area and they make them economic.</P>
    <P>That is a good principle and it is sound in every respect.  They move down the list, if they have sufficient land, and take any man that might be on the three-quarter or half-way line and if they have the land they try also to fit in people who might be described as having almost an economic holding.</P>
    <P>I thoroughly disagree with Deputy O'Leary's wild statements that there is <Col N="521" /> political pull, intrigue and patronage in the division of land.  I have in mind some farms in County Limerick which were acquired by the Land Commission under a Government other than a Fianna Fáil Government.  I must say, in fairness to the officials in charge of the division of the estates I have in mind, that their division and allocation was beyond question and beyond reproach.  They worked strictly in accordance with the regulations, without fear or favour.  They did not mind whether the successor allottees were supporters of Fianna Fáil or otherwise.  They acted fairly and above board.  I think credit must be given where credit is due and I am glad to pay that tribute to those men. They have been criticised and it has been said that their progress has been a slow crawling type of progress.</P>
    <P>You cannot blame the Land Commission officials if the machinery has become obsolete.  Give them more powers so as to enable them to move at a faster pace.  If we find in 1955 a different situation confronting us from that which confronted this House in 1933 in relation to the acquisition and division of land, then is it not time for us to effect a change?  If the present method is outworn and needs to be revived and rejuvenated, why not give the powers to enable the officials of the Land Commission to get on with their work?</P>
    <P>I mentioned the type of allottee who is generally given first consideration. He is the type of farmer living within a half-mile radius of the farm that is considered nearest the economic unit. However, I want to mention the cottiers who are to be found living very close to estates which are acquired and divided.  I have always had and always will have great admiration for the rural cottiers of Ireland.  I heard it said a while ago that that section of our community deserves well of our people and of our Government&mdash;and rightly so.  In every fight since the days of the Land League the cottier has been in the forefront.</P>
    <P>As one who had experience during the Black and Tan war, I wish to say by way of tribute, that in West Limerick we never found them wanting <Col N="522" /> whenever we needed their help or co-operation. We got our freedom in 1922 and no matter what Land Acts were brought into operation by this Oireachtas the cottiers were always relegated to the end of the queue.  They came in just when all other interests were served and were fitted in.  It has been said against them, by way of criticism and in justification of the treatment that has been meted out to them, that they did not own their little homes, that they were under contract to the local authority for the one acre, ten perches and that, because they were not owner-occupiers, they did not fit into the ambit of the scheme operated by the Land Commission.  If the Minister can, without legislation, give the Land Commission the powers they may need to embrace and incorporate that section of our people into land division schemes in the future, he should do it.</P>
    <P>There is another class of cottier whom I should like to mention.  As a result of legislation enacted by this Oireachtas, we have given our cottiers the emancipation the small farmers got from the agitation started by Davitt. They now have the power of purchasing their little homes from the local authority over a terminable period at a reduced annuity.  I do not think that when the 1933 Act was framed we had legislation enacted at the time to give those people the advantages which, thank God, they have to-day.  I should like the Minister to tell us the position from the Land Commission point of view the status of that type of cottier who adjoins any particular estate or resides within the prescribed distance therefrom.  What is his status and what are his chances of qualifying in the future for a parcel of land on that adjoining estate?</P>
    <P>I was reading through some of the speeches made on the debate on the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture. I am glad that Deputy Giles is in the House now because I want to refer to the speech he made on that Estimate.  I read something running through every bit of that speech which I very much admire&mdash;with one exception. He said that it would be well if we could get back again to the days <Col N="523" /> when our cottiers were satisfied, well-housed and well-circumstanced with their little flock of poultry, their pig or two in the byre and their cow on the long acre.  He said there was grazing on the road-side.  I do not think he actually meant that.  In all the tributes that from my heart I should like to pay the cottier, I hope the day of asking him to have his cow on the long acre will never come again in this country.  When and wherever we have the holdings to requisition and divide, I hope the cow of the cottier will be as nobly and as proudly inside the demesne walls as, in other days, were the cows of the man who owned the demesne.  In the old days, the cottier's cows had to roam along the road-side on what might be described as &ldquo;the long acre&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It was also said in the course of this debate that the Minister should consider men who are living in cottages and who require land for dairy purposes. We have a number of such cottiers in County Limerick and we also have a number of people who, although not engaged in the dairying business, take lands in conacre and have proved themselves a success. They are not the type of person who came over here from Britain and took thousands of acres of land for the purpose of growing wheat and cashing in on it, if they could.  The people I have in mind are cottiers and their sons in County Limerick who, year after year, go out and take ten, 12 or maybe 15 acres of land for tillage.  Over the years, they have worked it very satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>I have figures here which I shall give to the Minister to prove that the bulk of the wheat growing in County Limerick has been as a result of the efforts of the type of person I have mentioned. I think that where the Land Commission officials can very carefully check up on the <i>bona fides</i> of those people over a number of years and have found them successful in that type of husbandry they should also be considered. It is very unfair that they should be simply cast aside and that we should stick, as I have said, rigidly to conditions and qualifications laid <Col N="524" /> down possibly 20 years ago in this Parliament.</P>
    <P>There is another point I would like to make.  I was really more than surprised when I read Deputy McQuillan's speech and therein discovered that in his analysis of the figures for the Land Commission the sum of £600,000 odd, including expenses, went in the way of salaries and wages and that all that was left with the Minister for Finance for the purchase and division of land in the present financial year was the sum of £400,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.J. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I was listening subsequently to Deputy Donnellan, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, and he quoted a figure which did not agree with the figure that Deputy McQuillan gave here last night.  In order to satisfy myself I checked up the figures and I find that the figures given here by Deputy McQuillan are absolutely correct and those given by Deputy Donnellan, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, are in the main incorrect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>What figure is the Deputy talking about?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesJCollins" hpid="Mr. J.J. Collins Mr. J.J. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.J. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about the figures quoted by Deputy McQuillan when he stated that £600,000 odd, including salaries and expenses, will find its way to the officials of the Land Commission, leaving only to the Minister for Lands the very small sum of £400,000 to pay for land he might purchase and acquire in the coming financial year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesJCollins" hpid="Mr. J.J. Collins Mr. J.J. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.J. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Donnellan took the item from the Book of Estimates a while ago and went on to say that the figures he took were figures that were earmarked by the Minister's Department this year for the acquisition of land.  In my check up of that particular figure I find that it is a figure of book-keeping where you have on the one side a credit and on the other a debit side and a balancing of <Col N="525" /> what is known as refund or resettlement of the amount of moneys our farmers are getting by way of the reduced annuity.  I am not the financial wizard of this Party as regards those figures. I have just what you may call an ordinary common-sense grasp of what I see there.</P>
      <P>Figures are most factual things and completely demonstrate themselves. They can speak for themselves.  If Deputy McQuillan was wrong in the figure he quoted and if I, supporting his view, am taking an incorrect view, and the Minister says to me that he was definitely wrong, I would like to ask the Minister here and now, or if not now, when he is concluding, if he will give me the figures.</P>

      <P>If that is the case, if Deputy McQuillan is incorrect, it is time for us here to be either praising, attacking or defending the Minister on the pros and cons and the merits or demerits of the 1950 Land Act, if he has not got from the Minister for Finance in the present financial year sufficient moneys to carry on the programme of land acquisition and division that all Parties and all sections of this House would like to see the Minister carrying on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are one or two other points I would like to make before I conclude. One of them is to draw the attention of the Minister to one very important factor I see operating in some areas. I would like to know from the Minister what co-operation, if any, there is between the Department of Lands and the Department of Forestry. When the Minister introduces the Estimate for Forestry, I would like to say something on that too; I know that I cannot hope to go into the particular issue in this debate, but that I am in order in asking the Minister if there has been or is a possibility that <Col N="526" /> there will be any sort of co-operation between the Forestry Department and the Land Commission in dealing with people who surrendered their land for forestry purposes not for the cash value which is miserable.  We are all talking about forestry in this Parliament for so many years that we should be almost ashamed to mention it.  I would ask the Minister if there is an arrangement whereby a family that would surrender good mountain grazing for forestry purposes could come in within the category of migrants to be given holdings in good land.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>That is, now, to migrate a farmer with good land and take up a holding and plant it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesJCollins" hpid="Mr. J.J. Collins Mr. J.J. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.J. Collins</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.J. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>What is wrong with that for a policy?  If a farmer living in good mountainy land with 200 or 300 acres of mountain grazing as sound as the grazing you could find in the Burren in County Clare surrenders that to the Forestry Department for forestry purposes, when he has finished with the redemption value, etc., the legal expenses on both sides and possibly the ceiling about £4 9s. an acre, where does he find himself at the end?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that those people who have been trained in the profession&mdash;and I call it a profession&mdash;of farming would be better serviced and would be a better asset to the nation if you took them off the mountainy farms that were suitable for planting purposes and placed them in a farm where you have land to divide.  The Minister may be right.  It may be a foolish suggestion <Col N="527" /> on my part, but I believe that it is right.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.J. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The extraordinary thing about it is that we have very few next men.  I think it should be something that should be considered very favourably indeed by the Minister's Department.  I would like to qualify my suggestion, that it should be adopted where you have the immediate local congestion satisfied and surplus land available.  Then I think those people are entitled to be accommodated and placed.</P>
      <P>I have heard an awful lot of talk concentrating on everything west of the Shannon, the terrible amount of congestion you have in Mayo, in Galway, Donegal and so forth.  But I have statistics here which when I looked into them really surprised me.  Some people have a very mistaken idea about the County Limerick, for instance. They tell you it is a land flowing with milk and honey and that when you go out in the morning into the dew you will find the butter on the grass.</P>
      <P>There may be something in that, but I have here the statistics issued from the Statistics Office which show that in County Limerick we have 10,093 people living in farms of under 30 acres.  We have 5,737 between 30 and 100 acres, and we have 149 of 100 acres and over.  It is interesting and illuminating to compare the Limerick figure with that for Kerry.  In Kerry you have: under 30 acres, 11,617; 30 acres to 100 acres, 8,051; and over 100 acres, 1,738.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">

      <P>Numerically you can divide the whole number into the total and find the mean average.  The Kerry county valuation is £467,302.  We will go to Mayo now, to the Minister's native county.  Great emphasis has always been laid on Mayo.  You have there: under 30 acres, 23,682.  Mind you, the valuation of Mayo is surprising &mdash;the total is £375,639.  Compare Mayo with Limerick and Limerick with Kerry and vice versa.  In a county like Limerick, it might be surprising to the Minister to hear we have so many people there farming holdings to the tune of 10,000 odd, under 30 acres&mdash; which might be described as uneconomic holdings.</P>

      <P>We have in the hands of the Land Commission in County Limerick three estates that have been finally cleared and where everything is in order to work in a scheme.  They are the Donovan estate at Cooltoman, the O'Grady estate at Meanus and the Watson estate at Ballyagran.  The lands in question are fully in the hands of the Land Commission and have been let for the coming financial year, both in grazing and in conacre.  Someone said a while ago that the inspectors are back-pedalling, taking this easy and not going ahead with the work.  I would like to ask that for the estates in question, the <Col N="529" /> schemes be taken up as quickly as possible and the land allocated to those qualified to receive it.</P>
      <P>There is a belt of land between Athlacca and Kilmallock &mdash; you could describe it as a desert in itself.  I could not tell you how many farms there are in it, but it is a pretty large pocket. It is locally described as the grass ranching centre of West Limerick.  I do not know why the Land Commission have not fixed their attention on this area.  There are several uneconomic holders living in or about the farms in that area.  If we have not enough uneconomic holders, landless men or cottiers&mdash;who are still tenants of the local authority&mdash;we will welcome into that part of West Limerick migrants from any part of Ireland, and preferably from the Gaeltacht areas.</P>
      <P>The one thing I always admire about the migration system is that as many Irish speakers as possible should be fixed on the lands in Meath and Limerick if and when we have good land ready for them.  The one thing we should do is to facilitate those people as much as possible.  There is an area in West Limerick at the moment&mdash;the Lewis estate in Bally-longford, Adare&mdash;and for a year and a half there were a house idle there and 60 acres of land.  I was very pleased when recently I was informed that from the heart of the Kerry Gaeltacht a native speaking family was brought along and fitted in there.  It was something unique and outstanding and something that we all as Irishmen felt proud of, when that little family arrived in Adare and went round to the various shops and asked for their messages in the Gaelic tongue.  I am going to say this much on behalf of the people, some of them unsuccessful applicants, that they were very pleased and proud when they learned that an Irish-speaking family had been brought into the area.</P>

    <P>As regards this big pocket of land lying derelict and earmarked for grazing, in the Athlacca area, we can say clearly that, after the uneconomic holders, the landless and the cottiers, we will welcome into that part of West Limerick more Irish-speaking families from Mayo or Kerry.  I would ask the <Col N="530" /> Minister to draw this case to the attention of the Land Commission for further investigation and inquiry.</P>
    <P>There is one type of applicant in particular, that might not have been mentioned here before, that is the cottier living within the prescribed area from the estate in question, who has purchased his little home.  Even though he has only one acre and ten perches, he feels as proud and as independent as the four-cow, five-cow, or 10-cow farmer, the farmer we have in the western portion of Limerick or that the Minister may find in his native Mayo.  These people should be given the opportunity of getting the same treatment, as free men and free women in a free country, as any other type of people who earn their livelihood in the prescribed way on a parcel of land, be it 100 acres or the one acre that I mentioned.</P>

      <P>I may be a bit different from a lot of Deputies who have spoken in the last few days.  As far as I can see, they are all out for dividing more land.  I wish to give a warning to the Minister and to the Government not to go too fast with that.  What is the backbone of our country?  Is it not the cattle trade and the cattle exports?  What else have we to live on, what has the man in the town or the city to live on?  Everything flows from our exports of cattle.  I was speaking to a man to-day in the city; he says a friend of his bought a farm of 80 acres and found he could not make it pay, as it was not economic. Is not that strange&mdash;80 acres not economic?  Yet the majority of Deputies are pushing to get all the land of Ireland divided into farms of 30 or 35 acres.  As a person reared on the land, reared in the heart of Westmeath, I warn the Government about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we divide our land into holdings of 30 acres and 35 acres we will develop into a country of small farmers. We are trying to industrialise the country.  We will be living on industry and small farms and no one will be able to get a living.  We must remember that the finances to run this country are obtained from our exports <Col N="531" /> and the only thing we export which accumulates big round figures of pounds, shillings and pence is cattle. All the speeches we have heard over the last two or three days have been to the effect that more land should be divided and more migrants should be brought up to Westmeath, Meath, Kildare and the Midlands generally, which is the heart and the backbone of that export trade.</P>

      <P>Is that not on record?  I am not against cottiers getting land but a man cannot be a labouring man and a farmer.  That is not common sense.  We do not want the people of Mayo coming up to Westmeath and Meath.  If there is land being divided in Meath or Westmeath we want our own small farmers to get it.  We have in Westmeath 6,000 or 7,000 small-holders, under five or ten acres.  We want those to get part of the land in Meath or Westmeath when it is being divided.  The Land Commission should do more in regard to the rearrangement of holdings.  I know certain cases in my county where a man has perhaps 30 acres of land, five acres here, six acres there and ten acres somewhere else.  The Land Commission will not rearrange holdings to remedy that position.  They give a couple of local people a bit of an estate and then they land up a big colony from Mayo.  I do <Col N="532" /> not think the Government should make a present of a farm worth a couple of thousand pounds to a man who is able to go into the local town and pay several hundred pounds for a tractor, all in notes.  Although a man getting land should have a certain amount of money we must remember that it is State money that is involved here and that it should be spent to the best advantage.</P>
      <P>Another thing for which the Land Commission is responsible is that a farmer with 20, 30 or 40 acres of land and who has three or four very good sons, cannot get land for them.  I know a case in County Kildare where a farmer had three sons; he went and bought 40 acres of an estate beside him for one of his sons and the Land Commission would not sanction it.  The small farmer with 40 or 50 acres has not a ghost of a chance of providing for his sons.  He has only enough for one son and the others must emigrate.</P>
      <P>We all agree that many estates should be divided, those composed of 1,000, 700 and 600 acres, but in the Midlands, which is the backbone of the cattle trade, 100 to 150 acres are essential from the economic point of view.  The Land Commission went to a friend of mine not far away.  He is a hard-working man with 110 acres.  One of his nephews is working with him. That man never goes anywhere.  He spends most of his time working on the land which is evident from the black lines on his hands and the condition of his nails which are worn down to the fingers.</P>

      <P>It was said long ago: &ldquo;The road for the bullock and the land for the people.&rdquo;  Fianna Fáil were in office for 19 years and now it is the road for the people.  That is the result of their policy.  If we pursue the policy further by dividing up estates into farms of 30 and 35 acres it will mean the road for more of the people and the land for the bullock. If a farm is put up for sale now containing 50 or 60 acres and there is local agitation, the Land Commission go down and buy it up and the poor farmer with three sons has not a hope of getting it.</P>

      <P>It has arisen here and I should like to relate it to this Estimate as the Deputy before me has done.  He said that the division of land in this country was going ahead too rapidly.  Has anybody with any savvy at all the same view?  Is not the complaint of all of us that the Land Commission are going ahead too slowly? I am straining charity to the utmost limit when I say that and yet we have somebody saying here that the land is being divided too quickly.  If there was a good reason given to back that up I would not mind but the suggestion is that we are dividing our land into farms which are too small.  That was the advocacy we heard in this House from one Deputy and from one Deputy only, thanks be to God.  And thanks be to God we have got a Minister who at least has not got the views of that Deputy, who understands that 20 or 30 acres of good land are well worth having in this country.  Talking about not being able to live on 100 or 150 acres!  That much land would not do because he wants grass and more grass and large bullocks and the dog.  He says: &ldquo;Do not be like the Danes; do not be slaves&rdquo;.  In other words, do not work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Fagan apparently has very little idea of work if he wants 200 acres of land to walk around looking at his bullocks with a dog on his heels.  He says that is what we depend on in this country, that everything hinges on whether we export bullocks fattened in the heart of the country in Westmeath.  Apparently nothing is done in any other part of the country.  Let us have greater sized farms, do not bring in any outsiders, do not divide up the big ranches, do not make slaves of all the people by dividing the land into small farms. When, I wonder, has it been advocated that the land should be divided into small farms?  I have never heard it from anybody.  What has the Land <Col N="535" /> Commission been doing over the years but endeavouring to relieve congestion by bringing up uneconomic holdings to a size where they could be regarded as economic and sufficient to support a man, his wife and his family?</P>
      <P>Deputy Fagan laments the fact that we all may become small farmers. What a calamity, what an utter disgrace and downfall it would be for him to become a small farmer.  I should like to tell the Deputy that the small farmers have been and still are the backbone of this country.  No matter where he comes from he should never forget they are the people who make this country's economy.  What he wants is to live for nothing, to look down and talk down on the small farmers.</P>
      <P>It is a pity that there are not more people capable of becoming small farmers. If there were we would have a much better economy and it would be much better for the country.  It was said that the small farmers would take everything out and leave nothing for anybody else, that the best land in the country should be reserved for a few and that everybody else should keep their hands off it.  Do not let the Land Commission divide it up or they will ruin the country.  We also had the statement that a man cannot be a labourer and a farmer as well.  This all ties up with the further assertion that the farmer, as Deputy Fagan regards him, is a gentleman who does nothing, a gentleman of leisure, reaping the milk and the honey of the land at no expense to himself and without any loss of sweat.</P>
      <P>I assert that the man who is not a labourer is not a farmer because he does not know what he is doing if he cannot do it himself.  There is then the assertion that only a man with money should get the land.  Imagine that.  The Deputy says that and I wrote it down as he said it and I can read my own writing.  He said that we should not be giving free money and that we should not be spending £2,000 or £3,000 on those people.</P>

He made another statement to the effect that the Deputy from this side who spoke immediately before him, because he was advocating the giving of land to cottiers, was talking politics before an election. But what is it but politics for Deputy Fagan to come along and advocate that the land should be kept for the little group around him so that he would be returned here at the next opportunity.  If those are the views of Deputy Fagan, and I hope they are not, I sincerely hope they are not also the views of the Party he represents and belongs to.  God help the country if we should have a group as big as Fine Gael are at the moment represented by such views.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister whether he agrees that, in certain sections of this Bill, there are reasonable grounds for suggesting that there should be some amendment of them.  Take, for instance, Section 1. The increase in the weekly payments to a maximum of £4 10s. od. cannot be questioned except on the basis of probably increased cost to employers. It is likely that will have a very substantial bearing on the present £2 10s. od. with allowances to a wife and children.  What I mean is that nobody is objecting to a substantial increase, but at least we should know <Col N="538" /> what the impact of that increase is going to be on the employer&mdash;to the extent of what the increased insurance premium will be to him.</P>
      <P>I do not know to what extent the Minister has been given any information or estimates, but I think that he might tell the House what he thinks the result will be.  We hear great criticism every other day of manufacturers and employers increasing the charges for their goods to the public, but nobody seems to understand that these increases are brought about as a result of matters which are beyond their control.  I imagine that a large employer will have to meet a very substantial increase in his premium.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry.  I referred to Section 1.  I should have said Sections 3 and 4.  I am asking if the Minister has any information as regards the estimated increase in the charges that will fall on the backs of employers to meet this particular compensation.</P>
      <P>Section 8, in my opinion, would require some amendment.  Sub-section (1) of that section provides that, in the case of an injured workman whose incapacity is permanent and who has been receiving a weekly payment for more than six months, he may apply to the court to redeem the payment by a lump sum, and may purchase an immediate life annuity based on the table in the Second Schedule to the Act.  This provides that the lump sum must provide the man with 75 per cent. of the annual value of the weekly payment. The problem here is that incapacity must be permanent.  It is not specified that it must be total.  This kind of case has, for instance, been brought to my notice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A farm labourer may lose a finger and, as a consequence, may have a claim for permanent disablement.  He may be incapacitated for doing the class of work that he had been doing, such, for example, as the milking of cows.  Having proved permanent disablement, he can opt to get this particular lump sum, but because he is not <Col N="539" /> totally disabled he can then immediately embark on other classes of employment almost similar to the work which he had been doing.  In the interests of the costs that will fall on insured people, I think that the Minister ought to consider seriously whether the word &ldquo;permanent&rdquo; here should not include total, if the insured person is to receive the right to be able to get a substantial lump sum.  I am told that a farm labourer aged 30 years who was receiving say £4 a week would, according to the present Bill, be entitled to receive a lump sum of £2,895, even if he is not totally disabled, and if his permanent incapacity is of a very minor nature.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (3) of Section 8 gives any workman in receipt of a weekly payment for not less than six months, and whose incapacity is not permanent, the right to apply to the court to redeem the weekly payment for a lump sum, the amount of which can be determined by the court.  I suggest that this right should be given only in the case of a workman whose incapacity is permanent and partial.  Otherwise, a man who has a weekly payment for six months and who will make a full recovery eventually will be entitled to apply to the court for a lump sum. That position would lead to a tendency where workmen's compensation would again become more expensive.  There are the additional law costs to be considered. In these cases there will be the employment of solicitor and counsel, the cost of which will have to be borne by the insurance company which insures these people or by the employer himself if he carries his own insurance.</P>
    <P>There is then the terrific gamble that if, within six months, the employee is entitled to go to court before it is really proved that he is permanently disabled&mdash;to the extent that he was in the six months' period&mdash;and get the lump sum&mdash;that, I am afraid, will bring about a situation not intended by the Minister and not intended by those who want to see a just situation for injured or disabled work people.</P>
    <P>I understand that the reason suggested for incorporating Section 8 in <Col N="540" /> the Bill is to place workmen in the same position as the employer has been up to the present time, but this will not be the effect of the Bill.  Since the introduction of workmen's compensation, the number of applications made by any employer to redeem the weekly payment on the 75 per cent. basis has been very small.  I suggest that the Minister might reconsider the whole of Section 8, particularly with regard to sub-section (3), not because I do not want to see workmen getting substantial compensation where they are totally disabled, permanently disabled, or partially disabled for a period.  I want to see, as we all do, that the workmen will get the most that can be got and given to them in justice.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, I do not want to see the Bill become an Act of Parliament which, in its application, will result in extremely heavy costs to the employer, because of the occasional situation which will arise, and which must be included in the estimated possible liability of the insurance company, or the employer, if he insures his workers.  Therefore, I suggest to the Minister that Section 8 will have to be reconsidered, sub-section (3) in particular. I am not going to suggest that sub-section (3) should be deleted, but at least it should be amended.</P>
    <P>If the State were to take some responsibility for this, if you like, development towards the welfare of the worker, if the State were going to meet part of these costs, it would be a different story; if the State were going to carry the insurance from the employers and give these awards, it would be all right.  But so long as we live in the situation where this class of insurance must be continued, where it has to be done by an employer through an insurance company which operates for gain, not as a social welfare institution, and which does not want to take out policies and accept premiums which, at the end of the year, or a number of years, as a result of its experience, will show considerable loss, so long as that exists, the insurance company will play safe, and will impose on the employer, who cannot risk carrying this burden or liability on his own shoulders, a substantially high premium which will ensure <Col N="541" /> profit for the insurance company, but which, as I have said at the outset, will ensure a very substantial increase in the overheads of the employer, whether he is a manufacturer, or an ordinary trader.</P>
    <P>I have tried to ascertain, but I have failed, what this compensation will mean, not only from the point of view of the rates that are fixed, but also what lump sum payments will be given, as a result, if this Bill becomes an Act. I do not know whether the Minister has attempted to ascertain what the result will be in that respect.  I do not know whether his advisers have been able to give him any information, but my information, as far as I can gather it, is that the employer is going to have a very heavy insurance bill to meet, one which will start off on the basis of a guess, one which will afterwards be varied from year to year as a result of the experience of the insurance company, not in connection with any particular firm, because they all have to pay into the till.  It does not matter whose employee gets hurt. It is the employer who will have to pay into the kitty to ensure that the insurance company will not be at any loss.</P>
    <P>I do not want to see the workman suffer, but I also do not want to see the employer unduly pressed in this matter.  I think the Minister should consider the points I have made.  I do not want to repeat them, because the Chair will probably tell me that repetition is out of order, but I want to emphasise the points I have made. Generally speaking, our work people are not malingerers who look for something they are not entitled to.  Unfortunately, there are always odd people looking for opportunities to make very substantial claims.  We know of cases where a certain type of person goes round the restaurants trying to find pins stuck in buns. Finally that person is so unfortunate as to find a pin in the bun which sticks in the mouth.</P>

      <P>They are pinned down eventually.  I agree.  But they get <Col N="542" /> away with it in three or four cases, and the insurance companies have to increase the premium as a protection against this.</P>
      <P>As I have said, if this Bill is left as it is, it will be a most attractive proposition for the legal profession. There will be room in it for litigation <i>ad nauseam</i> and solicitors and barristers will delight in it.  If the Minister does not make the changes I have suggested, he should at least assure the House that the fears I have expressed are unfounded.</P>
      <P>When workmen's compensation was discussed by the previous Administration, the one thing which, I think, everybody wanted was to have a Bill clearly defined in its references to the type of person who is entitled to compensation, and that the compensation should be such as to remove, as far as possible, the need for litigation.  I think we were all agreed on that.  I take it that we have the same attitude now.  I want to see the Bill made clear.  If these points which I have mentioned&mdash;which can be regarded by the insurance companies as the &ldquo;gamble&rdquo; items, which they have to include in their estimated requirements of premiums&mdash;are dealt with, if it is made clear what the person is to get and if the circumstances that exist for the purpose of getting it are defined by law, the insurance companies will not have the same excuse for making their premiums far in excess of what they should be.</P>
      <P>Insurance companies, unfortunately, cannot do what the State can.  They cannot start off by saying that this is going to be the additional premium, and then find they are wrong by a long way.  They are going to take the attitude, at the beginning, of having no losses, and if they have a substantial margin of profit as a result of their calculations, I suppose their actuaries will give them some indication that they may reduce it.  Meanwhile the employer, or whoever has to meet the premiums, has to pay this higher rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an aspect that should be discussed under this measure but, as far as I can see, is not included in the Bill.  I agree with the view <Col N="543" /> expressed here that it is during the period of injury that the employee is most in need of full wages; in fact, he is in need of more than his full wages. That is why I was hoping that in this Bill some provision would be made in relation to those provisions which are doubtful or which can be improved. Employers might then be induced or encouraged to do what some employers do at the moment.</P>
    <P>Apart from what they have to pay by way of providing insurance under the Workmen's Compensation Acts at the moment, some employers actually pay a premium on the basis of the wages paid so that in the event of injury the injured workman, denied the opportunity of working, is paid his full wages and not just 50 per cent. or 70 per cent.  We can, as I have already said, only reach that stage when certain doubts are removed.  We are a long way off the State taking charge of this; indeed, if the State were to take the responsibility of collecting the insurance premiums from employers in order that workmen's compensation would be paid on the basis to which I have referred the House would be amazed at the weekly contribution the employer would have to make to cover his employee.</P>
    <P>If the Minister cannot give me the figures for which I have asked I appeal to him, in all sincerity, to consider amendments for the purpose of removing certain doubts and, secondly, to let us know then where we stand in relation to the possible increase in premiums which will fall on the shoulders of the employers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the House as a whole will agree that there is need for a comprehensive Workmen's Compensation Bill similar to the Factories Bill.  Former legislation is out-dated and obsolete and the increase in industrial development makes it imperative that we should have a complete and comprehensive scheme of workmen's compensation.  Because of industrial progress there is urgent need for such a scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been suggested that a Committee <Col N="544" /> of the House, or an outside committee, should be set up to make recommendations to the Minister and the House in that regard.  I am in complete agreement with that proposition. The question as to whether or not workmen's compensation should form part of the social welfare scheme or be amalgamated with the various types of insurance would come within purview of such a committee.  For that reason I do not think we need at this stage discuss that aspect of the matter in any detail.</P>
    <P>As I see it, this Bill is intended to remedy temporarily, pending a comprehensive measure, some of the most glaring injustices as a result of former legislation, injustices which operate against the interests of the workers, the people for whose benefit the legislation was originally framed.  All amendments since the 1934 Act have been based on an adjustment of the position to meet the increased cost of living.  While that was laudable, it nevertheless left considerable injustices to be remedied.  The Minister is now attempting to correct these injustices in a temporary manner at least pending further action by him and the proposed committee.</P>
    <P>The best test as to whether this is a good Bill or a bad Bill will depend on its reception by those who are most interested.  When the Bill was first published the Trades Union Congress, a congress of people solely and primarily interested in the working people and their needs, welcomed the Bill as embodying certain changes which the Trades Union Congress and trades unions generally had been seeking for many years.  That is commendation indeed from those who understand the position.</P>
    <P>Attention was drawn to the fact that the weekly compensation had been increased from 50/- to 90/-.  Comment was also made on the compensation increase under this Bill in relation to fatalities.  It was stated that these provisions were good in themselves and essential from the point of view of the working classes.</P>
    <P>Apart from that, there are two other distinct advantages where the injured workman is concerned.  There is power <Col N="545" /> to initiate proceedings for a lump-sum settlement.  Deputy Briscoe adverted to that.  There is power to proceed under common law for compensation notwithstanding the fact that the injured workman has actually been in receipt of workmen's compensation for a period of 12 months.</P>
    <P>I would like to add my voice both as a Labour Deputy and as a trade union organiser in support of that of the Trades Union Congress.  It has been my lot for a period of ten to 15 years to take an active interest in workmen's compensation cases.  Any man who holds the position of branch secretary or trade union organiser must of necessity appreciate the importance of workmen's compensation legislation and must, equally of necessity, come up against the snags and injustices inherent in existing legislation.  The reduction of the period from four to two weeks and the abolition of the three-day waiting period is to my mind a distinct advance in this Bill, one that is welcomed and one for which the Minister should be given full credit.  Under existing legislation workers were compelled, because of the meagre amount of compensation which very often almost brought them to the verge of starvation, to come to some settlement with the insuring company.  It is quite true that a District Justice or a Circuit Court judge had to approve of such a settlement and to decide that such an agreed settlement was favourable to the worker.</P>
    <P>In many cases that could be got over very easily by the workman himself indicating that he felt in much better condition of health than he actually knew himself to be.  We are all well aware how doctors differ, and differ genuinely, and very often it is the manner in which the injured workman himself expresses how he feels to the judge that decides in the judge's mind the grievousness of the injury.  If he finds that a workman, seeking to arrive at an agreement, indicates that he is not as seriously injured as he well might be, any judge who is human will be inclined to adopt the workman's word and sometimes agree to a settlement that is not at all in <Col N="546" /> the interests of the workman.  With the increase in the weekly compensation rate, the 90/- per week, in the future there will be much less reason for the worker to seek an immediate settlement.  Ninety shillings a week, while not a wage, perhaps, or a compensation that is wholly adequate, is so great an improvement on the previous rate, especially where single men are concerned, that the urgent need to seek a settlement will not be there.</P>
    <P>On the question of fatal accidents it might well have been said of the workmen's compensation codes of earlier days that it was much better from the insurance company's point of view that a man should be killed than that he should be injured.  Fatality meant a small lump sum while injury meant perhaps continuation of payments over a long number of years. That the loss of a breadwinner to a family has now been estimated by a somewhat better financial assessment is certainly, in my opinion, an advantage to the workman.  The increase of the juvenile dependents' age from 15 to 16 is also a step in the right direction and one that the trade union movement and the workers generally appreciate very much.</P>
    <P>I notice that the Minister, in his opening statement, sounded a note of warning as to what the effect of Section 8 of this Bill might be or what might be the reactions of the insurance companies to that section, that is, the right of the worker to initiate proceedings for a lump sum settlement. Deputy Briscoe has just now sounded the same note of warning.  I do not deny that perhaps there is some justification for the Minister's fears and the fears of Deputy Briscoe and that in actual fact increases in premiums might result which would be detrimental to the costings of a firm if insurance is to be charged against overheads. That is a reasonable thing to consider, but I wonder is the danger as great as either the Minister or Deputy Briscoe seemed to fear.  I believe that the Bill as drafted gives fairly ample protection in that regard.  Sub-section (4) of Section 8 of the Bill says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="547" />&ldquo;The court shall have a discretion to grant or refuse an application under this section and in exercising that discretion shall have regard to the nature of the workman's injury, his reason for making the application, and, where the employer so requests, the employer's circumstances.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Is it not reasonable that the insurance company should take the line that most of us in this country take?  Let the courts of our country take their duties seriously; let them exercise their judgments based on facts and on all the circumstances, and it is only where the judge&mdash;or, in the higher courts, a number of judges&mdash;consider it wise and beneficial and proper in the interests of the workman, after considering which course will do least injury, that they will grant such an application.</P>
    <P>I think there can be no gainsaying the fact that this House as a whole agrees that prior to this proposed change in the legislation the dice was loaded against the working man.  The insurance company could, if it so desired, pay him a weekly compensation rate for the whole of his lifetime.  They could also, if they so decided, go to the courts after a period of six months and have the compensation redeemed by a lump sum settlement.  Is it not reasonable that what is sauce for the goose should be sauce for the gander, and if the insurance company has that right, so within reason and as far as is within the power of the justices, should the workers have the very same right?</P>
    <P>I feel certain that the insurance companies will feel that they are protected sufficiently by sub-section (4) of Section 8 and will not jump their premiums to the extent that any of us might have thought at first.</P>
    <P>Should there be considerable pressure I think there is just one point where the Minister might consider a small relaxation and that is on the question of six months' incapacity.  The Minister might consider, if it did meet with the views of any Deputies or, perhaps, insurance companies, that that could be extended, if necessary to 12 months. <Col N="548" /> I would feel, speaking purely on my own and from my own observations, that a permanency of incapacity would take a period of at least 12 months to develop or to develop so that the idea of permanency or otherwise would become established.</P>
    <P>The Bill suggests six months.  I have no objection to the period of six months beyond that if the Minister felt as a result of pressure from any Deputies on the employers' side that that should be extended, I, as an individual trade unionist, speaking purely on my own behalf would feel that that concession could possibly be made.</P>
    <P>Whatever we may say about the risk of the insurance companies jumping their premiums, there is one thing to which I would like to draw the attention of the Minister, and I think it is a much more serious matter for his consideration than any of those risks.  It has come to my knowledge that ever since this Bill was published, insurance companies in a considerable number of cases are taking time by the forelock and forcing into court for a lump sum settlement a number of cases that have been long on their books, the idea being&mdash;it is quite clear&mdash;that they would get a judgment on the basis of 75 per cent. of the 50/- rate.</P>
    <P>I will quote one case, without giving the name, of a worker who lost his right arm in 1949.  Since 1949, being a single man, he has been in receipt of 50/- per week, and several times during that period the insurance company attempted to give him a settlement.  No satisfactory figure was arrived at. Within the past few weeks, he has received notice that the company are taking him to court to have a settlement fixed.  That is but one of a number of cases that clearly would benefit by the Act in which an attempt is now being made to deprive the parties concerned of the advantage of this Bill, due to the delay in this House in bringing it to completion.  I would seriously suggest to the Minister that he should consider adding a section to the Bill giving a right to any person whose case has been decided since the introduction of this Bill to go back for a further assessment, if and when the Bill finally becomes law.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="549" /> The intention of this Bill is to give full advantage to the injured workman and I do not think that any such action as I have indicated should be permitted to deprive a worker of what are clearly his rights.  It has been said by one Deputy that, while he had very little sympathy or very small sympathy with employers who had insured their workers, on the question of their right to go into court to secure a lump sum settlement, he had very great sympathy with the employer who had not insured his worker at all.  I take a completely opposite view.  To my mind, insurance of workers should be compulsory.  I am not going to discuss the question of compulsory insurance, because again that is a matter for the comprehensive Bill, but it is no excuse for an employer to plead that he could not afford to insure his workers.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Moran who made the point and I think what he said was that they could hardly afford to employ a worker, not to speak of insuring him.  I think this should be looked at in the other way and that no man who cannot afford to insure a worker should have the cheek to suggest that he should employ him. Surely the rights of the dependents, the wife and family, of that workman must be safeguarded, should he be killed in his employment or so maimed as to be useless for life or should he be partially incapacitated, while working for another man.  Surely it should be compulsory that these would be protected before that man could be put into employment to give profit to another, because no man employs any other man for other than a profit motive.</P>
    <P>I came across a case which I reported to the Minister a couple of months ago of a big estate which had a worker employed cutting timber.  As a result of that employment, he lost the use of one hand, and, when he went to claim insurance, he found he was working for a sub-contractor of the estate, even though he did not know it, and when he went into court, while his incapacity was admitted, he found that his decree was against a man of straw and he has now to rely, and to rely solely, on national health <Col N="550" /> benefit&mdash;a drain on the State.  It properly should be against the estate for which he worked, but, due to this easy trick, employers can get out of their obligations.  Compulsory insurance would, as in the case of motor car insurance, make clear that such could not happen.</P>
    <P>Those of us who were following the development of workmen's compensation came to know that a certain decision had been given in a court case which was subject to appeal and which left Section 6 of the 1953 Act open to doubt.  I am aware that Section 11 of this Bill was put in with the idea of offsetting any such decision, and I think Deputy Larkin, speaking for the Labour Party, in April last, stated that he was not quite clear whether Section 11 was any improvement at all. I feel that the Minister in his reply should indicate what the view of his Department is, now that a certain decision has been given, and whether he is quite satisfied that Section 11 is at all necessary or whether he is satisfied that it meets the position as it is at present.  It is the duty of the Minister to see that the wishes of this Dáil are carried out by the courts by seeing to it that Bills are so framed that there can be no loopholes, no legal points with which the lawyers can make play and which will give rise to judgments, on legal points alone, which are contrary to the intentions of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>On the question of what this will cost by way of increased premiums, I am sure the Minister has made his own inquiries, but some of us have also been inquiring, and I suggest that before there is any haste in the Minister's coming to any decision, as to how much can be afforded, he should examine the costings of employers' liability insurance over the past number of years.  I have got a number of figures.  I do not claim that they are 100 per cent. correct, but I claim that they are a pretty fair indication of costings, of premiums and various other costs, of employers' liability insurance over the past number of years.</P>
    <P>One of the points I get from the figures is that the figures of claims paid as a percentage of the premium income <Col N="551" /> in companies established within the country appear to be some 64 per cent.  Commission and expenses of management as a percentage of premium income appear to be as high as 30 to 36 per cent.  I would think that, on just these two examples alone, there is room for a certain tightening-up in management expenses and in commission expenses that might absorb some of the increased costs to carry the new risks that the companies may be called upon to carry.  Certainly they may not cover all the increased costs but, as Deputy Larkin suggested in his speech, the Minister would be well advised, before agreeing to increases in premium, to have the matter referred to some body such as the Prices Advisory Body.</P>
    <P>All of us know that insurance companies are in the business for their profit interest.  Deputy Briscoe indicated, when speaking of the risk and of these increased premiums, that these insurance companies would take the line of assessing the risk, irrespective of how small it was, as a new increased premium for a year or longer and then, having got a report from their actuary, they might consider a reduction if their anticipation of the risk did not work out.  I suggest it is the responsibility of the insurance companies, before they seek and secure increased premiums to that extent, to show that their fears are actual and well-grounded and that they are only seeking an increase to compensate them not for a risk but for an actuality. It seems ridiculous that they can assess a risk which, as Deputy Briscoe said, might be simply one in a 1,000 and apply it to every one of that 1,000.</P>
    <P>This Bill really affects just one section of the community, that is, the working-class people.  The employer is incidental only.  It is true that he employs the man and pays the premium but, whatever the premium &mdash;whether it is small or whether it will now be big&mdash;it has always been passed on to the consumer.  There is no employer who looks upon the coverage of his workers as other than one of his costs of production.  It is only reasonable <Col N="552" /> and right that the risk undertaken by a working man in the production of a commodity should be assessed in the price of the commodity.  I remember speaking to a doctor who had worked in Britain during the war and he said to me: &ldquo;Deputy, if you saw the injuries and the fatalities that happen in the mines in Britain you would consider coal cheap at £20 a ton.&rdquo;  He said that the risk of injury and of death to the miners was so great that he felt any price paid for coal was reasonable.</P>
    <P>Equally so, I think the risks our people run and the injuries that occur in the course of production, especially in this new mechanical age, must be assessed and taken as part of the production cost of any article.  The insurance companies are in the business purely and simply from the profit motive.  Only one section should be considered by this House and that section comprises the working people who come under these Acts.  Too long, I would suggest, have the rights of the working people been subordinated to the interests of the economy of the country.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to congratulate the Minister on taking the first step to put an end to this practice which has been going on for so long.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceEDockrell" hpid="Mr. M.E. Dockrell Mr. M.E. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>There are very many ways of considering this Bill and there are many aspects from which you can view it.  I want to pick out certain of those aspects which appear to me to be important and which it would appear to be necessary to inquire into. We start off and find ourselves in this part of Ireland in a country with high tariff walls and, in many cases, with new industries.  At the same time, we have a long-established retail and wholesale side of business which I might call quasi-industrial.  I should like to mention a few facts about those two aspects of our industry and the impact on them of workmen's compensation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Up to now, it has been comparatively easy for the manufacturers here to get back the costs of their production but it is not so easy for those engaged in distribution and in the <Col N="553" /> retail and wholesale business.  Yet, that side of industry pays workmen's compensation and employs men in industry who run risks and to whom accidents happen.  It is not so easy for those firms and for that side of industry to recover overhead costs.  In that respect, I might say that the members of this House this morning got a document, which I suppose most of us have not had time to read, with reference to the wireless industry and to costs and profits in it.  I wonder how the people in that particular industry to-day will view the enormous increases which are bound to occur as a result of this Bill.</P>
    <P>We would be quite unreal if we did not face the fact that this Bill will put up the cost of workmen's compensation insurance on every employer in the country.  This House starts off with a very clear realisation that it wants to see justice done to workmen.  The Labour people have said so.  Deputy Kyne referred to it and I think Deputy Larkin said in his speech that they did not want to put up the costs on industry unduly.  I might say that I also have little or no sympathy with the employer who does not insure himself properly.  He should do so, and under this Bill if an employer does not insure himself properly the financial risks he will run will be so grave that he will be very foolish.</P>
    <P>One of the matters which I hope the committee the Minister proposes to set up will deal with is the question of how far workmen's compensation should or should not be compulsory.  I personally am inclined to think that it should be compulsory&mdash;in fact, I must go further and say that I do think it should be compulsory, especially where we are dealing with articles produced in this country for the use of our own people.</P>
    <P>I might say that I am glad to see the increase of age limit for juvenile dependency.  I am glad to see that the age limit has been raised from 15 to 16.  I think that is a good step and that the alteration in Section 1 is one which industry can bear without any undue hardship.  But when we come to the question of the increase of 50/- to 90/- I am afraid that that again is <Col N="554" /> going to cost an enormous sum of money.</P>
    <P>When we come down to consider what is in Section 8 it is not very clear. I think that six months is too short a period.  One of the previous Deputies, Deputy Kyne, said that he personally would not object to a longer period. A longer period is necessary in my opinion where you have an injury for which you are going to pay a lump sum on the basis of it being permanent.  Six months is really too short a period to know whether it is in fact a permanent injury.  I might add on this point that the insurance companies say that 80 per cent. of the people who have been paid compensation for injuries get back into full employment.  Whether that figure is completely accurate or not I do not know, but at any rate there are large numbers of persons who are paid lump sums and who come back into industry.  That is undoubted.</P>
    <P>I have been somewhat surprised to see the emphasis which has been laid in this Bill on the payment of a lump sum.  I remember that some years ago when the Beveridge Report which was afterwards incorporated into the legislation in Great Britain came out I was very interested to read that one of the fundamentals of that report was that the workman must be protected from taking a lump sum when in fact he should be paid over a longer period.  It is interesting to see that we have apparently departed from that very considerably in this Bill.</P>
    <P>In Section 8, sub-section (4), there is a sentence which I think requires some elucidation.  That is that the court shall have a discretion to grant or refuse an application under this section and that in exercising that discretion it shall have regard to the nature of the workman's injury.  Then it finishes up by &ldquo;his reason for making the application and, where the employer so requests, the employer's circumstances.&rdquo; I take it that that means that the employer can make an <i>ad misericordiam</i> appeal to the courts.  If so, that seems to me to be a hardship on the workman and to bring in a differentiation as between one employer and another.  I read &ldquo;employer's circumstances&rdquo; as meaning the employer's <Col N="555" /> financial circumstances, and I think that would be a very dangerous and unfair thing to put into a Bill.  It would be very unfair to the workman and to other employers.</P>
    <P>Section 11 is apparently framed to protect the workman against exploitation, but it goes very much further than that and again, with its retrospective clause in sub-section (2), it is causing a great deal of uneasiness to the commercial community.  Other parts of Section 11 are not at all clear, especially sub-section (4).  I think sub-section (4) would give rise to great legal difficulties and would involve both the employers and the workmen in grave difficulties and that they would have to go to the court to have them settled.</P>
    <P>This Bill will be a tremendous burden on industry and I do not think that industry can stand it.  Certain industries cannot stand it.  We would be wise to examine whether we should not deal with it under the social code. I think it was Deputy Ryan who referred to that in his speech.  It seems to me to be a way which would be fair. It is all very well to say that this is industry and that industry must bear its own costs, but in fact it is very difficult to get industry to bear its own costs in this matter, because it will depend on the interpretation of the courts and those who are paying the premiums will not be judged entirely on their own insurance record.  They will also be judged on the insurance record of a much wider area.</P>
    <P>For that reason, I think it will be necessary to make the area and the categories as wide as possible.  I might explain that.  There might be certain employers in the painting industry who, owing to inefficient gear, perhaps, might put the premiums up on that particular trade.  That would have a bad effect on certain people who nevertheless maintain good plant and gear themselves.  Apart from that, the fact that one particular section of industry or trade had to pay a high premium would affect the premiums that other trades would have to pay.  Therefore, I consider that there is a great deal to be said for making your cover as <Col N="556" /> wide as possible, especially in view of the fact that this will vitally affect the farming community as a whole.  They will have to pay these increased premiums also, so there is a lot to be said for facing it in a national way, dealing with it as a national problem and paying on a national basis.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, there is no doubt that trade and industry will have to pay very large extra premiums.  I was making a guess myself and thought that the premiums might be as high as a 75 per cent. increase.  According to what Deputy Kyne said, I would read into that that you could expect an increase of something in the neighbourhood of 65 per cent. on premium payments on the present basis.  Bear in mind that we will be working on a different basis in the future.</P>
    <P>The first different basis is the increase from 15 years old to 16.  I have already said that that is an increase which I am glad to see, but it will nevertheless cost something extra, because it means that a payment must be made for one year extra to all children who come within that category. Section 8, under the proposed sub-section where a man after six months can go to the court and look for a permanent payment, introduces a different basis that will undoubtedly cost a great deal more.  There is a change in the basis also in Section 11. Therefore, we are faced in this Bill with a very great increase in our workmen's compensation payments.</P>
    <P>I would welcome the idea of a commission sitting on this whole question. I am not sure if the Minister proposes setting up a special committee to deal with this, as was done in the case of the Factories Bill.  Am I correct in this?</P>

      <P>There is no doubt that all Deputies are concerned to see that in the Bill before the House the section of the community that may be injured in the course of their employment will get fair treatment from the rest of the community.  We will have to consider, then, whether the Minister's proposals are fair both to the workman and to the rest of the community.  That is more or less the function of this House. The Bill outlines certain proposals.  As far as I can remember, the Minister in his introductory remarks gave no indication of what the impact might be generally, or the estimated cost.  I have no doubt that in preparing this Bill he, on behalf of the Government, made calculations of the impact on industry, on agriculture, on local authorities, on rents and generally on the cost of living.  We have to consider whether the impact of this Bill, even though it may be necessary, is one that the community as a whole can bear.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Minister has satisfied himself that the rents of houses that are still needed to replace slum dwellings will not be increased very considerably as a result of this Bill.  I remember the time quite well when the 1936 Act was amended and I distinctly remember contractors at that time claiming from local authorities 5 per cent. increase in the cost of the house.  People engaged in the building trade have told me that they made calculations and calculate that the provisions of this Bill may increase rents up to 1/- a week or thereabouts.  I do not know whether they are right or not.  The Minister may laugh and smile.</P>

      <P>I am just telling the Minister what has been the impression. <Col N="558" /> That impression is abroad in some sections of the building trade and whether it is well founded or not I cannot say.  But I do know, as a member of a local authority, that from previous experience an increase claimed under the Blue Slip represented 5 per cent. on the contract price.  If that is so it would be rather serious.  However, if the Minister himself is fully informed in this regard he should also fully inform the members of this House.</P>
      <P>It is quite easy to legislate here and to pass what you may call popular Bills, necessary Bills if you like, for which this House has not to raise a penny in the way of taxation to cover it.  The most difficult type of Bill that can be brought before the House is one where the Minister must bring in a Financial Resolution and the Minister for Finance must provide the moneys.  No money is being provided by the Exchequer to implement this Bill.  Some estimates have been made that it will cost a minimum of £5,000,000 extra per year, assuming all those employable are employed and are covered by insurance, if they are not covered through insurance companies the employer assumes liability for them.  That is one estimate which has been given to me and the Minister should make the facts known to the House and to the community at large.</P>
      <P>Every Deputy here will be conversant with a recent discussion we had on the Budget.  It is plain to every-one's mind&mdash;assuming the figure of £5,000,000 in the way of insurance premiums is correct&mdash;what amount of taxation the Minister for Finance would have to impose to raise £5,000,000.  If he had to raise it at the expense of bread, it would mean 6d. a loaf more, which gives us some idea of what it would cost.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I know and it depends on what the employment was and the risk from the insurance point of view.  The risks vary but I am making a calculation on a very conservative basis.  I am calculating that the highest risk should be double the lowest and I am taking an average between the two.  I do not think I would be far wrong in that.  It could err one way or the other but for the basis of the argument it is not a great deal wrong.</P>
      <P>That brings me back to the proposal in the motion moved by Deputy Dr. Ryan on the last occasion.  I want to suggest especially to the Minister and to the Government that before the Minister, with a Government majority, forces a Second Reading of this Bill through the House, he should have the investigation sought by Deputy Dr. Ryan made so as to clear Deputies' minds on this important issue.  As I said, it is very easy to legislate when we have no taxation to raise.  We can pass many popular measures by throwing the total impact, whether it is £1,000,000 or £5,000,000 on to the community. In regard to this Bill, one official of a local authority told me that the premium will represent 6d. or 1/- in the £ extra on the total rates of a county.  That is a great deal of money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not arguing against the Bill or saying that the increases are not necessary but before we take the full responsibility for putting it on the Statute Book and putting it into operation, every Deputy should be fully aware of its impact on the cost of living.  Labour Deputies are as much concerned as any other Deputies in the <Col N="560" /> House in that respect&mdash;the cost of living, the difficulty of keeping it steady or reducing it to what is necessary and desirable.  Day in day out the trend is upwards in spite of any efforts that can be made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. J. Larkin Mr. J. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>But we do not want to keep it down at the expense of injured workmen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree, but my point is this.  I do not know what percentage of the total of insured workers under the social insurance code represents injured workmen who claim compensation or who are entitled to it.  I am sure the Minister would have that knowledge, whether it is 1 per cent., 2 per cent. or 3 per cent.  That would give us a fair idea of what this should normally cost.  These are very important matters and it would help us to know whether the House is justified in putting a further serious burden on industry, on local rates and on the whole community or whether some benefit could not be provided for the injured worker by some other means.</P>
      <P>A question I would put forward is whether a code which has been in operation for 150 years should be amended and whether it is applicable to modern conditions or not.  We must consider whether it will cost too much to the community to operate the proposals that are in this Bill.  That is something about which the Minister should have facts and figures.  I am sure the Minister has satisfied himself on that or he would not have submitted the question to the members of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>That is quite true.  I am just making that point on this matter. I think it was Deputy Kyne who said that the total cost would be passed on to the consumer in all respects.  I think I am not making a mistake there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Col N="561" />
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I think agriculture employs a considerable proportion of the people in insured employment in this country.  I think I would not be very wrong in saying that roughly half of the people in insured employment are working at agriculture which is the primary industry.  Primary producers cannot pass on extra costs in the same way as can other industries and if there is an extra £2,000,000 or £2,500,000 to be put on the backs of the agricultural community by this Bill it is a very serious matter.  If it costs from 2/- to 2/6 a week at the present time under workmen's compensation to insure an agricultural labourer&mdash;I think that is roughly the figure&mdash;and if there is to be 100 per cent. increase on that it is a very serious matter.</P>
      <P>I do not know what is the cost to the State under social insurance under which people are insured in many directions&mdash;what the cost is to the State of insuring a man under the social insurance scheme for widows' and orphans' pensions, for sickness and children's allowances.  I am just wondering whether it is going to cost 3/- or 4/- a week for a farmer to insure a worker whereas the worker would not get the same benefits for the same contributions.</P>
      <P>The farmer cannot pass on these extra costs to the consumer whereas an industry could.  A prosperous industry can pass on such costs to the consuming public if the industrialist is producing goods of which he has a monopoly in the country.  He can quite easily pass on any extra costs provided the community are able to bear them and continue to buy the goods.  There are many struggling industries which are just carrying on and it has been suggested that the impact of this may be rather serious for them.  All these matters I am sure have been considered and considered carefully and when I raise this matter I raise it as a question mark.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not objecting to the basis of compensation if it is considered just and necessary but I should like to ask Deputy Dr. Ryan's question: if I am sick with pneumonia I get 50/- a week but if I am a workman and sprain my <Col N="562" /> foot I get £4 10s.; if I deserve £4 10s. a week for a sprained ankle is it just that I should get only 50/- a week when I am sick with pneumonia?  Of course you will have inequities in everything because it is so very hard to be perfect.</P>
    <P>I think the full support of the House should be given to Deputy Dr. Ryan's amendment to this Bill and I think that the Minister and the Deputies supporting him should take note of it at this stage.  I am sure the Minister has information available from his advisers, from the economists who advise the Government, as to what the impact will be on such things as rents in slum dwellings, on the cost of clothing and on the ratepayers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is a radical departure from the legislation already on the Statute Books in relation to workmen's compensation.  One good point about this Bill is that it proposes to increase the weekly compensation to £4 10s.  I feel, however, that it was a mistake to introduce this Bill before it was considered by a committee because it has such an impact upon industry in general and because it will have such far-reaching effects if it becomes law. I do not consider that this Bill is justified in the present circumstances because if you consider the workmen's compensation code across the water in Great Britain you will find it is very different to the proposals contained in this Bill, and I would ask the Minister what is wrong with workmen's compensation code existing in Great Britain?  Is it not a good code under present circumstances?  There are sections in this Bill which are not catered for under the Workmen's Compensation Act in Great Britain where a different system of indemnity by the State is given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="563" /> When we try to calculate what the impact of this Bill may be we have just to take a few simple examples.  First of all take the married man who gets sick.  He will get £2 10s. a week from the State but if he meets with an injury he will obtain £4 10s. a week from a private employer who may not be in very good circumstances.  Take a single man for instance at the present time.  After 17 days out of work as a result of an injury he will receive £5.  He will receive less than that from the State if he is out of work as a result of sickness but, under the Bill, if he is 17 days out of work he will get £11 5s. instead of £5 from his employer.</P>
    <P>That is a matter to be reckoned with when introducing a Bill of this kind, designed to impose a liability on a person who decides to employ another for the purpose of performing certain duties.  We have had in this country a very good code in so far as workmen's legislation is concerned, the basis of it being the 1934 Workmen's Compensation Act as amended by the 1948 Act and later by the 1950 Act.</P>
    <P>I feel that if it is considered necessary and, apparently, it is, to improve the conditions for injured persons and the scale of compensation to which they will be entitled in the event of an accident, the problem could have been met by extending the existing legislation instead of bringing in this Bill which has some very new features in it and which will impose very severe liabilities on employers.  In the long run, of course, the heavy liabilities which the Bill is designed to impose on employers will come back on the working man.</P>
    <P>Take for instance a baker.  If these liabilities are imposed on the baker, it will be necessary for him to increase the price of bread in order to protect himself by insurance against claims arising for accidents in the course of their employment, by members of his staff.  It is probable that, if this Bill is accepted as it stands, and if an employer wants to protect himself by obtaining a policy of insurance he will have to pay almost double the present premium.  I heard mentioned here the figure of 65 per cent. and 75 per <Col N="564" /> cent. but I am satisfied that the cost of obtaining an insurance policy to cover an employer against the liabilities which this Bill proposes would mean almost 100 per cent. increase in the premium.</P>
    <P>I have given the example of the single man who, under existing legislation gets £5 if he is out 17 days as a result of an accident, and far less than that if he is out for the same period due to illness, compared to the £11 5/- under this Bill for the same period of 17 days.  Similarly, on the question of redemption.  Where the lump sum payment at the moment may amount to £1,800, it is possible that redemption, in the case of an unmarried man under the present Bill, would amount to well over £4,000.  In order that an employer could pay over £4,000 instead of £1,800 to the dependents or relatives of an injured employee it would be necessary for him to protect himself by insurance or to carry the risk himself.  Most employers consider that it is safer, in the interests of their own security and to protect their business, to obtain an insurance policy and thereby cover themselves against these liabilities.  If an employer wants to cover himself against a liability of over £4,000 instead of one of £1,800 in a case of redemption, it is obvious that he will require to pay a very substantial extra premium.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1943" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Might he not as well pay the money that way as to be paying it in income tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>They are two different problems.  I feel myself that this Bill will have such a heavy impact on every employer in the country, since they will find themselves liable to the extent set out in its sections, that it will be necessary to set up a committee to decide whether, in fact, it would be better to have a workmen's compensation scheme such as they have operating in Great Britain instead of the system which we have here.  A number of our employers are not insured to carry the risks themselves.  The risk, financially at present is not as great as it would be in the event of this Bill being passed by the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="565" /> Obviously, if these liabilities confront an employer it will be necessary for him to seek the protection of an insurance policy.  It is probable, for instance, that a farmer might be required to pay something like £13 per man per year instead of the present figure of about £7 10s. per year.  Similarly, in the case of a general builder, where the premium for a builder's labourer for a full year is about £19 10s. &mdash;that is on a wage of £300 a year and I think there are very few getting such a small wage as £6 a week at the moment&mdash;it is probable that instead of paying £19 10s. per man per year, the employer in order to secure insurance cover, might have to pay up to £33 per man per year.</P>
    <P>These figures represent a very steep increase and somebody must pay it.  In the long run, it goes back to the workman himself.  Therefore, we must consider whether a scheme such as the one in Great Britain would not be better for the injured workman, and in the long run would not give him greater advantages at less cost to himself.  As far as I can see, Sections 8 and 11 of this Bill would provide a happy hunting ground in the field of litigation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 11 is designed to prevent that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 11 contains difficulties, but I shall confine myself to Section 8 for the moment.  Under Section 8, a position is brought about whereby the injured man would be entitled to institute court proceedings. He will be able to do so in respect of every accident which may happen to him, however trivial the accident may be.  But at the present time injured persons do not find it necessary to institute court proceedings.  In fact, the averages show that only about three persons per thousand of injured persons find it necessary to bring their cases to court because the machinery that is there under the existing legislation enables settlements to be reached.  Instead of that, we will have a situation where in their own interests and for their own advantage we will have a very high percentage of those persons instituting court proceedings in a formal way&mdash;just as a <Col N="566" /> formality.  I give that as an example of the change which would be brought about under Section 8 in the interests of the injured man.  It will be appreciated, however, that since originally it was only necessary for three or four persons per thousand on the average to do that, this section of the Bill is going to bring workmen's compensation very much into the field of litigation.</P>
      <P>Then the question arises whether, in fact, it will bring advantages to the injured man equal to the liabilities which will be imposed on the employer, who will be required to fend against each and every one of these schemes, whether he be insured or not. It is a matter for the employer to cover himself by insurance.  People might think that the insurance companies would be glad to see a Bill being introduced in this House which would have the effect of almost doubling the premiums payable for policies covering the employers against claims from injured persons.  That is not the case.  Insurance companies have, of course, statistics which will enable them to quote a premium which will obviously give them a working profit.  They only pay from the money which is collected from employers, but, in the first instance, the employers will be required to pay that substantial extra premium.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You have another situation here where, under the Bill, an injured man can obtain a redemption of his weekly payment.  He is enabled to do that under the Bill.  Then, after six months, within three years, in fact, of the date of the accident, he may take the employer to court, under common law, and press for the payment of a lump sum, after having obtained a lump sum already in the form of a redemption under Section 8 of the Bill.  Similarly, we have the example where an injured person can plead total incapacity, and having succeeded in convincing the authorities that he is totally incapacitated, having received anything from £4,000 to £6,000, he can go into the market again looking for work, if he is fit.  Of course, on the average, he may not, but this Bill does not prevent him from going into the labour <Col N="567" /> market once more, having been paid for permanent total incapacity under this Bill.  It gives injured employees an opportunity of taking proceedings at common law within a period of three years.  This is certainly a very dangerous section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>He must proceed within 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the part about three years?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>In any case, under the existing legislation, he has power to take action, at common law, within three years.  These are some of the points which I wish to bring to the notice of the Minister, because I consider that this Bill is a radical departure from the existing legislation, and that it contains very radical clauses such as Section 8 and Section 11.  I think it ought to be left to a committee to consider the impact of such sections on industry and agriculture in general.</P>
      <P>It was pointed out by Deputy Allen that public authorities and also, of course, the central authority, will have very heavy burdens placed upon them in order to protect themselves against the liabilities which the present Bill proposes to impose on employers of every description.  As I say, insurance companies will not be at a loss under this Bill, because they can accept or reject any risk.  In fact, there are insurance companies in Dublin City, at the present time, who will refuse to have anything to do with workmen's compensation insurance.  They will say: &ldquo;We are not interested in that class of business.  It does not give us a profit from the manner in which we operate our business.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other insurance companies, of course, who are able to make a profit from workmen's compensation insurance. But, when an employer goes to the insurance companies, and asks them to give him cover for the liabilities which this Bill proposes to impose upon him, they have the opportunity, the option also, of refusing to give that man cover.  But the Bill would be compulsory, and it would impose <Col N="568" /> that liability on an employer, whether he liked it or not.</P>
    <P>These are certain aspects which I feel should be considered by a special committee such as the one set up in connection with the Factories Bill. Considering the very heavy impact of this Bill, I am surprised that it was not put to a committee in order that the various aspects of it could be considered before this legislation was drafted.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Ryan, some years ago, when he announced in this House that he had in mind the idea of introducing workmen's compensation legislation of some kind, indicated at that time that he was anxious that a committee should be set up in order to give consideration to the question whether workmen's compensation should be nationalised or should be a matter still for employers, as it is at present.  I feel that the position is still the same, and that it would be necessary for all interests concerned to get together to discuss this workmen's compensation code as it stands, and also any improvement of the code that is needed.</P>
    <P>I believe they should also consider the question of having a workmen's compensation code such as there is in England.  I do not know whether the Minister, for instance, can point to any Workmen's Compensation Act, in any country in western Europe, which contains sections such as Section 8 and Section 11 of this Bill.  A good majority, I think, of the countries in western Europe have a system such as there is in England, where the State carries that liability, and the workman receives his compensation in the normal way from the State, just as he receives his weekly benefit, whether it be unemployed benefit or sickness benefit.</P>
    <P>This Bill proposes that the employer should give a greater amount of compensation than the State itself to a person who, for one reason or another, cannot earn his bread.  A sick man or an unemployed man with six children finds it just as hard to exist as the injured man who may have six children to support.  I feel these are matters which ought to be considered, if the <Col N="569" /> Minister is prepared to set up some kind of committee to deal with the question of workmen's compensation, and whether, in fact, it would be better to have workmen's compensation included in a stamp, the same as the unemployment and sickness benefit.</P>

      <P>It is well to know that both on my right and on my left there is complete agreement as to the success of socialist legislation in Great Britain.  I had Deputy Allen on one side and Deputy Rooney on the other apparently in full agreement as to the success of such legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>But we are not satisfied that such legislation has gone far enough here and, supporting the Minister as we do, we want something better than this.  Deputies on both sides have drawn attention to the outstanding danger, as they see it; that is, that while an unfortunate injured man will get these extra benefits, to which nobody objects, the important question is where will the money come from?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>It will come, as has been stated, either from the pockets of the employers or, indirectly, from the pockets of the consumers.  Deputy Rooney and others are, in my opinion, avoiding the main issue.  Possibly if they went into the matter and considered certain aspects of it and certain figures they would have a different view to express.  Very little reference has been made to insurance companies except in relation to the possibility of premiums going up; that is one of the basic problems in connection with this important issue, namely, the question of financial protection for the unfortunate worker injured in the course of his employment. Under the 1948 Act and again under the 1952 Act certain increases were given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us consider now the average profits of the insurance companies between the years 1942 and 1947; the average profits in those years was 8 per cent. <Col N="570" /> Workmen's compensation was increased in 1948 and again in 1952; the average profit between 1948 and 1952 amounted, not to the 8 per cent. of the previous five years but to nothing less than 15 per cent.</P>

      <P>I have given the figures quite clearly.  These new benefits will undoubtedly be of advantage to people who meet with an accident during the course of their employment; but why should we ignore the question of the profits of these companies in relation to premiums?  Do we not remember the loud-voiced protest here a few years ago when attention was drawn to the fact that the cost of administration under the Social Welfare Act was calculated at 12 per cent.? According to some Deputies that was supposed to be a colossal figure; it was described as outright robbery.</P>
      <P>Let us take the figures for both the Irish and the foreign companies operating here.  In 1953 the claims paid by Irish companies represented as a percentage of income were 65 per cent. The claims paid by foreign companies represented 50 per cent.  But it is even more important that Deputies should know that the percentage paid in relation to commission and management expenses in 1953 amounted to nothing less than 31 per cent. in the case of the Irish companies and 36 per cent. in the case of the foreign based companies. Leaving aside the question of an increased profit from 8 per cent. to 15 per cent. we have the interesting fact that the percentage paid out for expenses in 1953 by the English based companies represented 50 per cent. of their income on workmen's compensation whereas the percentage allocated for commission and management expenses amounted to 36 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our approach to this matter is the approach of the Labour Party.  It is the common-sense approach.  We say that in the various aspects of commerce <Col N="571" /> or other lines of activity in the country, financial or economic, we must strike a true balance as between one side of the scale and the other.  It is no use indulging in wishful thinking.  It is no use saying that we are in favour of increased allowances for injured workmen. We must go further than that.  As Deputy Kyne said, even if it means in the last resort an imposition, even in relation to problems affecting the cost of living, we must ensure that the injured worker is protected.  We want the Minister to realise that our views are quite clear in relation to the question of profits, the question of management, commission expenses and the percentage paid out by way of claims.</P>
    <P>While we are not against the setting up of a committee to consider the general question, we will not wait for this increase until such time as that committee reports.  How many times have members on both sides of this House protested against the setting up of committees and commissions?  Deputy Dr. Ryan wants this deferred for three months.  We will not wait for three months if we can help it because the injured workman will be placed in a very awkward position and it will be poor satisfaction for him to know that there were 11 or 12 worthy members of this House debating the question as to whether, first of all, he is entitled to an increase and, secondly, where the money will come from?</P>
    <P>There is another important point to which I would like to draw the Minister's attention.  Indeed, it is important that the community as a whole should be aware of this: it is essential that injured workmen will not be stampeded between now and the passage of this Bill by the activities of insurance companies which may try to start a campaign of redemption.  We have known of cases in the past where workmen were severely handicapped in relation to their claims.  We know the difficulties that confronted them.</P>
    <P>Deputies on both sides of the House referred to the danger of malingering. If there is one section of the community which can never get away with anything <Col N="572" /> in that respect it is the ordinary working classes.  The professional classes, manufacturers and others, can get away with certain things, but the hammer is always ready to come down on the unfortunate worker when there is any question of malingering.  It is vitally important, therefore, to have this fact brought to the notice of these workers who up to the present time have had to depend on a maximum of about 50/- a week so that they would know it between now and the passing of this Bill.  We want to get this measure through, and we do not intend waiting for the decisions of this committee, as mentioned in this amendment, so that in the meantime these workers will not find themselves put in an unfortunate position through an accident.</P>
    <P>I think it will be agreed these are not men of the type that Deputy Rooney mentioned were coming out well as regards compensation in England. We all know that in the case of any worker who meets with an injury if we were to take the percentage of his wages which he gets as a result of the accident in relation to his own true wages before the accident, no member of this House would like to place himself in the position of one of these injured men.  Therefore, if we would not wish ourselves or anybody belonging to us to be put in that unfortunate category it is about time we would say to those workers outside that we want to get them out of it.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, having clearly indicated the increase in the average percentage alone that the insurance companies have made out of all this between the years 1942 and 1952, and in view of the high percentage allocated for management and commission and expenses in relation to the percentage paid out by them, we want to say to the Minister, in congratulating him for the introduction of this important measure, that the sooner it becomes law the sooner it will protect these people who even at this present moment are in the position that the insurance companies are trying to &ldquo;come the heavy&rdquo; on them through redemption.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad the <Col N="573" /> Minister introduced this Bill and I am particularly interested in the increase in weekly payments.  I think that at a time when trade union congresses and others are seeking increases in wages to meet the cost of living it is only right that the injured man should get some increase in his weekly payments to help him to provide for his wife and family, or even if he is a single man, to help him to provide for himself.  Surely, when a man is injured or knocked out he is more in need of help than when he is working and drawing his full pay.  He is just as much in need of money and his family require to be fed when he is injured just as when he is drawing his full wages.  In my opinion this Bill should provide, without taking the 40/- into account, for a wife and two children as well.</P>
      <P>We all know that there is no use in saying that it will all fall on the employers. It should not.  We all know when wages are increased, employers are paying higher premiums and the insurance companies are not giving anything extra.  Deputy Jack Lynch and myself put down a question about a month ago asking what the different rates of compensation were and the average weekly pay of industrial workers and agricultural workers.  In August, 1934, the workmen's compensation was 30/- a week and the wages&mdash; the nearest date I got for industrial workers was October, 1938&mdash;were 54/11. In 1943 compensation was increased to 37/6 a week, and in 1943 the industrial worker's average weekly pay was 64/6. There was an increase of 10/- a week, practically, and the insurance companies were drawing increased premiums for all those years on increased wages because the employer has to pay so much per cent. on wages and every increase in wages, if the workmen's compensation is not increased, means a higher premium for the insurance companies without giving anything extra in the way of benefit&mdash;I am referring to weekly payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In January, 1949, the Government at the time increased the 37/6 to 50/- and the average industrial worker's wages at the nearest date I could get, which <Col N="574" /> was October, 1948, were £5 5s. a week, so that the insurance companies were being paid on £5 5s. a week by the employers and until January, 1949, they only had to pay the same thing notwithstanding the fact that wages had gone from 64/6 to £5 5s.  They were drawing increased premiums from the employers all this time.  In October, 1953, the Government at that time added on the 12/- for a wife and 14/-for two children, or 7/- each.  But wages in 1952 were £6 6s. and in between the insurance companies, because of the increases in wages, were drawing increased premiums on the increased amount paid out by employers. I believe that the insurance companies charges for premiums, as well as the extra money they drew in between when there was an increase in compensation, generally increased the premiums by about 15 per cent. making full&mdash;or perhaps better than full&mdash;pro-vision for whatever increase was given in wages, notwithstanding that wages had been building up all that time and that they were drawing on increased wages.  I think that requires very careful investigation by the Minister who is responsible for those insurance premiums, and if the matter is investigated seriously the increase should not fall so heavily on the employers at all.</P>
    <P>If this Bill had been brought in&mdash;I heard Deputy Dockrell speaking about it a while ago&mdash;the builders providers and other employers in Dublin would have to pay increased premiums on the 9/6 or whatever increase the workers were given, and the workers would get no benefit at all, but the insurance companies would get the benefit.  We are now bringing in this Bill at a time when everybody expects increases in wages and if we fix this rate of compensation at 90/- a week the insurance companies will base their premiums on that, but when the increase in pay comes, the insurance companies will draw a percentage on the increased amount of wages.  I think that must be investigated.</P>
    <P>Many people are talking of a comprehensive insurance Bill.  I remember that at the end of 1948 when the then Government was introducing an increase <Col N="575" /> in workmen's compensation, I heard Deputy Larkin saying he would vote for it because it was only a temporary measure.  After all, that is six or seven years ago and we are still waiting, although we have had two Governments, for this comprehensive Bill.  I do not know if any Government is serious about having such a comprehensive Bill.  I think the matter should be dealt with in something the same way as the other social benefits. I cannot see why it is that you have a ceiling of, say, 90/- a week for an industrial worker earning about £9 a week and sometimes more, with the compensation at £4 10s. a week, while the man earning £5 or £5 10s. a week would get practically the same compensation, although the other man's employer was paying twice as much in premiums.  Surely there is something unjust in that.  It is unjust, in my opinion, to that employer in that, although he pays twice as much in premiums, his man will get only the same as the man earning £5 or £5 10s. a week.</P>
    <P>Nobody can say that the compensation awarded to a man at present is sufficient to maintain him and his wife and family.  Some people will say: &ldquo;If he is out sick, he will only get so much in national health benefit.&rdquo;  That is probably not enough either, but the fact is that the man in this case is injured doing his employer's work, through no fault of his own, and he is entitled to sufficient to enable him and his wife and family at least to exist.  I know of any number of cases in Cork.  We have several dockers who were injured and they have been for years trying to live on these miserable allowances after many years of hard work.  I think it is entirely wrong, and, while I congratulate the Minister on the introduction of this Bill, I feel that it does not go far enough.</P>

      <P>I was delighted to hear <Col N="576" /> Deputy McGrath's very fine speech and disgusted to hear Deputy Allen's, because, when one hears a Deputy on the opposite side discussing a measure introduced by the Government, minimising the good that will flow from it and magnifying, by using amazing figures which I am quite sure he could not have checked up on, the impact it will have on the rent of a house and so on, one immediately begins to go a little further than surmising that behind it all there is possibly another headline in the <i>Irish Press.</i>  I will say no more about politics.</P>
      <P>As an employer in a very small way, I felt, on reading the Bill, that it was a question first and last of a moral obligation.  Everybody agrees that 50/- a week was not a sum on which a man with a wife and family could exist, if he were injured in the course of his work, and therefore, when one saw the increase suggested, one had to look to see whether or not there was a moral obligation to give this increase, even to the extent of hardly counting the cost. I have heard to-night comparisons between the worker drawing national health insurance of 50/- or unemployment benefit and the worker who will now draw £4 10s. per week, if he is injured and I think the comparison is not fair.</P>
      <P>We would all like to see national health insurance increased, if it were possible, and to see unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance increased, but that is a very different thing.  National health insurance is something designed to help a worker when he is ill.  The worker himself has a moral obligation to his wife and family to provide something from each week's wages, when he is working, against the eventuality of illness or to insure himself against this eventuality, as he can do.  Similarly, there is an obligation on him to provide for the possibility of unemployment, but who has the obligation to provide for the possibility of injury in the course of his work?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After a long deliberation, after discussing it with a few people and turnover in my mind exactly what would be the impact upon industry and agriculture and what would be the impact <Col N="577" /> upon the consuming public, I decided that a moral obligation lies on the employer. How he passes it on is a matter of competition and a matter of the possibility of his passing it on in his particular occupation.  A liability exists for the employer to provide at least what will give a modest living to the insured employee.</P>
    <P>I think the comparison that exists is really not a comparison between the man on national health insurance of 50/- per week and the man who is injured, but between the man who employs men and sets them to do work for profit for himself and the man who takes his car on the road and drives thereon.  If the man on the road with his car hits a breadwinner or anybody else, he must, if he is a decent man, recognise that he has a moral obligation to be insured and to such an extent that the incapacity of the person injured does not leave him in a position in which he cannot provide for himself and his wife and family.  An employer has the same moral obligation and therefore I welcome Section 4 in which the amount which a man who is injured can secure is increased to £4 10s. per week.</P>
    <P>I welcome Section 6 in which the juvenile dependency age is increased from 15 to 16 years and I welcome Section 9 in which the date from which insurance is payable to children and dependents of a deceased workman is changed from the date of the decision in court to the date of death.  I think that is fair, because if the wife of a deceased workman, on the day after the husband has been buried, has to go to the local grocer's shop or any other shop to buy the necessaries of life, she has to pay for them, so that I think the liability does exist from the date of death.</P>
    <P>I raised one matter on the Factories Bill here and I was referred by the Minister for Industry and Commerce to the amendment of the Workmen's Compensation Act.  I refer to the matter of occupational diseases, such as dermatitis and other diseases.  I will not do a thing about it because I have not studied the Bill sufficiently to be competent to do so, but I should like to hear the Minister on <Col N="578" /> occupational diseases and whether or not there is a liability on the employer to provide for them.</P>
    <P>There were a number of comments made with which I do not agree.  I do not agree with Deputy Kyne's statement that in many cases the interests of working people are subordinated to the economy of the country.  I think that is literally impossible.  The economy of the country must provide for working people, and, while one could go too far, justice does exist and the interests of working people are not so subordinated. Neither do I agree with Deputy Kyne that the employer is incidental.  I believe that a moral obligation rests upon the employer and his decision should be that this Bill is a good one and that he must meet it as best he can, whether by passing on the cost, by further exertions on his own part or greater efficiency in the work of his employees.  I do not think the employer is incidental.  We are asking something of him and we should ask it in a nice way.  He is not the lord or master, but at the same time he has responsibilities.</P>
    <P>You cannot give responsibility without also giving power and you cannot achieve power without, at the same time, taking responsibility.  Therefore, I think a moral obligation exists on employers in this country to make better provision for their workers.  This Bill seeks to do that.  Insurance companies or somebody else may come between, but this Bill is an honest and a good effort on the part of the Minister.  I congratulate him and I think that in the years to come we shall have occasion to congratulate him again and again on the passing of this very excellent Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. MacCarthy Mr. MacCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>When we were debating this matter only two years ago, many of us anticipated that we would have had the comprehensive Bill under discussion in this House long ago. However, realising the many difficulties which have been put before the House in this debate, I think the Minister is wise in the attitude he is taking of increasing the benefits and of considering <Col N="579" /> then what is best for a comprehensive measure.</P>
      <P>There is no use in approaching this matter on the false premise, so to speak, that because the money problems have not been solved the injured worker must remain on the old standards. We cannot treat a human being and his family as we would treat a machine that might perhaps get smashed up irreparably and be thrown on the scrap heap because nobody cared any more about it.  If a man falls off a scaffolding and injures his spine, or if a man is working for the county council and a chip of stone flies and he loses his eye, it is unreasonable to expect such men, surviving in pain, to continue for many months drawing benefits which are only about half their wages.  It is unreasonable to expect that, over a period, they and their families would have to do without the wages which they would earn if they were in normal health.</P>
      <P>When the day comes when, perhaps, they are able to resume work the question arises as to whether they are going to get any benefits at all or whether they are going to be cast aside and have to seek somewhere else for employment which, but for their accident, would have been permanent.  They are placed in that position by reason of their disability so that they have neither wages nor prospects in the end. This House should provide against that state of affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know a man who fell off a scaffolding some time ago.  He injured his back. That man has a very big family but he has had to survive on the old benefits because Deputy Dr. Ryan's increased benefits were not in force then.  I know another man who was working for the county council and, in unloading stones, a chip broke off and hit him in the eye and he lost his eye last October.  That man was depending on these benefits to support his family.  When the time came when he might be able to resume duty he was told there was no such thing as compensation for the loss of a vital organ and he will be working under that disability for the remainder of his life.  No provision under existing Acts, as far as I know, would enable <Col N="580" /> him to get any lump sum payment even to compensate him for the difference between the wages he would have earned and the benefits he received over all these months.</P>
    <P>I believe the proper solution is to work it in as part of the social welfare scheme eventually where there is a contribution from the State, from the employer or from the insurance company and from the worker himself so that the benefits he would receive would bear a very high relation to his wages.  Is the giving of, say, four-fifths of his wages a kind of deterrent to him?  Is it another way of saying to him: &ldquo;Be careful and do not get injured because, if you do, you will get in benefits only four-fifths of what you are now earning, and perhaps you may live in pain for the rest of your life&rdquo; and so forth?  With so many machines of every kind and description now in use, the risks are increasing day by day and the standard of skill demanded from the worker is getting higher and higher.</P>
    <P>To my mind, the quicker we get this Bill through and give those increased benefits the better, and the sooner we shall be able to settle down to make up our minds as to how these cases will be provided for in the future.  The more will be thought of us outside when it is realised that we are considering the people who are giving their time and their labour&mdash;in some cases the work is more risky than in other cases&mdash;for the advantage of the general community. We who are elected by the general community and who are legislating for the State in perhaps every aspect of life should not forget that our first obligations ought to be to those who, through their labour and their industry and through no fault of their own, become disabled.</P>
    <P>There is no reason why their families should suffer in consequence.  They should have an opportunity of bringing up their families in decent comfort and without impairing their prospects in life.  If we do not do something in this House to provide against these eventualities and to help to get the best efforts from our community&mdash; knowing that this Legislature is looking after their interests&mdash;then we are not fulfilling our purpose.</P>

      <P>I shall be very brief as I do not want to hold up the passage of this Bill.  The increase in benefit in this Bill is very much overdue. If employment conditions become onerous as a result of this measure that will not allow us to evade the real issue which is that the insured worker must be more fully protected.  The insurance companies may have to be dealt with if they do not act reasonably and, if they do not, we may have to consider State insurance.  The social responsibility to the injured worker cannot be evaded by us.  I welcome this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>My main objection to this Bill is one which the Minister referred to in his opening statement when he said it was not intended in any way to be a comprehensive measure.  Welcome as this Bill is, and necessary as are the increases in compensation, I think the Bill will have the effect of delaying this very much needed comprehensive measure.  When the last Government set up a parliamentary committee to go into the matter I felt at that time that it was about ten years overdue.</P>
      <P>In introducing the Bill, the Minister debated to some extent, for the benefit of the House, whether the committee that should examine the Bill should be a parliamentary one or an outside one or a mixture of both.  Perhaps the mixture would be more desirable. Then one can be sure of being able to invite some specialists in workmen's compensation, not only from the point of view of court litigation but from the practical side.  I refer to employers and insurance company officials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe it is necessary to have not only a comprehensive measure but a committee that will examine the position and suggest to the Minister what the measure should embrace and that that committee should be as representative as possible.  There are aspects of the code in its operation which might be forgotten by one interest or another, but by having together all the interests, those it affects and those it helps, I believe that in the long run this tidying-up now long overdue, will at last be introduced.  No one will seriously <Col N="582" /> oppose the Bill but I hope that it will not have the effect of postponing this comprehensive measure.</P>
    <P>There are many aspects of workmen's compensation in its operation that need remedying, as anyone who has been dealing with it in the courts or as an employer or as an insurance official is well aware.  It is difficult to discuss those points adequately in dealing with such a measure as is before the House.  I do not think that the Minister intended that speeches of that nature should be delivered here. On the other hand, he has suggested that he is open to hear any constructive criticisms or constructive suggestions that individual Deputies may have to offer.</P>
    <P>The trouble now is that we have a series of Workmen's Compensation Acts, starting in 1934&mdash;the first one enacted in this country, taking over from the British Act of 1906.  Nothing was done in regard to amending legislation until an Emergency Powers Order was introduced during the emergency, increasing the maximum from 30/- to 37/6.  The 1948 Act increased it further and the 1953 Act had, as its main provisions, the introduction of supplemental allowances and the increase of the maximum lump sum compensation in death cases.  I believe that each one of those should have gone further and instead of making a piecemeal attempt to tidy up this code they should have tried to remedy the defects that were apparent at the time of their individual introduction.</P>
    <P>The main provision in this Bill is the increase in the maximum from 50/- to 90/- and the abolition of the supplemental allowances introduced by Section 3 of the 1953 Act.  The Minister rightly observed that that abolition will not have the effect of reducing the compensation of anyone who was benefiting by Section 3, because Section 3 put a limit on the amount of compensation with supplementals to 75 per cent. of the pre-accident earnings.  I still believe that the man who has a family&mdash;and many workmen who are in receipt of workmen's compensation have to support not only a wife but often a very large family&mdash;should get some extra benefits over and above the <Col N="583" /> single man.  The single man in receipt of his maximum weekly compensation, whether it be 50/- or 90/-, is in a much stronger position to resist any offers&mdash; often inadequate&mdash;for compromising his claim by the insurance company.</P>
    <P>I do not think we are all innocent enough not to know that insurance companies make their offers and cut off payment of weekly compensation at the time which suits their own purpose best.  They may not do it from any inhuman point of view, but I am sure they do it from the business point of view.  We find often that a man who has been in receipt of workmen's compensation over a period, based on total incapacity, finds&mdash;possibly coming towards the legal long vacation&mdash;that his payment is terminated.  In the ordinary course, the remedy for the workman then is to go to court by way of originating summons.  An originating summons provides for a hearing not less than 21 days after the summons is issued, which means that a man whose compensation is cut off late in June or early in July will not have time to have his case before the Circuit Court until possibly late in October. In the meantime, he finds himself at the mercy of the butcher, the baker and the candlestick-maker and when he is about at the end of his tether from the point of view of getting credit, the insurance company makes a lump sum offer which is very tempting to the man with a family.</P>
    <P>Naturally, he will hope that the injury from which he now suffers may not be as bad as his doctor or himself anticipated. He might be induced, by the pressure of bills, to accept the sum, or possibly a little more, offered by the insurance company and so compromise for all time his right to receive workmen's compensation in respect of the injury which he suffered.  These sums are very often less than what his claim is really worth.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether that position can be remedied or how it can be remedied. I do not see that the Minister could provide legislation that would oblige insurance companies not to cut off weekly compensation at a time which is most inopportune for the <Col N="584" /> recipient.  Nevertheless, he could at least cushion the most deserving cases, that is, the man with a large family, by making some extra provision for the maintenance of his children.  In such a case if the maximum sum is increased it will not affect the man who is in receipt of a supplemental allowance, but it will give the single man and the single woman the edge, so to speak, from the point of view of negotiating and withstanding offers from the insurance company, over the married man.</P>
    <P>With regard to the section which empowers the workman as well as the employer to go to court to have the weekly payment compromised into one based on this annuity table, this provision is long overdue.  Up to the present, under existing legislation, the one-sided policy that the right of going to the court and having a sum fixed on a basis of total permanent incapacity was reserved only to the employer, was unfair to the workman.  In so far as Section 8 seeks to give a similar right to the workman it is a step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, I do not think I can agree entirely with the provision in sub-section (3) where a man, once he has been in receipt of compensation for six months, whether the injury is going to be permanent or otherwise, can go and have his weekly compensation assessed in the form of a lump sum and then receive that sum as determined by the court.  Rightly, of course, the court is given certain discretion but I think that particular sub-section is bringing the court nearer to the common law court and the big difficulty is that in some cases, perhaps, where a workman decides to go to the court under this sub-section and receives an award from the judge which he considers inadequate or, on the other hand, which the employer might consider too much, I do not think there is any right of appeal.  I would like the Minister to look into that.</P>
    <P>I think the right of appeal against a decision under the Workmen's Compensation Act at the present day is confined to matters which are legal questions.  If the court makes a finding of fact in workmen's compensation <Col N="585" /> I do not think that is appealable.  I presume that the court, having assessed the value of a weekly compensation payment to an injured workman and having made its award, the award will be final unless the Minister can indicate to me that there is some way in which the injured workman who is aggrieved, or the employer, can appeal the judge's award.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter which I think should be dealt with in this Bill. Pre-accident earnings are assessed on wages earned by a workman under what is described as a contract of employment. If the man in receipt of certain weekly wages is able to supplement those wages by taking small contracts&mdash;I have a case in mind&mdash;these supplemental receipts that he gets, earnings for himself, are not taken into consideration when his pre-accident weekly wages are being determined by the court for the purposes of assessing compensation.</P>
    <P>There are many men throughout the country who are tradesmen&mdash;whether they are men who have served their time or not I do not know, and it does not matter for the purposes of this case &mdash;and who often get work from the county council on roads.  Especially nowadays when county councils are trying to preserve the particular beauty of many places, to keep any new walls in line with existing walls when they take away corners, there is a lot of stonework and mason work necessary and such men are often employed by county councils and given whatever the appropriate wages are.</P>
    <P>But that particular job for which they are recruited might last for only a matter of weeks.  In the course of that, if such a man is injured his wages are assessed and confined to what he earned either with the council or in some other job under what I have described as a contract of employment.  If for, say, three or four weeks before he got this job with the county council he went to a neighbour and took a contract for the building of a wall or putting on a roof, he could not claim what money he earned in that respect as part of his average weekly earnings his pre-accident earnings, for the purpose of the assessment of his workmen's <Col N="586" /> compensation.  That is one small matter to which the Minister might have had regard, but perhaps it was not adverted to before or possibly during this debate.  It is something that should be looked into and tackled right away.</P>
    <P>As regards Section 11, I have read it but I must confess I have not studied it fully enough to realise the full implications of it.  However, it seems to me that a man, having received workmen's compensation, whether on a weekly basis, or by way of lump sum, can then go before a common law court and get another payment in respect of that injury.  There is an overriding provision in the Bill that he is entitled to this relief so long as his employer does not have to pay twice. I agree that the provision in the 1953 Act left the matter somewhat in doubt and I think the Minister introducing the Bill said that Section 11 was to put it beyond doubt.  Nevertheless the Minister will find possibly that there will be some loopholes, giving rise to litigation, which might require further amendment, further consideration or further expansion.</P>
    <P>The Second and Fifth Schedules are referred to in this Act as well and the maximum sums payable are brought more into line, as the Minister said, with present-day demands, concurrent prices, etc.  But these schedules are so involved that it is about time that a more simple method of working out children's lump sum payments was evolved.  Even the most experienced of lawyers find great difficulty in working out what the payment should be for children having regard to their ages and the number of months to their attainment of 15 years from the date of death of their deceased father or mother as the case may be.  It was simple enough in the case of total dependency but when it comes down to partial dependency it is rather involved. Having regard to the purpose which workmen's compensation is supposed to serve, some more simple method should be evolved so as to make assessments of what their claims are worth more simple.</P>
    <P>It often happens that offers of settlement are made by insurance companies <Col N="587" /> or by employers, as the case may be, in death cases and if there is a doubt, first of all, whether the death arose as a result of an accident in the course of the person's work and where there is a doubt about the degree of dependency, it is very difficult to advise an applicant&mdash;usually a widow and her children &mdash;whether she should accept the sum offered.  It is, of course, impossible to provide against the case when it is a matter for medical evidence whether or not the death arose out of the accident but in the matter of working out the appropriate lump sum it is always a matter for the court.</P>

    <Title>Committee on Finance. - Adjournment Debate&mdash;Kilkenny County Registrar.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, when I heard the Minister's reply to-day to Question No. 26 on the Order Paper, I informed you that I was not satisfied with it.  The county registrar in Kilkenny was appointed in 1926 and he reaches the age limit on the 20th June, 1955.  He made application to the Minister for an extension so that he might get the full 30 years' service which would enable him to qualify for full pension.  For some reason or other the Minister has refused to grant that extension.  This action of the Minister is unprecedented.  This is the first time in the history of the State that an extension recommended by the Department was refused by the Minister. It is obvious that when the Act was being framed provision was made to have this matter left in the hands of the Minister&mdash;to give him full discretion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason for that is obvious because the position of county registrar requires a very suitable person, a person who is tactful, resourceful and of the highest integrity, and we know it is very difficult to find a person with all these qualifications under the age of 35 years.  Consequently, in many cases when a registrar is being appointed, he is over 35 years of age.  In order <Col N="588" /> to give that man an opportunity of getting a full pension the Minister has been given the discretionary power of extending his years of service.  If, for instance, this man had been guilty of any offence&mdash;not an offence, maybe, but perhaps dereliction of duty in his office&mdash;and if there is any reason why his services should be terminated, then the Minister is perfectly right in refusing to grant the extension.  But no such case is being made here.  Over the past 28 years this man has given entire satisfaction to successive Ministers for Justice.</P>
    <P>Now, what qualities had this man in the first instance to qualify him for this position?  In 1917 he was a very young solicitor and when Mr. William T. Cosgrave went to Kilkenny to contest a by-election in that year there were nine or ten solicitors practising in the city but there was not one of them who would volunteer to act as Mr. Cosgrave's election agent. Mr. Kearney stepped into the breach. There was no much kudos for doing that in those days.  Again in 1921, in the May elections of that year, he was again election agent for the Sinn Féin candidates.  Being an election agent at that time was tantamount to carrying a gun.  That was shortly prior to the truce.  In 1922, Mr. Kearney acted as election agent for the late Mr. Patrick Gaffney of Carlow, a Labour candidate who received the greatest number of votes ever received in the Carlow-Kilkenny constituency.</P>
    <P>All this shows that this man was prepared to take risks, first of all in 1917 and later in 1921.  What is his recompense? He was offered this position in 1926 by the Cumann na nGaedheal Government of that day. Now he wants 12 months to entitle him to his full pension&mdash;he wants an extension to the 1st day of September, 1956.  He qualifies for full pension then, but in the meantime there is some greedy person looking for his job who is denying him the right of qualifying and the Minister is being pushed.  Who is pushing him?  From where does this push come?  I doubt very much if the Labour organisation in Kilkenny has made the recommendation that he should be dispensed with.  I doubt it <Col N="589" /> very much because in his earlier years, when he was practising as a solicitor, Mr. Kearney was the one solicitor that the Labour organisation could rely on to fight their case in Kilkenny.</P>
    <P>Anybody who wishes to go back on the records of County Kilkenny for the period I have mentioned will find that I am telling the Minister the truth.  I know that there is no victimisation from the point of view that the Minister is perfectly entitled to refuse this extension, but I know also that in no case in the history of the State has a man in his position been dealt with in this way, for the obvious reason that some greedy person, somebody not prepared to wait 12 months for his job, is pushing the Minister.  Is this person who is looking for the job afraid that the Coalition Government will not be in office in 1956?  Is the Minister afraid that he himself will not be there to give the job?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1943" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to tell the Minister that there is nobody looking for the job from our side of the House. It is the Minister's prerogative to fill this position, and if he believes he will be Minister in 1956 nothing, except selfishness and greed is compelling him and pushing him from dispensing with Mr. Kearney's services at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1943" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Good propaganda for you, Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no propaganda; there is just a question of justice&mdash;the justice that has been meted out by Fianna Fáil to every registrar irrespective of who appointed them down through the years.  Has any case been made against any registrar in any county?  When the 1926 Act was passed these appointments were made by the Cumann na nGaedheal Government. How many of these registrars have been treated in the way the Minister wishes to treat Mr. Kearney? Look back over the years.  Of course I have no way of knowing whether any man was dispensed with or dismissed. Possibly there were men but is there any case where a man who was tactful, <Col N="590" /> resourceful and of the highest integrity was not given the chance of qualifying for his full pension?  There is no case on record where that happened. Is it not the ambition of every public servant, not matter what position in the service of the State he occupies, to qualify for full pensions? Are people to be denied that now?</P>
      <P>But this man is being denied that right simply because there is somebody looking for his job and because the Minister, I do not know for what reason, is afraid it will not be within his power to give the job in September, 1956.  We are asking only for the same concession as has been given to the men who have acted as county registrars heretofore.  Why should this man be made an example of?  It is unprecedented in the history of this State that a man should be treated in this summary fashion by any Minister for Justice.  I would appeal to the Minister to change his mind on this question, and to review the decision that he has already given, having regard to this man's record down through the years in that no charge has ever been made against him.  He is still active physically, and with all his mental faculties as good as they were when he was appointed.  Yet, he is to be thrown on the dust heap.</P>
      <P>Is this a saving of money for the taxpayers of the country?  Already we have a pensioner in connection with this position.  We have a man who was handed over by the British régime and who was retired in 1926. He is still drawing a pension of £900 a year.  Are we to put another £900 a year on the taxpayers in order to create a job of £1,500 a year for some greedy individual?  This is a question of unnecessary increased expenditure on the taxpayers of the country and you are doing it deliberately to create a job for somebody else.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>If I am I am sorry, but the position is tantamount to what I have said, that a new job is being created and that does not mean any saving to the taxpayers in money. Actually, it will put additional expense <Col N="591" /> on the taxpayers because Mr. Kearney, as I have said, is perfectly well able physically and mentally to do the job that he has been doing for the past 28 years.  I would ask the Minister to review the decision that he has given in his case and to grant the extension.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>When I was told about this by Deputy Walsh I told him, frankly that I did not believe it, and I advised him to go and see the Minister personally, because I knew of no case in which an extension was not given where the Department was satisfied that the person concerned had given good service.  There were two cases&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Deputy is not going to go into qualifications or to mention the name of any person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to mention any name.  The Minister justified his action to-day, when answering the question, by saying that his predecessor &mdash;that is me&mdash;had in two cases refused an extension.  I shall try to deal with them without mentioning any names.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair does not want their qualifications brought in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>All I will say about the two cases in question is this: the Minister has full access to the files and he must be aware of the reasons why the extensions were not given in these two cases.  He must be aware of that, and I will leave it at that.  One of them was a personal friend of mine, appointed by our Government.  I must say that he is a man for whom I have the highest personal regard.  The other was appointed in the time of Mr. Cosgrave's Government.  The Minister knows, apart from these two cases, that during my 11 years as Minister for Justice, I granted extensions, although I agree that pressure was brought to bear on me, very severe pressure by some of our own people not to extend the time for county registrars, because there were undoubtedly on our side solicitors who wanted these jobs.  I said: &ldquo;Let them take their time; this practice has always been followed and <Col N="592" /> I am going to follow it, and when the time expires we can consider the other people.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The very remarkable thing here is the change of attitude on the part of the present Government.  When they were in office before, the position was that district justices were required to retire at the age of 65 years.  As a matter of fact, in 1946 a Bill which I brought in was passed through the House with the special support of the Labour Party requiring that even Dublin district justices would retire at 65.  That was for new appointments, but I think the position with regard to Cork City was different.  That Bill was passed.  When it came to the case of one particular justice&mdash;I had better not attribute any motives&mdash;who never had the right to an extension, a Bill was brought in to make it possible that he would get an extension from year to year until he reached 70 years of age.</P>
      <P>That is the law at present.  We have a reversal of that now.  The practice had always been to give these county registrars an extension up to 70 years if their health and services were satisfactory. Now, apparently they are to go.  I do not know if this is going to apply to the remainder of them, but anyway it is a new departure, and there is a reversal of engines.  It went so far on one occasion, when a gentleman was 70 years of age, that a special section was put in a Bill to extend his service to 72.  Now, we have quite the reverse process taking place.</P>
      <P>I do not know the gentleman in this case, but I think it is a great pity that this should be done because county registrars have the right to expect an extension.  It is specifically mentioned in Section 35 of the 1926 Act that the Minister may do it.  I think that gives a man appointed to this position the right to expect that he will get that extension if his services and health are satisfactory.  I join with Deputy Walsh in asking the Minister to reconsider this, and give this county registrar an extension sufficient at least to enable him to qualify for a full pension.  That is all I have to say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This afternoon, when this matter was before the House, the Minister for <Col N="593" /> Finance made what I consider to be a very serious reflection on my character, on my conduct of affairs in the Department of Justice.  He made some innuendo that I did not understand.  I hope he will be more explicit.  If he goes through the files of the Department and finds that I did anything wrong in my time, I hope he will be explicit about it.  He said something about cars.</P>

      <P>I am sorry for that.  I wish he were, but I shall probably get an opportunity later to do so.  I mention it now because the thing is hot&mdash; it happened to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to disabuse the mind of Deputy Walsh in regard to what he has alleged, that the secretary to the Department had recommended the retention of this gentleman.  I want to state publicly that the secretary to the Department made no recommendation, but on the contrary drew my attention to the fact that in 1953 a serious reprimand had to be made to this gentleman in connection with the state of his office.  For that reason&mdash;and Deputy Boland is well aware of what had taken place in 1953 &mdash;I have decided that as he is going to receive a pension of practically £1,000 a year, he was not satisfactory, and <Col N="594" /> that therefore it was time to call on him to resign.</P>
      <P>In 1953, Deputy Boland, as Minister, with the concurrence of the Department, had an inquiry which reprimanded this gentleman in connection with the sad state of affairs of his office.  This is the man that I am being asked to retain for another year or two.  I am at a loss to understand why there should be such a request made for an extension.</P>
      <P>County registrars are the most pampered officials in the whole Civil Service.  As Deputy Boland is aware, there is no other civil servant, and not even a resident medical officer, who gets an opportunity of retiring on full pension after only 30 years' service. Under the 1926 Act, I think, provision was made that county registrars should retire at 65 years, but the Minister has power, where he is satisfied that the work is being performed satisfactorily, to extend the age limit.  But Deputy Boland now asks me to explain, when he refused to grant an extension to two men.  I am not going to go into the details of that.  There is no doubt about it that Deputy Boland refused to give any reason for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I can show the Deputy the files.  He can accept my word for it.  You had good grounds for not granting an extension of one gentleman's time.  I agree with that, because, if I or any Minister had been in a similar position, we would have done the same as Deputy Boland.  In the second case, he gave no specific reason whatsoever for refusing to grant an extension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister will give me an opportunity of going into that later on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt at all, and I agree with the Deputy.  With regard to the officer concerned, his work was not considered satisfactory, and his continuing in office beyond the normal time for retirement would not be in the public interest.  I prefer not to go any further in this case.  I am <Col N="595" /> not going into its merits.  I am satisfied that if Deputy Walsh and Deputy Boland cast their minds back to 1953, they will see that they have not justified a case for bringing this matter up. As I said, this gentleman is retiring on practically £1,000 a year.  I believe it is in the public interest to get him to retire at the present time, and thereby have no further complaints from the Department in connection with the administration of his office.</P>
      <P>Deputy Walsh got very vocal, and alleged that somebody is greedy for the job.  I have not been pushed, other than by the information I get in the Department.  I know of nobody looking for the job and, up to the present, I have not been approached.  I do not know whether anyone in Kilkenny is aware of it.  Probably, when it comes to an appointment, Deputy Walsh's forecast will not be correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not made any forecast yet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Walsh says that this man was appointed by the Cumann na nGaedheal Government and that he was also an election agent for a member of the Party of which I am a member.  If there was any concession to be given, without interfering with public administration, you would imagine that, if influence had been brought to bear on me, it would have been with the support of the Labour Party instead of Fine Gael.  Of course, I would have been influenced to extend his time had I been satisfied that it was in the public interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad that Deputy Walsh pointed <Col N="596" /> out that it was not a political case. It was also pointed out that he was a member of the Cumann na nGaedheal Government and of the Labour Party. Had I been able to find any reasonable excuse at all, I would have retained him in office, but as Deputy Boland must know, the work of the county registrar is very important.  It may be that there will be cases in future when I will refuse to continue men in office in the same way.  There are other men who are doing their work satisfactorily. I am not worrying about their politics.  So long as they give satisfaction to the public, then the Minister has power to grant an extension to entitle them to a pension.</P>
    <P>There might be a case made if this man was aged when he went into the position, and was retiring on only a few hundred pounds of a pension per year, with a young family to rear.  But here is a man with whom, I am sure, no Deputy in the House will show any great sympathy, nor consider it a grievance that he should be confronted with retirement on practically £1,000 a year.  I think other civil servants would be pleased and delighted to get an opportunity of retiring on the pension of this gentleman, after service in the administration.  I want to say to Deputy Boland that I have acted in good faith.  But what happened in 1953 shows that the gentleman concerned has not been satisfactory, and for that reason alone, I decided, in the public interest, not to extend his period of service.</P>
