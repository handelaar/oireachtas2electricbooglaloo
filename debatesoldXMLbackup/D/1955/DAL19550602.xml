    <Title>Finance Bill, 1955&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Sweetman) Gerard Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Sweetman)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The main purpose of this Bill, as the House is aware, with one exception&mdash;an important exception &mdash;is to translate into legislative form, where legislation is necessary, the budgetary proposals for the current financial year.  The exception is, of course, the increase in the old age, in the blind and in widows' and orphans' pensions, for which separate legislation is required and has already been introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Finance Bill also contains a certain number of technical additional provisions, which it was not necessary to go into in the Budget, but which I shall now explain as I go along.  The debate on the Budget concluded only very recently and I, therefore, do not propose, at this stage, on the Second Reading of this Bill, to go into the sections in any elaborate way but merely to enumerate their purpose and give a brief account of their contents.  We shall have an ample opportunity for detailed <Col N="598" /> discussion on the Committee Stage, if that is desired.</P>
    <P>Part I of the Bill, as usual, deals with the income-tax code.  Section 1 reimposes the same rates of income-tax and surtax as were in force in the year ending 31st March last.  The remaining sections deal with matters to which I made reference in the financial statement.</P>
    <P>Section 2 increases the deduction which a taxpayer is entitled to make in respect of qualified children from £85 to £100 for each child.</P>
    <P>Section 3 extends the exemption from income-tax for charities so as to relieve the profits of a trade exercised in the carrying out of the primary purpose of the charity.</P>
    <P>Section 4 authorises the deduction from income-tax before income-tax liability is computed, of insurance premiums paid to provide for the expenses of medical care and attention in case of sickness.  In respect of that section, I would draw the attention of the House to the fact that the phrase &ldquo;authorised insurer&rdquo; is used in sub-section (1) and is defined later in the section.  That has the effect of relating it to the definitions that are in the Insurance Act, 1936, and it will therefore include the scheme that is operated by the Irish National Teachers' Organisation.  Deputies will see that that is clear from the wording that is followed in the second section when relating to the Act of 1936.</P>
    <P>Section 5 extends to future stock issues of local authorities the privilege of being able to pay dividends without deduction of income-tax at source. That does not mean that interest on stocks of local authorities to be created in the future are tax free.  It merely means that that interest will be payable without deduction of the tax at source and it will be assessable on Schedule D in the ordinary way.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Bill contains four relieving sections in respect of customs and excise.  The first section in this part, Section 6, increases from 30/- to £2 per standard barrel the rebate that is allowed to each brewer on the first <Col N="599" /> 5,000 barrels of beer brewed by him in any year and in this regard the year commences on 1st July and this section will be effective as from the year commencing 1st July, 1954.  The House will remember that I announced that I was making that concession for the purpose of assisting the employment that these small breweries give locally and so to try to make my contribution towards their being enabled to carry on satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>Section 7 reduces from 35 per cent. to 25 per cent. the minimum proportion of a cine-variety programme in a patent theatre which must consist of a personal performance so that the entertainment may qualify for the 30 per cent. repayment of entertainment duty allowable under the Finance Act of 1948, sub-section (10), Section 4, paragraph C.  The House is aware that in patent theatres there is a provision by virtue of which they have to pay less entertainment duties if they put on a live performance to the extent of a proportion of the show.  This is a change to enable them to alter the period of time they devote to the live shows.</P>
    <P>Section 8 of the Bill revokes the customs duty on galvanised corrugated iron or steel which has been suspended since 1942.  In the absence of such a provision it would automatically come into force again next year with the lapse of the Supplies and Services (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1946.  It has been announced that this Act will not be reintroduced next year.</P>
    <P>Section 9 has three purposes.  It provides, in the first instance, as announced, that the £8 excise duty applicable to agricultural tractors used on public roads for the baulage of goods without reward shall also apply as from the 1st July, 1955, to agricultural tractors using a carry-all or other detachable container for the conveyance of goods without reward.  As things are at present the attachment of such a device transforms the tractor into a goods vehicle making it liable for duty at the higher rate appropriate to that type of vehicle.  For example if it is one and a quarter tons weight it is liable to a duty of £34.  The <Col N="600" /> ordinary tractor can carry much more in a trailer at the £8 rate than could be carried in the detachable container so that it would be inequitable to leave the law as it stands at present.</P>
    <P>In the second place the section carries out the announcement which I made in the financial statement, that is that agricultural tractors used for hauling milk, separated milk and containers to and from creameries for reward will be subject to duty only at the £8 rate.  Provision is made in the section for a refund of the duty where a tractor qualifying for this relief has already been taxed for the full period up till 31st December last.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill contains four sections dealing with death duties. The first of these, Section 10, provides for confirmation of the agreement with the Government of Canada, signed on 28th October last, for the avoidance of double taxation on the estates of deceased persons.  The agreement is set forth in the First Schedule of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 11 provides that, where property is being taken out of settlement, the trustees may obtain from the Revenue Commissioners a certificate of the prospective amount of estate duty for which they, as trustees, may become accountable.  This will enable trusts to be wound up in certain cases, but I should explain that should the amount of the duty be found later to exceed the amount specified in the certificate the trustees will not be liable for the excess but the beneficiaries, who have received the funds, will still remain liable and such excess must be paid by them.</P>
    <P>The effect of Section 12 is to take all assurance policies contracted for by a deceased person on his own life for the benefit of other persons, and in such terms that he himself could take no interest in the policy moneys, and to aggregate them together for the purpose of ascertaining the appropriate rate of duty to apply to each of the policies.  The reason for this section is to combat a scheme for the legal avoidance of duty whereby an individual desiring to insure himself for £10,000 takes out five policies each for £2,000, <Col N="601" /> which is the estate duty exemption limit.  As the law stands, on the death of that person, each of these policies would form an estate in itself and no duty whatever would be payable in respect of those five policies.  It is to avoid the operation of such a scheme in the future that we are making this provision in Section 12.</P>
    <P>Section 13, on the other hand, is a relieving section which limits the application of the aggregation rule. Under the existing law, if a person's own free estate exceeds £2,000 it is aggregated for estate duty purposes with any settled estate in which he had an interest and, accordingly, becomes liable to the higher rate of duty.  Under Section 13 the aggregate will not apply where the net value of the free estate of the deceased does not exceed £10,000.  That is to say it is being extended from £2,000 to £10,000 in relief of the existing provisions. There is also the usual provision here for marginal relief as exists in many death duty cases.</P>
    <P>Part IV, and Sections 14 and 15 in Part IV are concerned with the Canadian double taxation agreement. They are for the purpose of giving effect here under our domestic law to that agreement.  Again, the agreement in this case is set forth in the Second Schedule to this Bill.</P>
    <P>Part V refers to two matters affecting stamp duty to which I made reference in the financial statement. In Section 16 I have provided for the repeal of the stamp duty on the certificate of notories public which became consequential on the enactment of the Solicitors Bill last winter. Section 17 provides that credit sale agreements will be brought into line with hire purchase agreements for stamp duty purposes.</P>
    <P>The remaining four sections of the Bill which are contained in Part VI are now the normal sections.  Section 18 makes the usual amortisation arrangement in respect of borrowing for voted &ldquo;capital services&rdquo; in 1954-55 and 1955-56.  The necessary repeals are provided for in Section 19 and in the Third Schedule to the Bill.  The repeal of Section 5 of the Finance <Col N="602" /> (Miscellaneous) Provisions Act, 1935, and of Section 23 of the Finance Act, 1938, abolished the bounties on tobacco made from home-grown leaf and on sugar made from home-grown beet which were introduced in 1935 to compensate exporters in particular for the higher duty-free cost of such commodities as compared with the imported products.  The tobacco bounty was suspended under the Emergency Powers Act.  No bounty has been paid in either case since 1943.  Tobacco has virtually ceased to be grown here and sugar ceased to be liable to duty in 1946.  With the lapse of the Supplies and Services (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1946, the original legislative provisions would be revised and, in the circumstances, their repeal is now proposed.</P>
    <P>That concludes a very brief review of the sections of the Bill and the Schedules are those to which reference is made in the sections, and to which I have referred.  In view of the fact that the debate on the financial statement was so recent I do not think that any further or more detailed statement is required at this stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is remarkable, not for what is in it but for what is not in it.  I suppose those innocent people down the country who believed all the Coalition spokesmen told them at the last general election thought that when this Bill was issued and circulated to the Dáil that there would be sections relating to beer duties, spirit duties, duties on tobacco and duties on petrol.  These sections are conspicuous by their absence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If one might try to find a description for this document&mdash;though, of course, it is not a sample of the most expert versification&mdash;one might describe it as almost an Elegy on the Disappointed Taxpayer.  Appropriately enough to-day we can apply to those who voted for the Coalition, particularly to those who voted for Fine Gael, a well-known line, indeed a hackneyed line, from Lycidas, for it is most opposite, &ldquo;That the hungry sheep&rdquo;&mdash; the Fine Gael sheep&mdash;&ldquo;look up and are not fed.&rdquo;  Where in this Bill are the tax reductions which were <Col N="603" /> promised us?  So far from there being any tax reductions in this Bill there are new provisions&mdash;at least one provision&mdash;to harrow the taxpayer, to pursue him even beyond the grave; for that is the purpose of Section 12.  If a man in his lifetime has been astute and intelligent enough to devise a means whereby those who are heirs of his body&mdash;his own children, to whom he has a special responsibility&mdash;will secure a reasonable share of his estate after death, a means whereby the grasping and avaricious hand of the Minister may be prevented from taking what the person who made the money, worked for it and who owns the money thinks should belong to his children, a means of thwarting the Minister in pursuit of this property, the Minister has now come along and made certain under Section 12 that what belongs to the children will pass into the Central Fund.</P>
    <P>Hitherto there has been no evasion of the tax law.  Let us make no mistake about this.  This Section 12 is not to punish crime; it is not designed to penalise an offender.  This Section 12 creates a new offence, if one may put it that way.  It is designed to ensure that a man who, as I said, is astute and intelligent enough to find a way to distribute his property or some small portion of it&mdash;because, of course, the amount involved is inconsiderable&mdash; equitably between his children will be stopped from doing this for the benefit of his own posterity.</P>
    <P>There are one or two minor reliefs in the Bill.  There is the relief provided in Section 2 which we welcome and which, no doubt, would have been embodied in a Fianna Fáil Budget if it had been introduced this year.  But there is one limiting factor in regard to it to which I would like to direct the Minister's attention and where I think that a minor amendment to the existing law would remove what is to-day an anomaly.  Under a section of the 1920 Act where a child enjoys an income in its own right above a certain figure the taxpayer does not get the benefit of this allowance, or, I think, of a housekeeper's allowance either&mdash;the full benefit of it&mdash;and I <Col N="604" /> would suggest that perhaps the Minister would look into that, and perhaps when he is concluding the debate on this stage he might be in a position to inform the House that he would favourably consider it.</P>
    <P>The other section which is a relief section is Section 7.  Section 7 is designed to secure a rebate in entertainments duty in cases where a certain proportion of the programme consists of what is generally known as &ldquo;a live show.&rdquo;  The section provides that the fraction which entitles the owner of a patent theatre to this concession shall be reduced from 35 per cent. to 25 per cent.  I am not opposed to that.  Quite frankly, if it had been put to me, I suppose I would have asked the Government to accept it, but I am just trying to throw my mind back to my tenure of office from 1951 to 1954 and imagining to myself what the Minister for Health or the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture would say if a Fianna Fáil Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;brought in a section like Section 7&mdash;or, as he is there, and inspired me, the Minister for Social Welfare.  We remember what the Minister for Social Welfare said when, because of the increase in the cost of manufacturing and of raw materials and on the advice of the Prices Advisory Body who are now sending the price of bacon sky-high, we proposed to increase the price of cigarettes by a penny.  We were told then that this penny was being given by the Fianna Fáil Government to the English tobacco monopolists.  That is what we were told by the Minister for Social Welfare.  If we were bringing in this Section 7 to-day and the Minister for Health was sitting on this side and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture was also here, we should be told that under Section 7 we were giving away the taxpayers' money to a millionaire cinema owner.  That is how it would be represented.  I am not saying that, but it is just as well that the public <Col N="605" /> should be reminded of the manner in which perfectly legitimate, reasonable and indeed unavoidable concessions, concessions which were inevitable if the general public interest was to be served, were misrepresented when we had to do things like that in our Finance Bills.</P>
      <P>As I say, if I had been where the Minister is, I would have agreed to this.  Half a loaf is better than no bread and if these people are not enabled to carry on and give such employment as they do now in maintaining a live show at the theatre, it merely means that a great number of people&mdash;stage hands, scenic artists, a great number of people who serve as supers in one way or another, as well as members of the orchestra&mdash;will be thrown out of employment, and I feel that the concession for what it is worth, is justified, if it is going to enable all these employees to remain in their jobs.</P>
      <P>I was saying that this Bill is remarkable not for what is in it, but for what is not in it.  I have already referred to the significant omission of any reference to the duties on beer, spirits, tobacco or petrol, which, if they were reduced to the 1951 figure, were, according to the Taoiseach himself in 1952, going to put £10,000,000 back into the taxpayers' pocket.  In fact, if they were brought back to the 1951 figure, I think the amounts that would go back into the taxpayers' pocket would certainly be very substantially in excess of £10,000,000.  I am not going to say that it would be possible for the Minister to do that.  It would not be possible for him to do it and to maintain public expenditure at the level to which it has been driven, and driven not by Fianna Fáil but by the Coalition since the Coalition took office in June, 1954.  The Minister cannot deny that under several heads he has very considerably and substantially increased public expenditure. Unfortunately, for Deputies and for the general public, the full extent to which he has increased expenditure has not been disclosed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When speaking on the General Resolution the Parliamentary Secretary to the Government told us that he <Col N="606" /> had no doubt that the greatest boon which could be given&mdash;I am not quoting the Parliamentary Secretary exactly&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary undoubtedly led the general public to believe that, in his opinion, the greatest boon which could be conferred upon the community as a whole &mdash;I think he said&mdash;in the general interest would be a reduction of 6d. in the standard rate of income-tax.  He said further it would cost £1,500,000 but that the Minister had not got the £1,500,000.  I am glad to see that the Minister apparently has a public conscience in relation to these matters. Apparently, however, he is not so very strongly opposed to the point of view of the Parliamentary Secretary as perhaps this Budget might lead people to believe, because he went down to Cork and on a public platform, addressing a Fine Gael audience, he devoted&mdash;I do not know exactly how long&mdash;a substantial part of his speech as reported in the newspapers to justifying his omission to reduce the standard rate of income-tax and to confer this greatest boon upon the community as a whole which the Parliamentary Secretary suggested could have been done, if it had not been for something else.  What ground did he defend it on?  He defended it on the basis that he apparently prevented the cost of tea from rising and that he had apparently reduced the price of butter, but he has not prevented the price of <Col N="607" /> bacon from rising, nor the price of bread.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>He could not reduce the standard rate of income-tax, because he had, first of all, restored the subsidy on butter and had restored the subsidy on tea.  I wonder does the Parliamentary Secretary believe that the perpetuation of subsidies is in the general economic or public interest? He may get up here and, speaking as a politician, say, yes, he does.  He may even say it on the hustings, but will he, in his capacity as a professional economist, embody that view in his teachings to his students?</P>
      <P>The really significant thing about the debate on the Budget of 1952 was that the Fine Gael Party were not prepared at that time to pledge themselves to a restoration of subsidies.  They have, of course, changed their minds&mdash; changed their minds perforce, because there is a whip on the box, there is a coachman driving the team.  The whole 50 or more&mdash;I forget how many &mdash;Deputies in the Fine Gael Party have to answer to the crack of the coachman's whip and have to go in whatever direction he may tug the rein.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, those people who voted for Fine Gael in the belief that if they got into power there would be some limit put, some halt called, to the increase in public expenditure&mdash;and, with that halt, that the taxpayer would inevitably benefit&mdash;have been disappointed. Indeed, the policy of reducing expenditure appears to have been abandoned. The real point, however, is <Col N="608" /> that not only did the Government promise a reduction in taxation, but they promised a reduction in the cost of living as well.  Not only did they promise a reduction in taxation and a reduction in the cost of living, but they promised a simultaneous expansion in the social benefits.  They did not say, as they are saying now: we will give you a reduction in taxation or a reduction in the cost of living or an increase in the social services.  Not at all.  They promised all three to the people.</P>
    <P>The actual hard, harsh economic fact is that the cost of living has not been reduced&mdash;that, so far from the cost of living being reduced, it is, as the Americans say, on the up and up.  It is true that the apparent cost to the consumer of butter has been reduced and that the apparent cost to the consumer of tea has been prevented from rising.  However, the real fact of the matter is that the consumer of butter and tea is now paying for these commodities in instalments.  He pays the first instalment to the grocer and he is going to pay the second instalment under this Bill to the Minister for Finance.  There is no blinking of this fact.  The only thing about it is that it is very questionable whether the incidence of the taxation which the Minister has to levy in order to provide the revenue to maintain these subsidies is a just and a fair one.</P>
    <P>Take, for instance, the question of butter.  Who is making the most out of the subsidised butter?  Is it the housekeeper in a humble working-class district?  Not at all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>The dairy farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has said &ldquo;the dairy farmers.&rdquo;  That is an admission that the case I am making is correct.  The dairy farmer gets the same amount for his butter whether it is subsidised or not.  The only question is in what way is it paid.  As I have said, the consumer pays one part directly to him over the grocer's counter more or less through the ordinary channels of trade. The other portion or instalment he pays indirectly as a taxpayer.  I was asking the question: Who it is who benefits <Col N="609" /> most by this butter subsidy?  Is it the housewife in a humble working-class district?  Is it the little shopkeeper or is it the small professional man?  Not at all.  As far as the shopkeeper and the professional man are concerned and the housewife, if her husband happens to be an artisan or a tradesman in the income-tax paying class, they get nothing.  They pay as much in direct taxation as their wives save through the subsidy.</P>
      <P>The people who are really benefiting by this are those who are supplying meals for profit&mdash;not those who are trying to feed their children in their own homes or their husbands at their own tables.  The people who are coining money because of this butter subsidy are the hotel keepers and the restaurant keepers.  Whether they are grade A or grade D hotels, whether they are fashionable restaurants or merely the humble sort of café that caters for the typist, they are the people making money out of this&mdash;not the general body of consumers.</P>
      <P>In one way or another, since the general body of consumers pay through the nail for this cheap butter for the restaurants and hotels they are probably losing, and losing very considerably on the transaction. The same is true of tea except with this distinction.  Apparently when you subsidise butter you are subsidising it, if you may say so, for the benefit not only of the hotel caterers and the restaurant caterers but some portion of the benefit finds its way to the Irish farmer.  However, when you subsidise tea what do you do?  The Irish farmer gets nothing out of it.  The hotel caterer gets his whack and so does the restaurant caterer, and the balance of the cash goes to the Far East or the Middle East, to the tea growers in Ceylon and India.  The tea growers in Ceylon and India are the people who get the maximum benefit out of the tea subsidies and it is because he wants to subsidise the hotel caterers and the restaurant caterers and the tea planters of Ceylon and India that the Minister for Finance in this&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;Finance Bill has not been able to confer on the community as a whole that greatest boon to which the Parliamentary Secretary to the Government adumbrated.</P>
      <P>There are a number of other matters to which I should like to refer on this Finance Bill but some of them, I think, might open too wide a field for discussion.  There is only one thing I can say, perhaps, in conclusion.  The highest tribute which has been paid to the Minister for Finance and his Budget was paid by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture. What was it?  What were the terms of this eulogy?  He said this Budget might have been a Fianna Fáil Budget.  According to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture, there is no higher standard now by which a Coalition Budget can be judged than that which was set by us in 1952.  There is this resemblance, at any rate, between the 1952 Budget and the 1955 Budget.  I think that the Minister, despite his difficulties, has made an honest attempt to present to the country and to the House a balanced Budget.</P>
      <P>It is a good thing that he has done that because he certainly will have cleared away an atmosphere of unreality and illusion which has characterised public life in this country since 1948.  The Budgets of his predecessor were not balanced.  I doubt if a critical analysis would show that any one of them was balanced but I know that, in relation to two of them, there were very heavy deficits running into millions.  In the case of the other Budgets, they showed a nominal surplus arising from the fact that the then Minister for Finance had not met the public obligations as they arose. I think that, in this Budget, the Minister has tried to do his job decently and honestly and for that, despite all the criticisms which can be levelled against the Budget, I for one am prepared to commend him because I think that, in doing that, he is doing a great public service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, let us get back to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture.  He implied that this was, in fact, the sort of Budget that <Col N="611" /> Fianna Fáil would have brought in because it was an honest Budget&mdash;that is what he said&mdash;and a sound Budget. So far as one can see from the outside an endeavour has been made to present a balanced Budget.  On the other hand, I do not know what are the actual facts behind this Budget.  I do not know, for instance, to what extent the Estimates which the Minister has made for revenue will be fulfilled.  I do not know to what extent he will be able to maintain the Supplementary Estimates within the figure of £750,000 which he has allowed for them but, assuming that the Estimates for revenue are really realised and assuming that he is able to restrict Supplementary Estimates to the figure of £750,000&mdash;it would be a Herculean task if he accomplishes it&mdash;then it looks to me, from the outside, that the Budget will balance.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister's refusal to reduce taxation is an earnest of the fact that he does recognise that the public interest demands now, and indeed at all times, except in very exceptional and emergency circumstances, that the Budget should be balanced, that the Budget for every year should be balanced.  It is not always possible, of course, to realise that.  Emergencies will occur and special provisions will have to be made to meet special circumstances on occasion; but definitely, in so far as there is an annual review or annual casting up of the accounts for the year, the Budget for each year in my view should be balanced.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I would like to say this, that the fact that the Minister has not attempted to reduce taxation in this year is something for which I at least will commend him.  Again, the very fact that he has not been able to reduce taxation shows how shallow and how unprincipled were those who pledged themselves to the people at the last general election that they would reduce taxation considerably. They have not been able to do this&mdash; and they must have known that they would not be able to do it, because the mere fact is that, as I have said, public expenditure does not permit taxation <Col N="612" /> to be reduced.  If we want to get a reduction in public taxation, then in my view we must impose a definite limit on public expenditure.  I think the time has come when we will have to take stock in this country.  With our limited resources, with our undeveloped economy, we cannot go on providing for all our citizens the things which the richest States and the most highly industrialised communities in the world are able to afford.</P>
    <P>We have to remember that we are, in the main, an agricultural community, that the majority of our people are very poor people, that there are no very great fortunes in this country, no huge industrial enterprises which can be readily and easily taxed.  Therefore, as people of common sense, as people who regard providence and prudence as virtues, as people who wish to pay our way in the world and maintain not only our political but our economic independence, we shall have to put some definite limit on public expenditure. When we do that we shall be in a position to consider these reductions in taxation which I believe are absolutely essential to the general good.</P>
    <P>I think money fructifies best in the hands of those who make it.  I do not believe and never have believed&mdash;and the experience of public enterprise everywhere has confirmed me in the belief&mdash;that the State in most matters can do better than the individual. While the State will have to undertake capital expenditure for development where the finance needed for the development of natural resources is far beyond the competence of any Government or any group of individuals to supply&mdash;and the State will of course in those circumstances have to step in and provide for capital development&mdash; nevertheless so far as day-to-day working of our economy is concerned, so far as the financing of private enterprise and private industry is concerned, so far as the capitalisation of our agriculture is concerned, the best hope of this country lies in allowing the man who earns and makes the money to employ it to his own best advantage.  In that way he will give employment to others and he will put the economy of our country upon a sound foundation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="613" /> I was going to say a great deal more about the impact of the Government's policy on agriculture.  The Minister for Health has just reminded me of it, or I think it was Deputy O'Higgins, I am not sure, who brought in here a leaflet which was circulated by me at the last election.  I think it was a good leaflet, I think it had a great sense of humour, particularly as the Minister for Agriculture was passing the ammunition to shut down Irish enterprise, using anti-aircraft guns for that purpose.</P>
    <P>We thought, having regard to the experience of the 1948-1951 Coalition, that the foibles and prejudices of the Minister for Agriculture would be turned against Irish industrialists and Irish industrial enterprise.  That has not been done.  Instead of that, the general financial policy of the Government and their guns have been turned very much against the Irish farmer. He is paying for Government policy through the reduction in the price of wheat, through the increase in the price of offals and, if I may say so, through the enforced reduction in the bank deposit rate&mdash;through the enforcement of a limitation upon the amount which he may earn on bank deposits.</P>
    <P>He is paying for a great deal of the Government's policy and I do not think that is right, because Irish agriculture is languishing for want of capital.  Anything that can put money into the farmers' pockets in present circumstances is not a bad thing for the community as a whole.  Anything that will allow money to remain in the farmers' pockets is not a bad thing for the community as a whole.  I think the farmer will use his own capital, his own personal capital, much more wisely and very much better than he will if he can get credit easily from any public source.  Unfortunately, that is what the Government is preventing the farmer from doing now. We were building up capital in Irish agriculture, we were putting money into the pockets of the Irish farmer. That was not a bad thing, I think that was what we wanted&mdash;but what is happening now?  He has no longer a margin to save, he has no longer a <Col N="614" /> margin to build up his capital resources; and he is driven back to the same position as before, the position in which he was a mendicant having to go into the bank manager and to other institutions and look for temporary accommodation until he would get his crops in.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to speak on this Bill only for a short while and my primary reason for intervening is to give Deputy MacEntee the correct quotation as to what I said about taxation.  It is given in column 1372 of Volume 150:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I am not saying there should not be reductions in taxation.  There is not the slightest doubt, from an economic point of view, and the general good of the community, that the operation by which a Minister for Finance might bring the greatest good would be to reduce taxation by 6d. in the £.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is my quarrel with Deputy MacEntee?  My quarrel about that quotation is that he took the subordinate clause and made it the principal clause.  From an economic point of view, yes: as regards industry, yes; yes as regards salaried people; but if we analyse the economic point of view in this country, what do we find?  As regards our farmers, they pay practically no income-tax and they provide at present 80 per cent. of our exports.  How then could it affect the part of our economy which is of the greatest importance, according to Deputies opposite, that is, the provision of moneys with which to pay for our imports at all times?  If, in fact, the farmers pay little or no income-tax, is it not obvious that a <Col N="615" /> very large part of our economy cannot be affected by income-tax at all?</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEntee quoted that statement of mine three times on the last occasion.  He did not quote it quite so definitely this morning.  I noticed he had it written down.  I was here the first time he used it and I did not jump to my feet because I wanted to refer back to the quotation myself and I had not the reference.  I thought he was wrong and I would have drawn his attention to the fact.  I am inclined to think Deputy MacEntee did not do that inadvertently.  The extent to which the general good of the community is affected by taxation is undoubtedly, when taxation is high, very great indeed, but apart from the economic point of view the Government is concerned with other points of view.</P>
    <P>I will start off by making a present to the Opposition.  A Government is concerned with the political point of view.  It is the business of a Government to look to the political end of things.  Even before you come to the economic point of view there is another point of view which, in my opinion, takes primacy before the economic point of view, and that is the social point of view.  This is the order: first of all, there is the political stability and organisation of the community and, as I say, a present to the Opposition, regard for the opinions of the people politically; secondly, and the one which is really of significance in this matter, there is the social point of view.</P>
    <P>I asked Deputy MacEntee at column 1723, Volume 150 of the Official Debates of 18th May, 1955:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Would the Deputy have given 2/6 to the old age pensioners?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEntee did not answer me directly.  He answered me in this way:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Nobody will believe, whatever else they may believe about any other Deputy in the House, that the heart of the Parliamentary Secretary is bleeding for the old age pensioners.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Again to be fair to Deputy MacEntee, <Col N="616" /> I will quote what he said later on in the column, and it answered my question by inference.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...if we were in office to-day there would have been in this year's Budget a reduction in the standard rate of income-tax and there would have been a corresponding reduction of an equivalent amount in other taxes as well&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That would be £1,500,000 and £1,500,000, that is, £3,000,000.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;and there would have been no cut in the social services.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In other words, Deputy MacEntee, if he was Minister, would not have cut the amount given to old age pensioners, so he answered my question.  The question was: &ldquo;Would the Deputy have given 2/6 to the old age pensioners?&rdquo; and, if I might use Deputy Lemass's words, they would have got &ldquo;sweet Fanny Adams&rdquo; from Deputy MacEntee if he had been Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>What did the Minister for Finance do this year?  In fact he did provide additional moneys for a reduction in taxation. He provided £600,000 to implement the legacy which Deputy MacEntee had left him from last year's Budget.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>In addition to that he provided a small sum, £100,000, which was of significance socially and to a lesser extent economically, for the concessions to our children.  The main part of the Minister's Budget was really taken up with two items: £2,000,000 for butter and £1,000,000 in round figures for the old age pensioners.  Deputy MacEntee dilated on the benefits the restaurant owners and hotel keepers got from the Budget.  Of course, it is quite easy to get the figures.  I regret I cannot recollect them accurately but I can recollect them reasonably accurately <Col N="617" /> because the last time the inter-Party Government were in office, there being rationing at that time, they had a system whereby the restaurant owners and hotel keepers paid the full price for certain items and included in those items were butter and tea.</P>
      <P>The Government this year did what they could do and they tackled the item which gave them the most money. They tackled flour, out of which they hope to get this year the best part of £500,000 and in a full year somewhere in the region of £750,000.  Of course, Deputies opposite agree with us in their hearts that that was the right thing to do.  I must say I do not disagree with Deputy MacEntee when he says it is a difficult thing administratively. The Government were well aware of that but, at the same time, the Government do not believe it will create that much trouble administratively. To get back to my figures, my recollection is that the value of the subsidy on butter and tea&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>What subsidy on tea?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me finish my sentence.  The value of the subsidy on butter and tea which existed when the last inter-Party Government were in office, if we are to judge from the figures, which the Government did not pay at that time to the restaurant owners and hotel keepers, was less than 5 per cent. of the total.  Therefore, out of the subsidy of £2,000,000 on butter the restaurant owners and hotel keepers will get far less than £100,000.  I am sorry I did not look up the figures before coming into the House.  Speaking from recollection, I would say the amount was something like £40,000 or £60,000 in the case of butter and, I think, something the same in regard to tea, because the subsidy was about the same.  The tea subsidy was £2,000,000 and the butter subsidy was £2,000,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy MacEntee put a very fair question to me.  I must say I have no grouse with the general tenor of his speech this morning any more than he had any grouse with the general tenor of the Budget.  He asked did I agree with subsidies or not.  It is a very fair question and I will answer it in this <Col N="618" /> way.  I feel the Budget of 1952 made a grave error in taking out the subsidies so rapidly, in taking them out at one swoop.  In fact this caused me&mdash; let us be precise about it&mdash;to take an interest in politics.  I had left the Civil Service, contrary to what Deputy MacEntee said, for a fair length of time at that period.</P>
    <P>Is the perpetuation of subsidy in the economic interests of the community? Surely Deputy MacEntee who was Minister for Finance had learned 12 months subsequent to that Budget what was the cost to the community in inflation of prices through the wage increases that had to be given.  I made a calculation as best I could that the saving in subsidy was of the order of £10,000,000.  I calculated that the extra cost that went on to the community at the time, through the whole economy, agriculture, industry and the other services, was of the order of £22,000,000 to £28,000,000.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to come to a conclusion definitely about that because, as Deputy MacEntee would say, these increases had to happen and, of course, that is a good answer, but my observations were that we should not have had these increases because the worst was over, in fact.  I am inclined to think, and the Deputy can deny this, that Deputy Lemass agreed with that view.  I do believe that Deputy Lemass did agree with that view of mine and in saying that I am not endeavouring to drive a wedge of any kind.  Deputy MacEntee said that this Budget has disposed of an atmosphere of unreality and illusion.</P>
    <P>At times in 1953 I certainly was astounded at the atmosphere of unreality that existed in political life in this country.  At times I was flabbergasted.  My amazement seemed to have been justified because, despite the climatic difficulties of last autumn, the whole tenor of life, and of economic life in particular, became more even last autumn and winter. This atmosphere of unreality and illusion was dispersed by the manner in which the new Government went about their work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>By leaving things as they were, or by some other way, the atmosphere was changed.  I should like to draw the attention of Deputy MacEntee to two facts.  They are that the Opposition did not divide the House this year either on the Vote on Account or on the Budget.  They could not say of the Budget this time that it was their Budget.  They did not divide the House against the extra 2/6 in the old age pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy MacEntee would not have given it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>He would not have given it and I suppose he could not force his colleagues into the division lobby on it.  The real reason why they did not divide the House on the Vote on Account was the nature of a couple of speeches made here about the rate of interest on bank advances being kept down in this country at a time and under circumstances when they might have increased by 1 per cent.  It was the nature of certain speeches made on the Opposition side of the House that prevented the Opposition dividing the House on the Vote on Account because the Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party knew that here was something that would benefit the country's economy beyond question without doing any damage to anybody.</P>
      <P>Now I shall deal with the final part of Deputy MacEntee's speech.  Deputy MacEntee, or the other Deputies occupying Fianna Fáil Benches, do not really believe that the main reason why any depositor in this country puts money into a commercial bank is the rate of interest he gets on it.  Nobody in any seat in this House believes that. I have no figures, but I have concluded from the lack of comment that not a single depositor has moved his money from any bank in this country because of what the Government did this spring in relation to the rate of interest.  There has been no comment whatever on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Childers said that the <Col N="620" /> depositors in the commercial banks were making a specific gift of money to borrowers in these banks by not transferring their deposits to any Six County bank.  Now if the boot were on the other foot and if Deputies on this side were over there with a Fianna Fáil Government in office and if that Government in their wisdom had taken this same decision what would Deputy Childers have said?  He would have yelled: &ldquo;Sabotage&rdquo;.  It would have been all right for him to have made the first part of his statement in this regard.  It might have been a reasonable comment that the depositors were making a gift.  But the second part of the statement hinted to them to put the Government in a difficulty.  What he said to the depositors was: &ldquo;Look, boys, put the Government in a difficulty by transferring your deposits to the Six Counties&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>To my mind, that was an unreasonable comment and perhaps the Deputy may feel now that it was an unwarranted comment.  In the final part of his speech, Deputy MacEntee referred to our undeveloped economy.  I should like to say this: I thought that the Government in office at the beginning of last year deserved commendation for the arrangements they made to get machinery into this country, to put combine harvesters in the hands of the farmers because these arrangements bore fruit last year.  On the 12th December last I saw a Massey-Harris self-propelled combine cutting corn.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us not divide on why they were here.  The arrangements which were made enabling the farmers to have them were of the greatest assistance to the community. On the whole, as I said earlier, I have no grouse with the nature of Deputy <Col N="621" /> MacEntee's speech this morning.  It did not condemn the Budget in any way except in the limited way of his previous speech and I think I have dealt with that point when I dealt with taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Finance Bill of 1954 was submitted to the House I moved an amendment to the Second Reading motion, an amendment which asked the Dáil to reject the Bill because it failed to give effect to the undertakings previously given by Ministers to reduce taxation.  In the debate on that amendment, the members of the Government who spoke asked the Dáil to reject it because they said they had not had sufficient time to do the things they had promised&mdash;to bring about the specific reductions in taxation to which they were committed.  They pleaded that the limited time available to them made it necessary to adopt the course of taking the draft Fianna Fáil Bill, as they described it, and of presenting it to the House as the Finance Bill, 1954.</P>
      <P>Deputies on this side of the House quoted statements made by members of the Government in speeches during the election campaign; they quoted the advertisements they had published in the newspapers, the leaflets they had distributed to the voters and the extracts from Radio Éireann broadcasts, all of which indicated the conviction of the Coalition leaders that immediate reductions in taxation were not merely possible but could be easily accomplished.</P>
      <P>These quotations had, I admit, no effect in this House, and I agree that they had little effect in the country. The arguments which Ministers put forward that they had no time last year went down with the more gullible of their supporters.  A year has passed and the same Minister for Finance brings in another Finance Bill which again fails in any single one of its provisions to give effect to their election undertakings.  I do not think that this Bill should pass through the House without having that fact duly emphasised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="622" /> If it is true that during the year there has been no change in tax rates, there has been no change in Coalition tactics either, and members of the Government are still going around the country even now dangling the same carrot, the same mouldy carrot, in front of the noses of the voters telling them that, if not this year, then next year, they will get a reduction in income-tax and a reduction in the rates of duty on beer, spirits and tobacco.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEntee described the Budget as an honest Budget.  That is one way of putting it.  Those who gather around the table of a three-card trickster at a race meeting do not think of him as a public benefactor, handing out money and inspired only by a generous desire to help people, and when they lose their money and go away with no more benefit from their session with him than they are getting from the Minister for Finance, they do not denounce him as a dishonest rogue because they got only what they expected to get, an education in the facts of life, and that is what the supporters of Fine Gael are getting through this Finance Bill, an education in the facts of life and an illustration of the mean, shabby trick that was played on them by the members of the Coalition Government and by those in this House who support that Government.</P>
    <P>It is my desire not to praise the Minister for Finance for the Budget which he has produced but to expose the humbug that made him Minister for Finance and to get him and every other humbug out of public life if I can because their type of trickery is bringing Irish politics into disrepute.</P>

      <P>These statements were made by Deputy John Costello, now Taoiseach, by Deputy Sweetman, now Minister for Finance, and by Deputy McGilligan, now Attorney-General. These pledges were given to the public and were shamelessly repudiated and this Bill is evidence of the repudiation. Last year, on the Finance Bill of 1954, I brought forward a number of amendments which gave the Deputies opposite the opportunity, if they wanted to take it, of bringing back the income-tax rate and the taxes on beer, spirits and tobacco to the levels at which they were before the 1952 Budget.  They had proclaimed throughout the country that the increase in these taxes in 1952 was unnecessary and unjustifiable.  They represented Fianna Fáil as having imposed these taxes for other reasons than the need to get revenue for the Exchequer.  They suggested that our aim was to cut down the standard of living of the people and to reduce their spending power for some mistaken economic purpose.  They assured the public who voted for them that they would bring back these tax rates to the pre-1952 level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When my amendments were submitted to the Dáil they voted against them, and as each amendment was presented the case they made for voting <Col N="624" /> against it was precisely the same as they had used against the amendment to the Second Reading of the Bill.  &ldquo;There was no time; give them time and they would do this next year.&rdquo;  Another year has passed.  This is the anniversary of the coming in of that Government.  A whole year has passed and in this Finance Bill there is no provision and no suggestion of a provision to bring these tax rates back to the 1952 level.</P>
    <P>I am going to produce these amendments again to this Bill, and again I will make the Deputies opposite either accept them or vote against them as part of the campaign to get hypocrisy, humbug and fraud eliminated from Irish public life.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy knows anything it has never been made obvious in his speeches here.  There is a reason for producing these amendments again and it is that the present rate of income-tax and the present taxes on beer, spirits and tobacco were represented to the people as Fianna Fáil taxes and they are still regarded by many members of the public as Fianna Fáil taxes.  They were so described by the dishonest Deputies opposite in their election campaign throughout the country.  I <Col N="625" /> want to make it clear through these amendments that they are Coalition taxes; that they are in operation because the Coalition wants them.  Will the Minister for Finance have the common honesty to say that he has kept these taxes in force because he had to do it, and because he could not balance his Budget without them?</P>

      <P>Why are the taxes on beer, spirits and tobacco and the rates of income-tax being left as they were fixed in 1952?  Are they still trying to parade these taxes before the public as something that Fianna Fáil imposed and that they would take off?  Does the Minister say that is an honest way to stand up to his responsibility?  Why do they not take them off in this year of 1955?  I do not believe that any Minister for Finance who wanted to balance his Budget, or even wanted to present to the House a Budget that had the credible appearance of being balanced, could reduce these taxes.  I never said that they could be reduced, but the Deputies opposite said that these taxes were unnecessary and an unjustifiable burden on the people.  Why do they not take them off?  Answer that question.  I am trying to get rid of this humbug and dishonesty. Is not the answer to the question that they cannot take them off and balance the Budget?  Is there one Deputy opposite who will have the honesty to stand up and say that is the answer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This &ldquo;three card trick&rdquo; that the <Col N="626" /> Government played upon the country has to be exposed sooner or later. These amendments, which I shall move to the Finance Bill, will be moved not for the purpose of political demonstration but in fulfilment of this effort of mine to expose hypocrisy and fraud and to make it clear that these taxes are now Coalition taxes and that they are in operation because the Coalition has decided to keep them in operation. That will help to secure that condition in public life that the Parliamentary Secretary has been talking about; and I hope that every Deputy now supporting the Coalition will be in the House to vote for keeping these taxes in operation; they will get the chance of voting for them and they will then have to make clear to those who supported them in their individual constituencies that these taxes are now in force by reason of their votes, and not for any other reason.</P>
    <P>There are some matters affecting this Bill to which I want to make more specific reference.  The Minister for Finance said&mdash;at least he implied it&mdash; that it was not possible for him to effect changes in the system of taxing industrial profits because the committee which his predecessor had set up had not yet reported.  I do not think we can go much longer waiting for the report of that committee.  The time has come in our industrial progress when we must consider this question as one of urgency and, if the committee is not likely to produce its report soon, then decisions will have to be taken without waiting for that report.</P>
    <P>Minister have been representing the industrial position as good.  They have been quoting the index of industrial production for one season as against another to suggest that there has been an increase in industrial production.  There has been no such increase.  If one compares like with like, if one takes the industrial output figure for the last quarter of 1954 and compares that with the last quarter of 1953 one will find there has been no increase in output.  There has, in fact, been a slight decrease.  With every other country in the world going <Col N="627" /> forward, we are standing still; by reference to every standard by which our economic progress can be tested that is the position.  Industrial output is not increasing.  The number of workers drawing unemployment insurance benefit is no lower than it was a year ago.  It is, indeed, slightly higher.  The volume of agricultural production is not increasing.  The cost of living is going up.  Taxation on the public is going up.  There is no evidence of progress to justify the complacency of the Government.</P>
    <P>These speeches of Ministers representing the country as enjoying a prosperity boom are altogether misleading; in no way is the country any better off than it was 12 months ago. But there is this difference: 12 months ago there was a Government in office which did not regard the conditions then existing as satisfactory and which was working might and main to improve them.  That Government represented the situation as it then existed as merely the beginning of another effort or another drive towards economic progress; whereas to-day we have a number of Ministers sitting back in their chairs complacently reviewing the situation and doing nothing whatever to secure an improvement of it.</P>
    <P>I have said on many occasions that our industrial development has reached the stage where, if it is to continue, export possibilities must be opened up. I do not know the significance of the Government's decision to adhere to the recent decision of the council of O.E.E.C., in relation to the granting of aids for the encouragement of exports.  I would have thought that the best way of securing interest amongst our industrial producers in export possibilities was by a rearrangement of the system of taxes on industrial profits.  But, so far as I understand the present position, the Government has precluded the possibility of taking that course by their adherence to the O.E.E.C. decision.</P>
    <P>While I am on that matter, I want to refer again to this question of the withdrawal of the subsidy on flour used for the manufacture of biscuits and <Col N="628" /> cakes.  When I spoke here in the Budget debate I contended that the extension of that decision to flour used in the production of biscuits and confectionery for export would mean the end of the export trade in these goods; and the Government, with very commendable promptitude mended its hand and the Minister for Industry and Commerce announced the next day that the manufacturers of biscuits and cakes for export would continue to receive their flour supplies at the old price.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not true. The Minister for Industry and Commerce interrupted the Deputy and told him there and then what had been decided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>That the position for export would be protected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That the manufacturers of biscuits and confectionery for export would continue to get flour at the old price?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The manufacturers were informed to the contrary yesterday. They were informed yesterday that they would receive flour of only 72 per cent. extraction instead of the old 80 per cent. extraction subsidised flour.  That means a higher price for flour used in the production of biscuits and confectionery for export as well as home consumption and it means the end of the export trade.  It certainly means the end of the export trade in respect of biscuits to the Six Counties, where the British manufacturers are, I understand, cutting their prices at the same time as our manufacturers will be compelled to increase theirs.  I do not know what arrangements the Government has in contemplation to bring into operation this two-price system in respect of flour but all the indications so far are that the Government is making a thoroughgoing mess of it and the effect of that mess will be felt in diminished production and diminished employment in the trades concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="629" /> The British tax system provides for a lower rate of taxation on profits retained in a business for its development as against profits distributed in dividends.  Now our problem in relation to industrial development has been to secure a ready availability of capital to finance expansion and the great bulk of the capital which has gone into the expansion of Irish industry has come from the retained profits of existing concerns and there is every reason why in our circumstances we should adopt the British system and apply it here.  In fact it is quite obvious that a country like ours, at the beginning of its industrial progress, requires these stimuli to expansion to a far greater extent than they would appear to be necessary in Great Britain; but, if the British Government in its wisdom thinks it necessary to give that inducement to industrial firms to hold their profits for the expansion of their businesses, surely we have equally a sufficiently good reason for doing the same thing here.</P>
    <P>We require some inducement to our manufacturers to modernise their plants and get rid of obsolete and obsolescent equipment.  Again, while other countries, Britain included, give an initial allowance in respect of new plant purchased we do not do so here. All the arguments which have been advanced in the past that the general rate of taxation here is lower than in Britain do not deal with the point at all.  The point is that the efficient firm, the firm which is prepared to expand and buy up-to-date modern efficient equipment, should have an advantage in doing so over the firm that is not doing so within the general tax rate, whatever it may be.</P>
    <P>The absence of any provision for depreciation on industrial buildings is an anomaly.  It means that the system of taxing industrial profits is in part a system of taxing industrial capital and if anybody will investigate the history of the financing of Irish industry since the end of the war he will find that a high proportion of the taxes paid by industry during that period has in fact been paid out of capital. We find our industrial production at <Col N="630" /> the end of 1954 was no higher than at the end of 1953.  We have got to consider what effect that stagnation in industrial output may have on our employment and emigration problems. This Bill contains the Government's proposals for dealing with that position, and that is nothing.  There is no indication in it of any policy or of any aim which is likely to contribute to the further growth of Irish industry.</P>
    <P>During the course of the past year there were many indications of public interest in the introduction of a pay as you earn system of taxing earned personal incomes.  The most significant thing is that that interest to which I have referred seems to have found its most frequent expression in trade union circles.  There has been some general indication of support for it in other circles also and it is obvious that the general public feeling is that it is time that something should be done about it.  Everybody knows how difficult it is when you have to pay your income-tax once or twice a year in the form of a substantial sum, how much easier it would be if it could be paid weekly in the form of deductions from the weekly pay cheque.  Everyone has encountered cases of individual hardship on people who have lost their employment or who have retired but find themselves billed for taxation on the level appropriate to the higher income earned in the previous year.</P>
    <P>I must recognise that there are practical difficulties in applying the pay as you earn system here.  We were probably right to wait until the British system had been in operation for some time so that we could gain by the experience of the operation of that system before considering applying it here.  The British system is undoubtedly complex and the Royal Commission which was set up to consider its simplification has reported that no real simplification is possible without risk of serious iniquities.  They regarded it as more important that there should be an equitable distribution of the taxation burden rather than that the scheme should be made more simple to operate.  We are told that the application of the scheme here <Col N="631" /> would cost £160,000 in the first year and £100,000 per year afterwards.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the cost to the Exchequer.  To that must be added the cost to business people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The cost to business people would not be very great.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>On the contrary, it would be very much greater.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so. There has been some opposition by very large employers in Britain on the ground of the additional cost which the operation of the scheme causes but the cost to the ordinary employer, such as the majority of employers in this country, is inconsiderable.  In any case, as the law stands, where an employee defaults the Revenue Commissioners can go to the employer and direct him to pay the income-tax and then to deduct it from the employee's earnings. I personally cannot understand why there is this objection to the principle of the scheme which seems to be reflected in the attitude of the Minister for Finance.  The scheme is clearly good in principle and we should be able to find a way to operate it.  The trade unions have asked for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Not all the trade unions want it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I would suggest that consideration should be given to this matter by bringing the employers and the trade unions into consultation about the implementation of a scheme. A number of workers' bodies have expressed themselves in principle as being in favour of the introduction of a scheme.  Let us get going on it.  Let us consider whether the practical objections are as strong as they seem or whether they can be overcome.  All I ask is that the process of having the scheme examined in consultation with representatives of workers and employers should begin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In further connection with income-tax there is another proposition which I want to make.  The present personal allowance is not very much larger than <Col N="632" /> it was before the war.  I believe that the personal allowance for a single man before the war was £125 and that it is now £140.  The personal allowance for a married man before the war was £225 and it is now £280.  When the income-tax code was first devised the personal allowance was intended to represent the amount which would be required to give a person a livelihood in accordance with what was then regarded as the working class standard. It was the amount of money which would enable a person to maintain himself on a working class standard and which should be free of tax in everybody's income.  It is quite clear that the present personal allowance has no longer any relation to such a theory or standard.  Even if we consider the position now, in contrast with the post-war period, we can find no adjustment of this personal allowance in relation to the changes in the value of money.  Whether we relate the allowance to the principle of the working class standard of living or some other principle, the personal allowance should vary with variations in the value of money.  If that £125 was regarded as a reasonable allowance to be free of income-tax before the war the figure should be somewhere around £300 now.  The amount of the allowance should be varied in relation to variations in the value of money and it should also be tied to the cost-of-living index figure as the best guide to change in the value of money.  These remarks apply with equal force to the earned income allowance.</P>
    <P>I want to make one or two other suggestions.  I think it should be a recognised principle of financial policy that the Government should rely for its revenue upon a few main taxes and seek to avoid a multiplicity of taxes. Taxes on income, on inheritance and a few taxes on articles of general consumption, preferably not necessaries, should bring in the bulk of the revenue.  We have in operation here a very large number of excise duties on licences and so forth, not all of which were imposed originally for revenue purposes and some of which are obsolete.  There should be an examination <Col N="633" /> of all these and the Government should eliminate all those which are now only maintained for revenue purposes and which no longer serve the purpose for which they were devised.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the best example I could give is the dog licence tax.  Originally that tax was imposed to secure a reduction in the number of ownerless dogs which were roaming around the country.  The purpose of that tax was to secure the elimination of these hordes of homeless and ownerless dogs. That problem no longer exists and is not likely to arise again and yet we keep this elaborate tax system in operation although its administration costs a great amount of money and it is difficult to enforce.  I think that tax should be abolished.</P>
    <P>There is another tax to which I would refer and unfortunately it is one that was imposed by a Fianna Fáil Government.  It is the excise duty on tyres and tubes.  When the Dunlop factory was started in Cork the Minister for Finance was worried about the possibility of losing revenue from the customs duty on imported tyres and tubes.  In order to avoid that and to secure the goodwill of the Department of Finance for the project it was agreed that in substitution for the customs duty there would be an excise duty on the Irish-made tyres and tubes.</P>
    <P>Anyone who has visited the factory at Cork will see that there is there a customs compound and all the tyres and tubes made in the factory pass through that compound and are taxed before they are sent out to the retail distributors.  This tax has had to be amended from time to time because it produced a number of anomalies and any excise duty on an internal product intended for home consumption is bound to produce anomalies of one kind or another.  The amount which it produces is comparatively small and it could be abolished&mdash;the time has come when it should be abolished.  The consumption of tyres and tubes has expanded far beyond anything contemplated when the factory was founded, and the maintenance of the duty is no longer, in my view, justifiable.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="634" /> There are certain other excise duties on licences, stamp duties of one kind or another, which appear to be completely unnecessary, which yield very little revenue, which are only a source of annoyance to the public and which should be cleared out of the way.  The Minister for Finance could secure a reputation for himself in the history of the legislation of this State if he were to do that job.  The total amount of revenue secured from all these duties added together is insignificant and probably would not be noticed in the course of a financial year having regard to the variation there usually is between revenue actually received and estimated revenue.</P>

      <P>The Government has to borrow a great deal of money to carry through its Budget proposals of this year and in view of the scale on which Government borrowing has become necessary in recent years it seems likely that difficulty will be experienced in securing year after year the amount which the Government will require by the traditional methods and that is a situation which I think the Government will be forced to face up to.  In my view&mdash;and I want to make no secret about this&mdash;the scale of Government investment expenditure will have to be considerably expanded if the economic and social problems of this country are to be solved.  I do not regard it as an achievement to be proud of that the Government is cutting down its investment expenditure this year&mdash;the Minister seemed to be a little proud of this fact, but I think it is moving in the wrong direction&mdash;because no plan for <Col N="635" /> the rehabilitation of the Irish economy, no plan for getting the country into a position which will secure full employment for our people and end abnormal emigration, can be conceived which does not involve a very considerable increase in Government capital expenditure, at least in its early stages.</P>
      <P>There will be practical problems in financing even the present programme of capital expenditure much less the expanding programme which I think is necessary.  The Government has talked about setting up a capital investment committee with powers to determine priorities of investment.  I think it is high time that the Government made clear to the public what it has in mind. These announcements which appeared from time to time as ministerial statements or declarations to their political Parties smacked of the introduction of some form of control of investment, and while there is any suggestion of Government controls being introduced in that sphere there is likely to be a slowing down of private investment activity.  If the Government has anything definite in mind, if they are not just talking in vague terms about something which they do not understand, the sooner they make a specific announcement of their intentions the better it will be, because the situation as it is now is the worst kind of situation to allow to continue, one in which everybody has been told the Government is about to do something but has no precise idea of what the Government contemplates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am throwing out these suggestions because I think these are matters of importance which have to be considered in relation to the Finance Bill, of far greater importance than anything that appears in the Bill.  As Deputy MacEntee said, the significance of this Bill is not what is in it, but what is not in it, and what is not in it is any indication of policy on the part of the Government, any plan for the benefit of the community or for increasing industrial or agricultural production which can in any way mean that this time next year the economy <Col N="636" /> of this country will be one bit stronger than it is now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the memories of members of this House and the memories of the public in general are as short as Deputy Lemass would have us think.  I think the public, and certainly Deputies on this side of the House, remember the Fianna Fáil economic policy as enshrined in the 1952 Budget.  We recall very well the phrases which were scattered through that Budget which, in spite of their arguments in opposition, which were made subsequently, were the kernel of the Fianna Fáil policy for their last three and a half years in office.  We recall the fact that they set out deliberately to reduce consumption in the future, that they believed earnings had gone beyond the cost of living and that the country could afford to have higher prices for basic commodities.</P>
      <P>No matter what Deputy Lemass says now in the Dáil, having left office for a year, on the necessity for increasing agricultural and industrial production, creating conditions of full employment in this State, we remember&mdash;and I think the people remember&mdash;what the basic economic policy of the last Government was.  To my mind, the difference between the two Governments, between the first inter-Party Government and the last Fianna Fáil Government, between the present inter-Party Government and the last Fianna Fáil Government, was that the last Fianna Fáil Government set out by means of its budgetary policy to meet an imaginary balance of payments crisis and that the present Government by its financial and budgetary policy has endeavoured to tackle the real problems of our economy, the problems of high prices, high unemployment and the necessity to develop our undeveloped resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I use the phrase &ldquo;imaginary balance of payments crisis&rdquo; advisedly because there was no crisis which the last Government had to face and the last Government's policy was framed under a complete misunderstanding of the economic facts.  These facts have been pointed out before but apparently ex-Ministers  <Col N="637" /> of the Fianna Fáil Government have not learned from them.</P>
    <P>I want to quote what Deputy MacEntee said a week or two ago at column 1771 of Volume 150, No. 12, of the Official Debates when he was referring to the necessity for what he described as the 1952 taxes.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Our external assets were melting away at an alarming rate.  A deficit of over £30,000,000 in our balance of payments in the year 1950 had been followed by another of more than double that figure in 1951.  In three years our available external resources had shrunk by over £100,000,000.</P>
    <P>This is a small country.  It has been alleged that we had at one time a surplus of external assets over external liabilities of about £400,000,000.  In three years we had frittered away&mdash;because that is what it amounted to when you come to look on how this money was spent&mdash; we had frittered away 25 per cent. of our external resources, the things upon which we depend in a very large measure for financing our trade, for some of the income which we drive, the things which the last Minister for Finance in the Coalition Government referred to as our economic mass of manoeuvre, the resources upon which we would have to reply in a last emergency.  We were frittering these things away at the rate of £100,000,000 in three years.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That, to my mind, is a very clear statement of an absolutely false economic fact, and I want to say categorically that, in the three years to which the Deputy was referring, 1949, 1950 and 1951, though there were deficits in the balance of payments amounting to £100,000,000, there was no frittering away of our external assets to that extent and I want to give the figures which are available for any Deputy, the figures for our external assets for these three years.</P>
    <P>If any Deputy picks up the report of the Central Bank for the year ended 31st March, 1949, he will see the position of the external assets of the banking system as a whole and these <Col N="638" /> figures are very revealing.  Taking the figures for the external reserves of the Central Bank, the associated banks and the Post Office Savings Bank as a whole, the total external assets which these banks held on 31st December, 1948, amounted to £214.3 million.  If Deputy MacEntee was correct, one would have expected a startling decline in these external assets of the banking system for the three years of the deficits amounting to £100,000,000 but the facts were that, at the end of these three years, on 31st December, 1951, three years later, instead of being £100,000,000 down, the external assets of the banking system stood at £212.6 million, a decline of £1.7 million in these three years.  These are incontrovertible facts&mdash;for the three years we had deficits in the balance of payments amounting to £100,000,000, the external assets of our banking system went down by only £1.7 million.</P>
    <P>We experienced in these three years an inflow of foreign capital amounting to £45.6 million; we availed of the American loan and the American dollar grant amounting to £46.8 million; and our holdings of external securities were only diminished by £7,000,000 in these three years.  Instead of the deficit of £100,000,000 bringing about a reduction in our external reserves, a frittering away, to use Deputy MacEntee's phrase, of our external reserves to the extent of £100,000,000, in fact our external reserves for these three years in regard to the banking system as a whole declined by £1.7 million and with regard to the holders of private securities by approximately £7,000,000.  That was the crisis, the so-called crisis, which necessitated the savage impositions of the 1952 Budget, which necessitated the reduction in consumption by increasing taxes and cutting subsidies which was the basic fact of the economic policy of the last Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    <P>That is the difference between this Government and the last Government. It is a very easy thing for Deputy Lemass to come into the Dáil and tell the Minister for Finance what to do. It is a very easy thing for him now to come in here and advocate income-tax allowances for industrial concerns that <Col N="639" /> are ploughing back profits and to speak here about introducing pay-as-you-earn systems and the cutting of minor taxes of an excise nature.  It is also very easy for him to talk about the necessity for an economic policy to increase production and bring about conditions of full employment in the State.</P>
    <P>The answer to these simple phrases is: Why was it not done when they were in office for nearly 20 years, and, in the last three years of the period of their tenure of office, why did they not set about bringing about an expansionary policy, increasing production by means of reducing taxes, by means of keeping the amount of money in the pockets of the consumer at the same level so that he could spend more and why did they set about a policy, as they deliberately did, of reducing consumption in the State, with all its attendant consequences of a reduction in industrial production and increased unemployment?  We pointed out these things to them at the time, but they did not listen to us. The country, I think, gave its verdict in a very clear fashion in the general election last year, and, no matter what the spokesman for the Fianna Fáil Party said, the country realised what had happened.  We have now set about altering the whole emphasis and incidence of financial and economic policy away from the restrictionist policy of the 1952 Budget and towards increasing consumption, towards increasing investment in the State.</P>
    <P>I agree thoroughly with what Deputy Lemass has said about the necessity for increasing our capital investment programme.  I remember, however, the attacks which were made on the capital investment programme of the first inter-Party Government.  I remember the pawnbroker's sign put up around the City of Dublin saying that we were putting the country in pawn and the attacks made in the Dáil and out of the Dáil on the increased liabilities undertaken by the Government and the increased interest charges which the Exchequer was having to pay because of the capital investment programme.  In spite of <Col N="640" /> those things, the first inter-Party Government started the capital investment programme and brought capital investment to a very high figure.  I want to see that figure expanded.</P>
    <P>I think it is of interest to note how, even though we have greatly increased capital investment in the past few years, we still lag far behind in capital investment the figures which other countries have been able to achieve. If Deputies examine the American experts' report known as the I.B.E.C. Report, at page 23, they will see the figures for expenditure per head of population on fixed capital in the country.  In 1950, the year which was taken by the American experts as the base year, the figure per head of the population in this country was 60 American dollars.  The comparable figure in Denmark, which is a country in rather similar circumstances to ours, was over double&mdash;130 dollars per head of the population&mdash;and the Belgian figure was 87 dollars.</P>
    <P>Even Finland, which is regarded as a backward country, had a higher figure per head of the population than ours, standing at 66 dollars per head. Switzerland was at 167 dollars per head of the population.  It seems to me that these figures indicate that, in comparison with other small countries, we are lagging far behind in our capital investment programme and we have got to set out to expand it in whatever way we can.</P>
    <P>There are certain principles of policy involved when we talk about expanding our capital investment programme. In the first place, there has been considerable criticism, some of which to my mind has been warranted, of the balance of the total capital investment in the State&mdash;criticism made by expert economists in various journals in the last few years.  These criticisms have pointed out that a proportion, and to their mind too large a proportion, of the total capital investment undertaken in our country was in nonproductive capital investment and was sometimes termed &ldquo;social capital&rdquo;. To some extent that criticism is correct. I do not want to see 1d. less spent on social capital.  I do not want to see any reduction in expenditure on <Col N="641" /> hospitals or houses.  Rather do I want to see work on them increased, particularly in relation to the housing drive.  However, I do want to see the level of capital investment as a whole increased and more of it put into productive capital works.  There is no reason to cut down investment on social capital if the investment on productive capital is increased.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass has referred here to the difficulties which the Government faces with regard to financing their capital investment programme.  I think the time has come when the Irish commercial banks should play a part in financing the Government's capital investment programme and should hold a much greater percentage of Government securities in their investment portfolios than they do at the present time.  The commercial banks in other countries have co-operated with their Governments in their capital investment programmes.  The banks of other countries have large percentages of their investments held in the Government securities of their own countries.  Our banks here hold a comparatively small figure of their investment securities in Government stocks.  I should like to see that figure greatly increased and the banks taking up loans at a much lower rate of interest than would be necessary to secure money from the public when public flotations have to be embarked upon.</P>
    <P>To my mind, the capital investment programme is so important in bringing about conditions of full employment and in increasing production that the rather haphazard nature by which it has been planned in the last few years will have to be scrapped and we shall have to set up a capital investment board.  Deputy Lemass has made vague hints and insinuations that it would be to control investment.  It is necessary to set up a capital investment board to plan investment.  It is time now that the various Departments should, over a period of years, be directed to the type of economic capital programme they should undertake.</P>
    <P>We have had considerable criticism here and outside the Dáil&mdash;criticism with which I agree&mdash;of the increased <Col N="642" /> expenditure on roads.  I think too much money is being spent on roads at the present time and that some of the money should be put into houses or hospitals or, if possible, into capital investment of a productive nature.  I can see nothing wrong in using the expression that has been used&mdash;&ldquo;raiding the Road Fund.&rdquo;  It is a colourful emotive phrase.  After all, road tax is like any other tax and if some of it could be put towards the building of houses or hospitals or towards the land rehabilitation programme I should be all in favour of it.</P>
    <P>I think it is also important to appreciate, when we talk about capital investment in this country, that capital investment can be met only out of savings either current or past.  If current investment is not sufficient to meet the rate of existing capital investment, then we have to draw on our past savings in order to meet it.  If that equation is borne in mind, it will be appreciated that it is necessary to intensify the savings campaign if we are to increase the capital investment campaign.  A large-scale savings campaign could be undertaken side by side with a large-scale expansion of the capital investment programme without being any great danger to our balance of payments position.</P>
    <P>I do not think that much is to be served now by the type of speech to which we listened this morning from Deputy Lemass.  Deputy Lemass himself admitted that the speeches which he made last year have not had much effect in the country in general.  I do not think the speeches he and his colleagues are making in that vein are having much effect this year either. The people are tired of the slanderous types of accusations that we have heard from Deputy Lemass this morning and from his colleagues for the past year or so.  This Government must not be hampered in their work and I do not think will be hampered in their work by trying to run after all the hares started by the disappointed spokesmen of the Fianna Fáil Party. It is time now to get down to the task of seeing that we have full employment in our State.  It is time to see that we have not got five or six people living <Col N="643" /> in one room&mdash;as they are in my constituency at the present time.  It is time to get down to the task of expanding revenue so that we can, if possible, bring better social benefits to our people.  These are the real tasks before this Government.  I think they have started on that road in a very fine style and that we shall have something very good to show at the end of our four remaining years of office.</P>

      <P>I think the Parliamentary Secretary to the Government rather disclosed the basis of the Government's approach to budgetary and other matters. He said the first consideration was political, the second social, and only the third economic.  They are still carrying on the same political approach to these matters that they had during the last general election and before it. We would hope that the time would come when budgetary matters&mdash;matters of public finance&mdash;would be approached not primarily in a political way from the point of view of the interests of the Party but from the point of view of putting the country on its feet and making its progress more certain.</P>
      <P>The political approach that the present Coalition group made to the Budgets in the past is now quite obvious.  They criticised the 1952 Budget and said that the level of taxation then imposed was savage.  From the point of view of their own political future, they said things like that. Deputy Costello, now Taoiseach, said at that time that he would not remain in office for a minute if these savage impositions were continued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These &ldquo;savage impositions&rdquo; are still imposed, every one of them.  It was alleged then that they were imposed to reduce consumption.  Is it to reduce consumption that they are being imposed to-day?  They are the same taxes.  The tax on beer is the same, the tax on cigarettes is the same, the income-tax is the same, as in the 1952 Budget.  It was said that the only reason was to reduce consumption.  Is that the purpose for which they are imposed to-day?  As Deputy Lemass pointed out, the members of the Coalition Government will be forced to vote <Col N="644" /> for their imposition.  I want to know if they are going to vote for their imposition for the purpose of reducing consumption.</P>
    <P>It is no harm to repeat that the members of the various Coalition groups got the votes of the people on the promise that they would abolish those taxes.  Deputy Davin said&mdash;as I quoted here on the Budget Resolution &mdash;that the Labour Party would not be concerned with getting positions in the Government but with reducing taxation and other things.  The Minister for Education said on the 29th March, 1954, just a year or so ago:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Our policy is to relieve once again the penal taxes that were imposed by Fianna Fáil in the 1952 Budget.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, when we brought in these amendments to the Finance Bill to give the Government an opportunity of carrying out what the Minister for Education said he would do and do immediately, they said: &ldquo;You cannot expect us to reduce taxation in three or four days; after all, this Bill has been prepared, we had no time to change it.&rdquo;  The Finance Bill was brought in a few days after the Government was set up, but it is now more than 365 days later, not three or four days, and there is no sign that the Government are going to apologise to the people for the way they fooled them or that they are going to do anything about reducing taxation, even after 365 days.</P>
    <P>In order to give credence to all the promises made about the reduction in taxation by £10,000,000 or £20,000,000 as Deputy McGilligan, the Attorney-General, indicated they would do, they referred to what they did in 1948 when a couple of months before the end of the financial year they reduced the taxation on cigarettes, tobacco, beer and whiskey.  They said: &ldquo;What we did in 1948 we can do in 1955 and we will do it and do it immediately.&rdquo;  As Deputy Davin said, they would not be concerned with getting positions in the Government but they wanted this taxation dealt with as it was in 1948. Deputy Dunne ran around the country and he was only one of the many who <Col N="645" /> said they would not consider even taking part in a Government until these taxes were reduced.  He was very specific&mdash;he wanted the taxes on beer, cigarettes, etc., reduced before they would consider taking part in a Government.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael representatives in the Government are quite brazen about the way in which they fooled the people regarding an immediate reduction in taxation.  They are quite brazen about it.  A number of the lawyers in that Government think that they can talk themselves out of any position.  They talked the people into giving them votes and they think they can blind the people now, by more talk, into believing that they never made any promises. The Labour Party are not quite so brazen.  The whole of this morning that whole block of benches in which the Labour Deputies are supposed to sit was quite empty.</P>

      <P>One Labour Deputy looked in for a couple of minutes and then skipped.  I wish they were here in order that I might have a chat with them about one clause in this Bill which is an interesting one.  At one time we used to be deafened by the Labour Party with the plea that there should be no means test for social services.  They were breast high for no means test in regard to old age pensions and I think the present Minister for Finance once supported them in a motion that the means test for old age pensions should be abolished. They were breast high at the beginning for no means test in regard to health services.  There is a clause in this Finance Bill which enables an income-tax payer&mdash;surtax or otherwise&mdash;to get a subvention from the State if he insures himself for hospital and medical benefit&mdash;and in that clause there is no means test above a certain figure.  Once a man becomes liable to income-tax, the Government is prepared to give him a subsidy if he insures himself for medical benefit and for hospital treatment, but below that figure they are not.  If a man has a wife and several children and only a <Col N="646" /> modest income and no income-tax to pay, and if he wants to insure himself and his family for medical benefit and hospital treatment in case of illness, he has to pay his own pounds.  The State gives him nothing.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I moved to report progress last evening I was dealing with what appear to be some defects in the existing code of workmen's compensation.  I was dealing in particular with the position that faces a workman who, without any court award, was in receipt of weekly compensation in respect of injury that he met with arising out of and in the course of his employment.  I said that it often happens that the employer and the insurance company, where the employer is insured, often pick what appears to them an opportune time to cut off that compensation.  The workman then has recourse to the courts and if his compensation has been cut off shortly before the beginning of the long vacation, he is in a particularly vulnerable position from the point of view of having his claim settled by a tempting offer, often inadequate, from the insurance company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said last night that I thought that was a matter that the Minister possibly could not remedy, but, on giving it second thoughts, I feel, perhaps, there might be some method whereby such a man could have his claim brought before a court, say some kind of floating Circuit Court, during the long vacation.  Otherwise, if his compensation is cut off, say early in July, that will not give him time to have his claim heard before the end of that particular term.  The courts normally do not resume until well into October, therefore, giving him a very long period in which he has no weekly compensation to remunerate him for his loss of earning capacity.  In <Col N="647" /> urgent cases in different types of litigation, people who have to seek redress from the courts are given that facility and I think it might, in some manner, be extended to workmen whose compensation has been stopped at such an inopportune time.</P>
    <P>There is one other aspect of that problem which again is a defect in the present system as it has evolved from legal decisions; that is, if the workman's compensation is cut off he usually goes to court for the purpose of having it restored or else of having whatever proper compensation the court considers fit awarded to him. Under the present legal position, if the court finds that the man is no longer totally incapacitated, the court then has to look to what earning capacity the workman has in his partially incapacitated state.  But unless the court has actual evidence of what the earning capacity of the man is, it must adjourn the award of his partial compensation to see what work the man can actually do.</P>
    <P>It usually happens, I think, that if a man is cut off from full compensation he has not in the meantime tried to work in his partially incapacitated state, and even though the court decides on the hearing of his case that he is no longer totally incapacitated and that he is partially incapacitated, it cannot give him a partial award until such evidence is forthcoming. That evidence cannot be got together by the workman until another period has elapsed, when he has tried his hand at other jobs.  After he has succeeded in getting a job and earning some reduced wages, only then can the court assess his partial compensation.</P>
    <P>There is, of course, a prejudice always against such a man and having been injured with a particular employer, a prospective employer is not anxious to take him on.  Fortunately there is a section providing against any hardship in that respect, that is, Section 24, whereby the court, if by reason of his continuing disability, even though he has recovered somewhat, but still fails to find employment, can treat his partial incapacity as total and award him full compensation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="648" /> Last night I mentioned, too, that I was doubtful whether an appeal would lie to a superior court in the event of either the employer or the workman being aggrieved in respect of an award given under Section 8.  Generally it is only on legal questions that appeals can be taken against workmen's compensation decisions in the Circuit Court.  Possibly in the case where an award by a circuit judge is considered inadequate or excessive, the Supreme Court, which is the appellate tribunal in this case, would probably exercise its judicial discretion in setting that particular award right, but I would ask the Minister to ensure that there is some appellate jurisdiction in respect of that section.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the present code which urgently requires remedying is the award of medical fees.  Under Section 73 of the 1934 Act that sum was fixed at a maximum of £5 to the doctor who treated that workman for his injury.  I accept entirely that the principle of workmen's compensation is not compensation for pain or suffering or for any consequential loss, but compensation for loss of earning capacity. Nevertheless, nobody can tell me or convince me that a man who is seriously injured can adequately repay his medical adviser, his surgeon as the case may be, by a court awarding this paltry £5 under Section 73.  It must happen that the workman's commitments are very much higher than that particular fee.  Therefore, apart altogether from the rights of the medical profession to get their just fees, I think it is only fair to the workman that he should at least have the comfort and satisfaction of knowing that his medical adviser, his doctor or surgeon, is properly compensated and properly paid for whatever treatment is given.</P>
    <P>I do not think anyone will accept that the £5 which at present is the maximum&mdash;and that is only given on application to the court by the doctor at the end of the year&mdash;is adequate. There are cases and cases will continually arise where not only ordinary medical treatment but a surgical operation is necessary.  The insurance company or the employer are, under the <Col N="649" /> present legislation, in no way bound to provide that treatment.</P>
    <P>In practice it does not appear that in reference to their own liability the employer or the insurance company will undertake to pay whatever fees are due for such specialist treatment so long as there is no obligation on them to do that&mdash;so long as they are not bound by existing legislation to do so.  It often happens that the workman, in relief of his own conscience, will make some attempt to pay out of his weekly or lump sum compensation something over and above that £5 to which the doctor may be entitled.</P>
    <P>One other matter to which Deputy Kyne referred, and rightly referred, is the question of whether or not workmen's compensation insurance should be compulsory.  I do not think there is any doubt that it should.  The man who owns and drives a car continuously on the roads is obliged, under pain of fine or imprisonment, to insure that car.  He is presumed to have an instrument of death under his control. Many employers, even employers in a small way, who own or occupy factories have instruments of death so long as they have inexperienced, and sometimes experienced, workers occupied around their machines.  It would be false economy and, in some cases, actual exploitation of the workman, for employers to fail to insure employees.  We all have knowledge of cases of severe hardship where people were severely injured, often maimed for life, and got no benefit because they were uninsured.  In some such cases an employer might pay the workman a small sum, but in many cases a small employer is no mark because he has no money and he emigrates rather than submit to the execution of a court decree.</P>
    <P>If anything requires to be compulsory in this country I think it is insurance of workers against injury, particularly in factories and on farms. With reference to the amendment put down by Deputy Dr. Ryan, I should like to say that even though we are discussing it now in the middle of 1955, the Bill is titled the Workmen's Compensation (Amendment) Bill, 1954. The Minister has said that one of his <Col N="650" /> first acts on assuming office was to examine what was necessary for the relief of injured workmen and this Bill was produced as a result.  The last Government did set up a committee to examine the whole problem of workmen's compensation and the Minister, even though he did not agree with the personnel of that committee, should have tackled the matter seriously at the beginning and there is no doubt that in the 12 months that have intervened that committee would have reported adequately and would have enabled the Minister to bring in a comprehensive measure.  Even when the Bill had its First Reading he should have adjourned the Second Reading for three months, set up a committee, and have had their report for the Second Reading.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, that is my main objection to this measure.  We all agree that increases in compensation are necessary but, on the other hand, one must also consider the effect it will have elsewhere.  Some suggested effects, made from this side of the House, were scorned by Government Deputies but there is no doubt that the increased weekly maximum compensation payments will put a big new onus on employers.  There must be an increase in insurance rates and, therefore, it could happen that a man now able to employ four people will have to reduce that number to three in order to meet the increased insurance commitments.  It is very likely that this increase will have such an effect, and much as we appreciate what the Minister has done for the employees, we have a corresponding obligation to insure against the imposition of additional hardship on employers.</P>
    <P>On the question of the constitution of the suggested committee, I said last night that I thought it should be a mixed body of Oireachtas members and of outside interests.  I would suggest that if possible the committee would be presided over by a Circuit Court judge because the Circuit Courts have most to do with awards under the existing legislation.  I think the Minister would find very little difficulty in finding a chairman among the Circuit Court judges who would do justice to the work of this committee.  I would <Col N="651" /> also suggest that some of the lawyer members of the House should be put on the committee.  I should like also that the industrial employers, the trade unions and the farmers represented in the House would have representatives on the committee.  Outside interests, I suggest, should similarly find a place on this committee.  I have little doubt that when this body would make its report the cleaning up and the tightening of the workmen's compensation code would at last have been achieved.  I would appeal to the Minister that, having got this Bill on the Statute Book, he will not rest there but proceed with the greatest possible expedition to set up this committee and remedy the defects in the code, some of which I have referred to and the many more equally important flaws.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Corish)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say at the outset that I feel particularly satisfied with the type of discussion we have had on this Workmen's Compensation (Amendment) Bill.  I think Deputies, from all sides of the House, have spoken freely and sincerely on the different aspects of workmen's compensation and the different provisions of this Bill.  With, I think, two exceptions, the debate could be regarded as being entirely non-political.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I indicated in my opening speech that I did not intend this Bill to correct the many defects that have been apparent for such a long time in the workmen's compensation code.  My original idea&mdash;I might say my primary aim&mdash;was to come immediately to the aid of workmen injured in the course of their employment.  I considered that the weekly allowances being paid were inadequate, that they should be stepped up, that there was no justification for a differentiation between a single and a married man.  I considered also, as, of course, the Government did, that the lump sums being paid in the cases of fatal accidents were scandalously inadequate.  I considered that the age of juvenile dependents should be raised from 15 to 16 years and that the waiting period in respect of the first three days also <Col N="652" /> should be reduced.  I think that on these points every single Deputy who has spoken has been in agreement with me.</P>
    <P>As I said also in my opening speech, and Deputy Lynch mentioned it now, it is my intention to set up a committee that will deal with the whole code of workmen's compensation and will consider particularly whether or not workmen's compensation should be run as a State scheme.</P>
    <P>I will admit that in respect of the composition of the committee of inquiry, I have changed my mind.  Two years ago, I was of opinion that a Committee of the House would be a better type of committee to consider the question of workmen's compensation, but on reconsideration I decided that an outside body, representative of workers and employers, the legal and the medical professions would do a far better job.  I hope that this committee will report to me in the shortest time possible.</P>
    <P>Section 8 seems to be the only controversial section.  Let me say at once that I am not one of those who want to steamroll any particular section or measure through this House if there are genuine and sincere opinions opposed to mine on any side of the House.  I can see certain defects in regard to the operation of Section 8, but I do not say that these defects cannot be remedied on the Committee Stage, or that the difficulties which have been mentioned in the course of the debate are insuperable.  At the same time, I am of opinion that some of the fears which certain Deputies expressed are not well founded.  In any case, between now and the Committee Stage I will have Section 8 re-examined to see whether or not it can be amended to meet the viewpoints which have been expressed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Ryan said that he was in entire agreement with sub-section (1) of Section 8 which gives an employee the right to seek redemption where there is permanent incapacity. The period within which an employee can make application to redeem is, under the terms of the Bill, six months.  I will consider whether or not a solution can be found to meet <Col N="653" /> the points expressed by extending that period to 12, 18 or 24 months.  I can see the difficulty in respect of sub-section (3).  I also undertake to have that sub-section re-examined to see if certain viewpoints which have been expressed can be met.</P>
    <P>Many of the Deputies who raised objection to Section 8 did so on many assumptions.  Some seemed to assume that our courts do not know their job, and that Section 8 will always be operated in favour of the worker.  A number also assumed that the members of the medical profession hold totally opposite opinions on the condition of an injured man according as to whether they are appearing for the applicant or the defendant.  I do not think we are going to have the spate of applicant or the defendant.  I do not think we are going to have the spate of applications for redemptions under Section 8 that was mentioned by some Deputies, especially in view of the fact that the weekly payment, on the passing of this Bill, will be much more attractive than it is at present.  I think that a worker who is permanently incapacitated will think twice before appealing for a redemption, especially when he knows that he will now be in receipt of £4 10s. a week.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Ryan also spoke about the relationship that should exist between workmen's compensation payments and social welfare benefits.  I suppose he has a certain point there. He expressed his point of view pretty clearly, but unfortunately that was not the point of view he adopted when he was Minister for Social Welfare, nor do I think it was the attitude that was adopted by his predecessors who had responsibility for workmen's compensation. I am referring now to the various Ministers for Industry and Commerce down through the years. Their attitude was not that there should be any relationship between social welfare benefits and the rate of workmen's compensation.  That has been the history of workmen's compensation during the last 30 or 40 years. Indeed, that goes back to the beginning of this century when there was no such thing as sickness benefit payments.</P>
    <P>I want to say that the Government <Col N="654" /> are not unmindful of the inadequacy of social welfare benefits as they stand at present.  Deputies are aware that the Government have introduced legislation to increase the rate of benefit in respect of old age, blind pensions, widows' and orphans' and noncontributory pensions.  I can also say that, in respect of other benefits, it is the stated policy of the Government to come to the aid of the recipients of sickness benefit, unemployment benefit and unemployment insurance and to provide for increases there as well.</P>
    <P>Much of the opposition to this Bill has been on the question of cost.  Those who dwelt mainly on the question of cost did not deal with the Bill in the detail which one would expect.  It seemed to me there was an effort on the part of some Deputies and among them, strangely enough, two of my own colleagues for the constituency of Wexford, to try and stampede certain members of the House to vote against the Bill on the allegation that it was going to impose a particularly heavy burden on employers, industry generally and on the agricultural community.</P>

      <P>I do not think that such is the fact.  I think that Deputy Allen said last night that if this Bill became law, in the case of certain local authorities&mdash;I think he mentioned county councils&mdash;it would mean an increase in the rates of between 6d. and 1/- in the £.  I do not know if Deputy Allen was speaking about the County Wexford, a county in which he takes a particular interest and of which he has a very detailed knowledge.  I made it my business this morning to inquire from the Wexford County Council how much it provided last year for workmen's compensation. Deputy Allen knows that the Wexford County Council carries its own workmen's compensation risk.  Last year, the Wexford County Council provided £1,600, and this year it is providing £3,000 on the assumption that this Bill will be in force during this year.  That sum of £3,000 represents a rate of 2d. in the £.</P>

      <P>I said that.  I merely want to point out that, in respect of County Wexford, which may be regarded as a typical example, the increase suggested by Deputy Allen of between 6d. and 1/- in the £ in the rates is entirely fantastic.  He also suggested that if the Bill were to become law it would mean an increase of from 6d. to 1/- in the rents of houses.  I confess that I have not examined that in detail, but I think I would be safe in saying that his statement in respect of that matter was nearly as fantastic as that the rates would be increased by from 6d. to 1/- in the £.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dr. Ryan moved an amendment asking that this Bill be postponed for three months to enable a Committee of this House to determine what effect the Bill will have on employment and on prices.  It amazes me that, in relation to a Bill designed to do good for workmen, anybody should propose its postponement until the effect on prices and employment can be ascertained.  It amazes me particularly when I remember that the Deputy who moved its postponement was a member of a Government which in 1952 introduced a Budget, the result of which was to increase unemployment by 18,000 in one year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us examine now what the effect of this particular Bill will be.  I think it was Deputy Allen last night&mdash;I hope I am not misquoting him because I have not had an opportunity of looking at the records&mdash;who suggested once or twice in the course of his speech that this Bill would impose an additional burden of £5,000,000 on both the agricultural and the manufacturing industries.  That of course <Col N="657" /> is very much exaggerated.  At the present time there are approximately 500,000 workers insured for the purposes of workmen's compensation.  The total premiums paid in respect of them come to £1,500,000.  That represents about £3 per head.</P>
      <P>Deputies spoke about the possibility of an increase of 100 per cent. in the rate of premium.  I shall be a little bit more conservative and put the increase at about 80 per cent.; that would mean an increase of £1,200,000. Now the total insurable population is 750,000; that is to say there are 250,000 workers who are not covered for workmen's compensation by their employers.  Assuming that another 50 per cent. of the 500,000 are not insured, we have 750,000 who would be insurable and whose employers would be responsible for compensating them in the event of an accident.  Assuming that the total increase is £1,800,000 that would represent an average of £2 8s. per workman.  I admit that £2 8s. per workman may seem a large sum, but that is on the assumption that the premiums would be increased by 80 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister give an assurance that in future there will only be an additional £2 8s. per workman? It is only £3 at the moment.  Is that an assurance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not an assurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister correct in stating £3 is all that is required to pay the premium for a workman's compensation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me put it this way: the total premiums paid amount to £1,500,000 in respect of 500,000 workers. The average per worker is £3.  It varies, of course, up and down, but the average is £3 per head.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may not be aware that it costs £6 10s. to insure an agricultural labourer.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite simple arithmetic really&mdash;very, very simple.  I am arguing on the assumption that the premium increase would be 80 per cent. and I do not think there is any justification for anybody saying or the insurance companies proposing that there will be an increase of 80 per cent. in the present premiums.</P>
      <P>I am concerned with the worker in this Bill.  I am concerned about the employer, too, but the main idea of workmen's compensation is to compensate the worker for loss of earnings. The number of workers involved, whose employers are liable to compensate them, is in the region of 750,000 and of that number 500,000 are insured by their employers.  The total premium in relation to the 500,000 is £1,400,000. Let us bear in mind at the same time that that £1,400,000 does not cover workmen's compensation entirely.  It is also intended to cover common law actions.  I think it would be unreasonable to assume that £500,000 of that £1,400,000 is paid by way of compensation to injured workers.</P>
      <P>Deputy Desmond gave certain figures, and I think they are pretty accurate, showing the premiums paid per year and the amount paid out to the ordinary workman.  I think all of us must admit that of the total sum received by insurance companies by way of workmen's compensation premiums the injured workman certainly does not get a fair proportion; he gets a very small part of it indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The legal profession get just as much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>That is another day's work.  I think employers themselves ought to be concerned about the treatment meted out to them by insurance companies.  The insurance companies have indicated to me that in respect of the increase from £2 10s. per week to £4 10s. per week and also in respect of the increase in the case of fatal accidents, and in relation to other minor changes, the increase will be in the region of 23 per cent.  In relation to Section 8 and Section 11 they have suggested an increase of 49 per cent. <Col N="659" /> on the existing rates.  Frankly, I cannot understand where the insurance companies get this notional figure, because it can only be a notional figure, of 49 per cent.  I believe it is on the assumption that every injured workman will now seek redemption.  I believe, too, that it is based on the assumption that in every case where redemption is sought the courts will grant the redemption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>They have power to do that under the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The judges administering the courts in this country are not fools.  The injured workman must prove his case.  He will have to prove permanent incapacity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>That represents a total increase of 72 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>On existing rates, yes. As I have said, I cannot for the life of me understand how the insurance companies can justify an increase of 49 per cent. on existing rates in relation to Section 8 and Section 11 of this Bill.  I will deal with Section 11 later, but, in respect of Section 8, I have given my views already and I said that I was prepared to reconsider Section 8 with a view to amending its provisions on the lines that were suggested by Deputy Dr. Ryan, Deputy Kyne and Deputy Larkin in the course of this debate.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dr. Ryan submitted that we might, in respect of workmen's compensation, consider the setting up of a special court or tribunal to deal with compensation claims so that we might achieve some uniformity in decision.  I appreciate his concern about that, but I do not think it would be at all feasible or desirable.  If a special case can be made for establishing a special court or tribunal to deal with workmen's compensation cases there would also be a case for the setting up of a special court to deal with drunken driving charges in order that there would be uniformity in decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many people have complained of the different decisions in workmen's compensation cases, but so also people <Col N="660" /> from time to time have complained of the differences in judgments by one district justice as against another in respect of drunken driving or other charges.  I appreciate what Deputy Dr. Ryan has in mind and I think it is something that might be considered by the commission which will deal with the whole code of workmen's compensation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kyne made reference here to a case, or cases, brought to his notice in the last few weeks where employers are seeking now to achieve a redemption of weekly payments being made to injured workmen, believing, of course, that the redemptions that might be made by the courts would be at the old rates.  If such a practice is being engaged in, or to be engaged in, between now and the passing of this Bill, I think it is only right that steps should be taken to rectify that position. The Bill has been under discussion for some time and it is a few months since it was published, but it could be described as nothing less than sharp practice, on the part of these employers, if they now seek redemption whereas heretofore they made no effort to come to terms with the injured workman.  If this sharp practice is to be engaged in now and in the next few weeks I will have to seek the permission of the Dáil to include an amendment which will do justice to the injured workman.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. A. Byrne Mr. A. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister's amendment be retrospective in case what he fears may have happened?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to remind the Deputy that I have promised nothing. I will consider the introduction of an amendment to deal with this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Ryan took exception to the abolition of the supplemental allowances.  I had a pretty rigid view of that matter when the 1953 Act was before the Dáil and I think many of us in the Opposition, from all Parties, took exception to the fact that the supplemental allowances were being introduced. The principal aim in introducing them originally was to compensate a man who had a family and I think it would be a very bad precedent to <Col N="661" /> continue this idea of differentiating between a single man and a married man.  We might find ourselves eventually subjected to pressure from certain sections to differentiate between single and married men in industry and to pay a single man a certain wage and a larger wage to a married man. Inasmuch as at present industry does not differentiate between single and married men, and I hope there never will be such differentiation, I do not know of any reason why there should be such differentiation either in the case of workmen's compensation.</P>
    <P>Deputies also suggested that we should take steps to make workmen's compensation compulsory.  I do not think it was intended that anything should be done in this Bill to make insurance compulsory in respect of workmen's compensation.  I believe every one of us considers it to be desirable and I believe that the employer who is not covered by insurance is undergoing a very severe risk which I would not be prepared to undergo.  For his own protection, as in the case of a man who is driving a motor car, every person who employs a man should insure for the purpose of workmen's compensation.</P>
    <P>I was interested in the views given by Deputy Dr. Ryan on Section 11 of this Bill because I thought that I was doing him a favour.  Every one of us applauded the introduction by Deputy Dr. Ryan of Section 6 of the 1953 Act. Section 6 was introduced to allow a workmen's compensation claim within a period of 12 months to proceed by way of common law.  I remember listening to Deputy Dr. Ryan and saying to myself that that was the indication of that section of the 1953 Act. Deputy Dr. Ryan now comes along and says that that section was only intended to allow an injured workman to proceed within 12 months by way of common law if it was proved that he was ignorant of his rights.  I took the trouble of reading up the debate of the 28th July, 1953, and while certain workers are adverted to Deputy Dr. Ryan that day heard views expressed that the section was not absolutely airtight.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Ryan was very insistent that the section was airtight and my <Col N="662" /> only purpose in introducing Section 11 was to make assurance doubly sure. In view of a recent decision that has been given by the Supreme Court possibly my fears were unfounded, and possibly now it will not be necessary to continue with Section 11, but Section 11 was introduced before the decision was given by the Supreme Court, as I wanted to safeguard the position, especially the position of injured workmen who would be affected by Section 11.</P>
    <P>Many other small points were raised but I do not think it was intended that they should be dealt with by me or that they should be dealt with in the present Bill.  The committee which I propose to set up will, I trust, be functioning in a very short time and will, I believe, tackle all the complicated problems that go with workmen's compensation codes, and make suggestions to remedy these difficulties and overcome the problems involved.</P>
    <P>I do not think that the amendment which Deputy Dr. Ryan moved should be considered by the House.  The very significant thing about it was that there was practically no support from his own Party for the amendment, which leads me to believe it is not a Party amendment.  Deputy Lynch welcomed Section 8 without any qualification here last night although the main theme of Deputy Dr. Ryan's speech was that Section 8 would be the most expensive part of the Bill. Deputy McGrath made an admirable speech on this particular Bill and he demonstrated&mdash;as did several others and I merely take Deputy McGrath because he is an Opposition Deputy&mdash; that he fully appreciates all the difficulties of injured workmen and what they need.  Therefore, I would suggest that the amendment be withdrawn, or failing that, that the House would reject it because it appears to me, on a thorough examination of all the facts at my disposal with regard to cost, that there is no justification at all for assuming that the passing of this Workmen's Compensation Bill will have the effect that Deputy Dr. Ryan seems to think it would have.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>When the debate on this Estimate was adjourned yesterday, I was more or less replying to certain statements made by Deputies opposite, and, in particular, by Deputy Fagan of the Fine Gael Party.  In his statement, he gave us to understand that the Land Commission were working too fast, that they were dividing land much too quickly and that therein there was a danger to our national economy.  The real danger then pointed out as flowing from this vast division of land was that the large farms of the country would disappear and we would have nothing in their place but small farms, and, having nothing but small farmers, we would become as the Danes have become, slaves.  I have already dealt with the matter of the type of Danish slavery referred to and with how ridiculous this statement really is.  Far from being slavery, it would appear that by dividing up the land on the system obtaining in that country, we would increase the prosperity of our nation and have our people very much better off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is disturbing, however, about this statement and this type of outlook is that it comes from a Deputy of many years' standing in one of the largest Parties in the House and it is really something we would need to take note of and inquire into, to find out whether or not this outlook, expressed by Deputy Fagan, should by any chance be a reflection of the policy in regard to the division of land of Fine Gael, because, if this were so, the people of the country should be made aware of the outlook of that Party, if that outlook is as expressed by Deputy <Col N="666" /> Fagan.  They should be made aware that Fine Gael would not be in favour of dividing the land of this country and do not want or seek to have small farmers in these Twenty-Six Counties.</P>
    <P>They would need to know that farmers living on small farms are sometimes to be avoided, that they are an evil in any country in which they exist and that, in fact, they can be regarded as no better than slaves.  If that should be the Fine Gael policy, which I hope it is not, then our people should know that that is Fine Gael policy and they should be made aware of it at the earliest opportunity because up to the present time they have not been made aware of it and they may have been mislead in regard to this matter as they may have been misled in other ways by Fine Gael propaganda.</P>
    <P>On the question of leaving undisturbed large ranches in this country, I know that we on this side of the House do not believe that the large ranches are absolutely an essential part of our economy.  If we can have the land of those ranches divided up and more usefully worked than they are at present &mdash;and, God knows, in many cases that would not be very difficult&mdash;if we can have them divided in such a way that a greater production can be taken from those lands then we can and will divide them on any and on every opportunity we get.  We do not believe these lands should be left to those ranchers who would like to have cattle and only cattle on them&mdash;and not only would they like only to have cattle on them but they would not even want to grow the produce on some of their land to feed their cattle.  They would prefer to get the small farmers from tillage counties such as my own county of Donegal to grow the crops for them and give them their grain and other crops for a bad price and, if they could not get them at a bad price, they would like to continue importing feeding stuffs from abroad.  We have never believed and we never will believe in that system.</P>
    <P>We believe the land is there to be used by the people of this country to its best advantage and we believe that to use it to its best advantage entails <Col N="667" /> not only a greater production but also, where possible, a greater amount of employment.  No one in his senses will suggest that land left in large tracts of hundreds and possibly thousands of acres under large heavy dry cattle is really giving employment in the way that land can give employment if tilled and properly farmed as lands are farmed in other parts of the country. We also believe that the people in the Midlands and in Deputy Fagan's constituency are not all of a mind with him in resenting the migrants who come in from the West.  In many cases, these migrants are welcomed by the local community and in the short number of years some of them have been in the Midlands they have helped in many ways the life and the economy of the part of the country in which they have been settled.  We consider that more of that can be done and should be done.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, we believe that people such as Deputy Fagan should not be countenanced in this House in view of his outlook in regard to this matter which he expressed here yesterday.  We believe also that Fine Gael, as a Party, should either publicly dissociate themselves from his remarks, through some of their spokesmen, or that they should stand up and say that Deputy Fagan was speaking for Fine Gael and that what he said represents Fine Gael policy.  On the other hand, I should like to ask Deputy Fagan and his Fine Gael colleagues why it is that, if they do not believe in land division and if they think the Land Commission is working too fast, they are nevertheless supporting it.  I should like to ask them why they are keeping as Minister for Lands a Deputy from the Clann na Talmhan Party who does believe in land division and who wants to see the land divided, where possible.  Why carry on with the present Minister in that office if they do not believe that this job has to be done and should be done?</P>
    <P>On the other hand, if it was only a case of Deputy Fagan giving his personal views then so much the better. It is better that it should be that way than that his Party should hold such views but it is something that should <Col N="668" /> be cleared up and it should go from this House that we do not agree with Deputy Fagan when he talks of Danish farmers as slaves and when he talks in scathing terms of small farmers as a community in this country.</P>
    <P>There are many other matters which I should like to mention very briefly on this debate.  When I began my speech here yesterday I intended to talk about these other matters but such was the tirade we heard from the opposite side of the House immediately before I began my speech that I was led away from what I really wanted to say.  The statement made here yesterday that the Land Commission were dividing land and working too fast is, I think, the greatest bloomer we have ever heard in this House from anybody on any subject under the sun.  Nobody thinks that the Land Commission are working too fast.  Nobody thinks that, generally speaking, the Department of Lands work too fast nor, for that matter, will anybody agree that any Department works too fast.  Our usual trouble with all Departments, for various reasons, is that when we want anything done they are much too slow. While that is true of all Departments I think nowhere is it more true than of the Land Commission. The Land Commission have been in existence for many years.  They were set up years ago with a very definite purpose in mind.  That purpose has not been attained and, judging by the progress made so far, it is not likely to be attained in our time&mdash;and if only the same rate of progress is continued with then I doubt if the purposes for which it was originally set up will ever be attained.</P>
    <P>We do not seem to be getting the lands divided and rearranged as we had hoped.  It would seem that there are a number of reasons why the Land Commission cannot go faster.  I do not say that all of these reasons, added together, are sufficient to justify their slow rate of progress but undoubtedly certain of these objections and these snags are holding them up.  That is where I believe the Minister or any Minister for Lands should be able to do something.  As we see it at the moment, the acquisition of land is one of the big troubles.  Far from improving <Col N="669" /> the situation, the legislation of more recent years has tended to make a complete dead end of the acquisition of land in that the clause about giving market value for land does not, in fact, operate and apparently cannot operate in the minds of the Land Commission. Why this thing cannot be operated is more than I can see.  Why the Land Commission cannot go out when a farm is for sale and purchase it for what is regarded as market value, I do not know.  There is no great reason that I can see why they cannot do it.</P>
    <P>If I want land or if anybody else wants land and there is a farm on the market then the only consideration is whether or not we have the money to buy it.  I have never heard of an instance coming before the House where the Land Commissioners, through their Minister, made the case that they had not the money to buy a particular farm.  The money is usually available so far as I know and yet although the lands become available they are not always taken up by the Land Commission even though they may need land in the particular area in which it is offered.  Why cannot they get going?  Why cannot they get a move on?  Where land is offered, where it is needed for rearrangement and redistribution, why cannot they get that land?  If it is on the market, so much the better; it should be easier to get it then than when they have to acquire it compulsorily.</P>
    <P>You have this kind of thing happening in certain cases.  You have the Land Commission endeavouring to get land and over a number of years they will have their minds made up that a certain portion of land is very desirable in a particular district.  Apparently they have gone into the matter and have decided that so many acres of land in this particular townland or townlands would make the adjoining holdings of an economic size.  After years, that particular holding may come on the market&mdash;and what happens? Not what we would expect.  We do not find that when it comes on the market it is immediately taken up by the Land Commission and rearranged.</P>
    <P>In my own part of the country, there is a farm that ten years ago was being <Col N="670" /> sought by the Land Commission for purchase by agreement.  They were then of the opinion that such a farm would be very useful in order to give economic holdings to nine or ten people in smaller holdings around about.  During the past 12 months the farm that they sought ten years ago by agreement was on offer, the owner having died.  What happened?  They allowed somebody else to purchase that farm and to settle down in the midst of that congestion, just as it was ten, 20 or 30 years ago and as it will be in another 20 or 30 years.  What I want to know is, if ten years ago the situation in a particular district was such that the Land Commission believed they should purchase the land for rearrangement, why&mdash;nothing having changed in the meantime except the Government&mdash;should they decide now that the need is not there any longer, that they do not want that farm, although they knew it was available and was on offer to the public?</P>
    <P>I raised this matter here and I was given very little satisfaction by the Minister.  All I want to know from the Minister here to-day is this: did the Land Commission, unaided and unabetted by anybody in politics or otherwise, without any push from either side&mdash;did they within the last two or three months decide of their own volition that rearrangement was not necessary, despite the fact that ten years ago in the same circumstances they decided that it was necessary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Now, the Minister does not get that cock to fight here to-day. I know this area like the back of my hand.  I knew it ten years ago and long before.  Nothing there has changed, except that the owner of that farm has since died.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>And three people moved out of the village since.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>That farm was offered for sale and the Land Commission were made aware of it, by me if by nobody else, and they did nothing about it.  I want to know why that change of heart took place.  I am suspicious <Col N="671" /> that it did not take place entirely in the minds of the Land Commissioners, without a little jab from left to right from somebody in office, or somebody with some power somewhere or other to give the wink as to what should be done.</P>
      <P>In addition to this particular area that I talk about being congested, the rundale system operates in the locality also.  The rundale system is something that should not exist to-day.  I say that with all due respect to everybody in the Land Commission who has been working over the years to get something done by way of settling up our holdings.  The rundale system would not exist if the job had been carried on as it should have been since the Land Commission was established.  It is a disgrace to find, after all these years, that you have holdings still on the rundale system.  It is a system that gives no satisfaction to anyone and that causes more friction and more trouble in rural communities than any other thing I know of.  You have a field here and a neighbour next to it and you go across his land to get into your own field; you have someone else crossing over your land to get into another field; and there are no fences between any of them to mark the boundaries, nothing in many cases but a few stones stuck here and there in the ground.</P>
      <P>That is something that should not be in evidence to-day, if the Land Commission were doing their work and if the various Ministers concerned in the Department of Lands had seen to it that they did their job.  It is not only a question of getting the best possible results out of the land held by these people.  It also means an end to the rundale system, an end to something that is a cause of friction and trouble and that very often has developed into family feuds over the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These things are known to the Minister sitting opposite.  They are known to the Land Commission also. What this House and the people would like to know is what they are going to do about it.  They are doing very little about it at present and seem to <Col N="672" /> have very little intention to do anything. It is all very well to point out how many holdings were rerarranged in the past 12 months, how many acres of land were redistributed. what you have really to look at and ask yourselves is: &ldquo;What did we not do during the past year that is crying out to be done; what is there to be done that we have not done and what are we going to do about it in the next 12 months?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Land Commission have another fault that is very apparent in some parts of the country.  They take over lands and for one reason or another&mdash; many of the reasons being quite reasonable and legitimate&mdash;the land they have taken over cannot be redistributed or divided until further land becomes available.  In the meantime these lands already held are let by conacre on the 11 months system. I do not mind their being let.  I do not mind their being used by the people who want to take them and pay a rent for them.  What I object to is that these lands are held in that manner over a long term of years and in those lettings no consideration whatever is given to the fact that at some future date some unfortunate will get them as a holding from which he is expected to make a living.  In the intervening years the land is run out of condition, everything in it is taken from it and nothing is put back.  You cannot blame people who take the land this year if, knowing they will not have it next year, they try to get all they can out of it and put nothing into it.</P>
    <P>It is up to the people holding the land&mdash;it is up to the Land Commission, when they are responsible&mdash;to ensure that the land is kept in proper heart and, if anything, that it should be improved for the future tenants rather than made barren and derelict and useless, to be saddled on some poor unfortunate later, who thinks he has got something when in fact he has got nothing.  That is going on and something should be done to stop it.  It should be stopped immediately and not next year or the year after.  If we cannot divide the land we take over to-day and if we must let it, then we <Col N="673" /> should ensure that it is properly used, and not abused as is the case now.</P>
    <P>Think of the people who are going to get that land eventually, think of them as tenants or farmers in the future, who will expect to make a living from such land.  Do not think of them as units you are going to place on a particular holding so as to be able to say in this House that so many units have been placed there in the last 12 months, and &ldquo;is not that a fine job?&rdquo;  There is no use making units or numbers of them, they must be given land that will give them a return for their work.  Land that has been let for years by the conacre system is not suitable for anyone after it has been changed round and trampled over for ten years in conacre, with nothing going into it and everything being taken out of it.  When you put a farmer on that land you are really committing him to slave labour, as he will not be able to make anything of it unless he has a lot more money than one expects such people to have.</P>
    <P>Another matter that has been aired here on numerous occasions is the question of what is regarded as a landless man.  That was mentioned by a number of speakers yesterday.  I would like again to point out, in regard to my own county, the meaning of that phrase &ldquo;landless men&rdquo; in regard to land division and distribution. It is rather unique&mdash;it may not be confined to Donegal, but it is certainly not general&mdash;that we have a system whereby we have had people for years and their fathers before them working the same land, the same fields.</P>
    <P>They have held that land year in and year out under almost a perpetual letting or lease.  That land is not theirs.  It is not in their ownership. It belongs to part of an estate which at some time or another may be taken over by the Land Commission, and in some cases in the past many of these places have been taken over.  My grievance is that these men are, in the main, regarded as landless men.  They are not given the same consideration as a small uneconomic holder who may adjoin these particular estates and they are not therefore given a fair <Col N="674" /> crack of the whip when it comes to dividing this estate on which they and their fathers before them have laboured.</P>
    <P>Can you regard such a man as a landless man and pass him over as somebody who should not be given land because he does not own it?  Some of these people in my county are the best farmers we have.  They have more know-how on farming than many of those with much bigger and better farms of their own.  They are traditional farmers and tillage farmers. They own their own machinery; they have their own animals and their own stock; they have carried them down through the years and they are farmers in every way except that they do not own the title deeds to the land which they and their fathers before them have worked.</P>
    <P>When the Land Commission come along and take over an estate on which these people are working, we find such men being regarded, to all intents and purposes, as landless men.  These are the people who should be considered in the first instance.  It is in the eastern part of my county particularly that the system has been operating.  When land is being divided, what is the use in moving in migrants from any other part of the county, relieving congestion along the western fringe, if you create new land slums, new congestion, in the very area you are dividing?  What is the point in relieving congestion in the west if thereby you re-create congestion in the east and with this added disadvantage: the people from the west generally have lived through it and know what congestion is.  They have learned the hard way how they can live in a congested district; but these people in the east who are being moved out and left without an acre of land either because of rent or for some other reason, are people who have been working land, who know no other way of living.  Where are they to go?  What are they to do?  Surely any Minister, any Department and any commission that go into this matter thoroughly&mdash; and I do not believe they have gone into it thoroughly yet&mdash;will agree with me that these people who are traditional farmers, who have earned their <Col N="675" /> livelihood as farmers and are good tillarge farmers, should get first consideration as the land becomes available, over and above the migrants.  By all means bring in the migrants and plant them so that they can supplant the planters of old who are rampant in that part of my county.  I would be delighted to see the migrants coming in when these people who are now tilling the land have been satisfied.  That part of my county was planted.  Let us plant it again but plant it properly, with the right type of farmer, not the rancher, not the big man.  Give us the ordinary hard-working people who are there willing to take that land and who have in many cases been working that land and paying rent to the planters of old.</P>
    <P>Let the Minister not think that this is a matter I am airing here for any political purpose.  Neither do I want the Land Commission to take it that I am unduly criticising them in this matter.  I believe this system or this way of living in the east of my county is rather unique.  It may occur in some other parts of the country but it certainly does not generally occur. Look on this matter as something applying to my county only.  Do not look on it in the general way that you look on land division and redistribution of land in other parts of the country because in doing that you are not being fair to the people in my county.</P>
    <P>Ours is a different system and a different pattern.  If you are going to see that pattern is properly rearranged you must look on it in a different manner from the manner in which you look at the rest of the country.  I am asking not for special consideration for these people, not for anything out of the ordinary but that in dealing with their case you should have full regard to the system and the pattern, to the tradition of these farmers who are regarded as landless because they do not actually own the land which they have been working for generations.</P>
    <P>It was mentioned here by speakers that migration is no solution to our problem of congestion.  I do not agree that it is no solution.  I would be <Col N="676" /> likely to agree that it is not a full solution but to say it is no solution is entirely wrong.  It is a help in many cases and being a help I feel sure that anything that has been said in that strain will not interfere with the Minister or the Land Commission in going ahead with their rearrangement programme and their migration of farmers from the western seaboard.</P>
    <P>Migration is a help and we want to see it done more speedily and in many more places.  We want to see it done fast because one of the big reasons&mdash; apart from any other reason we may have heard&mdash;for getting it over and done with is that congestion is actually inclined to grow as fast in many places as it is being dissipated in others.  If we do not get a move on we will find that we might as well be marking time because what we are doing to-day is being undone somewhere else tomorrow due to the slow pace at which this work has been carried on.</P>
    <P>Let us go ahead with this work and get it done.  If there are snags existing at the moment that are hindering the Land Commission, the Department of Lands and the Minister, let them find out what those snags are.  Let the Minister come into this House with the remedy for those snags.  I can assure the Minister that in suggesting remedies for such snags he will not be hindered in any way from this side of the House.  We will be glad to see any measure being brought in that will help to push ahead with the rearrangement of our land in this country. Anything he can do by way of legislation will, I am sure, have the help and co-operation of this side of the House.</P>
    <P>We should not keep on talking about the hindrance certain things are.  We should not say we would have done this or that but for a particular snag. Let us not be excusing ourselves year in and year out: &ldquo;We would do it but for the operation of certain legislation.&rdquo; If there are snags and if new legislation is required surely the proper thing to do is to put that legislation on paper, bring it before the House, pass it and get on with the job.</P>
    <P>Coming back to the statement made that migration is no solution for congestion <Col N="677" /> and that only industry and afforestation can relieve congestion, I say it is a big help and would be an even greater help to the relief of congestion if it was pushed ahead much faster, and that is what I am asking the Minister to do.  Although disagreeing with those who made the statement that it was no help, I want to agree with them when they say that this question of afforestation and industry can be a very great help.  I do not say, however, that it is the only solution. I say let us have migration, afforestation and industry, let us have all three for the west of the country. Let us push ahead with them as quickly as we can and in addition to dealing with migration let the Department of Lands get its skates on in the matter of afforestation also.</P>
    <P>There will be a debate on that matter later and, therefore, I will not go into it, first of all because I would not be allowed and secondly because it is not appropriate to this debate.  Let the Department of Lands go on with its job.  Do not let that Department be looked upon as something that is there but is doing nothing.  Do not let us have either the Department or the Land Commission being regarded down the country as a limbo to which letters may go but from which no replies ever issue.</P>
    <P>The Department of Lands is much too important to reach the state it has reached at the moment.  We must pull it out of that condition.  Let us rejuvenate it; let us give it the powers that it is lacking and let us bring in the necessary legislation enabling it to do its work, and I can tell the Minister that when he brings such legislation before this House he will get the full co-operation of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <P>So I say to the Minister let him, as head of the Department of Lands, and in fairness to himself and to his Party and to the country, remove the snags that exist in his Department; let him take away the boulders that are in the way of the speedy acquisition and division of land and of the other aspects of the Department's work.  Let him get on with the job of having the very necessary work of the Department carried <Col N="678" /> out more speedily so that our nation will be one of farmers, many of them small farmers but all of them farmers of whom we can be proud and not, as Deputy Fagan said, people of whom we should be ashamed.  We are proud of our small farmers and let the Minister see that we have more of them in the future.  The more of them we have the better the country will be economically and otherwise.</P>

      <P>There is one rule of the Land Commission which is debarring some of our uneconomic holders in County Dublin from getting decent farms.  This regulation is that they will not get any land if they are over a mile away from the land that is being divided.  I think the distance is a mile.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>At the moment there are several small uneconomic farmers in County Dublin who have to travel nine or ten miles to land which they have set.  They are very good tillage farmers and I would appeal to the Minister and to the Land Commission to consider favourably my representation on their behalf.  I have raised this matter on numerous previous occasions because I feel that grave hardships are being inflicted on these uneconomic holders in North County Dublin by this regulation.  If a farm is divided and if it is just outside the mile, an uneconomic holder will not get part of it.  These men, who are most industrious, are paying from £15 to £40 per acre for land and they have to travel anything from nine to 15 miles in order to work that land. I put it to the Minister that it is time that rule was waived where it applies to so many uneconomic holders in this <Col N="679" /> particular area.  I say that in the light of experience I have had.</P>
      <P>Another point I want to make is on behalf of a big number of conacre farmers. These men have been in occupation of land, let to them in conacre, over a long number of years.  I would ask the Minister that where people who have been working conacre for a long period become dispossessed by Land Commission acquisition of that land these men would get consideration. Surely, where they have worked this land for so many years, they are entitled in fairness to special consideration.  I have spoken many times before about this problem as has Deputy Blaney about the same problem in Donegal.  These people deserve sympathetic treatment.  They deserve at least the same treatment as a herd on an acquired estate would get.  I assure the Minister that this problem is acute, particularly in my constituency; it is a matter of depriving these people of their livelihood.</P>
      <P>Still another burning question is that of the Land Commission roads in County Dublin.  I have not studied the position in that regard in other parts of the country so I shall speak of the situation in Dublin only.  I am not making this point now as a criticism of the Minister or of his predecessor because I think it is a matter of Land Commission policy to make roads which in fact are not roads at all.  The Dublin County Council will not take over these roads because they are not properly laid.  Farmers find it impossible to use these roads to get into their holdings.  I think the Minister should consider the question of bringing about some co-ordination between the Land Commission and the Local Government Department so that the roads could be automatically handed over to the local authorities for maintenance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course it is your fault because the council are not prepared to take over roads which are not properly made.  What I am <Col N="680" /> suggesting is that there would be some sort of co-ordination between the Department of Lands and the Department of Local Government so that the roads would be properly made and could be taken over and maintained by the county council.  At the moment these roads are no better than boreens or prairie tracks and they have been disimproving over the years.  It is time that something was done about it.</P>
      <P>The Minister, and the Minister for Local Government, should get together and establish some form of coordinating machinery for dealing with this and eliminating the grievances which every Deputy is up against where any land has been divided or where Land Commission roads have been made.  The Minister knows that what I am saying is true.  I have raised this question here many times. I wanted to raise it on one occasion on the Adjournment, and I am now taking the opportunity of doing so.</P>
      <P>All sorts of grievances are associated with this question of bad roads, and I suggest it is time that the Minister and the Land Commission should come to a determination to try and eliminate those grievances and to say that in future they are going to do a good job on these roads.  If that is done there will be no necessity for Deputies to raise this matter any more in the House.  I am not blaming the Minister or his predecessor for the fact that such roads have been made.  In my opinion, these roads are a disgrace in any country, and it is most unfair to the people who have to live on them in their present neglected state.  Business people and others have refused to deliver goods to the people who live on those Land Commission roads.  It is impossible to take threshing and other machinery along them.  The Dublin County Council will not take them over.  In conclusion, I hope that something will be done at once about these prairie tracks.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been listening to debates on this Estimate since I became a member of the House in 1932. There have been debates on this whole question of the completion of land purchase and the division of land.  It is <Col N="681" /> now 52 years since land division activities commenced in this country, and undoubtedly I could pay compliments to the Congested Districts Board, to the Estates Commissioners and also to the Land Commission for the very useful work that has been accomplished all over that period.  At the same time, there are very few people who would believe that it would take that length of time to complete land purchase and land division here.  We all admit that 52 years is a very long period of time, and yet the question of land acquisition and land distribution seems to be as live an issue in this House as ever it was.</P>
      <P>I believe that the proceedings regarding land acquisition are all together too prolonged.  The preliminary notification of the intention of the Land Commission to acquire or resume a holding is furnished, I presume, to the owner or his solicitor.  There are a considerable number of preliminaries, and these go on for a number of years in many instances.  Take an owner of land who has land in a number of townlands.  The various townlands are mentioned, and the area in each town-land owned by the occupier.  That is left hanging on for a very considerable time.  Eventually, a decision is come to and a certain amount of land in some of the townlands is taken.  The owner is left with the remainder.  I cannot understand why that decision could not have been given in a much shorter period than five, seven or ten years as happens in many instances.  In my opinion it is most undesirable.  In the first place, it is holding out certain hopes to the people concerned in getting land, and in the second place it has this effect that the owner of the land has that threat hanging over his head during all those years.  Consequently, he is not going to take the same interest in working his land as he otherwise would.  That is one of the faults that I have to find with the Land Commission activity and the system that is being operated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is all right to advocate the speedy acquisition of land, but there is not much use in that if we do not also have a speedy division of land.  I do not know whether it is staff shortage <Col N="682" /> is the cause or not, but for the life of me I cannot understand why an estate, taken over in 1947 or early in 1948, is still undivided.  I cannot understand why a part scheme was prepared, houses erected and holdings pointed out to migrants, and yet the migrants have not been brought there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>What I have said has been happening.  I know another estate which is quite close to my home. It was taken over, I think, in the end of 1948.  The negotiations were on in the latter part of 1947, but it was taken over in 1948 or 1949, and it has been let in conacre grazing and tillage since then.  Some of that estate when it was taken over was in a pretty bad way because it had been let for conacre tillage during the emergency and was very neglected.  I understand that last year the Land Commission made it a condition on those who took it for conacre tillage that they should put in a certain amount of fertiliser and also sow it with grass seeds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that such a length of time should be allowed to elapse before proceeding with the division of that estate.  I believe there is sufficient Land Commission staff in the County Galway to deal with it and have something done by way of having a scheme prepared.  I put a question to the Minister some few weeks ago in respect of the estate that I am now speaking about.  The Minister's reply was&mdash;I know, of course, very well that this is the information he got from the Department&mdash;that the staff were on more important work than in dealing with this estate.  The fact is that the Land Commission took over that estate of 373 statute acres in the year 1948-49, and that they have continued <Col N="683" /> to let it in conacre grazing and tillage. If that estate had been taken over in an area where there was acute congestion, and the Land Commission found that they had some difficulty in preparing a scheme for it and then had to let it in conacre for grazing, meadow, or tillage, I could very well understand that, but in this case the land is not in the centre of an area where there is real acute congestion. There could not be acute congestion there because of all the land that was divided previously in that particular area.</P>
    <P>There is another feature of this question which was mentioned by Deputy Blaney.  It was that, when land is being let by the Land Commission, very often it is not the smallholders even in the locality who get it.  They perhaps get a preference, but they are outbid by the very large landholders.  I know people who have taken conacre tillage on a particular estate that I have in mind even though they have plenty of land to till on their own holdings. I think that is a matter that should be taken into consideration by those in charge.  I move to report progress.</P>

      <P>Our liberalisation, in fact, now slightly exceeds the liberlisation contemplated in the agreement to which we adhere under certain conditions.

      <P>The Minister has gone; he cannot even wait for two minutes. Every member of the Labour Party has cleared out&mdash;I do not know why.  I was addressing myself to those empty benches when this debate was adjourned.  The questions I was addressing to them are of some importance, particularly to the people who voted for them at the last election and who enabled them to put the Coalition Government into power again.  I was proceeding to contrast one section in this Finance Bill with the attitude of the Coalition Government on the implementation of the Health Act. Under this Finance Bill, in Section 4, the income-tax payer will be relieved of a portion of his income-tax provided <Col N="689" /> he insures himself and his family against accidents and illness, and he will get relief of his income-tax on the payments he makes.</P>
      <P>Now it was provided in the Health Act that a man in receipt of up to £600 per year, with a wife and three children, would get help if he or any member of his family fell ill.  The Coalition Government have steadfastly refused to implement that Act.  The man in receipt of £600 a year, with a wife and three children, gets no help from the State if he or any member of his family falls ill, irrespective of whether that illness lasts for a week or six months and irrespective of whether they have to pay two guineas to a specialist or £200 to a hospital.</P>
      <P>While the Coalition Government, with the help of the Labour Party, have refused to give the benefits to the middle income group, to the clerk with the small salary or the artisan earning £10 or £12 per week, they have jumped in in this Bill to give a subsidy to the people who pay income-tax and surtax, and there is no means test.  They may have £700 per year or £700 per week; nevertheless the Government will not apply a means test to that particular group and they will get the relief in income-tax irrespective of what the amount of their income may be.</P>
      <P>This subvention is free for all income-tax payers.  But the man with a wife and three children earning £600 per year, who may have to pay a few hundreds in some unfortunate case for himself, or his wife, or a member of his family who falls ill and has to go to hospital for a long period, gets no assistance.  The Health Act has been postponed but the Government has jumped in to help the very large income-tax and surtax payer.  I would like some member of the Government &mdash;the members of the Labour Party have disappeared again; the Tánaiste would not wait&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If I am wrong let me be corrected.  It is no use the Parliamentary <Col N="690" /> Secretary simply saying I am wrong.  He has said that on many occasions.

      <P>I have no doubt that it is in the Parliamentary Secretary's interest to defend the Coalition Government and the Labour Party in this particular instance, even if he has to make interruptions without any basis; but I want to know why it is that the Government and the Parties comprising it are prepared to give a subvention to people in the income-tax and surtax groups to help them to insure themselves and their families against illness and the consequences of illness and refuse to implement the Health Act which would at least have helped the middle-sized farmer and the middle-income group in the towns and cities.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Health went down somewhere and condemned the giving of doles to everybody, a practice which, he said, was being operated by the Fianna Fáil Party.  That was last November.  But now the Coalition Government are prepared to give a dole to the large income-tax and surtax payers to help to insure themselves against illness and the consequences of illness.  I am not contesting that that is a bad idea, but they are prepared to give that dole to people who can very well afford to insure themselves out of their own resources and they are, at the same time, refusing to give the rights which this Parliament conferred on the middle-income group and the middle-sized farmers under the Health Act of 1952 or 1953.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is as usual quite wrong.  He is as wrong as he was in his reference to the entertainments duty and the man who made the thousands of pounds out of the abolition of the dance tax two or three months before it was actually abolished.  This Finance Bill provides that a man who is paying income-tax will get relief of some portion of that tax if he insures against illness for himself or his family.  The Tánaiste at one time used to berate Fianna Fáil for their favouritism towards the large income-tax payers and particularly towards those who made a profit out of Irish Industry.  He denounced the people who put the money into Irish industry and made a profit out of it as racketeers and he said that, if he had his way, they would all be behind the thickest jail walls he could find.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>If I am not allowed to remind him of his threat to put our industrialists behind the thickest jail walls the Government could find, then let me remind him of one thing which undoubtedly comes within the scope of this discussion; that is, what he said about the excess profits tax.  He said: &ldquo;By returning a strong Labour Party the people would have the guarantee that excess profits would be taxed to provide money to subsidise food and thus reduce the cost of commodities.&rdquo; He said that in Limerick on 24th January, 1948.  Speaking at Celbridge also in 1948 he said: &ldquo;Nobody had been able to explain why £4,500,000 of excess profits tax had been turned back to those whose backs were best able to bear the taxation burdens instead of being given to those whose only relaxation was a simple smoke or a glass of stout.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In those days the Tánaiste, then Deputy Norton, was going to take £4,500,000 to subsidise the ordinary bulk of the people of the country who found it hard to pay the price of commodities necessary to keep up their standard of living.  He has departed from all that and instead of taking £4,500,000 from these people he proposes, under this Finance Bill, to give them more if they will insure themselves against illness.  It is going to be free for all income-tax and surtax payers, but the man with the wife and three children with £600 a year will get nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to ask the Labour Party &mdash;I am still addressing their empty benches, which have been empty all day&mdash;why it is that while agreeing to the postponement of the Health Act indefinitely they are jumping in to help this particular group which was condemned by them very loudly and at some length.  There would be something to be said for this section if it <Col N="693" /> was applied all round and if help was being given in it to those people who would have been helped under the Health Act of 1952, which was ignored by the Coalition Government which refused to implement that Act.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste, when he was in Government before, increased the National Health stamp by 6d. and after being three years in office he left it so that if a sick man had ten children he would still only get 22/6 per week.  It remained at that level until Fianna Fáil introduced and passed the Social Welfare Act and increased the benefits up to 50/- for a person similarly circumstanced. They were all for no means test when Fianna Fáil were in office but now they are all for no means test for the income-tax payer but if a man falls below that class he will have to undergo the means test.</P>
    <P>Deputy Costello, this morning, spoke at some length about our balance of payments situation.  He set himself up as an expert statistician who was able to enter the lists with the official people who have been trained in statistics and whose duty and job it is to provide the Government and the nation with vital statistics.  He alleged that, in fact, during the whole period of the last Coalition Government there had been a decrease of merely £1.9 millions in our external assets.  He quite satisfied himself that such was the case by a reading of the external balances of the commercial banks.</P>
    <P>The ordinary man in the street knows that if a man wants to judge his own situation as to whether his external balance of payments is right or not he has not only to count the money in his trousers pocket but also the money in his waistcoat pocket and the bills in his inside pocket.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>And his stock, his stock and trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.  The Department of Statistics, after going into the situation between 1947 and the end of 1951, reported that, after checking up the decrease in the sterling assets and taking into account the same situation in regard to Government Bonds and having given heed to the increased <Col N="694" /> liability of £46,000,000 owed to America and other capital items, there was a decrease in our external assets between the end of 1947 and the end of 1951 of £159.9 millions&mdash;£160,000,000 in round figures.  I need not go any further into that but I just want to give him those figures so that he can chew on them and also to let him know that he must look further than the external balances of our banks between one year and another if he wants to know how our balance of payments stands.  He must take into account transactions such as loans and advances to Irish citizens, dealing in external stocks other than by banks, capital payments made externally and so on.  All these have relation to our external balance of payments and the sooner Deputy Declan Costello realises that the better.</P>
      <P>I intervened in this debate, Ceann Comhairle, to ask the question of the Labour Party as to why they stand for no means test for our income-tax payers, whether they have £7 or £70 per week, and also why they insist that a man with a wife and three children who has £600 a year or less should have to pay full medical expenses for himself and his family and pay their hospital expenses if they fall ill.  Is it that the Tánaiste has changed his mind so greatly over the years and has the Labour Party changed with him? Every day you see him appearing in the papers as being entertained by a number of people whom once he thought should be the guests of the Government behind the highest-walled jails they had.  He now thinks that instead of putting them behind the thickest-walled jails, the thing to do is to give them a subsidy to insure themselves and their families against illness while he is leaving the middle-income groups without any such subsidy and leaving them to pay the full expenses for themselves and their families when they are subject to illness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy MacEntee opened the debate on this Bill by making a quiet criticism of certain aspects of it.  I did not agree with all he said.  I think the Deputy would have been surprised if I did agree with him just as I would have been surprised <Col N="695" /> if he had agreed with me, but I must say, having regard to the tone of the debate that he set, I was rather surprised at what transpired subsequently.</P>
      <P>Before I go on to the speech of Deputy Lemass I want to make one reference to that of Deputy MacEntee. I notice that he paid me the compliment of apparently reading the speech that I made recently in Cork.  In that speech, as I did when replying to the Budget debate in the Dáil, I made it quite clear that the only interpretation that I could put on the speech made by Deputy MacEntee on the Budget General Resolution was that if he had been in my position he would not have provided this year the £900,000 that I provided for the increases in the three types of pension covered by the Bill that is now circulated.  I repeated that in Cork and Deputy MacEntee referred to my Cork speech to-day and did not in any way suggest that my interpretation of his previous remarks was in any way incorrect, and therefore I may take it, I correctly interpreted him on the previous occasion and that we now know the difference between the policy of this Government and that of Fianna Fáil in that respect. They would not have done what we have done.</P>
      <P>But, after listening to Deputy MacEntee, I sat here dumb with amazement at the speech which was produced by Deputy Lemass.  With our knowledge of Deputy Lemass we are accustomed to having him make speeches in annoyance, or in simulated annoyance, but it was clear this morning that there was something more than that in the manner in which he addressed this Bill.  I suggest that what was really wrong with Deputy Lemass is that he has been around the country and that he has found throughout the country that his line and the line of Fianna Fáil are not finding any favour with the people.  Deputy Lemass does not seem to realise why he and his Party were put out of office last year and it might be desirable to stress again why they were.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have often said before and I <Col N="696" /> repeat that I do not think it would have mattered in the very slightest degree what was said by this Party or by any other Party on this side of the House, and that the reason the people desired a change of Government last year was that they had found out Fianna Fáil.  The record of Fianna Fáil, and only the record of Fianna Fáil was responsible for their own downfall.  What was wrong with the Party was that the people discovered that the Fianna Fáil Party through Deputy Lemass when he spoke in Cork on the 12th May, 1951, had given certain specific promises about what his Party would do if they returned to office.  Deputy MacEntee, too, I think repeated those promises when he was speaking at Rathmines Town Hall on the 14th May, 1951, and the reason that there was a change of Government last year was because the people were disgusted with the manner in which Fianna Fáil immediately they had got into power turned their backs on the promises they had made in the general election campaign of 1951.</P>
    <P>I must confess that I was quite dumbfounded at the brazenness of Deputy Lemass in roaring and ranting &mdash;because those are the only two words which are accurate to describe the speech we heard from Deputy Lemass this morning&mdash;in the way he roared and ranted about political honesty.  The Deputy's own words are recorded and the manner in which he turned back on them immediately he had got into power, and these were far more specific than anything that was ever said by any Deputy on this side of the House, much less by myself, as he alleged during the course of his speech.  I do not like going back on debates in this House in preferring charges across the House about honesty and so forth but the people should remember, and in fact do remember, when Deputy Lemass makes that type of speech about honesty that it was not the Parties who are now on this side of the House who were concerned with certain matters that had to be raised in the public life of the country in the last ten years.</P>
    <P>We were not the people who were responsible for Eindiguer and Maximoe <Col N="697" /> and company; we were not the people responsible for the bacon performance that went on in the days of Fianna Fáil before; we were not the people in office at the time that the Great Southern Railways ramp went on through the country some years ago. I do not like referring to these matters, and I am not going to refer to them in any detail, but it is a bit thick for Deputy Lemass of all people to come in here and get up and talk about honesty when he was the person who was in charge of the Department that was concerned in two of those matters that had to be submitted to inquiry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not be relevant but for the speech made by Deputy Lemass this morning.  Deputy Lemass would have been wiser for his own sake and for the sake of his Party if he had kept to a discussion on what is in the Bill or if he questioned what is not in the Bill.  That would be perfectly fair and he is perfectly entitled to make suggestions and to debate what is not included in the Bill on the Second Reading, but to take the line that he took this morning&mdash;perhaps it was for the purpose of having a nice scare headline in the <i>Evening Press</i>&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Aiken always adopts the same line that anybody from Fianna Fáil can say exactly what he likes, but immediately anybody from this side of the House tries to retaliate it is a case of: &ldquo;Don't hit me with the baby in my arms.&rdquo;  We know that type of thing&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Aiken failed when he came along to follow Deputy Lemass.  He did try to make an effort and it was rather a poor effort to try to follow in the footsteps of Deputy Lemass.  That is all that is worrying him, that he was not very efficient at it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lemass then went on to list various things about which he felt there should have been some provision in this Bill.  He made a reference to industrial taxation and to the manner in which it was desirable to assist industry, but he forgets, of course, that he had many opportunities in Government if he desired to bring in a system of taxation by which there would be a different rate of taxation for profits drawn out of industry and profits left in industry.  He had that opportunity over the years and it always amazes me about the Deputy that the only time he ever gets any of these ideas is when he has been translated by the people from these benches across to the other side of the House.</P>
      <P>One of the criticisms that could fairly be made&mdash;if I may be allowed in passing to make it on this Bill, although it is not strictly relevant to Finance&mdash;about Deputy Lemass's handling of Industry and Commerce is that he was never concerned with productivity as apart from production. One of the difficulties that has arisen because of the build up in the Department of Industry and Commerce over these years has arisen precisely because there never was any consideration of productivity and the desirability of ensuring that we would have our industries producing at figures and at costs comparable with the costs at which they should be produced.  The whole emphasis always has been, not on productivity, but on production, regardless of productivity, and we are certainly not in that way going to achieve the maximum increase in national income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had some discussion also from Deputy Lemass about export possibilities. It was the Deputy's agreement of 1938 which hamstrung us in the matter of exporting into the <Col N="699" /> British market and it was not until 1948, until the 1938 Agreement was amended by the inter-Party Government in 1948, that we were able to export industrially into Britain.</P>

      <P>Nonsense!</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>There were many factories in Deputy Aiken's constituency which were not in that position. The boot factories in the constituency which he represents were not in the position&mdash;thanks to the agreement made by Deputy Lemass in 1938 &mdash;of being able to export to Britain, until we came along in 1948 and had that agreement amended.  That is another example of the way in which Deputy Lemass on that side of the House is a very different Deputy from what he was when he was a Minister on this side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister had better read the export statistics of 1947.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister knows exactly the position which existed when this Government came in in 1948 in respect of that industry and the Minister quoted them to people concerned in the industry when the Minister was up in Louth ensuring that Deputy Aiken's Party would suffer a defeat about 15 months ago and when all the people concerned in the industry up there agreed, not with Deputy Aiken but with the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lemass also referred to P.A.Y.E. and he suggested that there was complete unanimity amongst the trade unions here that a system of P.A.Y.E. was desirable and should be introduced.  I think that if the Deputy investigates the position further, he will see that that is not so and that in fact there is a division&mdash;they are very nearly equal&mdash;between the representatives of the unions, one suggesting that it is desirable and the other suggesting that it is not desirable. Before we should even examine the possibility of a system that would suit our particular purposes in this respect, we should have a clear and almost unanimous view from the unions concerned. <Col N="700" /> I do not think it would be desirable that we should merely take holus-bolus from the other side a system which may suit their industrialised country but which would hardly be appropriate to ours.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also referred to the administrative cost on the Exchequer of such a system estimated here and as given by me in reply to a question the other day.  I think the Deputy is entirely wrong when he suggests that the Exchequer costs of the implementation of such a system is less than the cost to business as a whole.  I think that far the greater cost of working out any system of P.A.Y.E. arises from the cost which impinges on employment and therefore on business and ultimately on prices in the introduction of such a system.  As I indicated in reply to a question some months ago by Deputy Casey, there is another method of dealing with that problem.  Certain large employers have indicated that they are prepared voluntarily, with their employees and with the revenue, to enter into arrangements whereby tax can be deducted in a somewhat similar way to the statutory method in force on the other side of the water. I made it clear then, and I want to make it clear now again that, if employers and employees wish to work out a scheme like that, we will give them any assistance that lies in our power.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass also tried a hare by suggesting that we were about to control private investment.  He made the innuendo that, when we talked of reviewing capital expenditure, there was inherent in that review a suggestion that we would control private investment in some way.  That is entirely without any foundation and I really do not think that any Deputy who thought for a moment would make such a reckless statement, a statement which, if believed, might do untold harm to the economy.  The review we have undertaken is a review of State capital expenditure and it is a review which, at the same time, we hope, is going to ensure that we will be able to make more capital available for private enterprise, which, of course, I need hardly say, is an entirely different <Col N="701" /> thing from the control Deputy Lemass suggested.</P>
    <P>We want to ensure in respect of our capital investment that we are getting the best results from it.  A great deal of the capital programme grew up piecemeal and I do not think anybody could suggest that it is unwise now, having regard to that piecemeal growth, to take a general review of the whole State capital programme so as to ensure that our capital resources are being utilised to the best possible advantage, and that the best are given proper priority.  It was perhaps inevitable that the capital programme should have grown up in the dismal way it did, but it certainly appears to me and I think it was accepted by Deputy MacEntee&mdash;to be perfectly fair to him&mdash;in his speech on the Vote on Account as being entirely right and proper that we should now make a review of the type that is going on at the present moment.</P>
    <P>So far as the other speeches on this Bill are concerned, Deputy Aiken confined himself entirely to opposition to Section 4.  Section 4 of this Bill provides for an entirely new relief.  It is the first time any relief has been brought into the income-tax code to ensure that people would be encouraged to go into insurance against the loss that sickness brings.  Deputy Aiken suggested that that was in contradiction of all the Labour Party had stood for.  It is not for me to speak for them except to say that, as I understand the statements made by the Labour Party and the trade union principals over a number of years, they have always stood firmly for the principle of insurance&mdash;they have always considered that insurance was the correct principle that gave people things as of right.</P>
    <P>This provision is an insurance provision. I do not think any of us could rationally object to it.  Surely it is much better that people would be encouraged in that way, when they are able to do so, to make provisions for the unforseen cost that may come upon them at any time because of sickness? None of us can tell when the very heavy expense that sometimes attends the sickness of oneself or one's family will come and it would be a <Col N="702" /> wise and a prudent person who would make provision against that day.  This Section 4, to which Deputy Aiken is apparently so violently opposed, merely acts as an encouragement for that insurance and merely acts as a gesture and a signpost that this Government believe that the principle of insurance in those things, as in others, is a wise principle and one that should be encouraged.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass told us this morning that when this Bill would come to the Committee Stage he proposed to repeat again all the amendments that he put down last year.  That is his privilege as a Deputy.  That is his privilege on the Committee Stage of a Bill to introduce amendments, within the Rules of Order, if he so desires. I think the Deputy will find, however, that the public will not relish that type of play-acting&mdash;because that is all it is.  The people outside know quite well&mdash;as I said at the beginning, before the Leader of the Opposition came into the House&mdash;that what translated Fianna Fáil from this side of the House to that side of the House was the fact that they made specific promises in 1951 and made specific criticisms of us in 1951 and that they had only got into these benches and barely warmed them when they went back on all the promises they made.</P>

      <P>The Leader of the Opposition should remember that every time he allows Deputy Lemass to make a speech of the sort he made here this morning the only thing it does is to re-create attention to the record of Fianna Fáil for the three years in which they were in office&mdash;the record which stands there clear and without question.</P>
      <P>We had a long speech this morning from Deputy Lemass, for example, about the necessity for finding new work for people.  What was the record of Deputy Lemass when he, as Minister for Industry and Commerce from 1951 to 1954, was responsible for employment? It was a record which showed that in the period from mid-June, 1951, to mid-June, 1954, 19,000 more people were registered as unemployed.  There were 19,000 more people on the live register on the day Deputy Lemass and Deputy de Valera left office in 1954 than there were on the day they took office in 1951.  Now they come in here and have the hardihood, the brazenness&mdash;perhaps I might even use the word the Leader of the Opposition used about me, the check&mdash;to talk about a policy for employment when, in fact, their record over those three years was to put an additional 19,000 persons on the live register.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not merely that, but Deputy Lemass &mdash;who was the Minister for Industry <Col N="704" /> and Commerce and responsible for prices&mdash;was the person who, during the election of 1951, suggested that there was no reason at all why&mdash;Korean war notwithstanding&mdash;prices should increase. Nevertheless, they were raised again under Deputy Lemass in the same three years from 1951 to 1954.  It was the fact that the people who are now on the Opposition Benches indulged in such dishonest criticism in 1951 and then came over to this side of the House and turned round and broke the pledges they had given to the people that was responsible for putting them out of office in 1954 and nothing that was done by any other Party.  It was because they were found out and had been found out.</P>
    <P>What was really worrying Deputy Lemass this morning was that after a few visits to the country in recent weeks he has found the country peaceful, happy and contented with this Government, certain that this Government is going to remain in office for its full length of term and certain that, when the record of this Government comes to be shown at the end of our five years in office, it will be a record very much more pleasant, a record very much more pleasing to the people, for our five years, than that for the three years during which Fianna Fáil were in office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Speaking here before Question Time, I mentioned the undue length of time that has been taken in completing acquisition proceedings in numerous cases.  I also mentioned that the expedition of acquisition proceedings was not of so much importance unless allocation was carried on in a much more expeditious manner than it has been done for a number of years.  I mentioned a number of cases where estates had been taken for five or seven years.  In some instances <Col N="705" /> schemes were prepared and houses built.  In one instance holdings were pointed out away back in 1948 to three migrants; since then the houses were built but not until last November was one of the three houses occupied; two houses still remain to be occupied and a considerable amount of the same estate yet remains to be dealt with.  I mentioned another estate which was taken over in 1949 and which was let in conacre&mdash;by way of tillage, hay and grazing&mdash;for the past five or six years and there does not seem to be any sign of the Land Commission proceeding to deal with that estate either.</P>
      <P>I mentioned some cases in my own area.  It is not an area now where the question of land acquisition and division is so acute, because of all that was done in previous years.  Nevertheless, when you find cases such as I have mentioned, it is difficult to understand why the Land Commission are so slow.  I put a question to the Minister some weeks ago about one estate and he told me the delay was due to the more important work the Land Commission had to do.  He did not mention even an approximate date when they might undertake the preparation of a scheme for the division of that estate.  That is all very disappointing and very unsatisfactory.  If it is lack of staff that is causing that delay and if the Minister comes here for permission to recruit the staff necessary, I am sure that those on this side of the House will gladly give it to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other instances I cannot understand.  For example, there is one case where the Land Commission notified the owner of intention to acquire or resume the holding.  At the time the notice was served, the holding was untenanted.  Since then the owner has taken up occupation there.  The area of land would be in the neighbourhood of 350 acres.  According to a reply I got here from the Minister almost 12 months ago, the Land Commission now require only 21 acres.  I cannot understand a decision of that kind.  If they require only 21 acres out of 350, it must be for a few special people.  I believe there would be a number of people within a mile limit <Col N="706" /> of that estate who would required enlargements to their holdings.  This matter will also create considerable dissatisfaction in the neighbourhood, if the Land Commission proceed to take 21 acres out of a holding of 350 acres.  An action of that kind does not make sense to me.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission would be well advised to shorten the period of acquisition. I know that the individual owners have their rights, that they have the court to go to in regard to various aspects of the case.  They can object to acquisition or they can object on price.  I cannot understand, however, why it should take three, five, seven or even ten years to come to a final decision.  No one can understand that and it would be very difficult to explain it away.  It is unfair to those who are living in the hope that they will get land there.  It is unfair also to the owner himself because, while that threat is over his head, that nearly all his land or a considerable portion of it may be taken, he will not have the interest he otherwise would have in cultivating and improving that land.</P>
    <P>Land division has been going on for about 52 years.  We should have come to the time now when the Land Commission would be in a position to make a statement giving the approximate area still available for acquisition.  It should be possible for them also&mdash;and I am sure they would have the figures available&mdash;to tell us the number of congests. For instance, they could take those under £15 level or under £10 level.  If we could have that statement from the Minister, we would know what the available land could do to relieve the number of congests that there are.  If we have only 500,000 acres&mdash; and I expect that would be as much as we would have at the moment&mdash;and if you give a 33 acres holding to a migrant, you would give new holdings to about 10,000, I except.  If you were to give an average of 10 acres extension to existing holdings of others, I suppose you would relieve 17,000.  That would be 27,000 in all.  I believe that the number of landholders under £15 valuation is much greater than 27,000. Consequently, land division alone will not solve the congestion problem.  It will undoubtedly relieve congestion, <Col N="707" /> but it certainly is not and cannot be a final solution for it.</P>
    <P>I put a question to the Minister, I think it was on the 27th April, regarding the Shannon valley flooded areas.  I asked him when he intended to implement the scheme that he gave us to understand the Land Commission were preparing or had prepared and if he would state whether those who have got farms in previous years but who because of the inadequacy of the grants given for the erection of houses, were unable to proceed.  He told me in Banagher the evening that the conference was there that that difficulty was being overcome.  I put the question to know if that difficulty had been overcome as in the case of future allottees, if it would be retrospective to those who were given similar holdings but who could not erect their houses, say, from 1946 or 1947 onwards.  He told me that the scheme would be implemented but that it would have to await the report of the American expert who was coming over to give advice on the Shannon flooding.</P>
    <P>Deputy McQuillan put a supplementary question in this connection asking if that report would be available inside 12 months.  The Minister replied that he could not say and then Deputy McQuillan put another supplementary question asking if that meant that the implementation of the scheme would be held up until that report was furnished. The Minister replied that it did not necessarily mean that but that it was only prudence to await the report.</P>
    <P>I considered that reply very vague. I did not like to challenge the Minister on that occasion and I avail of this opportunity to refer to the matter.  If nothing is to be done for those people for 12 months, or maybe it will be five years, then there was very little use in making promises to them both on the evening of the conference in Banagher and previous to it during that period of time.</P>
    <P>A number of the people in the flooded areas of the Shannon in my constituency were relieved away back in 1946 and 1947 and even previous to that. They were taken out to an estate at a place called Moystown, in County <Col N="708" /> Offaly.  Houses were erected there I presume by way of giving people a grant or an advance but there were some others who were given holdings or extensions a distance away from their existing holdings at a later stage and the cost of building having increased very considerably, some of them were not able to erect their houses.  We had a few cases where the Land Commission had already notified them of their intention to take back the land from them.  That would be a very serious situation as far as they were concerned because some of their families are large and the health circumstances of some of them were anything but good.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will take this question up with the Department and see that in respect of those who were unable to erect houses with the grants that were allocated previously, the grants would be considerably increased or that otherwise the Land Commission would have the houses built as they have done for migrants by direct labour or on the contract system.  If not, all the promises are so much hot air.</P>
    <P>In regard to the improvement of estates, a great deal of very desirable work was carried out but in many instances the inspectors who laid out the work did not take certain things into consideration.  They did not take into consideration the fact that the erection of fences and the making of roads obstructed the natural flow of water to the out-fall and that is what happened in a great many instances.  It is not the responsibility of the present Minister or even his predecessors.  This happened many years ago and it has been happening all the years along.</P>
    <P>As I say fences were erected and roads were laid with the result that that natural out-fall has been obstructed and a great deal of that land is now water-sodden.  It is impossible to drain that land unless some steps are taken to enable whatever authority would be dealing with drainage, whether it be under the Land Commission scheme or otherwise, to undertake the work.  If the people concerned were to carry out the work they would be regarded as trespassers and I presume they would not be permitted <Col N="709" /> to make any drains along the natural out-fall to take away that water.</P>
    <P>We have had a number of statements here, one from a Deputy in the Midlands, who strongly resented the migration of congests from the West to the Midlands.  He held that a considerable number of larger-sized holdings should be left or that otherwise our live-stock industry would fall off and we would not be in a position to produce the proper type of live stock for the foreign market.  What is the extent of the largest type of holding that should be left?  Is it desirable to leave an almost unlimited number of acres, up to 1,000 and 2,000 acres, to people who will use it almost entirely for grazing?  That, in my opinion, is a very wrong policy.  The migrants who have come from the West to the Midlands, have, in the main, used their land very well.  They have made a success of it and I would like to see that policy of migration continued, taking cognisance, of course, of the local congests, and seeing that they get fair treatment in the first instance, which would make for better relations between the migrants and the local people.</P>
    <P>Some years ago, I think it was in 1946, a Bill was introduced in this House which was very sharply criticised by the then Opposition, and that was a Land Bill which enabled the Land Commission to take possession of holdings which were not being properly used.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether that Act has been invoked in many instances.  I believe it has been invoked in a few, in order to dispossess those people. In my part of the country it has been invoked in one particular case and I regard it as most unfair.  If it had been worked out generally and applied to all without discrimination nobody could find fault with it, but in this particular case the person whom I have in mind should have been dealt with in a more gentle manner and he should not have been the first to be aimed at.</P>
    <P>This was a case where the man's uncle was employed by the landlord. He got the holding of land in lieu of his livelihood.  Now the nephew, who <Col N="710" /> would, I am sure, have continued in that employment after his uncle's death, got the holding from his uncle but because it was not a vested holding the uncle did not have the right to bequeath it to him.  However, he has been in possession and has been served with a number of notices for possession. The last notice he got was a writ to appear, if he so desired, in the Circuit Court in Galway some weeks ago. I cannot understand why that man should not have been given the right to sell that holding, provided that out of the money he got for it from the sale of the holding he would pay back to the Land Commission the amount of money advanced for carrying out improvements.</P>

    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Why?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be a different matter if the actual herd who got the displaced employee's holding passed it on to his son but the nephew had other parents to look to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>In this case the holding did pass by bequest to the nephew but maybe it was not so great an asset to the nephew because it is easy to get a holding with a legacy of debt on top of it and that is what appears to have happened here.  But if this land had not been acquired by the Land Commission the nephew would have carried out the same work as he did for his uncle in the uncle's declining years and would have continued in employment for the owner of the land.  But why single him out when I can give other instances and specific cases of where the Land Commission did give to employees the right to sell holdings even though they were not vested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Was this nephew living there and working it after the uncle's death?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and he is still there.  Of course I cannot claim that he was using the holding well but he was using it just as well as are some people who occupy vested holdings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>That is no guide.  A lot <Col N="711" /> of them are not working them as we would like.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>And nothing is being done about it.  I am comparing this case with those of others who were given the right to sell their holdings and these people, mind you, got them as landless men, and those landless men who got presents from the State are now deemed not to be on a par with the man who inherited from his uncle who got it as an employee.  I am sure my opposite number beside the Minister knows all about this case and that probably he has made representations about it.  I would like to suggest that if the Land Commission could see its way they would leave this man the holding in the hope that he will improve, or that they would give him permission to sell on condition that out of the money he gets for it the Land Commission would be recouped for any advance they had made in respect of improvements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter I wish to mention is the question of bogs.  Bogs were provided by the Land Commission, and certain improvements were carried out, but it takes a great deal of money properly to improve the bogs by the provision of proper roads and drainage. In my opinion these improvements should be carried out on all bogs.  Bogs were marked out and allocated for people who were given land 40 years ago.  These people are now vested on their holdings and are not the responsibility of the Land Commission any longer but the bogs are of no use to them and they have to go to other bogs and, in competition with their neighbours, pay high prices for their domestic supplies of fuel.  I think that when the Land Commission take over a bog and when they are allocating it they should hand it over in a good condition, if not the bog will become derelict.  I know also of a number of cases, and this applies even to migrants in County Galway, where people were given exchange holdings.  With their old holdings they had good bogs and were promised similar facilities with the new holdings, and even though they are from 15 to 16 <Col N="712" /> years in possession of these holdings the bog, which is no great distance from them, has not yet been divided or distributed.  These are all matters that the Land Commission should remedy.</P>
    <P>I want to refer again to the acquisition of land.  One of the things that I marvelled at mostly in this respect was a section which the Minister in 1950 incorporated in the Land Bill which went through this House.  That was the section whereby he provided that market value must in future be paid to the owner of the land.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>What was wrong about that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>We put the question to him at that time of what he meant by market value, and if market value meant market price, and I have a very distinct recollection of his reply.  He said that market value and market price were in no way related to each other.  I never could understand that reasoning or see what logic there was in it.  If the Land Commission were permitted to carry on as they had been doing, then the people whose lands they took over would not have the same foundation for litigation or for going into the courts.  I have noted cases where the prices offered by the Land Commission in the first instance were more than doubled by the price-fixing tribunal.  I have known such cases to happen within the last five years and the result of it all is that when the price is fixed the Land Commission have said that it would be most uneconomic for them to take over the land and they would withdraw from the proceedings.  The Land Commission cannot again reopen proceedings for seven years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.  But that provision was not contained in the 1950 Act; that was in the 1927 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>But the 1950 Act had the very definite provision that the market value must be paid to the owner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The power which the Land Commission has to withdraw if they think the price is too high goes <Col N="713" /> back to a time before either of us was here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>And no Minister for Lands sought to repeal or amend it.  I believe some of the prices fixed by the price-fixing tribunal would not be obtained even at a public auction unless it was sold out in small lots. In my opinion, there is hardly any individual in the country who would pay £11,000 or £12,000 for a holding of land which I believe could be got to-day for £8,000.</P>
      <P>That, I suggest, is going to have a very adverse effect as far as the acquisition and the division of land is concerned. There are many ways of killing the cat and of retarding the activities of the Land Commission as far as the acquisition and division of land is concerned. One is by putting a wholly inflated value on the land, and then of having the Land Commission withdraw proceedings and of leaving it there for the next seven years.  That sort of procedure is not going to expedite land division.  I think it would be much better if the position had been left the way it was, because I believe that the Land Commission, as it then existed, was a fair body and would not try to wrong anybody.  But on the day that the term &ldquo;market value&rdquo; was enshrined in the land legislation of this country it provided a happy hunting ground for the legal profession and those concerned to advise owners to go to the furthest limits in order to obtain the highest possible price.</P>
      <P>I know of a case where the Land Commission were taking over a derelict holding in my area.  For some reason a price was fixed, and the Land Commission said they could not take it.  They would be depriving no member of a family of anything by taking it over because, as I have said, it was a derelict holding.  The next of kin were in different occupations far away, but if that holding had been taken over four or five new holdings could have been created for migrants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is only a fortnight since a very large holding was offered for sale in the County Galway.  I do not know whether it has been disposed of or not. I put it up to the Land Commission <Col N="714" /> and got a reply to say that they had decided not to intervene.  That particular holding of 130 acres or 140 acres of very fine land would have provided four or five good holdings for migrants, but the Land Commission, perhaps for very sound reasons, decided not to intervene.  In view of these facts what is the use in talking about the relief of congestion, the problem of migration or anything of that kind?</P>
    <P>I am not holding the Minister or his predecessor responsible, but when the Land Commission have got the responsibility and the authority they are the people who have the right to determine the land to be acquired and of how it is to be allotted.  The Minister can do very little unless by bringing a Bill into this House and of having the Land Acts amended.  This business of land acquisition and division has gone on for a very long time.  I think we have now come to the time when we should be in a position to fix a date on which it will come to an end.  I think the time has come when any Minister or any Government should be in a position to say that, after so many years, the S. and P. sections and the A. and R. sections can be closed, and when the officials engaged in them can be put on work in some other Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot understand why any Deputy should put before the House all the cases in his constituency. I wish to say, however, that I have the greatest regard and respect for the Deputy who has just sat down, but I do suggest that it is really boring for members of the House to have to listen to a contribution such as he made.  The fact that dictatorships have been set up in various countries throughout the world must be because so many democrats spent so much time talking about nothing, and because nothing was done afterwards.</P>

What is the sense in Deputies having to listen to particulars of cases in Galway, South, West, East and North&mdash;or anywhere else, when it is a question really of policy for the Minister for Lands.

      <P>I have no grievance against the Land Commission.  I know their difficulties.  Whether it be Deputy Blowick or Deputy Derrig or anyone else is in charge, I know that there are difficulties in the way.  We must remember that there have been objections from Deputies representing constituencies in the Midlands and in the eastern counties who do not wish to see congests coming up from South Kerry or the western seaboard.  They say that when land is being divided in their areas the sons of farmers there, the unemployed and workers should get a portion of it.</P>
      <P>I would like to remind the people who own the land in the Midlands and in the eastern counties that it once belonged to the ancestors of those who now live along the western seaboard and in South Kerry.  They were the people who owned it and they were driven back by the foreigners.  Therefore, their descendants have the right to go back and get a portion of that good land.  The ancestors of those who live along the western seaboard were driven back by the foreigners to the hillsides, the woods and the mountains, and therefore it is only right that their descendants should now be brought back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a grievance as far as South Kerry is concerned.  There were many holders there who were brought up in the Midlands.  On the holdings they left there were houses, many of them good houses; some were Gaeltacht houses <Col N="716" /> and others were built under Local Government Acts.  These houses have been left there, more or less derelict, during the past four, five, six, seven or eight years.  My desire is that the Minister should now see that these lands are divided, and that the houses should not be left to fall into decay.</P>
    <P>The fault that I find with the Land Commission is that they make the divisions too small.  We must do something to improve the Gaeltacht and the areas along the western seaboard, to make holdings economic.  There is no use in giving six acres here, five acres there, and four acres in another place, to people within a mile, two miles or three miles of the holding to be divided.  I would prefer to see the land divided in such a way that it would make economic holdings for one or two tenants in the immediate vicinity.</P>
    <P>Politicians come along, and want one man to get six acres, another to get five acres, and so on.  In the end, the land is cut up in a useless and most expensive way because, when a holding is divided, it must cost a great deal to fence it.  The thing to do is to allot a decent portion of land to remaining tenants where somebody has got an exchange of holding, and has been brought up to the Midlands.  If we are to maintain the Gaeltacht, it must be done, some way, through land division. That is the foundation of the whole scheme, to make the Gaeltacht economic. Even though it may denude the population to some extent, in years to come the whole matter will be settled satisfactorily.  When you have bad land, such as we have in the Gaeltacht, the only thing to do is to give plenty of it to someone who will make a living out of it.</P>
    <P>All this patching in land division, is I think, entirely wrong.  It is expensive. We do not wish so much that the large farms in the Midlands and eastern Ireland should be divided into small farms, because those people buy our live stock.  If they did not acquire our live stock, our economics would be entirely overthrown and upset.  That is a problem to which some thought should be devoted.  Dividing up the lands in the Midlands, in Minister or East Leinster, and bringing up congests from the western seaboard, to <Col N="717" /> give them 25 or 30 acres will never settle the land problem in this country. It is a very serious matter.  The Minister must know what we require in the West, he must know what will suit our type of economy, and he must also think of the people whose holdings will be taken over in the Midlands and eastern counties.  The problem is rather serious, and there is no use trying to make political capital out of it by saying to a congest: &ldquo;I will get you an exchange up to the Midlands.&rdquo; That has been going on too long.  That is what you say, every one of you. That attitude must be changed and the land problem tackled in an entirely different way.  I want to speak the truth.  I know what is going on.  I am absolutely independent, but I would like to see this question settled in a proper way.  The time has come when we must make economic holdings available for people along the western seaboard and give them to good working farmers.</P>
    <P>I want to say deliberately that some of the owners of the best land in Ireland never bother about it at all.  That is all to the good for us along the western seaboard, because they rent their land to our people and buy our cattle at high prices.  That is the position. I know it very well.  It suits us very well in Kerry.  I hope the lands which the Land Commission acquired in South Kerry will, as soon as possible, be reallotted, and houses, built at the expense of the State, given to people who deserve them, to good working men or women in the neighbourhood, regardless of politics.  I hope further that the Land Commission will continue the policy of bringing as many people as possible from the western seaboard&mdash;I do not care whether they come from South Kerry, West Kerry, Galway or other western areas.  I hope they will give them decent farms in districts from which their ancestors were driven hundreds of years ago, so that they and their families may live in happiness, and so that the people they leave behind along the western seaboard will have sufficient land, whether it be good or bad, to enable them to make a living.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to detain <Col N="718" /> the House very long because I feel, when speaking on this Estimate, that the Minister understands the western problem.  There is definitely acute congestion in the West.  To my mind, it is more acute there than in any other area.  I sympathise with the Minister, because I realise that the relief of congestion in the West is a very difficult problem.  We have not sufficient land there even to provide relief half-way, and I do not know how the Minister is going to solve the problem <i>in toto.</i> I think he and the Land Commission would move in the proper direction if they reserve a certain acreage of land in the Midlands and other eastern counties, where there are large demesnes, for migrants from Sligo-Leitrim. Heretofore, I think, no land was reserved for migrants from Sligo or even Leitrim.  I think that the Minister should take note of that, and should try to reserve some areas in the Midlands and eastern counties where land is available.  He should take cognisance of the congestion which exists in Sligo-Leitrim.  According to a report recently there are more migrants from Galway and Mayo than there are from the entire constituency of Sligo-Leitrim.</P>
      <P>To help the Minister out in his problem some Deputy mentioned cut-away bogs.  In the most westerly end of my county there are about 300 acres of cut-away bog.  I approached the Department of Lands and the Department of Agriculture about that bog some four or five years ago.  I was told nothing could be done because they could not establish title.  If title could be established and the land acquired and sub-soiled it would relieve congestion to a considerable extent in about one quarter of my constituency. I appeal to the Minister to take special note of that.  I have visited that area on a number of occasions and I know very progressive farmers there, admittedly with a small acreage, who have built up very excellent holdings on sub-soiled cut-away bog.  If this bog to which I have referred could be treated in that way it would go a long way towards relieving congestion and the farmers working on it would do their share and play their part in the economy of the country as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="719" /> A number of Deputies on the Opposition Benches have more or less issued a challenge that lands are being offered to the Land Commission and that the Land Commission are doing nothing about them.  I have no knowledge of any land being offered in my constituency to the Land Commission and nothing being done about it.  I have done my utmost to help the Land Commission to acquire every available acre.  If I were the Minister I would accept that challenge and inquire as to where land is being offered to the Land Commission and nothing being done about it.  I do not know of any such case.</P>
    <P>In one case the excuse made for not dividing a holding of land acquired by the Land Commission some four or five years ago was that the holding was not sufficiently big to satisfy the demand for land in the area.  Recently that holding was advertised for public auction and the bottom immediately falls out of the excuse given by the local inspector that the holding was not sufficiently big to satisfy the demand.  If this land goes for public auction the last state there will be worse than the first.  I hope the Minister will accept the Opposition's challenge. As far as Sligo-Leitrim is concerned I have no knowledge of any land being offered to the Land Commission and nothing being done about it.</P>

      <P>First of all, I would like to compliment Deputies on both sides, with the exception of one member of this House, on the way they have approached the debate on this Estimate for the Department of Lands. Generally speaking, the debate was helpful and constructive.  There was a bit of criticism, but that is all to the good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McQuillan in my opinion spoiled what might otherwise have been the best debate on the Irish Land Commission for many a long year here by treating the House to a speech which was nothing but a tissue of inaccuracies and errors.  There was wild and reckless abuse of officials of the <Col N="720" /> Land Commission, wild and reckless abuse of me, my predecessor and practically everybody else concerned. He sought to give the impression that he was the &ldquo;Simon Pure&rdquo; and the other 146 Deputies here were just so many thoughtless individuals who knew nothing and that, therefore, we should take advice from him.</P>
    <P>He sought to make comparisons against the Land Commission by quoting sets of figures which are not comparable at all and by concealing facts which would be obvious to anybody who would take the trouble to make even the most superficial study of the Book of Estimates.</P>
    <P>He concealed the fact that the Land Commission, unlike other Departments, is a composite collecting and spending Department&mdash;if you like, a kind of revenue plus social welfare mixture. Indeed, the Land Commission acts as a collecting agent under the land project for one of the other Departments with which Deputy McQuillan sought to compare it; but for his own narrow interests he concealed that fact too.  He mentioned the sum for salaries on the Vote for the Department of Lands; that sum covers the collecting as well as the spending functions of the Land Commission and it is entirely false and misleading to argue, as Deputy McQuillan did, as if the salaries related only to the spending functions. One might as well base an argument on the fallacy that the total on the cover of the Book of Estimates relates to a single province.</P>
    <P>To add insult to injury, the Deputy paid lip tribute to the staff and then proceeded to make what, I think, any reasonable person could only interpret as a nasty, veiled charge of idling and inefficiency against them.  In that he was aided and abetted subsequently by Deputy Kennedy.  I was not surprised at Deputy McQuillan, knowing him as I do; I was certainly surprised at Deputy Kennedy who has been a long time in this House and who was a Parliamentary Secretary for quite a considerable period&mdash;a period of three years.  One of the nasty features about this kind of charge is that it is made within the privilege of this House <Col N="721" /> against officials who cannot defend themselves.  Being a politician, I do not mind what bricks are thrown at my head; but it is a mean thing, to say the least of it, that Deputies should make charges against people who, by virtue of the laws we make here, cannot defend themselves either here or <Col N="722" /> in the public Press.  In my opinion, the Deputy's attitude is one of cowardice.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Tuesday, 7th June, 1955.</P>
