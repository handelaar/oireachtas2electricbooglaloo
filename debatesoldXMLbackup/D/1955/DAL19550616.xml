      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 9:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 7 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  The Finance Act, 1920, as amended by Section 8 of the Finance Act, 1952 (No. 14 of 1952), shall as and from the 1st day of July, 1955, be amended by the substitution in Part I of the First Schedule to the said Finance Act, 1920, of the matter set out in the Fourth Schedule to this Act for the matter inserted therein by the said Section 8, and sub-section (1) of Section 3 of the said Finance Act, 1920, shall have effect accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  The duty of excise imposed by sub-section (2) of Section 3 of the Finance Act, 1920, shall, as and from the 1st day of July, 1955, be charged, levied and paid at the rate of £6 17s. <Col N="1362" /> the gallon (computed at proof) in lieu of the rate chargeable by virtue of sub-section (2) of Section 8 of the Finance Act, 1952.</P>
    <P>(3)  Nothing in this section shall operate to relieve from or to prejudice or affect the additional customs duties or the additional excise duty in respect of immature spirits imposed by Section 9 of the Finance Act, 1926 (No. 35 of 1926).</P>
    <P>I move this amendment on behalf of Deputy Lemass and, first of all, I want to know whether the Minister for Finance is accepting these amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The case for it was made at great length throughout the country and over many years by no less a person than the Taoiseach, but the Minister for Finance will not say that he is now rejecting the advice which the Taoiseach once gave in relation to this tax.  They expect to laugh it off and they expect to silence all opposition to the tactics of the Coalition Government since they came into office.  During the election last year the Taoiseach dealt at length with <Col N="1363" /> this tax on whiskey as indeed he had dealt at length with it very often in previous years.  I want to put it on record and I will read the extract from the Taoiseach's speech at meetings he addressed in Wexford and Enniscorthy, as reported in the <i>Irish Times</i> of 15th May, 1954.  He said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I challenge the Taoiseach to deny that the meaning of the fresh figures he has disclosed and which are only available to a person in Government is that in each of the two years 1952-53 and 1953-54, the Government got an average of £50,000 per year less duty on the higher rate than we got from the whiskey when whiskey was 5½d. a glass less in 1951-52.  In 1953-54 they only recovered £500,000 of the £600,000 they lost in 1952-53.  What good did the extra tax do?  The Government got less revenue, the price went up savagely on the consumer, the consumption dropped over the two years by 80,000,000 half ones&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>By how many?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>By 80,000,000 half ones the Taoiseach, then Deputy Costello, said.  The quotation continues:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;...the price went up savagely on the consumer, the consumption dropped over the two years by 80,000,000 half ones, the income of the publicans and the distillers dropped and accordingly the income-tax they pay fell.  People in public houses and distilleries lost their jobs and it has been calculated that the farmers got from £150,000 to £200,000 less for their barley.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, in view of that statement by the Taoiseach, who made no promises he says now, is it not amazing that, when I ask a simple, direct question of the Minister for Finance as to whether he is going to accept the amendment put down by Deputy Lemass to do away with the increase in tax that was called savage and which was put on, as the Attorney-General said yesterday, for revenge, the Minister for Finance could not give me a direct &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo;?  Does the Minister for Finance <Col N="1364" /> calculate that the keeping on of this tax this year is going to result in a reduction of consumption by 80,000,000 half ones and is it for the purpose of effecting such a reduction in the number of half ones consumed that he proposes to reimpose this tax?  The Minister for Finance may not answer Deputies here in the House, but it is a question that a number of the people who were deceived into voting for the Coalition groups in the last general election are asking and to which they want an answer.</P>
    <P>The Coalition groups would like the people to believe now that they made no promises in regard to the reduction of the tax on whiskey and beer and all the other taxes that were in operation when they were in opposition. We quoted a number of statements they made but in case they may have forgotten them let us put them on record here in relation to the tax on whiskey.  The Tánaiste wrote to the publicans in his constituency on the 3rd May, 1954, when looking for their support and he addressed them in the following terms from his election headquarters in the Railway Hotel in Kildare:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A Chara, as you are an elector in the County Kildare constituency, I take the liberty of enclosing herewith a copy of my election address and would kindly invite your attention, in particular, to the portion of the programme set out on page three under the heading &lsquo;Reduction in Prices&rsquo;.  In view of the serious effect of increased taxation on cigarettes, beer and spirits which, no doubt, has had an injurious effect on your trade, I trust that you find it possible to give me your No. 1 vote in the forthcoming election, and kindly ask your relatives and friends to do likewise so that, with the aid of the Labour Party, I may advocate in the new Dáil a reduction of the taxes which so adversely affect your business and the consumers generally.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1943" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>You copy that in the next election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>We shall not copy that in the next election or in any other election because the difference between <Col N="1365" /> the Fianna Fáil Party and the Coalition is that members of our Party, myself included, may from time to time make a foolish statement&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1943" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>You surely do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;along with the many wise statements we make, but we have never deliberately, treacherously and in cold blood set out to deceive the electorate.  All this Coalition campaign was a calculated, cold-blooded bit of treachery on the public of this country, and the sneers and the gibes of the Coalition groups in the last few days prove it to the hilt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1943" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no murder in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The Leader of the Fine Gael Party&mdash;not the present Taoiseach but Deputy Mulcahy&mdash;said that the first thing they would do, &ldquo;the first task of the new Administration would be to lighten the burden of taxation now crushing our people&rdquo;.  Deputy MacEoin, as he then was, on the 29th March, 1954, said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Our policy is to relieve once again the penal taxes that have been imposed by Fianna Fáil in the 1952 Budget.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is one of the taxes which was imposed in the 1952 Budget and which the Taoiseach said reduced whiskey consumption by 80,000,000 half ones, which he said had reduced the income of the Exchequer and which Deputy Mulcahy, his Leader at the time, promised they would relieve.  It is ridiculuous for the Minister for Finance to say that he made no promises simply because on this particular issue of this leaflet issued in Kildare they did not say categorically that if they got in they would reduce these prices and these taxes at once, but if the Minister for Finance, Deputy Sweetman, as he then was, did not say it through his leaflet canvass he did say it from the platform.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>In County Wicklow.  I heard him speak of the couple of hundred thousand pounds he was going to get by a certain means and with which he was going to save the Irish nation from all it had suffered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>He made various calculations and he was careful not to commit himself to figures to the effect that he was going to reduce the price of beer from 1/3 down to 11d. and cigarettes from 2/4 to 1/8, but all his canvassers in County Kildare did.  They went around the country handing in these leaflets: &ldquo;See what Fianna Fáil did on you.  We are going to undo their bad work&rdquo;.  The Attorney-General yesterday gave another proof of this cold-blooded treachery, this calculated treachery, which they practised on the electorate.  It was represented to the electors at the last general election that the Attorney-General was to be the incoming Minister for Finance in case the Coalition got office and it was pointed out that, in 1948, when Deputy McGilligan took over as Minister for Finance, he reduced within a month of the end of the financial year the taxes on beer and cigarettes and it was said: &ldquo;As was done in 1948, so it will be done in 1954&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>No&mdash;&ldquo;So we can do again&rdquo;: a very different matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>So it would be done in 1954.  It was Deputy McGilligan who said that he had reduced taxation within a few days of taking office in 1948 and &ldquo;when we come in again, we will reduce it by £10,000,000 in ten minutes &mdash;£1,000,000 per minute.&rdquo; It was to be done within ten minutes, and, in order to make this bit of treachery more effective, Deputy McGilligan was sent to the radio, after this build-up of what he had done in 1948 in reducing taxation on beer and cigarettes and these other commodities within a few days of taking office in 1948.  He there deliberately said to the people, who believed that he was going to be the Minister for Finance, that any Minister for Finance taking over could reduce taxation by several millions and <Col N="1367" /> he indicated that it should be £20,000,000.</P>
      <P>The people naturally said: &ldquo;This is on the word of a man who did take off taxation when he became Minister for Finance before and who, we are given to understand, will be Minister for Finance again.&rdquo;  They took it that he was speaking not only his own mind but the mind of the Party that proposed to make him Minister for Finance once again.  It was only after eight or nine months that we learned from Deputy McGilligan's own words that he did not in fact show his radio address to his colleagues.  When Deputy Lemass was accusing him of having spoken on the radio the policy of the Coalition Government under Fine Gael, he denied it and said that they had not seen it.</P>
      <P>He himself then dealt with the matter, following Deputy Lemass, and at column 386, Volume 149 of the Dáil Debates of 10th March last, he said, referring to his radio address:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;They said here to-day that it was probably done in consultation with my colleagues.  I did not see any colleagues of mine before I had written it, because I was occupied in the morning in getting the broadcast right.  I experience great difficulty in writing these things.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I did not see any colleagues of mine before I had written it, because I was occupied in the morning in getting the broadcast right,&rdquo; but Deputy McGilligan, when he went to the radio station and indicated that taxation could be reduced by several million pounds&mdash;anything up to £20,000,000 was desirable&mdash;did not indicate that he had not shown his script to his colleagues, that he was speaking only for himself, and that he was not going to be Minister for Finance but that he was going to sidle out of that and give the baby over to somebody else.  It was a cold-blooded and deliberate bit of treachery on the electors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other day he came back again to what he said on 10th March, because yesterday we all heard him going back on the quotation I have just given when he interrupted Deputy <Col N="1368" /> Lemass to say he believed the Party had known what he was going to say. On 10th March, as I have quoted, he said he did not see any of his colleagues before he had written it.  The people have one lesson to learn from this, that is, that they have to parse every single word the Coalition groups say in any coming election.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach is very loud in saying he made no promises.  In fact, in the famous speech which he always quotes to indicate that he made no promises, he did make several promises.  I quote again from the <i>Irish Times</i> of 14th May, 1954, 13 months or so ago.  On that occasion, having dealt with protection and the ideal of full employment, he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is a cardinal feature of our policy that we shall honour every commitment to the farmer and provide him with a guaranteed price for wheat during not less than five years.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Was that a promise?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is dealing with taxation in general. This section and the amendment to it deals with taxation on a specific commodity. The Deputy should keep to that point and to that point alone. Taxation in general does not arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>It is alleged here that there was no promise made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That has been dealt with fairly extensively.  This is a proposal to put a tax on a specific commodity and a proposal to relieve taxation on that commodity.  The Deputy should address himself to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a proposal to relieve the tax which the Government promised they would relieve and their justification for not relieving it now, although they promised to do so, was that they made no promise.  I have pointed out that, in the speech which the Taoiseach made when he was seeking election, he in fact did make promises.  The promise most frequently made all over the country was to throw high taxation overboard.  That was placarded all around the country. All that the people had to do in order <Col N="1369" /> to throw high taxation overboard&mdash;to throw overboard the tax on whiskey, the 5½d. extra that the Taoiseach spoke about, the 6d. on cigarettes and so forth&mdash;was to vote for the Fine Gael candidates.  Now Fine Gael say they never made any promises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister for Finance deny that all around the country there was this poster which said: &ldquo;Vote Fine Gael for lower taxation and for better times&rdquo;?  Do Fine Gael deny that there was a big cartoon 20 feet by 15 feet on every hoarding in the country which showed the electors throwing higher taxation and higher prices overboard?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The people believed that the Coalition groups meant to throw these things overboard as they had thrown overboard the taxation on whiskey, beer and cigarettes in 1948 when they reduced it within a few days of their coming into office.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Deputy to confine himself to the question before the House.  The Deputy has had a fair innings on general taxation.  He should now confine himself to the question before the House, namely, the section and the amendment.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Finance could have shortened this debate very much and indeed we might have had no discussion at all on it if he had simply indicated his intention when I asked him at the beginning of this debate whether or not he was going to accept this amendment the effect of which would be to reduce the tax to the level they said they would reduce it: if he had said &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to that question, there might have been no debate on it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the Minister refused to answer &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to that question, we have to discuss the whole matter because it is a matter of some importance.  Votes were obtained on the promise of reducing these taxations and this tax specifically of which the Taoiseach spoke so much.  He used the phrase &ldquo;80,000,000 half ones&rdquo; not once or twice in debates in this House but on every platform throughout the country and many times in this House. It is of some importance to know that last evening the Taoiseach remained in the House for some time but did not take part in the debate.  This morning he was present at the beginning of the debate and then he walked out.  I should like the Taoiseach to come back before the debate on this section closes and to hear him talk about the 80,000,000 half ones and the reduction in income which it is causing.  I should like to hear the Taoiseach tell us why he is reimposing this tax on whiskey at this time&mdash;a tax which he described as &ldquo;a savage tax&rdquo;. Is he reimposing it for the purpose of deliberately cutting down consumption, as they said we imposed the taxation? Is he imposing it in vengeance on the consumer, as the Attorney-General said yesterday, and, if not, what is the reason for imposing it?</P>

      <P>Deputy Aiken claims that the difference between the Party which contains him as a member and all the Parties opposite him is that his Party never deliberately and in cold blood treacherously set out to deceive the people, while every other Deputy in the House representing any other Party than the Fianna Fáil Party was guilty of calculated treachery.  I suspect that the real reason this and other amendments have been moved is that Deputies opposite are unable to get the people to listen to them at their after-Mass meetings in connection with the local elections and that they want to use <Col N="1371" /> this House to put their propaganda across.</P>
      <P>Deputy Aiken talks about calculated treachery and deceiving the people.  I am glad that he and his colleagues right and left of him at least have the grace to hang their heads in shame when they think of this phrase coming from Deputy Aiken.  Do any of them remember the election campaign of 1951?  Do they remember the banner slogan of that campaign&mdash;&ldquo;You can trust Dev.&rdquo;?  Do they remember how that slogan was used to emphasise the sea-green incorruptible honesty and honour of the Fianna Fáil Party campaign? We all remember how every pronouncement they made with regard to matters of policy, and so forth, was emphasised and underlined by the famous slogan: &ldquo;You can trust Dev.&rdquo; I just want to make this comment.  That slogan was never used again and never will.  During the 1951 General Election campaign, when the Deputies opposite&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The amendment deals with the taxes on whiskey which were first imposed in the Supplementary Budget of 1947.  I think it is relevant to remind the House that a certain amount of discussion has taken place in relation to these taxes.  Members of this Party and other Deputies in this House were accused yesterday evening and this morning by Deputy Aiken of indulging in calculated treachery, of setting out deliberately and in cold blood to deceive the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to remind the Deputies opposite of some of the discussion which took place in relation to these taxes.  I want to remind Deputy Lemass, Deputy de Valera and Deputy Aiken in particular that the man appointed as Minister for Finance in the last Fianna Fáil Government spoke with particular emphasis with regard to the taxes that are under discussion in this amendment.  Deputy MacEntee <Col N="1372" /> made a speech in the Town Hall of Rathmines at a time when he, Deputy Aiken and the rest of them were in opposition and, according to the newspaper reports&mdash;which have never been contradicted&mdash;he referred to rumours which, he said, were being spread by a number of persons in the licensed trade to the effect that if Fianna Fáil were returned to office the taxes imposed on drink in the Supplementary Budget of 1947 would be reimposed.</P>
    <P>We can all picture Deputy MacEntee throwing up his hands to the high heavens in horror when he uttered this phrase: &ldquo;There is no truth whatever in that.&rdquo;  Deputy MacEntee gave that categoric assurance to the people.  He was a former Fianna Fáil Minister for Finance and he was about to become Minister for Finance again in a Fianna Fáil Government.  He gave a definite assurance that there was no truth whatever in the rumours which he alleged were being spread that Fianna Fáil would reimpose these taxes.  Apparently, the people who were spreading the rumours knew Fianna Fáil form better than Deputy MacEntee did.</P>

      <P>They knew about the £24,000,000 which was bequeathed to Deputy de Valera.  They knew the form of the Fianna Fáil Party better than Deputy MacEntee did.  They did not intend to be gulled by the slogan: &ldquo;You can trust Dev.&rdquo; In any event, they made up their minds that, in relation to the tax on whiskey, you could not trust Dev. very far.  It took them just nine months to see exactly how far you could trust him in relation to that tax.  In the same speech, to emphasise this theme that was running through the Fianna Fáil pronouncements with regard to these taxes, Deputy MacEntee had this to say.  Lest anyone would for a moment think that he would come into the category of people who were described by Deputy Aiken a few minutes ago as indulging in calculated treachery, setting out cold-bloodedly and treacherously to deceive the people, lest there be the slightest danger that any of the people being asked to support Fianna Fáil would put <Col N="1373" /> Deputy Aiken, Deputy MacEntee, Deputy Lemass or any of them in that category, Deputy MacEntee continued, in the same speech as that in which he gave that assurance with regard to these taxes&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The people were being asked to decide whether politics in Ireland was to be a dirty game played by confidence tricksters who were prepared to promise anything to dupe the people into voting for them.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;You can trust Dev, these taxes won't go back&rdquo;&mdash;and nine months later these taxes were back again.</P>

      <P>The Deputies opposite are still smarting under the fact that the Irish people decided that they have had enough of Fianna Fáil. They bitterly resent the fact that Deputies on this side pointed out to the people exactly what Fianna Fáil had done in relation to the taxes now under discussion, the fact that&mdash;not-withstanding the assurances given by Deputy Lemass, Deputy MacEntee and the rest of them that these taxes would not be reimposed, that it was unnecessary to reimpose them&mdash;the taxes were reimposed.  We pointed that out to the people, as we were entitled to do.  As far as I am concerned, I will continue pointing it out to the people.  Fianna Fáil resent that. They resent the fact that the Fianna Fáil actions in relation to these taxes and to other matters were so fully and so effectively exposed to the people. I think it was Deputy Childers who referred to the pamphlet which Deputy Aiken produced here this morning as being &ldquo;damnably effective&rdquo;.  It was&mdash; and it was intended to be effective.  It was intended to drive home to the people just how far you could trust Fianna Fáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment and the other amendments which have been tabled here are not tabled seriously.  Deputy Lemass and Deputy MacEntee yesterday evening admitted that these were not being tabled with the serious <Col N="1375" /> object of having them accepted.  Yet we have this little bit of play-acting from Deputy Aiken this morning.  He stands up and asks: &ldquo;Is the Minister prepared to accept this amendment?&rdquo; Did he not hear Deputy Lemass last night; did he not hear Deputy MacEntee last night?  I do not know what is the order of ascendancy in that Party, I think Deputy Lemass still has a head lead on Deputy Aiken; but in any event his two colleagues put themselves on record last night as admitting, with varying degrees of frankness, that these amendments were not tabled seriously.  They did not go so far as to admit that they were put down merely for the purpose of brazen play-acting, but that in fact is the purpose of these amendments.  Deputy Lemass, Deputy MacEntee and Deputy Aiken are not endeavouring to make any kind of serious contribution to the financial discussions in this House.  I hope the day will come when some arrangements might be made that the time of the House will not be wasted in the manner in which it has been wasted so far by the Deputies opposite.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I go on with this discussion of the spirit duty, I would like to make a passing reference &mdash;that Deputy O'Higgins can do nothing to asperse the honour of Deputy Eamon de Valera.  So far as this discussion has gone this morning, we once more have a suggestion made that we promised to maintain taxation at the 1951 level.  I think it is best to admit that we trusted far too much in the maintenance of the tradition of balanced Budgets which has been the case in this country for many years and which was admittedly the case even in the previous régime, when Cumann na nGaedhael was in office before 1932.  I can hardly believe that either Deputy MacEntee or any other member of the Fianna Fáil Party would have made the promises or would have made statements in regard to keeping taxation at its current level, if they had known they would be faced with an unbalanced Budget, with £24,000,000 that was completely committed to the repayment of capital charges and with the obligation of implementing new <Col N="1376" /> policies such as the Social Welfare Act and the Health Act which, with the unbalanced items in the Budget, total £15,000,000.</P>
      <P>All I can say is this, that on the next occasion that a general election comes before the people of this country, we will be very much more careful, we will know that a Coalition Cabinet has been in office and that, particularly in a time of dissolution, the members of the Cabinet have quarrelled within themselves and are quite capable of leaving an unbalanced Budget.  The next time, we will have to be certain that every time we make any reference to current taxation we shall say: &ldquo;Provided that the Budget which has been passed previous to the election is in fact balanced and that the expenditure will be met by revenue.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In this particular case we are discussing something rather different from income-tax and the tax on beer. There is more opportunity for the Minister to accept this amendment than there was in the case of income-tax and the beer tax yesterday, when Deputy MacEntee and Deputy Lemass made it quite clear that, although the Coalition had promised to reduce these taxes, if the Budget was to be balanced they would in fact have to maintain them.  There were widespread allegations made that the tax imposed on whiskey was uneconomic; that it was related to the law of diminishing returns; that sums which varied from £500,000 to £1,000,000 were being lost to the Exchequer through overtaxation of whiskey. Statements were freely made throughout the country during the general election that if the whiskey tax had not been imposed more revenue would have come from it and other forms of taxation could have been relieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember hearing in Kilbeggan, where whiskey is distilled, very definite charges made that the reduction of employment in the Kilbeggan distillery&mdash;and employment was reduced also in the other small distillery at Tullamore which was similarly affected&mdash;could have been avoided and that, moreover, the hard-pressed worker was paying more for other <Col N="1377" /> commodities because money was being deliberately lost to the Exchequer by the improvidence of the then Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>We are discussing, therefore, on this amendment a slightly different problem and I want to ask the Minister for Finance whether he has changed his mind; whether he now believes that the whiskey tax is economic from the standpoint of collecting the revenue which it was designed to collect, and what has changed the situation?  I would like to ask him whether he deliberately believes in keeping the consumption of whiskey, particularly among the less wealthy sections of the community, at the level which he believed was low when the tax was imposed by us?  That is a perfectly fair question because, as I have said, the implication was that the law of diminishing returns was operating, not only in connection with whiskey, I might add, but in connection with other taxes as well; and the suggestion was made that we could collect far more money if we reduced taxes.  We did not know how to impose taxation and we were deliberately imposing taxation to cut down consumption and we could collect the same money, or even more, if we reduced taxation.</P>
    <P>In the case of whiskey that particular charge was made and it was based on the fact that for the first part of the period the consumption of whiskey had declined.  Why has the Minister for Finance not changed his mind?  In Kilbeggan and in Tullamore, where there are two small distilleries, there was very considerable agitation during the general election over this and people made speeches in Kilbeggan on behalf of the Coalition Parties stating quite clearly that employment would be increased in the distillery if the Coalition Government got back to office because there would undoubtedly be the abolition of the increase in the tax, which was ridiculous and ineffective and, indeed, had the effect of reducing the consumption of whiskey without bringing any corresponding return of revenue.</P>
    <P>As the Minister knows, the small distilleries are particularly affected; and he must know, since representations <Col N="1378" /> have been made to him by representatives of both these small distilleries which were affected, the high overhead costs per gallon of whiskey distilled and the difficulty of financing whiskey under bond and the overwhelming prestige over a period of years in the case of the larger distilleries; and I would have thought that he would have done something to live up to the promises that were made in the areas where whiskey is distilled in Offaly and Westmeath and do something to help in this matter.</P>
    <P>As I have said we have a perfect right to ask him for an answer to this specific question: What has caused him to change his mind about the economic value of the tax?  We put down this amendment not merely to try to make the Coalition Parties make statements in regard to their promises and what they really meant by them, but also with the object of finding out whether, after all, everything that was said about the tax on whiskey was wrong from the financial and revenue standpoint.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already, by way of interjection, described the amendment Deputy Aiken moved for Deputy Lemass this morning quite properly as sheer irresponsibility.  We had the pattern last night and I do not propose to travel over the same ground again.  I propose to refer to any difference there may be in relation to this amendment as compared with the amendments we discussed last night. Deputy Childers has asked a specific question.  The fact is that was the position at the time these criticisms were made.  In 1952 my predecessor expected he would get an extra £1,000,000 from whiskey.  In fact, instead of getting £1,000,000 extra, he got £500,000 less.</P>

      <P>The facts show exactly where the Fianna Fáil Government stands and where the inter-Party Government stands.  Let the people judge on those facts.  I am perfectly happy, and I have said this everywhere, that the people should take the unvarnished results of the three years of inter-Party Government from 1948 to 1951 and the results of the one year from 1954 to 1955 and put them on one side of the scales and put on the other side of the scale the effect of Fianna Fáil governmental policy from 1951 to 1954.  That is by way of judging policy.  I could go into all this on a much wider basis but I would be very properly reminded that we are dealing with a particular amendment.</P>
      <P>So far as the specific amendment is concerned, that was the position when these duties were imposed.  It is not the position now.  The position now is quite simple.  The cost of this amendment would be exactly the amount that I am proposing to set aside in the current year to meet the increase in old age, widows' and blind pensions.  Anybody who wants to have a balanced Budget and who votes for this amendment is saying that whiskey should be reduced in preference to increasing these pensions. I prefer to increase the pensions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Taoiseach was trying to prove that the Exchequer would get more revenue by reducing the whiskey duty he was wrong: is not that what the Minister has just said? He has now found out he was wrong; the higher duty is bringing in the revenue anticipated.  But the Minister has just said that Deputy MacEntee was wrong to the extent of £1,500,000. When Deputy Costello, now Taoiseach, went out during the general election trying to prove to the people that the Exchequer would get more revenue by <Col N="1380" /> reducing the whiskey duty he was talking nonsense.  He has since found that out and the Minister for Finance, on that argument, goes to grass.  I want to leave this question of election promises aside for the moment.  It seems now that promises were given since the election.  Prior to the Budget, the Minister received representatives of the publicans' organisation and also representatives of the trade unions which cater for the publicans' assistants. I do not know what happened.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No; on the contrary, I said I had no information whatever as to what happened at these interviews but the spokesmen of the publicans' organisation and the spokesmen of the assistants' organisation have since said that they were expecting to get relief in the Budget and were extremely disappointed when no such relief was forthcoming.  What has happened since?  The publicans' organisation has moved to secure an increase in prices and, judging by the statements they have issued to the Press, the increases they are seeking are very considerable.  They have said they must get relief and if relief was not forthcoming in the Budget they must get it from the consumers in the form of higher prices.  I repeat what I said yesterday, that the publicans are being led to believe that these increases will come&mdash;perhaps not the full increases they are seeking, but some increases&mdash;in the prices of beer and spirits when the local elections are over.</P>
      <P>I do not know if that is likely to be beneficial either to the publicans or to the brewing and distilling trades. During the course of the election various Fine Gael spokesmen represented both the brewing and distilling industries as tottering on the verge of bankruptcy, not likely to carry on unless some relief in taxation was given, because, of course, there is a very considerable difference from the point of view of those trades in securing the relief they need in the form of reduced charges as against higher prices.  It is not unlikely that any increase in prices will reduce consumption, increase the number of teetotallers in prices will reduce consumption, increase the number of teetotallers in the country, to Deputy O'Leary's horror&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect will be a contraction of output and employment at the manufacturing end.  If, however, relief in the form of reduced taxes is not to be forthcoming, then if there is foundation for the publicans' case they are justified in seeking to put into motion the machinery which may secure for them, with Government consent, increases in prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1382" /> The trade union organisation, on the other hand, has said that while recognising the difficulty of the publicans, they are not prepared to delay the claim they are making for improved conditions for the employees.  The president of the Publicans' Assistants' Union has stated that many hundreds of publicans' assistants are emigrating because they see no future in their employment in this country.  They have also urged that it is better for the trade to get relief in the form of reduced taxation rather than in the form of higher prices but they are apparently supporting a case for higher prices now that the relief in taxation which they were led to expect would be forthcoming is not available to them.</P>
    <P>There is surely a case for considering this amendment in the light of these statements, apart altogether from any pledges which Ministers and their supporters may have given during the election campaign.  It is, of course, preposterous to put the revenue derived from the whiskey tax against the specific charge for old age pensions: that is not merely a misleading picture to put before the House, but it makes nonsense of all the assertions of Fine Gael spokesmen during the election campaign about the practicability of securing tax reductions through economies in the Government's administration.</P>
    <P>There is one aspect of this matter of election promises, however, to which I think some emphasis should be given. The attitude of the Labour Party in this regard is still ambiguous.  Deputy Aiken has quoted the circular issued by the Leader of that Party during the election campaign, a circular in which he referred specifically to the increased taxes on tabacco, beer and spirits, and asked for support so that he could advocate in this House with the Labour Party the reduction of these taxes.  Now the only member of the Labour Party who has spoken in this Dáil on the subject of the whiskey tax has spoken against its reduction&mdash;that is Deputy O'Leary.</P>

If there is any difference within the Labour Party I do not want to reveal it now, but it is perhaps desirable that the position of that Party in relation to this tax should be clarified.

      <P>I have never been accused of that before.  Leaving aside the political aspect of this amendment, I think the Minister should take this opportunity of clarifying the position regarding his relations with the publicans' organisations and the Publicans' Assistants' Union.  Nobody will accuse Mr. Hedigan of being prejudiced against this Government&mdash;he stood with Deputy McGilligan as a candidate in a Dublin City constituency on behalf of Fine Gael.  What he has said about the Government since is on record and is to the effect that he accused the Government of reneging on their undertaking to him.</P>

      <P>He certainly said that the publicans got better treatment from Deputy MacEntee as Minister for Finance than they were getting from Fine Gael despite all the promises that were given to the publicans' association by the Fine Gael Party.  If there is no intention of giving the publicans relief in the form of higher prices, then they should be so informed.  I think it is undesirable that the situation that now exists in that trade should continue with the trade unions looking for higher wages and better conditions for their assistants when higher wages and better conditions cannot, presumably, be given unless the trade get either lower taxes or higher prices.</P>
      <P>The position of the Government should be clarified.  If they are not going to give increased prices, the publicans should be so informed and the Publicans Assistans' Union should be so informed.  If they are going to give higher prices, or if the Government is prepared to concede the principle of higher prices subject to the report of the Prices Advisory Body, then the position is that the Government has come to a definite decision that lower taxes will not be given and if relief is to be secured it must be secured through higher prices.  The situation should be clarified and this is a very suitable opportunity for doing so.</P>

      <P>In view of the fact that Deputy Lemass has&mdash;I think quite deliberately&mdash;misconstrued what some of the publican spokesmen have said, I just want to put this on record.  I saw deputations from various publicans' organisations, from the licensed vintners, the Association of Vintners and organisations from other parts of the country and the union concerned. I listened to all that they had to say and when they had finished I told them that when framing the Budget there were three things I had to consider. One was the economic position of the country as a whole.  The second was the revenue and expenditure, the national position.  The third was, the considerations <Col N="1385" /> in respect of each particular trade and that they had put to me the considerations in respect of their trade.</P>
      <P>I told them that I would bear all these three things in mind when I was framing the Budget and more than that I was not prepared to say to any of them.  I did.  I carried out my undertaking implicitly and to the last letter and nobody, no matter what twist Deputy Lemass may try to put on any statement, has ever suggested, except Deputy Lemass, that I made any promise to them which I did not carry out.</P>

      <P>Did not the Minister's Party make all the promises possible to the trade?  Did not they lead them up the tree and tell them that as soon as they would get into office they would reduce the tax on beer?  Did not they tell them they would reduce the tax on spirits?  Even at this late stage, I do not see why members of the Fine Gael Party do not get up in this House and say: &ldquo;We did make false promises, we have found we were wrong&rdquo; and admit it now like honest men.

The present Minister is not facing up to his promises.  He is not honouring the promises that he made to the loyal publicans that stood by him and his Party.</P>
    <P>The present position of the trade definitely requires that the Minister should do something for them.  Deputy MacEntee, as Minister for Finance, gave relief to the trade in his Budget and intended to continue in that way provided the financial position merited it.  Of course, the Minister for Finance, just as they all did during the last general election, cries about the poor people, the old age pensioners, the widows and orphans and all the others that they cry about.</P>

Will he tell the House where is the £10,000,000 that his leader, the Taoiseach, alleged that we had when we introduced our Budget of 1952.  Is he aware that the licensed trade has deteriorated greatly and that a number of employees in the trade have emigrated because they see no future in it?  One of the reasons why they see no future in the trade is that they cannot believe the promises that were made by responsible statesmen who are now making up this Government.</P>

It will be very difficult for people to take seriously the promises of any public men in future because the promises that have been made so lavishly have not been fulfilled. They went around the country with pamphlets during the election.  A number of the pamphlets have already been discussed.  They referred to the 1948, the 1951 and the 1952 Budgets. They indicated what they would do when they would get in.  When challenged about this in the House they say: &ldquo;We did not make it,&rdquo;&ldquo;I did not make it,&rdquo;&ldquo;It was not made by me.&rdquo;  The Minister in his election address in Kildare has the same thing and he is denying that he made any promise at all.

      <P>The Minister's canvassers went around and told the gullible people in Kildare&mdash;the same was done in the rest of Ireland&mdash;that when they got into office they would reduce taxation to the 1951 level.  Now when they are challenged in the House they say they never made such statements and promises.  That is the attitude of responsible leaders of the Government to-day.  That is bad for the country from the national point of view.  We <Col N="1389" /> cannot have any confidence in public men when they adopt a policy of that kind.  It is the poor who suffer.

      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Cosgrave)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the most noticeable thing about this discussion is the difference between Fianna Fáil when in office and when in Opposition.  When Fianna Fáil were in Government they increased the taxes on beer and tobacco but when they are in opposition they are in favour of a reduction. We had two speeches from Deputies Lemass and Childers expressing solicitude for the publicans on the one hand and the small distilleries on the other.</P>
      <P>What are the facts about this matter? When Fianna Fáil was in Government in 1947 they introduced a Supplementary Budget in October of that year.  In that Supplementary Budget they raised the taxes on beer and tobacco.  We at that time were in opposition and said that if we got in we would take off those taxes. Within four months a change of Government had taken place and the taxes were repealed.  That situation continued until the election of 1951.  During the course of that particular election, because of rumours that were apparently being spread through the licensed trade, two prominent members of the Fianna Fáil Party spoke on the question of beer and spirit taxes. Deputy Lemass, as he then was, said, as reported in the <i>Sunday Press</i> of May 13th, 1951:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A Coalition Minister has said that Fianna Fáil if elected would increase taxes on beer and tobacco. Why should this tax be necessary? There is no special reason why we should reimpose these taxes.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy MacEntee spoke at Rathmines Town Hall and said, as reported in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of the 16th May:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A number of persons in the licensed trade were spreading rumour that if Fianna Fáil were returned to power taxes imposed on drink in the Supplementary Budget of 1947 would be reimposed. There is no truth in any such rumour.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Within ten months, on the 2nd April, 1952, Fianna Fáil, then in Government, reimposed the taxes on beer, tobacco and spirits.  When Deputies Childers and Lemass express solicitude for either the publicans or the workers in the distilleries we want the people in these particular trades not to judge on speeches and not to judge on either promises or talk but to judge on the record.  The record clearly proves that when Fianna Fáil are in Government they do one thing and when in opposition they say another.</P>
      <P>When in opposition, two leading members of that Party stated that these taxes would not be reimposed, but within ten months the taxes had been reimposed.  The ill-effects to which Deputy Childers referred this morning&mdash;that were felt by the distillers, the publicans, the employees of the publicans and the members of the Licensed Vintners' and Grocers' Union &mdash;all flowed from the Fianna Fáil Budget of 1952.  When Deputies come in here and talk about their interest in the effects of these high taxes and when they appeal to the Minister for Finance to repeal them, is it not reasonable to ask them why, when they had a majority and when they had given specific pledges that these taxes would not be put back, the taxes went on?</P>

      <P>Deputy de Valera has been talking by way of interruption both last night and this morning.  There is not a Deputy on either side of the House who will not let him speak.  We <Col N="1391" /> will give him his head from now until 5 o'clock if he wants to talk about the taxes.  The position is that the people can judge a policy only on results.  On two specific occasions since 1947 Fianna Fáil introduced two Budgets dealing with taxes on beer and spirits.  In both of those Budgets, in the Supplementary Budget of 1947 and the Budget of 1952, they reimposed heavy additional taxation on spirits, beer, tobacco as well as on the other commodities.</P>
      <P>I know that the local elections are coming on next week and that it is no harm for Deputy Childers to create the impression in Kilbeggan or Tullamore that he was in favour of reduced taxes but results are the best test of any policy.  Fianna Fáil in 1947 and 1952, the two occasions when they had a majority, raised the taxes on both beer and spirits.  In May 1951, Deputy Lemass in Cork and Deputy MacEntee in Rathmines, undertook that if they were elected they would not reimpose the tax on beer and spirits.  Now they are in opposition again and Deputy Lemass comes in here perturbed about the conditions in the licensed trade and Deputy Childers is anxious about the position of the smaller distilleries and the effect which the heavy tax had.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They had an opportunity in 1953. When Deputy MacEntee in his Budget of 1952 imposed the tax on spirits he estimated that the increased taxes on spirits, that is, on whiskey, would have given him £1,020,000.  When the out-turn of that financial year had occurred, instead of getting the estimated increase, it was less by £504,000. In 1953 Fianna Fáil had a majority and Deputy Childers was a member of the Government then as were also Deputies Lemass and MacEntee.  They knew the effect of these heavy taxes on distilleries or on the breweries as the case may be.  They took no steps to grant reliefs but now, when in opposition again, they suggest that the present Minister for Finance should effect a reduction.  As the Minister said this morning, the amount of revenue that would be lost as a result of this proposition is exactly equal to the increases which are being granted <Col N="1392" /> to the old age pensioners, the widows and orphans and the blind pensioners.</P>
    <P>I think that the Minister did, in the remissions which he granted to the smaller breweries, show his interest and desire in a practical manner to help them in their special circumstances. I believe that the vast majority of the people agreed with him when he said that as part of Government policy we believe that the weaker sections of the community have the first claim on the resources of the State and that in a case of this sort it would be quite unreasonable to grant this proposed remission to the interests concerned rather than by increases in respect of old age pensions, blind pensions and widows and orphans.</P>
    <P>We have had a great deal of talk about promises, posters and so forth, but the facts show that it was Fianna Fáil, on two different occasions, imposed in the first case, and reimposed in the second case, the burdens which affect the distilleries and which affect the publicans about whom Deputy Lemass is now so solicitous, and affect all those who derive their livelihood from the sale of beer and spirits.  It was the inter-Party Government when they got the opportunity&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The circumstances are entirely different&mdash;to expect that from a Party getting into office two years after the penal Budget of 1952. We said, during the course of the by-elections in 1952, that if we own those elections and got in that then the remissions could be effected, but that once&mdash;the Deputies opposite know this particularly well&mdash;the pattern of expenditure gets to be in any sense rigid it is extremely difficult to change it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only occasion on which we did get the opportunity of doing it within a short time, we implemented the remissions.  I do not believe that any publican or any employee in the licensed trade, or workers in the distilleries or small breweries, are impressed by the arguments used here by the Fianna Fáil spokesmen last night or this morning.  They have only to throw their minds back&mdash;they <Col N="1393" /> have not to go to the Fine Gael Party or to the Labour Party and say: &ldquo;Well, they said this but may be they will not do it,&rdquo; and they have not to listen to our speeches&mdash;in order to be convinced. They know from the records that it was the Party opposite that raised these taxes and increased the burdens which these particular sections of the economy are obliged to bear, and that the only occasion on which any remissions or reliefs to these trades or industries were granted was by the inter-Party Government in 1951 and by the remissions which the Minister for Finance has given to the smaller breweries in the Budget of this year.</P>
    <P>I know it is difficult for people not to be impressed by the speeches and propaganda of the Deputies opposite. We want the people to judge on the results and on the facts.  The results show that it was that Party that proposes now, when it is in opposition, not to increase taxes, but when they got into Government they on two occasions put on these heavy taxes. Now they express interest and solicitude for the distillery workers, for the licensed grocers and vintners and employees in these particular trades.</P>
    <P>Similarly, in the case of other undertakings that were given, but which are irrelevant on this particular amendment, the facts again speak loudly. They give point to the undertaking that subsidies would not be reduced and within ten months the subsidies were cut as the people know.  They also know that the taxes were reimposed in respect of beer and spirits. We ask the people to judge on the results rather than on the speeches or on the talk of the people opposite.</P>

      <P>May I intervene?  The Minister for Finance suggested that I had misquoted Mr. John Hedigan, Chairman of the Licensed Grocers' and Vintners' Association.  I propose now to quote his words as recorded in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of the 10th May last.  Mr. John Hedigan is recorded as saying:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;...it is most likely that prices of drinks will be increased in the near future.&rdquo;</P>

      <Col N="1394" />&ldquo;We had looked forward,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;with lively expectancy to the Budget of last week.  We had expected, and felt that we had the right to expect, that the Minister for Finance would have followed the example of his predecessor and given some direct relief to the retail licensed trade of no less an amount than that which Deputy MacEntee had given in the 1954 Budget.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think that that quotation indicates that I was perfectly accurate when I said that the spokesman of the Licensed Grocers' and Vintners' Association had said that, following his interview with the Minister for Finance, he expected, and felt that they had the right to expect, relief from the Budget.</P>

      <P>The Minister for External Affairs, apparently is a neophyte sitting at the feet of the Attorney-General.  The Attorney-General is also very adept in switching a debate from a real issue to one which he manufactures.  The issue in the <Col N="1395" /> debate on this amendment to reduce the spirits duties, is not what Fianna Fáil did when it was in office and not what Fianna Fáil said when it was out of office, but what the Government promised when it was out of office and what it is failing to do now that it is in office.</P>
      <P>The Minister for External Affairs has recited the history of the supplementary duties on beer and spirits.  He has told the House that in 1947, under the Supplementary Budget, the duties on beer and spirits were increased. They were increased for a definite purpose: to enable the Government to cover the possible cost of subsidies on foodstuffs which the Fianna Fáil Government were about to introduce.  They were introduced as a wise precaution to ensure that the Budget for 1947-48 would be like all other Budgets for which Fianna Fáil had been responsible prior to that time: that instead of showing a deficit on current expenditure, a deficit which would be met by borrowing and which would be passed on to succeeding generations, the country should pay its way and the State should pay its way as it went.  That was an honest policy: that is the sort of policy which honest men try to follow in respect to their own individual expenditure and to their everyday concerns. Therefore, this Supplementary Budget was introduced and, quite frankly, the taxes on beer, spirits and tobacco were increased in order that the Government might make provision to cover the expenditure which was contemplated in respect to food subsidies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for External Affairs has come in to tell us that the moment the Coalition Government came in they repealed those duties.  Now, they are asking the people to believe that they have conferred great boons on them by maintaining the price of tea, more or less constant, and in reducing the price of butter by 5d. per lb., but during the election which preceded the advent of the Coalition in 1948 they went around telling the people that these things did not matter: that the subsidies in fact were only a way of disguising the consumer's expenditure, and of preventing <Col N="1396" /> the workers from securing the living wage which, if the real cost of living to the workers had been disclosed, they would have been justified in demanding. That is what the Labour Party were telling us and that is what some members of the Fine Gael Party were telling us.</P>
    <P>However, as the Minister for External Affairs has reminded us this morning, when the first Coalition took office in 1948, they reduced the beer and spirits duties to their former level. They continued the subsidies, gradually tapering them off and providing for some part of the cost of those subsidies in a rather surreptitious way.  For instance, there were two prices for bread, two prices for butter, two prices for tea and two prices for sugar.  At the same time, they were compelling the Irish manufacturer of confectionery and other things to pay an enhanced price for his sugar and in that way they were, of course, compelling those workers who were engaged in the manufacture of sugar confectionery for export, to accept, perhaps, a lower standard of living than they might have been if this dishonest imposition had not been passed on to the Irish manufacturer of sugar confectionery.</P>
    <P>That is what the Government did from 1948 and continued to do until 1951.  Do not let us forget that while they had the two-price system in operation there was as much bread, as much butter, as much sugar and tea there for anybody who was rich enough to pay for it, and those who could not pay for it were kept strictly to the ration at the ration price.  That is the subterfuge and the device that was adopted by our predecessors during the period 1948 to 1951.</P>
    <P>But there was something more that had happened.  What did follow from the repeal of the increases imposed in the Supplementary Budget?  There followed this, that from the Budget of 1949, there was an openly disclosed deficit of about £2,700,000.  I am speaking now from memory and without any memorandum on that matter in front of me, but Deputies who wish to verify my statement in this regard can go out and look at the statement which was issued to the House by the then Minister <Col N="1397" /> for Finance in the course of the preliminary part of his Budget speech of 1950.  They will see there a disclosed deficit of £2,607,000, the fruit of a policy that had been pursued by the Coalition in refusing to live up to their just obligations and to find the revenue to cover the expenditure which they were undertaking.</P>
    <P>That happened in the Budget of 1949, in the Budget of 1950 and in the Budget of 1951, as presented to this House. There was a concealed deficit.  Those two Budgets of 1950 and 1951 did not balance because the then Minister for Finance did not meet the obligations that properly fell in respect of a number of subsidies, including that for fuel. But the position could not be concealed. Once there was a change of Government and the books were open to scrutiny we realised, and we warned this House in July, 1951, that after an examination of the figures it was clear to us that there would be a deficit of many millions of pounds on the Budget which my predecessor, the present Attorney-General, introduced, as Minister for Finance, in this House in May of 1951.</P>
    <P>When the end of the year came and the books were closed with it, then it was clear that there was a deficit on the 1951 Budget of no less than £6,700,000.  £6,700,000 was the deficit on the Budget of 1951 on the expenditure for that year, as it had been foreseen when the Dáil was precipitously dissolved on the 4th May of that year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>There was £6,700,000 of a deficit which the Fianna Fáil Government which succeeded the first Coalition had to meet and it was a running deficit, a deficit which was going on from year to year, because the increases in Civil Service remuneration were continuing from year to year and the increases in old age pensions which were promised by the Labour Party but which we had to implement were going on from year to year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1398" /> I want to give credit where credit is due.  Let me say this.  The fact that the deficit on the 1951 Budget was only £6,700,000 was due very largely to the Labour Party.  If it was due to one element in the Coalition more than to any other it was due to the Labour Party.  It was due to the inaction of the Labour Party in regard to the pledges which they had specifically given to their supporters that, if they were returned to power in 1948, there would be increases in the social welfare services, there would be increases in the health services and there would be no means test.</P>
    <P>These are the things which the Labour Party spokesmen promised to the electorate during the general election of 1948.  These were the three carrots which were kept dangling before the people during the three years that the Coalition were in office and it was on one of them that the Coalition broke up.  The Coalition broke up because of the refusal of one element in the Coalition to honour the pledge in regard to the health services. It broke up because of the refusal of the Fine Gael element to honour the pledge which the Labour element in the Coalition had given to those who voted for them, to bring in extended health services and to bring in social welfare legislation without any means test.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps so, but the point I wish to make is that in so far as the Budget of 1951 disclosed a deficit of more than £6,700,000, the gratitude for the fact that it was not higher is due to the Labour Party because if they had fulfilled their promises and if they had brought in the Social Welfare Act which we brought in in 1952 and if they had brought in the health services which we introduced in 1953 and which have since been suspended, the deficit in the 1951 Budget would not have been £6,700,000 but £15,000,000.  It must be admitted straight away that the Fianna Fáil Government gave effect to the pledges that had been given by the Labour <Col N="1399" /> Party, because after all our policy has been one of social progress.  We are the people who brought in the children's allowances; we are the people who brought in the widows' and orphans' benefits; we are the people who brought in the first Health Act on which all successive legislation has been based.</P>

      <P>We brought in the widows' and orphans' benefits.  What I am saying is that the Government which introduced these measures of social amelioration for the benefit of the people of the country were the Fianna Fáil Government.  Therefore, because we were such a progressive Party, when in office we had to fulfil the pledges made by all sides of the House during the election of 1951 that there would be improved social services, that there would be a new Social Welfare Act and improved health services. All of this cost money and that is why the Budget of 1952, on the basis of taxes as they existed in 1951, would have shown a deficit of £15,000,000 just because we undertook and we implemented what the Labour Party had promised to do but had failed.</P>

I wonder how many of those millions he had hoped to get from the social services, from the health services, from the unemployment benefits, from the widows' and orphans' allowances, and from the children's allowances which the present Taoiseach described in 1947 as merely a row of medicine bottles.</P>

They had the excuse last year that they were just taking office and that therefore they could not start playing hanky-panky with the State finances as they had done when they took office in 1948.  They said, as I had to say in 1951: &ldquo;We will see how the year turns out and when we have ascertained the situation for ourselves we will bring in a Budget on lines which will be in the public interest in relation to taxation.&rdquo; They brought in a Budget in 1955 and how does it and in what respect does it differ from the Budget of 1952?</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in the cost of Government without much effort, how is it they are not giving the taxpayer even the opportunity to take a glass of whiskey?  How is it they have not given the people the benefit of these savings, which, let me repeat, the present Attorney-General assured the electorate could be secured without much effort?  I do not want to deal with the Attorney-General.  I think the Attorney-General last night put himself in an absurd position.  We had talk of a dictionary republic but we had a dictionary defence from the Attorney-General last night.  The Attorney-General tried to obliterate from the public memory the fact that he had pledged himself to make reductions to the extent of several million pounds, which, of course, conjure up figures like £10,000,000 or £20,000,000, not a mere £1,000,000 and part of £1,000,000. What did he try to convey to those listening to him when he was talking over Radio Éireann?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The one thing that this last defence has shown is that whatever confidence is to be reposed in any portion of what the Attorney-General said, the electorate will not believe the Attorney-General even out of a sworn affidavit in regard to any simple statement of fact after hearing him on the Vote on Account, the Budget and on the Finance Bill.  The real point I want to get at is that these amendments, which ask that the duties on beer and spirits should be reduced, are really designed, if there is anything in the statements made by the Taoiseach in May of last year, to help the Minister for Finance. After all, the Taoiseach was very confident that if the duty on spirits were reduced the Exchequer would benefit. That was the view the present Taoiseach tried to convey and to impress on the electorate last year.  Here is his chance now.  Let the Taoiseach try the experiment; let the Minister <Col N="1402" /> for Finance hearken to the teachings of his leader and let him reduce the spirit duty to the level at which it stood in 1951 or prior to 1952.  According to the Taoiseach, if he does that he will unlock a vast treasure chest, gold will flow into the Exchequer because the people will drink more whiskey though they may not be much more sober.</P>
    <P>If the Minister for Finance does that the distillers throughout the country will be saved and there will be a better market for barley.  We will, in effect, be on the pig's back if only the Minister for Finance will hearken to the teachings of his Taoiseach and, by reducing the duty on spirits, increase the yield to the Exchequer.  That is our real point.  We are not in this House to act as partisans.  We know the difficulties of the Minister for Finance and we are anxious to help him.  And now let him, as I said, be a good boy.  After all the Taoiseach is an old hand at the political game and we have been told he is surrounded by a staff of back room boys to advise him on economical and financial matters.  I notice he has been particularly silent during this debate.  But he has told us that if the duty on spirits were reduced the greater part of the difficulties of the Minister for Finance would be solved because the increases in revenue would more than offset any lessening in taxation.</P>

      <P>We have the peculiar position to-day of the Fianna Fáil Party proposing and supporting an amendment to take off taxes which they themselves put on and they expect the present Minister to do it, but let us go back to the situation which the Minister found when he took office last June.  He found, in his own words, the bottom of the barrel scraped clean. The position was very different when Deputy MacEntee took over in 1951. He was presented then with approximately £26,000,000 of unspent money&mdash; £24,000,000 in Marshall Aid money, plus a further £2,000,000, making a total of approximately £26,000,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the situation which Deputy MacEntee found when he <Col N="1403" /> became Minister in 1951.  When he handed the country over to the present Minister the bottom of the barrel was scraped clean and he comes in now with an amendment asking that the duties be taken off beer which he himself put on.  I have heard Deputy MacEntee saying that when he took office he decided to let things rip for the year 1951 and just watch how the year would turn out, but, while he was letting things rip in 1951, he got rid of £24,000,000 before the end of January, 1952, a period of approximately eight months, when the inter-Party Government, during the previous three years, disposed of something like £16,000,000 of Marshall Aid money very carefully.  It was not a matter of spending it in eight months&mdash;they had a programme and they followed that programme.  I mention this point because I find it very difficult to bear with Deputy MacEntee when he talks in this fashion.</P>
      <P>The Deputy also mentioned the two-price system, but he forgot that his Government brought the prices up for the poor people and made them pay the same price as the richer people. The inter-Party Government pursued a policy by which they gave increased rations of food&mdash;it will be remembered that the people were getting only two ounces of butter when the inter-Party Government took over&mdash;at a low price and whatever people required over and above the ration, at the ordinary economic price.  These are matters which we must consider when we see Fianna Fáil putting forward an amendment of this nature now.  It does not deserve to be supported on this occasion. I am satisfied that this Government will pursue a policy which, in the long run, will lighten the burden of taxation on every section of the community.</P>

The Taoiseach was going to throw the taxation on whiskey over-board&mdash;the people were going to consume <Col N="1404" /> 80,000,000 half ones more and the Minister for Finance was going to get several hundred thousand more. The excuse of the Minister for Finance now is that he must tax whiskey and beer and cigarettes in order to get the money to pay the half-crown to the old age pensioners, which he says is going to cost £1,000,000.  He has already got that from the farmers in the 12/6 reduction in the price of wheat.  He got an extra 50 per cent. bonus on the £500,000 they are charging them for bran and pollard, so that between the reduction in the price of wheat and the addition in respect of bran and pollard and the tax on biscuits, he is getting twice as much as the half-crown to the old age pensioners is costing him.

      <P>At Limerick, on 24th January, 1948, Deputy Norton made a very specific promise to the people.  He said that by returning a strong Labour Party the people would have a guarantee that excess profits would be taxed to provide money to subsidise prices and thus reduce the cost of commodities. Speaking at Celbridge in the same month, he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Nobody has yet been able to explain why £4,500,000 of excess corporation profits tax had been handed back to those whose backs were much more capable of bearing financial burdens than those whose only permitted relaxations were a simple smoke and a glass of stout.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Tánaiste then indicated, and asked for support for, a policy that would reimpose the excess corporation profits tax, increase old age pensions, increase widows' and orphans' pensions <Col N="1406" /> and reduce the tax on smokes, spirits and stout.

    <P>As I pointed out yesterday, there is no means test once a man becomes an income-tax payer.  The State will subsidise him to look after himself, his wife and his family if he insures himself and his wife and family against medical and hospital expenses.  However, although they increased the price of the national health stamp, by the postponement of the Health Act they still leave the working man to look after and to pay for his wife and family if they fall ill.  This Coalition Government are going to give 7/6 in the £ to the man with £600 or £700 or £6,000 or £7,000 a year in order to insure himself in respect of medical expenses but they have refused to support or to press for the extension <Col N="1407" /> of the benefits that were the law and which should have been drawn by the&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There are some people left in the country yet despite the encouragement which the Parliamentary Secretary gave to emigration when he was discussing the matter of full employment.  There are still some people left in the country who will be interested in the discussion of these matters.  The Minister for Finance says it is impossible to reduce this tax.  The only excuse he gives for not carrying out his promise is that it is impossible to reduce this tax and to increase the old age pension.  But the Leader of the Labour Party promised&mdash;I gave the quotation this morning&mdash;his electors and particularly the publicans that they would reduce the tax on spirits. He made promises before to the effect that they were going to reduce these <Col N="1408" /> taxes by reimposing the excess corporation profits tax.  When that tax was abolished it was drawing £4,500,000.  It was withdrawn because the Labour Party in Britain had withdrawn theirs and it would have been impossible to keep it on here if we wanted to see industrial development continue.  People who had money to invest in industry would invest it in Britain under a Labour Government where that tax had been abolished rather than in this country if the tax still obtained here.</P>
      <P>That explanation was not accepted by the Leader of the Labour Party at that time.  He promised he would reimpose it.  If he reimposed that tax to-day it would bring in not merely £4,500,000 but probably £10,500,000.  Why is that sum of £10,500,000 not collected in that fashion rather than collecting in on beer, cigarettes and spirits, which the members of the Labour Party promised to reduce?  Not only did they promise to reduce the tax on cigarettes, beer and spirits by reimposing the excess corporation profits tax but they said they would not even take a job in the Government unless they were reduced. In Meath, Deputy Dunne said they would not even discuss joining the Government until these taxes were reduced.  At the last general election, Deputy Dunne was one of the principal spokesmen of the Labour Party.  He went galloping around the country making all the promises on behalf of the Labour Party and the incoming Coalition.  He went down to Navan to get Deputy Tully elected.</P>

      <P>According to a report in the <i>Meath Chronicle</i> of the 15th May, he said that before the Labour Party would participate in a Government with any Party or group of Parties they would insist that the prices of bread, butter, tea, sugar, cigarettes, tobacco and the workers' pint must be reduced and reduced immediately.  He said that unless they got agreement on that point they would not participate in the formation of any Government.  Did the Labour Party, before they took part in the formation of this Coalition Government <Col N="1409" /> now well over 12 months ago, get agreement that these taxes would be reduced and reduced immediately and, if so, why have they not been reduced within 13 months of their taking office? They reduced some of them in 1948, as has been pointed out, within a few days of their taking office.  They said that what they did in 1948 they would do again in 1954 if they were re-elected. Deputy Dunne said they would not participate in the formation of a Government&mdash;that they would not even discuss it&mdash;unless these taxes were reduced immediately.  Was that agreement made?  There are now two members of the Labour Party left in the House to answer that question.</P>

      <P>They do not seem inclined to answer it.  Deputy Davin, who is now a Parliamentary Secretary, said they would take no jobs in the Government until taxation was reduced and reduced immediately to the 1951 level.  Deputy Davin&mdash;I have already given the quotation&mdash;said it was his opinion that neither Fine Gael not Fianna Fáil would secure an overall majority in the 1954 General Election and that the Labour Party would hold the balance of power.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>They hold it.  He said further that, in that event, the Labour Deputies would not be concerned with securing positions in the Government &mdash;a few extra Ministries and Parliamentary Secrétaryships&mdash;but would be concerned, rather, with reducing taxation and restoring the cost of living to as near the 1951 figure as possible. We know what they did about restoring the cost of living to the 1951 figure. They sneered at the £1,000,000 we gave to reduce the price of bread by a half-penny and called it the &ldquo;Half-penny Budget.&rdquo;  They kicked loaves all around Dublin in contempt of the reduction. In this Budget, they did not even give a halfpenny and they are taking another £500,000 off flour&mdash;off the biscuits and buns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach, in a very humble fashion, says: &ldquo;I may not be a <Col N="1410" /> mathematician, but I can add up.&rdquo; That is a quotation from a statement made by him on the 7th May, 1954.  He added up that this tax which the Government are now proceeding to reimpose would have the effect of decreasing consumption by 80,000,000 half ones, and he said also that would have the effect of reducing the taxes collected by £600,000.  If it is going to have that effect, it is not going to contribute very much to the old age pensioners. That money must be got from the farmers, through the decrease in the price of wheat, the increase in the price of offals and the tax on buns and biscuits.  There is now only one member of the Labour Party left&mdash;the others have disappeared&mdash;and there is still no explanation.</P>

The Tánaiste promised he would intervene in the debate and answer this question, but he has not done so.  Not a single member of the Labour Party has spoken on this Finance Bill to date on his feet.

      <P>On the previous amendment last night, I referred to a calculation which I had made about the ratio between the cost of a pint of beer and a week's wages.  I made the same calculation for the cost of whiskey. Before Deputy MacEntee's Budget of <Col N="1411" /> 1952 the ratio in the cost of a glass of whiskey and a week's wages of an industrial worker was 1 to 40.  Immediately after the Budget it became 1 to 35.  I am glad to say that it is back again at 1 to 40, because of the increase in wages last year in particular and in the year before.  There is no use in the Opposition getting up here and making long irrelevant speeches, with a sentence or two relating to this amendment.</P>
      <P>There has been continuous reference to the promises that were made.  When you get down to promises, you find that Deputy Lemass said immediately before the election, at York Street on the Friday night before the election, that no promises were made.

      <P>Read it out any time.  The Deputy should look and see what is in it.  The main point really is whether the present Government will reduce taxation or not.  The answer to that is twofold&mdash;we will reduce taxaation, unlike Fianna Fáil, at the first moment we can; and, secondly, we have stopped the increase in taxation and stopped the increase in expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What happened the £10,000,000?  In actual fact, there are two £10,000,000 now&mdash;there is the £10,000,000 of Deputy McGilligan and the £10,000,000 of the Taoiseach&mdash;but there is another figure, the £15,000,000 of the Leader of the <Col N="1412" /> Opposition, which he is going to talk on, on the Final Stage of this Bill.  The Party opposite put up taxation to that extent in the Budget and they proceeded to spend it.  Having spent it and raised costs all over the community, they ask us why we do not take it out immediately.  Might I say this about this particular amendment, that on the estimates of what happened about beer and spirits there might be some case to be made, owing to the loss of revenue which came about, that this should certainly not have been imposed in 1952?  The then Minister was all out in his calculation, but the present Minister, having considered the matter carefully&mdash;and he has to take a great deal more than his Budget into consideration&mdash;has decided that this tax cannot be remitted this year.</P>

      <P>Deputy Aiken is very much worried about the Labour Party, but he is the cause of all the trouble <Col N="1413" /> since 1947, when he brought down the Fianna Fáil Party by the Supplementary Budget.  I am speaking as a member of the rank and file of the Labour Party.  I said in the constituency that sent me back here, that we would join in an inter-Party Government for the betterment of the people that we represent.  We are satisfied that an honest effort has been made by the present Cabinet to do the right thing.  Is it not long overdue since 1952?  The old age pensioners and the widows and orphans should be the first plank in the policy of any Party, of any Government.  We told the people from the Labour Party platforms that we would reduce the price of butter and the price of butter has been reduced.  We have granted an increase to the old age pensioners and to widows and orphans.</P>
      <P>Deputy Aiken is terribly annoyed that Deputy Norton is not here.  I think it is all the better that he is not here, because if he were he would lash the ex-Minister better than I could do it, as he knows his tactics.  The only thing the Opposition can do to-day is give quotations from leaflets.  They cannot stand on their own feet and make a speech.  I have no quotations or leaflets.  The people whom I represent know that the Labour Party is honest with them.  It was the Labour Party that put Deputy de Valera into power in 1932.</P>
      <P>Subsequently, when they pressed Deputy de Valera, then President and head of the Cabinet, to do something for the plain people after he had been a short time in office, what did he do? He ran up to the Park and dissolved the Dáil.  He said he could not get on with the Labour Party because the Labour Party was pressing him to do certain things, things which should have been done to help the poorer people and the workers generally.  He got into office on false promises at that time.  As the years went by, Deputy MacEntee, Minister for Local Government, refused to sanction an increase of 2/- a week for workers in Tipperary; he said 1d. a day was enough.  Deputy de Valera said a wage of 45/- a week was enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1414" /> I am satisfied that the Government in which we have the honour of having members is looking after the interests of the people.  We have no doubt about that.  The Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Corish, who represents the same constituency as I do, and the Tánaiste and Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Norton, will see to first things first and forget the Party politics and bitterness.  It almost looks as if the ex-Ministers in the Fianna Fáil Party think that no one can run the country except Fianna Fáil.  Let me quote what they said on their posters.  There was one poster with Deputy de Valera pointing a big finger: &ldquo;Keep the straight road for better times and lower taxes.&rdquo;  That is what he had on his poster; but when he was in power he forgot the poor people who had put him into office and that is why Fianna Fáil is out of office now; they let down the people who supported them in 1932.</P>
    <P>This is the second occasion upon which we have had an inter-Party Government here.  When the first inter-Party Government was elected the first thing that Government did was release the republican prisoners.  That was an achievement.  I will be before the people in a few days in the local elections.  The people will judge us on what we have achieved for the old age pensioners and the widows and the orphans and on the honest effort we have made to try to bring down the cost of living.</P>

      <P>I can well understand Deputy O'Leary's annoyance with the Fianna Fáil Party.  Deputy O'Leary seems to place great store on the fact that the present Government is in power.  I do not think it is a matter of which Government is in power; it is a matter of honesty.  If Deputy O'Leary is so simple as to think that the Fianna Fáil Party now in opposition will forget the promises made by the members of the Coalition Government he is mistaken. Deputy O'Leary states he speaks on behalf of the rank and file of the Labour Party and that he is well satisfied with the present position.  He is well satisfied to see taxation on the increase; he is well satisfied to see prices increasing; and he is well satisfied that there has been no lowering of the burden of taxation.  If Deputy O'Leary had said all that to the electorate in 1954 he would have saved the country a whole lot of trouble and expense.  It is somewhat late now to be trying to put that one across.</P>

      <P>Certain statements have been put into Deputy O'Leary's mouth so that he can preach them parrot-like to all and sundry on the eve of the local elections.  As I say, the Chairman of the Transport and General Workers' Union does not seem at all happy over the present position and I think he speaks on behalf of the rank and file of the Labour Party.  The Irish Transport and General Workers' Union is the largest wing of the Labour Party in this country despite the fact that there are other Unions at the present time trying to oust that body.  For what reason I do not know, but I think that the chairman of that union realises the present Government is in a bog of incompetence in relation to prices, to taxes, to the rate of emigration and the cost of living.</P>
      <P>Local elections are fought more or less on a political basis but certain spokesmen of the present Government are going around in my constituency and apologising to the electorate that but for the fact that the Fianna Fáil Party has insisted on making this a political election they would not introduce politics at all.  That reminds me forcibly of what George Bernard Shaw said one night at a party when he was asked by an admirer at what stage he entered the battle for life.  He replied by saying he never entered the battle of life but threw his mother into it. There is no need&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The present Government promised to maintain the price structure initiated by Fianna Fáil and that price structure extended to barley.  We said all along during the period following the 1952 Budget that food prices were based on farm prices and that any interference with farm prices would have serious consequences for the farmers of this country.</P>
      <P>It was very easy, of course, for a mixture of Parties, who were firing at the target and it was a matter of hit or miss.  It was very easy for the Labour Party to go to the built-up areas and say: &ldquo;We stand for lower food prices.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>With regard to the tax on whiskey, the Minister for External Affairs, when speaking here earlier, gave a quotation from a statement which he alleged Deputy Lemass made on the 13th May, 1951, but, by stopping short and not reading the quotation in full, the whole context of Deputy Lemass's speech was misconstrued. I would like to read in full what Deputy Lemass said at that time. I am reading from the <i>Sunday Press</i>, 13th May, 1951.  What Deputy Lemass did say was:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A Coalition Minister had said that Fianna Fáil, if elected, would immediately increase taxes on beer and tobacco.  That suggestion seemed to emanate from guilty consciences. Why should any increase in taxes be necessary?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister for External Affairs stopped there.  Deputy Lemass continued and said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Coalition had presented the Budget for the present financial year before dissolving the Dáil.  Mr. McGilligan had claimed that it would yield a small surplus of revenue at the end of the year.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Deputy Lemass continued:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If it was an honest Budget based on <i>bona-fide</i> expectations of expenditure and revenue working out as Mr. McGilligan had estimated, then it was clear that no further increases of taxation of any kind were necessary. Why then should Coalition Ministers be forecasting a need for higher taxes?  No Government would increase taxation for the fun of it. Did they allege that Mr. McGilligan's Estimates had been phoney?&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1425" /> It was most unfortunate that, though he was pressed to do so, the Minister for External Affairs did not see fit to read this quotation in full.</P>
    <P>The only other matter I want to refer to is the question of the increase in the price of whiskey and beer. I think a statement from the Minister should be made to clarify the position not alone in Dublin but in the City of Limerick where a statement was made by Fine Gael representatives. I have here a statement from a publican in which it is stated: &ldquo;We have been asked for subscriptions by Fine Gael representatives&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a statement given to me and if anyone wants it on affidavit I will furnish it.  The statement goes on: &ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;and assured that the price of whiskey and stout will be definitely increased before September 15th.&rdquo;  How can anyone make that statement?  Personally, I do not believe that the decision has been arrived at by the Government, the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Industry and Commerce that by September 15th the price of whiskey and stout will be allowed to be increased. These canvassers are irresponsible and now that the matter has been brought to the notice of the Minister he should categorically state whether or not a decision has been arrived at.  I have no hesitation in saying that I am convinced that this fictitious date of September 15th is picked out solely to induce support for the Fine Gael Party in the coming elections.  How long can they continue to mislead these people?  I am not going to go into the merits or demerits of increasing or decreasing the price, but I say that apart from the City of Dublin we heard in Limerick City promises that the price of whiskey and stout would be increased before September 15th of this year.  I hope that when the Minister is replying he will make a statement on that.</P>

I would ask the Minister, in view of the statements made both inside and outside the House, whether or not the Government intends to increase the price of beer and whiskey in the near future? We could, of course, ask a parliamentary question.  That is a simple question and it is the only one I ask.</P>

I am sure the Minister for Finance would have reduced taxation but the he found that those rates of taxation were absolutely necessary in order to pay for the liabilities of the nation in this particular year.  It is true, I am sure, even though the Minister for Finance will dispute the amount which the licensed trade in Dublin did subscribe to the Fine Gael funds during the last general election.

      <P>And also votes and influence. Before the General Election of 1954, a great number of these respectable citizens in the licensed trade in Dublin were telling all their customers that but for the rack-renting and tax-renting Fianna Fáil Government they would be getting their bottle of stout, the pint or a half of whiskey at a price less than they were then paying.  The self-same publicans to-day are telling their customers that they are not paying sufficient for the services which they are rendering to them because of what it is costing them to run their licensed premises, to pay their assistants and meet other charges.  Consequently, they are asking the Government for permission to increase the price of whiskey and of other spirits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1943" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>In effect, they are asking the public to pay more for the services they are giving, for the whiskey they get out of bond and for the bottle of stout which they serve to their customers. There is no doubt, I think, that in time, as a result of the pressure they will put on and of the figures which they will be able to show to the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry and Commerce, they probably will succeed in being able to get an increased amount for their spirits, beer and everything else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the debate on the 1952 Budget, when there was an outcry from the Deputies who then sat on this side of the House, the Fine Gael and Labour Parties, against the taxes which the then Fianna Fáil Government put on spirits, I remember saying here that the Government of the day have the right to determine the rates of taxation <Col N="1430" /> in respect of any commodity.  I concede the same right to this Government. They have an absolute right to determine what rates of taxation should be in force on any commodity, and no outside influence has any right to prevent that Government from determining what the rates of taxation should be, but at the same time, if it can be shown by sections of the commercial community that the rates of taxation operating against them are severaly injuring and damaging their interests and preventing them from getting a fair livelihood, I think they are entitled to consideration as an important section of the community.  I will admit that no Government have the right to so penalise any section of the community by the rates of taxation which they impose on any commodities which that section of the community may be handling as to put them out of business or seriously damage their interests.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the Minister for Finance will agree that the present rates of taxation on spirits are injuring the licensed trade.  Far be it from me as I have often said in this House to dislike the licensed trade.  I have no dislike in the world to them because I believe they are entitled to a livelihood the same as any other section of the community.  I do want, however, to refer to the hypocrisy of the present Government and the Leader of the Labour Party in promising the people 12 months ago during the general election that if they had the power to do so they would ease the burden of taxation on the licensed trade.  That, however, has not been done under the Budget of this Government and it is not a Fianna Fáil Budget.</P>

      <P>We will lose them again whenever we are the Government of this country because when a Fianna Fáil Government decides in its wisdom and judgment that certain rates of taxation are necessary they will impose them, and that is what this Government is doing to-day.  The Minister for Finance has been asked a dozen times already this morning to answer the question with a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo;: whether the Government have decided to allow an increase in the price of beer and spirits in the immediate future.  I would love to argue and hear it argued whether there should be any fixed price on beer and spirits.  Both are in full supply in the country, and to a certain extent are luxury commodities. They are not an absolute necessity, like bread.  It is questionable whether there should be any fixed price on them.  Why not let the trade handle them as, for example, farmers are allowed to handle the sale of their produce, and charge such prices for them as the community, who are the best judges, are prepared to pay.  That might be the simplest way out of this. Nevertheless, we want this Government to vote against the promises which they made during the last general election.  As far as I know, the Ceann Comhairle has not the right under the Constitution to impeach a Government for not carrying out the promises it had made during the election campaign.</P>

      <P>This is 1955 and I suggest that the ordinary people of the community are entitled to expect at least honesty from their public representatives. When political parties seek the people's support for their policy put forward at a general election, they should honour the guarantees they gave when they become the Government of this country and have the power to do so.  This Government are not honouring the promise they made to reduce the price of spirits.  In all honesty and decency the Minister for Finance should answer the questions that have been asked: Have the Government decided to allow the price of beer and spirits to be increased when the local elections are over or in the immediate future?  Or, are they prepared to grant any concessions to the licensed trade?  Is the Minister satisfied that the licensed trade is carrying an undue burden?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think those are fair questions.  The Minister has ways and means of finding out what the revenue is and what is the general income of the licensed trade. If he believes there is an undue burden because of this taxation, it is only right <Col N="1433" /> and fair that he should honour the promises made by himself and his colleagues 12 months ago when they were seeking the suffrages of the people and when Deputy Norton, the Leader of the Labour Party, was sending a special circular, signed William Norton, T.D., a prospective candidate for Kildare, and asking for the support of the licensed trade in County Kildare, so that he might come to Dáil Éireann with a mandate from the people of Kildare and ask on behalf of the licensed trade in Kildare to have the duties on beer and spirits reduced.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1434" /> Deputy Norton, I see, is absent.  He may have good reason for being absent to-day, but his colleague, Deputy O'Leary, has sat here since 10.30 this morning and if he had been briefed by Deputy Norton, we would be delighted to see Deputy O'Leary stand up and say on behalf of Deputy Norton: &ldquo;We give this undertaking.  We will not remain in this Government more than a week&mdash;or a month, as the case may be &mdash;unless they reduce the taxation on spirits.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>(1)  The duty of customs imposed by Section 20 of the Finance Act, 1932 (No. 20 of 1932), shall in respect of tobacco imported on or after the 1st day of July, 1955, be charged, levied and paid at the several rates specified in Part I of the Fourth Schedule to this Act.</P>
      <P>(2)  The duty of excise imposed by Section 19 of the Finance Act, 1934; (No. 31 of 1934), shall, be charged, the 1st day of July, 1955, be charged, levied and paid at the several rates specified in Part II of the Fourth Schedule to this Act.</P>
      <P>(3)  Sub-sections (3) to (5) of Section 19 of the Finance Act, 1934, shall apply to tobacco which is chargeable with the duty of excise imposed by sub-section (1) of the section at a rate specified in Part II of the Fourth Schedule to this Act and for the purpose of such application references in the said sub-section (3) to (5) of the said Section 19 to Part I of the Sixth Schedule to the said Finance Act, 1934, shall be construced and have effect as references to Part II of the Fourth Schedule to this Act.</P>
      <P>(4)  The rebate on hard-pressed tobacco mentioned in sub-section (2) of Section 17 of the Finance Act, 1940 (No. 14 of 1940), shall, in respect of any such tobacco sold and sent out for use within the State by any licensed manufacturer on or after the 1st day of July, 1955, be at the rate of 2/8 per lb.</P>
      <P>(5)  For the purpose of this section, importation shall be deemed to take place at the time when the entry of the relevant goods under the Customs Consolidation Act, 1876, is delivered.</P>
      <P>As the Government did not accept the motions to reduce the duties on beer and spirits, I do not suppose they will be very enthusiastic about reducing the duties on tobacco, so I think we can let this go to a vote without any further discussion.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 12, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I sent the Minister notice of a question I proposed to ask to-day in connection with this section and I think the Minister has had some difficulty in understanding exactly what I was asking about.  I may say that I have had equal difficulty in trying to understand Section 12.  The question I have to put to the Minister is (a) does Section 12 affect the estate duty payable on the death of the insured on policies of £10,000 or over, where a whole life policy under the provisions of the Married Women's Property Act, 1882, has already been taken out by a father on his own life for the absolute benefit of his children who are minors, irrespective of whether they be living or not, on the happening of the event when the sum insured comes payable and where a bank, trustees for the minors, the children, was appointed and named on the face of the policy when originally taken out prior to the introduction of this Bill and (b) does the Bill conceal that it curtails, in effect, the rights and privileges given to women and children under the Married Women's Property Act, 1882?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a rather technical matter, I suppose, and what I really wish the Minister to answer is: does the section in any way endanger the persons who are beneficiaries?  This is not a <Col N="1439" /> case of a trustee arrangement; it is an out and out settlement.  The father of the family takes out a policy in the names of certain beneficiaries, but does not act as a trustee.  A bank or other independent person may be appointed as trustees for the beneficiaries. What I want to know is, does this in any way suggest that where large sums are involved, and where these transactions have been brought about, in the ultimate interpretation of Section 12 the sums that would accrue would in any way be calculated as part of the estate for estate duty?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Of the father's estate. In other words, are these hitherto undisturbed beneficiaries now to be interfered with by this section?  I understand the Minister's attitude about my question.  I suppose it is so peculiarly written that it is difficult for him and his officers to try and interpret it.  Perhaps he will interpret for me Section 12 or answer the question as to the fears I have suggested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>On the section.  I should like to suggest that the Minister might consider bringing in a certain modification of Section 12.  As I understand the section, its effect will be that all policies of insurance will be aggregated together with the general estate of the deceased and the appropriate rate of duty will be applicable and will be borne by the beneficiaries of such policies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Britain last year I understand a similar section was proposed and that it was somewhat modified in Committee. I suggest that we could easily follow the British example in this regard. The policy which was adopted was I think, what was referred to as a &ldquo;ringed fence policy.&rdquo;  It was suggested and, in fact, carried that all policies of insurance would be aggregated in respect of each individual beneficiary and, as it were, a ringed fence would be put around that particular beneficiary and the appropriate rate of duty applicable on those policies would be paid by him.  If the deceased left various policies of insurance <Col N="1440" /> to various beneficiaries then each of these beneficiaries would have, as it were, a ringed fence put around the particular estate to which he or she was entitled under the various policies of insurance.</P>
    <P>I suggest the Minister might consider giving some relief to the family beneficiaries of a deceased person.  I think it is generally agreed that savings by insurance policies is a desirable method of saving to be encouraged.  As this section stands, it may have some deterring effect on such savings: it may not be very great but, on the other hand, it might.  I also think that the necessity for this section is probably not as great as it was in Britain and that the loss to the Exchequer by reason of amending this section slightly would not be very great.  I would ask the Minister to consider reducing somewhat the burden of this section by allowing all policies in respect of one beneficiary to be treated separately from the general estate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal first with the point made by Deputy Costello. The position in Britain is exactly as he has suggested but I think that what is suitable for them, with their rather larger and wider implications, would not necessarily be, and in fact is not, suitable for us with our much smaller ambit here.</P>
      <P>Another point that arose was that in Britain the insurance companies themselves took voluntary steps to curb the evasion of duty.  It may have been because there was such an arrangement in existence between the life officers concerned across the water that they adopted a slightly different method.  I am afraid that we are smaller here and that the effect would be quite substantial on our revenue if it were dealt with in the way in which Deputy Costello has suggested.  I may say that I examined this matter with some care before I decided on the type of method I would use to stop the evasion.  I am afraid, therefore, I could not alter the section of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe raised two points. He was courteous enough to give me notice of them.  I am afraid I found a little difficulty in understanding his questions just as I found a little difficulty <Col N="1441" /> in understanding the point he has put to-day.  Perhaps I might meet the situation by explaining very briefly what the section does mean and then the Deputy can consider it.</P>
    <P>Under the Married Women's Property Act, if a husband pays money for the benefit of a wife or child there is a presumption in law that he intended it to be a gift and that it was not intended in any way as a sum which should be repaid.  Exactly the same effect can be achieved if anybody gives it to somebody other than a wife or child&mdash;I am not talking now at all of insurance policies but of any property&mdash;but, in that respect, they must execute a deed of gift or there is a presumption of it.  This section does not in any way change the general law in relation to the Married Women's Property Act or the ordinary deed of gift.  There is no change whatsoever.</P>
    <P>So far as the second part of Deputy Briscoe's question is concerned the answer is clearly &ldquo;No.&rdquo;  That portion of his query I quite understand.  There is no change whatsoever in the general law by which a husband providing funds for a wife or child is deemed to have given them as a gift and they cannot go into the husband's free estate. What this section does, however, deal with is an entirely different position. If a person takes out a policy on his own life but not in favour of himself &mdash;in favour of someone else&mdash;then, on his death, because he has no interest in the policy, the policy is not treated as part of his free estate.  The policy moneys that arise on his death, and in respect of which he has no interest, are treated as an estate by themselves and being treated as an estate by themselves means that the property that is an estate by itself is considered only for the purpose of deciding on the rate of estate duty that is payable in respect of that property.  The Deputy is probably aware that rates of estate duty vary according to the total value of an estate that comes for assessment.  Therefore, if a person leaves a bigger estate he pays a higher rate of duty.</P>
    <P>A policy in respect of which the deceased person had no interest is not aggregated with the other free estate <Col N="1442" /> of the deceased for the determination of the rate.  If, for example, a person had free estate valued £10,000 and took out a policy in favour of his wife for £10,000&mdash;a whole life policy on his own life&mdash;then, when he died, the estate duty would be assessed on his free estate at the rate applicable to £10,000 and on the insurance policy as a separate estate valued for £10,000&mdash; not on £20,000 applicable to the whole. That is the case of a single policy.  This section does not change the position at all in respect of a single policy.  What was inclined to happen was this. People were taking out, not a single policy for £10,000 but ten policies of £1,000 each, separate documents.  The total premium was exactly the same, but the ten policies each for £1,000 were not liable for duty at the rate applicable to £10,000.  Each of them had to be considered as an estate in itself and there were ten separate estates, each ranking for consideration at the duty rate of £1,000.  What we provide for in this section is that if a man takes out ten separate policies now, that will be treated exactly the same as if he took out one for the £10,000.</P>
    <P>There is another provision, that where a person takes out whole life policies on his own life and in which he has no interest at the date of his death, they will be all taken together as one separate estate.  He will not be able legally to avoid liability by splitting up his policy into small denominations in order that they may be under the limit in respect of which estate duty is not charged at all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite follow the case made as far as it concerns an individual who may become a beneficiary in this way.  What happens, however, to a father who leaves a policy to his wife and two separate policies for his two children?  Does the Minister mean what he said, that notwithstanding the beneficiaries being different people the aggregate of all of the policies will be treated as one?</P>

      <P>The Minister is trying to correct an abuse that has grown up as a result of avoidance of taxation generally, whether in this case or in others.  I am trying to put it to the Minister that, in trying to correct that abuse, he should not hurt individuals who are beneficiaries as a result of an honest effort and where the question of evasion is not the uppermost thought.  An individual may have taken out ten policies each for £1,000. I could not understand just the sense of an individual taking out ten separate policies in that way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>That is to say, one individual would be inheriting ten different sums amounting to £10,000, if they were £1,000 each and therefore the duty would be payable on that. What I am asking the Minister to avoid is inflicting hardship in a case where a parent leaves seven children and makes provision for each one separately.  They are separate entities. The Minister is going to add them together and combine the total of all those seven beneficiaries.  They are all going to pay at the rate as if they had inherited seven times what was in fact made available for them.  I think that is unfair.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>He would not leave seven farms.  I am talking about a case where he has made provision, as the Minister pointed out, by absolute gift, not something that he was in possession of at the moment he died.  I am talking of what he parted himself from years before his own departure. Assume that a man leaves six children and a widow and by this method of insurance policy they each become the possessors of £10,000.  At present each of them would pay the inheritance duty applicable to the £10,000.  What the Minister is doing now is that the seven amounts will be added together and each of them will pay, on his own £10,000, the rate as if he had become possessed of seven times the amount, £70,000&mdash;which is, of course, a much higher rate.  That is the point I am questioning and that is what I think is not reasonable.</P>
      <P>I do not think it is fair, because as people grow older and as children grow up they may become married and have their own families and their own commitments, separate from each other. Yet you are going to bulk them together in this case for the purpose of taking from each of them the surplus or increase over and above that which they would have to pay on the other basis.  I think the Minister ought to consider this particular item again. This is going to cause hardship in many cases and it is going to be unfair. I do not think it should be dealt with in the way the Minister proposes now and I would like to hear him suggest something further in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>In fact, it transpires now that what Deputy Briscoe is saying in a more involved way is what Deputy Declan Costello was saying previously.  Deputy Briscoe surely is not going to ask me to agree with him that a person who has £70,000 worth of life insurance, split up between seven different people in the way suggested, is a person to whom we should try to make concessions?  I suggest that the very case the Deputy took showed clearly that this was an evasion&mdash;a <Col N="1445" /> legal evasion, I agree, but an evasion by the big type of person.  Deputy MacEntee will undoubtedly bear out for Deputy Briscoe, if he has any doubt about it, that the sum of £70,000 here in Ireland is indeed a very large slice of the average estate that would be left.  Deputy Briscoe may not appreciate that up to £2,000 there will be no liability at all.</P>
      <P>What was happening was that people were taking out enormous numbers of these policies for the purpose of legally &mdash;perfectly legally&mdash;avoiding payment of any death duties in respect of those policies, on the money they left in that way at their death.  I do not think that is a situation which any member of the House could stand over, having regard to the fact that other people, with their own small free estates of £5,000 and £6,000, were made liable to pay.  I do not think it would be reasonable at all. It would create a very anomalous position if a person with a free estate of £5,000 were liable for the payment of duty in an easier way as compared with the person who had an estate consisting of life policies amongst his family, as Deputy Briscoe suggested.  I think the whole effect of doing what Deputy Briscoe suggests would be to assist the large man and penalise the small man.</P>

      <P>I am afraid the Minister does not follow me.  I am not trying to argue in favour of the person who is endeavouring to save something from the State for his family by purely evasive measures.  There is another person to be considered other than the evasive gentleman; there is the individual who does not possess a very large amount of liquid anything.  He is a provident man and he decides that in the course of his lifetime he will not be able to accumulate or amass a fortune to bequeath to his next-of-kin and he decides out of his income to take out policies for the benefit of his wife and his children if he dies.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>We have reached the stage now, and I am sure the Minister knows this, where one can only go to <Col N="1446" /> a certain limit in endowment policies. The rate is much higher than that for the ordinary straight life policy, and the premiums in relation to the amount that will ultimately accrue are also considerable. If an individual takes out an endowment policy he takes it out for himself.  As a young man of 20 or 30 years of age he deems it prudent to take out an endowment policy which will mature when he is 65 and he will have this lump sum, with or without profits.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>For whatever purpose he wants it.  That policy is part of his own estate and has not been deeded by him irrevocably to anybody else.  I am talking about the person who cannot see any possibility of making adequate provision out of endowment policies or other assets and who decides that he will take out a policy in his son's or his daughter's name; he pays out of his earnings so much every month and, in the event of his death, that son or daughter will be provided for.  Now, I am not saying that he should not pay the estate duty appropriate, but I am objecting to the Minister coming to the House now and saying: &ldquo;Hitherto the individual who inherited that amount of money paid the appropriate estate duty; now, if that child has a brother or sister, or four or five brothers and sisters, and they are all treated in the same way by the deceased parent, the total amount will be added and each beneficiary will have to pay on the result of that addition.&rdquo; I think that is unfair, and I am asking the Minister not to proceed along that particular line.</P>

      <P>Is not the case the Deputy makes perfectly obvious on the Deputy's own case?  The individual decides how much he can afford to pay out of his income in insurance premiums. We will say he can afford to pay £100 a year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but I am taking that figure for the sake of argument. <Col N="1447" /> He decides how much he can afford to pay and, having decided, is he not only breaking it up into certain entities for the sole purpose of evasion?  If it is £100 a year he will break it up into five policies of £20 premium each purely for the purpose of avoiding duty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to reconsider this.  I know how anxious Ministers for Finance, despite their general public reputation, are that the incidence of taxation, or the brunt of liability, should fall upon every person with a certain degree of equity.  Therefore, when there is a man, perhaps a little bit more intelligent and better advised than his fellows, who can find a way out of the net&mdash;I confess quite frankly that I myself liked to get after that fellow in the same way as a greyhound, I suppose, likes to get after a hare or a gamekeeper after a poacher.  But we have got to guard ourselves against that and we have got to have some consideration for the taxpayer.</P>
      <P>I think this net is cast far too wide because it may catch some people whom the Minister does not intend to catch and with whom the Minister would actually have a great deal of sympathy.  I will not say whether or not he intends to catch them, but take the case of a husband who is depending on a son to carry on his business and to provide for other members of the family after his death.  Take the case of a man who marries a second time, perhaps with a fairly long interval between the death of his first wife and his remarriage: he may have a young family by the second marriage and it may be that he will intend to put the onus of carrying on the business and making provision for these young dependents upon his eldest son by his first marriage.  He may do that by insuring his own life and making full and adequate provision by the payment of a heavy premium.  But supposing he decides that the son will carry on and he decides to insure him for a substantial sum carrying a reasonably small premium.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a case in which an insurance is taken out and the property <Col N="1448" /> passes after death.  The policy had been taken out by the father in the son's name, but the son could not benefit by his own death.  He was not paying the premium.  He had absolutely to right or title to the policy. The policy had been taken out by the father.  That may have been a long-sighted policy but there are prudent people who like to provide even against fairly remote contingencies. That would not necessarily be an evasion. The father would decide that the business would do very well if the boy was there to carry on after the father's death; but the boy may not be there to carry on.  The boy may predecease him.  The husband ensures that if anything happens to him his wife, the boy's stepmother, will have at least so much either to employ a manager competent to carry on the business or have a capital sum from which she can derive some income. That is a case which might arise under this section and I appeal to the Minister to consider the matter from that aspect.</P>

      <P>But there may be separate policies.  After all, we do know that by negotiation you can get <Col N="1449" /> better terms from one company than another.  You may still be taking a policy out with the first company and then, when you think you have got all you can get out of them, you start negotiating with another company and in this way a good business man, an intelligent business man, a person who knows how to make the best of his opportunities will naturally try to get the best value he can.

      <P>Not on their lives but on his life.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;...or moneys received under such a policy, or interests in such a policy or moneys, all the policies, moneys and interests so included (except any in respect of which estate duty neither is payable on the death nor would be if the duty were payable on estates of however small a principal value) shall, for determining the rate of estate duty to be payable thereon, be aggregated so as to form one estate, and the duty shall be levied at the proper graduated rate on the principal value thereof.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a section which can be criticised from different points of view and I am criticising it from the point of view of the fact that while it is desirable to stop evasion, if it is widespread, we must at the same time have regard to human circumstances and to certain principles and that on the whole I think the public interest is not served when dealing severely or too rigorously with cases such as I have mentioned.  That is the only point I am making.  As I say, perhaps if I had been over there and the matter had been put up to me I might have been bringing this in.  I do not think I would.  I have very often turned things down on the ground that taking them by and large the general public interest of the community would not be served.</P>
      <P>So far as I heard, the Minister has based his case for this section entirely on the ground that there are people who have large fortunes, great incomes, and who, because they want to protect those after their death, have availed themselves of this method which has been perfectly legitimate up to now, and he wants to ensure that estate duties will not be evaded.  In that connection, we must remember that when the estate duties were first introduced they were levied at a comparatively low figure and rates of taxation were not oppressive and not exorbitant.  But now we have passed that line and, in my opinion, they are.</P>

      <P>Three possible sites for a new school have been inspected.  A site offered by the reverend manager in 1949 was inspected in November of that year and was found to be unsuitable, as it was low-lying, its area was too small and it was badly situated.</P>
      <P>A second site was inspected in March, 1950.  This site was regarded as suitable.  As, however, it appeared that the procedure in connection with the production of evidence of title to that site would be most complicated and protracted and that the cost of acquisition might be prohibitive, a third possible site was inspected in May, 1953.  Although it was far from ideal the Department was prepared to accept it as a last resort, in view of the history of the case and of the urgent need for a new school.  Difficulties, however, arose also in connection with the acquisition of the third site.</P>
      <P>As local opinion did not favour the third site the reverend manager, through his solicitors, has reopened negotiations for the acquisition of the second site.</P>
      <P>As I mentioned in my reply to the Deputy's previous question on 2nd June, 1955, there are legal problems of a somewhat complicated character to be resolved, but I am glad to say that progress is being made and I am hopeful that the stage will be reached before long at which it will be possible to arrange for the production of satisfactory evidence of title to the site.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBrady" hpid="Mr. Brady Mr. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary be able to disclose the particular sites that are referred to by date?  It is very hard to make a checkup on the different sites referred to. Would it be that the site that is now spoken of as being suitable is the stud farm about which there have been legal difficulties?  I understand that a local committee was set up some time ago and that they discovered a site convenient to the present school and that <Col N="1454" /> it was quite suitable according to the report of the inspectors.  Furthermore, it would seem from the Parliamentary Secretary's reply that it was that site that was referred to because he states that the amount of ground available was not sufficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>That was in relation to the first site.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrady" hpid="Mr. Brady Mr. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Parliamentary Secretary is talking about that particular site, I understand that a further amount of land was offered.  What I want to get at is that the local opinion is that a suitable site was discovered by the local people themselves, and if the Parliamentary Secretary's advice is that this land was not sufficient, a further amount of land is available at the same site.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>The position actually is that the first site which was offered by the reverend manager had not a sufficient area in it to be suitable and satisfactory.  That was not the third site.  The objection to the third site is one which perhaps it would be as well not to mention.  Similarly, I would like to say that I would not like to indicate which of these two sites is which.  There is no difficulty as regards acreage about either the second or third site.  The difficulty about area was in relation to the site which the manager was so good as to offer near the present school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrady" hpid="Mr. Brady Mr. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that the site that the Parliamentary Secretary says there was some difficulty about ultimately?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, Sir.  The site near the present school was held by the Department to be inadequate in size.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrady" hpid="Mr. Brady Mr. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the very point.  My information is that the amount of land offered on that site originally was too small and that the present owner of that land, when approached by the local people, said she was quite willing to give a further amount of land which would make it quite suitable.  That is what I want to try and clear.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister's reply mean that he intends to go ahead with the expenditure of £8,000 on the place at Corr Áit and that, when he has completed that work, he will then consider repairs to the main job on the island, namely, the pier?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.  The delay has been caused by reason of the fact that I am not yet satisfied that the alternative landing place improvement, mentioned by the Deputy, is a work that should be undertaken out of the National Development Fund as an alternative to the Corr Áit proposal originally put forward.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not.  The Minister has a completely open mind until he is convinced otherwise.  The Deputy, when Parliamentary Secretary, received a report from his advisers advising that Corr Áit would be a much better position than the new pier.  Other advisers advised the very opposite, that the new pier would be the better proposal instead of Corr Áit.  I have got to satisfy myself as to which of these proposals is the better and it is for that reason that I have not taken a decision.</P>

      <P>Could the Minister say, roughly, the amount of death duties payable on estates as they rise from the lower figures to fairly high figures? That is the first question.  The second is whether the Minister would contradict me when I say it is possible to take out on a young man in perfect health a straight life policy at a very low annual premium?  When we talk of the sum for which a person is insured as being a very high figure, it does not necessarily follow that the annual premium need be a very high figure.</P>

      <P>Take the case of a young man.  If an insurance company's doctors and actuaries advise that he can be expected to have a long life, the annual premium on such a straight life policy can be low.  I am thinking of a young man with no possible chance, unless he wins a sweepstake prize, of accumulating what might be called a very large estate which would leave his family provided for in the event of his death.  I say that where that man takes out a policy for each of his children when they are born&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>On his own life, and making provision for each child in the event of his death.  If he has say five children and has taken out a policy for £2,000 for the benefit of each of those children&mdash;the policy is a straight life one on his own life and the premium payments are made from his income&mdash; I say, that if the Minister accepts this, he is doing a most unfair thing to these young people.  Instead of each of them paying as individuals, he is grouping them together for the purpose of extracting an added contribution for the Exchequer.  The Minister should realise that in that case each of the children becomes a beneficiary of a sum that is now to be taxable.</P>
      <P>The Minister and the Attorney-General said that I had made a <i>faux pas.</i>  The Attorney-General made the biggest <i>faux pas</i> of all.  The Minister said that an estate of £2,000 pays nothing, but if you have five estates of £2,000 each you get a total of £10,000, so that those people who never paid anything will now have to pay.  I do not think the Minister intended that to be the case, nor do I think he realises, if this section becomes operative in its present form, the degree of hardship that is going to fall on innocent people whom he himself never intended should be caught by it.  An estate exceeding £2,000 and not exceeding £3,000 pays 1 per cent; an estate exceeding £10,000 pays 6 per cent.; an estate of £20,000 pays 14 per cent., and an estate of £50,000 pays 30 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Take the case of the beneficiary that I am contemplating here.  If the parent dies and a life policy becomes mature for payment, the child who is getting £2,000 does not, under the existing law, pay any estate duty.  If, however, the Minister's proposal in Section 12 becomes part of our law and is enforceable by the Revenue Commissioners, and if there are six children in a family each getting £2,000, the Minister is now bulking the £2,000 for each child together as if each had inherited the whole lot.  I say that is unfair.  I do not think that is the Minister's intention, because he says that he wants to give relief in estate duty payments to lower income people.</P>
      <P>Take the case of a man who has a reasonably good income.  He is in, if you like, a hazardous occupation.  He may be a pilot in a big airway company and has a big salary because of the hazardous nature of his occupation. He is insured separately himself.  He can take out a straight life policy at a very low rate because of his income. He may be able to provide his wife and children with a policy for more than £2,000 for each.  It may be £10,000 each, the aggregate sum being £50,000.</P>

      <P>I have said that he is separately insured against death by accident because of the nature of his occupation.  The policies that I am referring to are straight death policies. That type of policy, against death from natural causes, is comparatively cheap. It is possible for him to make this provision because he has no other means of making provision to leave his family anything if he dies a natural death.  He cannot bequeath the aeroplane he flies in to his family because it is not his.</P>
      <P>I am pressing the Minister to tell the House that he will reconsider this and that he will be prepared to consider it from the point of view of coming to the House again on the next stage and saying: &ldquo;There is this situation.  It does need some special treatment.  I think the House ought to agree that where persons have for a great number of years made this provision, are already committed to it have reckoned what will happen to their families if they die, and this now catches them up&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have personal knowledge&mdash;that is why I am so concerned in this regard&mdash;of a man who had a delicate daughter, a daughter who was not fully developed mentally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1468" /> He was always anxious about this child and he made provision, as he thought, to bring in sufficient money to keep her for the rest of her life by investing £10,000 in what were then known as 5 per cent.  Victory loan issued by the British Government.  He died feeling he had made adequate provision for that child in the circumstances he had arranged for her.  What happened? The British Government called in the 5 per cent.  Victory loan and the only alternative that could be got for the money was a 3½ per cent. stock, with the result that the long-term provision made for that poor unfortunate child had to be altered.  She had to be removed from the institution she was in to a less costly one.</P>
    <P>Was that evasive action on the part of that parent?  Surely there are many other parents, whether their children are normally healthy or not, who want to make provision for them.  Deputy Barry does not seem to understand.  I do not know whether Deputy Barry is a married man and has a young family or not, but I am sure if he has, he has often thought of the future welfare of his next-of-kin when his time comes, as I have often thought when my time comes.  Therefore, I am thinking of that type of person, the person who has made these arrangements in the past.  Not all of them have done it for evasive purposes.  Some may have. You will always have that, but, as Deputy MacEntee asks, why hit the person who has done it out of pure motives because there are others who have done it out of impure motives.</P>

      <P>No.  I have only given that as an example because that is what the Minister has in mind.  The Minister is not concerned about a single child or the widow of a deceased person.  He is concerned about the whole group.  He has grouped them together from the point of view of being able to extract estate duty from them together which he cannot do separately.  I take it that soon the Minister will, if he goes along this line, take a firm with, say, five brothers&mdash; let us keep to the figure five&mdash;who are directors in a concern which they own jointly, each with £1,400 a year, which is below the surtax line, and the Minister will say: &ldquo;I am going to join these all together.  The total income of the five of them is £7,000 so that they will have to pay surtax between them&rdquo;.  It is the same principle.</P>

      <P>I am glad Deputy Barry is throwing these points across <Col N="1470" /> because he is helping me to make clearer than apparently I was making, the case I am putting forward.  Is the Minister satisfied that this is what he understood from this particular section? Does he not agree with me that it can cause unfair hardship?  I do not wish to take-up the time of the House arguing this until 5 o'clock, but will the Minister say to me now: &ldquo;I am accepting what the Deputy says as referring to people other than those who are out for purely evasive purposes.  I will look into it and if there is anything in what he says I will see what can be done.&rdquo;  I am not asking the Minister to promise now to do anything, but if he says that I will be quite satisfied.  If he will not do that I must pursue the argument because I believe the situation is unfair.  I am sure Deputy O'Higgins will agree with me that it is unfair.  Deputy Costello had a point of view which was almost in line with what I am trying to express. They had this in England and it was abandoned, but the Minister says it was abandoned there because they could afford to do it in the light of their large resources in this direction, but it will not be abandoned here because our resources are so slender.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>That was not quite what I said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I understood the Minister to mean.  Perhaps the Minister will tell us what he did say and how far I am wrong.  I understood him to say that it was easier for them to abandon it over there because of their resources in relation to huge estates compared with the small ones here.  I think the Minister said that a £70,000 estate here is a large estate. However, I am not concerned with the question of the comparison of a large or a small estate here, in England or in America.  I am concerned with what is right and what is wrong.  I believe the committee that dealt with this in Britain abandoned it because they recognised it was wrong in principle, that it was unfair and that you are making out of individual citizens groups of citizens whom you are going to tax as a group as distinct from individuals. <Col N="1471" /> It is a completely new principle and should not be allowed to be introduced here.  Will the Minister tell me that he will examine the provision and see does it require some saving words and, in addition, will he say if he thinks it is fair to make this retrospective by having it applied now to transactions which have been completed maybe ten, 15 and 20 years ago and up to this were free from this particular method of getting extra money from an estate of a deceased person?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal first with the last point that Deputy Briscoe raised about retrospection.  The position has always been that in respect of death duties the operative date has been the death of the person.  That has always been the practice right down through the years.  If it was desired to change the rate of estate duty at any time the change would have to be framed so that it would affect deaths of people who were born on and after the date of the passing of the Act.  Obviously it might not come into effect for 60 or 70 years and it would be quite nonsensical from the point of view of legislation, and from the point of view of administration it would be utterly hopeless to have different rates running at the same time for people who were born at different times.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister now talking as a poacher or a gamekeeper?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking as both poacher and gamekeeper on this occasion.  To have that type of duty imposed would be quite ludicrous and that is, in fact, what the Deputy, in his last few sentences, was asking me to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking about a contract as distinct from a death.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>That has been recognised all down the years and every Act that was passed has provided that the date of death was the operative date and as long as it did not create a different situation after the date of death, it was not retrospective. The Deputy has in front of <Col N="1472" /> him, I think, the statutes of 1951. There was some amelioration of the rates of estate duty in cases that became operative there in respect of deaths after that date, and has exactly the same principle as this section as regards its date of operation.</P>
      <P>Deputy MacEntee dealt with the matter in another way.  He will not misunderstand me, I hope, when I say this is an extremely technical matter and that what I think Deputy MacEntee did was to rush in and try to assist his colleague Deputy Briscoe without fully understanding the implications of what he was suggesting. The effect of the suggestion that was made by Deputy MacEntee would be simply this.  As far as I am concerned, if I were back in the position of poacher, so to speak, I would be able to ensure that nobody would ever pay any death duties at all in respect of any personal estate, much less policies. You would be able to do it that way because it would, in effect, mean you could take out not a genuine policy at all but a succession of lump sum policies that you could distribute amongst your family.  Let us take a person with an estate of £100,000. Instead of annual premiums he could pay lump sum premiums of £2,000 each on 50 policies, operative from the date of death.  Instead of paying an annual premium he could pay a lump sum and that whole £100,000 would be free of death duty.  The effect of Deputy MacEntee's suggestion would be that the whole estate would escape from liability to death duty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>It is one possible way of dealing with it if that is the policy you want to operate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that is the fair way to operate the provisions we want to legislate.  I do not see any difference, except the purpose of avoiding death duties, between the man who takes out a policy on his own life for £10,000 and by his will be-queathes <Col N="1473" /> the proceeds of that policy between his five children, on the one hand, and the man who, on the other hand, decides that he will take out five separate policies and allot them to each of his children <i>ab initio.</i>  I do not see that the one person should be treated differently from the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see any reason why they should be treated in a different fashion from the death duty point of view.  I think socially the principle of insurance is very wise and the principle of insurance is adequately covered and assisted by the State reliefs that there are in respect of life insurance premiums.  But I can see no difference whatever between the principle of the person taking out one policy on his own life and the other person taking out separate policies in the way I have suggested, except that such people want to avoid having to pay any duty.  If people can legally avoid paying duty naturally they will try to do so, and equally when the State feels the avoidance is disturbing the equity between one taxpayer and another, the State will close that method.  That is what we are doing in this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>You have not proved your contention that it is disturbing the equity in such a broad and general way that it is necessary to do this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy MacEntee thinks it is right that a person should so distribute his entire estate that he pays no duty, then it seems to me quite clear, as in the case of some other resolutions we were discussing, that the Deputy was not quite as active as he might have been in recent years.  I would be delighted to join issue with Deputy MacEntee on the case he made. I think his case is completely untenable and the only suggestion I can make is that he made it because it was a somewhat technical matter the implications of which he did not fully understand&mdash; that he did not understand what he was rushing into.  But if, having understood them, he still wants to rush in on that line, I am delighted to join issue with <Col N="1474" /> him on it because I think the suggestion that a plurality of separate policies should be treated in the same way as a single policy is so irresponsible that it will not under any circumstances bear examination.</P>
      <P>I do not think the Deputy realised the import of his suggestion.  He stated the case of a person who has his substance in his own house&mdash;may be a house valued at £3,000.  We will say the house is valued at £2,000.  If that man has another £2,000 which he has put into industry&mdash;let us take it that he has it in shares in an Irish company&mdash; he has £4,000.  Why should he have to pay duty on £4,000 when the person who wants to evade liability for duty by taking out separate policies gets away with it?  It does seem to be inequitable for one to have to pay and another not to have to pay.  It is quite clear to me that when Deputies Briscoe and MacEntee made these statements they had not looked into the matter. I understand the full implications of it. It was a matter on which I was invited to express an opinion long before I sat on this seat for the first time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy had a very short journey from one side of the House to another but in travelling he changes his own ideas so much he feels he is entitled to think that other people suffer the same metamorphosis. I think when the Deputy looks into this again he will realise his approach is entirely illogical and that he is merely proposing the case here in order to excuse the man trying to avoid payment of duty which the Oireachtas has decided he should pay. That is the issue.  It is a legal evasion which is being prevented for the future so that everybody may be treated in the same way on a fair basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had a most extraordinary confession from the Minister.  All I can say is that it recalls to my mind a statement of the late Dean Swift when he was talking about certain appointees to Irish Sees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1475" /> They started off as honourable gentlemen from London but on the journey they were waylaid by highwaymen and when they came over here they were robbers.  Apparently the journey from this side to the other resulted in a metamorphosis and the reverend gentlemen who left London became robbers before their arrival in their Irish Sees.  Having said that, I should like to say now that I do not think the Minister is fair to himself.  He said that he knew this evasion was taking place.  Here we have a Minister on this side of the House at that time and a most active member of the Opposition who did not disclose that this evasion was taking place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I never said that.  I said I knew this basis of law.  I did not say I knew these evasions were taking place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, very well.  There is no point in chopping an argument on that basis, but the Minister spoke here about evasions of the law and talked about people taking out insurance policies.  Are we permitting people to take out insurance policies in order that they might evade tax?  But is there not something those people can do in order to evade death duties, but which has been regarded as being the sort of thing you do not have to take public measures to prevent?</P>
      <P>If a person taking out an insurance policy on his life is in a position before he dies to assign by deed of gift, that gift might be made three years in advance of his death and he evades death duties on the gifts which he has made to his own children.  It may be that he can make these gifts some time before his death and that he is able to exercise a fair amount of control in the manner in which the gifts are dealt with and yet at the same time these gifts are not liable for death duty if they are made earlier than three years before the date of his death.  These insurance policies may have been taken out many years before the man died and the case the Minister made is that he knew of instances where the policies were taken out many years prior to death.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1476" /> I should like to come back to what I was saying before the debate adjourned.  I was saying that we were not discussing this in a partisan sort of way but that we were trying to bring out the pros and cons, the merits and demerits of the Bill.  I will put this question to the Minister.  Supposing a son takes out only a single insurance policy on the life of a parent or a wife on the life of a husband, will that be caught by the section?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>A single policy is not affected by the section, which deals with a plurality of policies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The section says: &ldquo;includes any policies of insurance on his life.&rdquo;  Now, surely if this section is going to affect only cases of plurality of policies, it is somewhat ambiguously worded.  I am not a draftsman but as I see the phrase I would conclude that it means one policy.  The Minister says it means a plurality of policies but I say that the wording of the section does not rule out the singular.  In order to make the position clear I would suggest that it should read: &ldquo;more than one policy of insurance.&rdquo; As worded here, it would suggest one policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The law at present governs the single policy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take it the Attorney-General's contention is correct that it may apply to one policy. Supposing you have a thrifty girl as many Irish girls are and she marries a nice chap who is all right in his own way but a bit of a harum-scarum and who is a bit free and open-handed with his money and she decided in quite a legitimate way that she would take out a policy upon his life.  I am talking about one policy at this stage.  She decided to take out a policy on his life and he agreed, saying: &ldquo;If you can get the money out of eggs or butter or the housekeeping money you are quite welcome to take out a policy on my life and make provision for yourself.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Time goes on and in a couple of years perhaps the housekeeping money goes up and she takes out another policy and so on until a stage comes where she has got a substantial number of <Col N="1477" /> policies upon her husband's life.  He dies, and, though he was a harum-scarum, he did not squander all his substance.  He lived up to his income, if you like, but there was a fair amount of capital passing on the date of his death.  Here is the estate of the deceased which he held in his own right, representing £20,000 or £30,000&mdash; it may not represent anything so big, but let us take that case&mdash;and here, on the other hand, is his wife who has paid the premiums over a considerable number of years on policies amounting to £5,000 or £6,000.  Under the section as it stands, this sum of £5,000 or £6,000, which does not belong to her husband and for one penny piece of which the husband has not accepted responsibility, is to be aggregated with the rest of the estate.</P>

      <P>There are various types of property.  There is what is known as free estate, that is to say, real estate or personal estate or chattelry estate, of which a person dies possessed and with which he can deal exactly as he likes.  That will include policies of insurance.</P>

      <P>In a marriage settlement, for example, settled property and free estate, will be aggregable. There is a separate form of property&mdash; property in which a deceased never had an interest.  That is the one we are discussing here, but that does not become aggregable with the free estate or settled estate.  It is treated as one estate, as an entity in itself, and what this section provides is that any policies in respect of which a deceased ever had an interest will be considered as one estate and the rate of duty applicable to this will be struck, and it will not be aggregated with anything else.</P>

As I see it, the position is this: a person will have real estate and settled estate.  These are completely outside the ambit of Section 12.  Am I right?</P>

      <P>Very well.  What is the position of these policies to which I have been referring where the deceased's widow has taken the policies out independently of the deceased and has been paying the premiums on these policies all the time?  Is she, when he dies, to be liable for estate duty on the aggregated value of these policies? Can the Minister answer that, because it might possibly ease our difficulties?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>Take the case of a person who ostensibly has received from her husband a regular pay.  She may have got it weekly, monthly or quarterly but, at any rate, it was given for the general expenses and upkeep of the household.  Take the case of the wife who has received from her husband a regular allowance to provide for housekeeping and other things. Out of this allowance, she has managed to put away a little bit every time, and has decided that, instead of putting that money in a savings bank in her own right or investing it in national loan or in an industrial undertaking, from her point of view, the thing which gives her the greatest possible assurance is to take out policies on her husband's life.  How does she stand then?</P>

      <P>It comes back to <Col N="1481" /> what sounds very simple, but is far from it.  It depends on what money it was.  In other words, it depends on whether there is a gift by the husband to the wife of that money, she to do what she likes with it, or whether the husband gives it to her on the basis: &ldquo;This is to pay what is due and you account to me.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Does it not show you that the section is bristling with difficulties?  Here we have an ordinary case of a man and his wife.  The man says: &ldquo;You know, I can allow you so much for the housekeeping, and so on. You do the best you can with it.  I assume that you will pay the grocer, the maid, and do a number of other things with the money such as clothing the children.  However, do the best you can.  I am not going to ask you to come along once a month and submit the housekeeping accounts to me for audit.&rdquo;  The wife may agree to that and think to herself: &ldquo;I am thrifty. I can make the children's clothes and I can do a dozen other things.  In that way, I can save a little now and then.&rdquo; There are women who bless their husbands for that arrangement.  The wife is, therefore, able to put by £20, £30 or £40 a year.</P>

      <P>The Deputy has missed the point again.  That is not the point that arises under this section. The point that arises on the Deputy's case is whether or not any duty is payable. This section deals only with cases where the duty is payable.  The quiz the Deputy suggests that arises in that case is a quiz not under this section but as to whether or not duty is payable at all.  That is the position. If it was her own money, there is no duty at all of any sort payable.  That is where the difference is.  This section only deals with cases where it is first established that duty is payable.</P>

      <P>This is an appeal to the Minister's sense of justice.  I do not think he is treating the House fairly. Quite obviously, these are very obscure sections.  I was not here&mdash;and, to that extent, I am culpable&mdash;when the Minister was putting the section before the House.  As a layman, I am prepared to admit that I may not be fully cognisant of its real purpose.  It may be that I am misunderstanding the section. However, I still cannot get away from the point I made at the beginning. If a person, by deed of gift, cedes property three years before his death that property is not liable to death duty on his decease.  Supposing a person takes out these policies three or five years before his death, or even longer, will he be caught by this section <Col N="1484" /> whereas if he had chosen to make provision in a different way he would not be caught?  Is there not surely a case there to ask the Minister to justify the difference between the two?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>This Section 12 does not in any way affect liability to estate duty.  It deals purely with the method of ascertaining the rate of estate duty when there is already liability.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am perfectly certain the Minister will not ask us to believe that this section has been brought in merely with a view, purely and solely, to trying to fix a procedure determining the rate of duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

Apparently, the Minister for Finance feels there is a moral duty on him, imposed by obligations of equity as between one citizen and another, to see that no person is allowed to insure his life at too low a rate.  Does the Minister tell us that that is the purpose of this section&mdash;to try and discourage this type of insurance?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my own fault that I was not here when the Minister introduced this section.  I may not fully understand the purport and clear intention of it.  However, I am here, at any rate, as a member of this Assembly and, in the interests of all of us, I should like to get this matter cleared up.  We do not want to enact any legislation which would be unjust or any legislation which will prevent people from making proper provision for their relatives and dependents after their death.  I am perfectly certain that the Minister's position in that regard is akin to my own.  All we want to do is to make certain that, in his desire to stop what has been described as evasion, the Minister is not going too far.</P>
      <P>Deputy Briscoe has already told the House that they have refused to do this in Great Britain.  Why should we do it?  After all, there the evasion is perhaps much more widespread than here.  Why should we try to do it? If there are people fortunate enough to be in a position to take out these policies or provide for them, why should we go to the extreme that they have not gone to yet in England?  After all, we have not yet become a socialist State or a communist State: we still believe in private property and in the rights of private individuals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I to understand now, after all this talk, that what Section 12 now means is this, that where an individual takes out a series of policies on his life for his wife and children, each independently in the name of the wife and children, the only purpose of this section is, first of all, to aggregate the policies and that for the purpose of estate duty they will not be added to the estate of the deceased man?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>To the free estate or settled estate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Does that not make the matter really worse?  Is it not really worse for the beneficiaries of the gentleman&mdash;who, the Minister might think, has done this as a result of evasive tactics, but who I say is making <Col N="1486" /> the best provision he can for each of his children?  In fact, he may have different amounts for different children, he may have bigger amounts for his daughters than for his sons, under these policies.  Is it fair to these beneficiaries, on the death of the father, who now become possessed of their own little estate&mdash;which may have been arranged for them from their early infancy and which could never be the property of the parent or either them, or of any of the other children, except possibly where death inter vened?  Does he think it fair to aggregate those policy figures and say: &ldquo;Each and every one of you will pay an estate duty rate on the seven aggregated policies as if each of you had received the full amount.&rdquo;  Is that fair?  It means bringing individuals, in some cases, into paying estate duty who normally would not have to pay it at all.</P>
      <P>When we talk of figures like £10,000, everybody says that is a large estate, that £70,000 is an unheard-of figure.  I think that this type of insurance policy behaviour should be encouraged by the State.  You make provision for insurance against sickness.  This is a thing that the State should welcome and encourage, rather than put a premium on it and try to become another child of the parent, another beneficiary, which was never intended I ask the Minister now&mdash;I am pressing him again&mdash;to consider the matter from the point of view I am talking about. Is he prepared to insert a clause, that this particular section will have effect only in the case of policies taken out after the date of the passing of this Act?</P>
      <P>There is no use in the Minister arguing the point that the death duties change from year to year and yet relate back to the year of birth.  One thing has nothing to do with the other. These are, in fact, contracts made by a parent with an insurance company, with a certain idea in mind.  I do not know to what extent some of these cases would be affected, but I think the principle is wrong and I ask the Minister again to reconsider it.</P>

      <P>The existing position, which this section alleviates, concerns cases where there is a free estate and a settled estate passing on the death of a person.  If we consider the case of A, who settles property on his son B for life and then on to another son C after the death of B, in that case the estate duty is payable on the death of B, on both the settled estate that he leaves under that settlement and on the free estate.  The effect of this section is to extend the exemption, in respect of the property provided by the deceased, from £2,000 to £10,000.</P>
      <P>There have been cases where people who were not getting any benefit under the settlement, nevertheless had to pay very substantial sums by reason of the aggregation of the settled estate with their free estate.

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few items about which I feel I must complain. That is very often the case on these Estimates&mdash;all too often we have to complain.  Generally speaking, most of what I have to say on this Estimate will be in the form of complaint of one kind or another&mdash;complaints confined in some cases to my own county and of a general nature in other cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taking first things first, I will deal now with complaints of a general nature which affect the country as a whole.  One of the things I feel is entirely wrong, and it is something which has been going on for quite a time though that is no reason why it should be continued, is the system whereby the Department of Health or the Minister for Health, as the case may be, agrees to increase the salaries or remuneration of certain officers or officials employed by a local authority on health work or in the health section of that authority, such as dispensary doctors and others.  This policy has always been irksome to members of local authorities who feel that they, as the elected representatives of the people, should have a direct say in the negotiations leading up to such increases. In most cases down through the years <Col N="1489" /> we have never been consulted and we are usually faced with a <i>fait accompli.</i></P>
    <P>Now, this does not apply only in the case of dispensary doctors, but I mention them because they are the most obvious.  From their point of view the system is a rather good one because, as I see it, and as I have seen it recently, the doctors get their increase sanctioned by the Department or by the Minister.  They there and then proceed to approach the local authorities, not all together or on the one day; they approach the weakest councils first.  The weakest councils are picked out for the first attack and, having succeeded with the weaker councils in putting their claim across, their case is strengthened when they approach the next council because they can say: &ldquo;Oh, such and such a council has already granted the increase&rdquo; and down the list it goes until eventually the claim reaches my particular county, as, indeed, it has very recently reached it.  We found ourselves in the last line of defence between the ratepayers and the increased amounts asked for by these particular people in so far as the ratepayers' contribution is concerned towards the upkeep of our dispensary services and our dispensary doctors.</P>
    <P>For the first time that I know of, our council recently rejected the claim of the dispensary doctors despite the fact that it was brought before us on two occasions and the big weapon in the hands of the Irish Medical Association branch in Donegal was that all the other counties had granted this increase and we should, therefore, do likewise.  We have not done likewise and we have no intention of doing likewise until the conditions under which it is alleged these doctors are getting that increase actually obtain in our county and in all other counties.</P>
    <P>Had this claim been based fairly and squarely, as most claims in recent times have been based, on the suggestion that the cost of living has increased and an addition in salary is necessary therefore to offset any fall in the value of the income, our approach might have been different.  Had that been the approach, then I for one, <Col N="1490" /> would not have had any objection to paying this increase.  My objection to it now is that the claim was based on the allegation that, due to the implementation of the Health Act, 1953, doctors were as a result now finding that their private incomes had been reduced and that this increase of salary therefore would be by way of compensation for that loss.</P>
    <P>The fact of the matter is that, far from there being any loss, there has actually been an improvement.  They might have been at a loss had the Act gone into operation as was intended by the Minister's predecessor.  Possibly then the case could have been made, and probably would have been made, that this was fair compensation.  In the meantime the Government changed and the present Minister, or his Government, did not see fit to implement the Health Act of 1953.  Therefore, the very case that could be made for an increase to dispensary doctors no longer obtains.  Actually the reverse was the position because under one part of the Health Act, which is in operation at the moment, far from being at a disadvantage the dispensary doctors are, in fact, at an advantage.</P>
    <P>I refer to the particular section dealing with maternity in relation to the lower income groups.  Before the implementation of that section of the Act dispensary doctors were paid a salary for that particular work.  Now, in addition to salary, they get five guineas per case so that, instead of being at a loss, they are actually gaining.  Therefore, the claim for an increase cannot stand and the method of granting the increase is wrong, because they go to the Minister first and foremost; the matter is discussed and a decision reached and the Minister then informs the local authorities that he, as Minister, is prepared to sanction an increase not exceeding so much.</P>
    <P>The line of attack is then defined and the most divided and weakest councils are picked out first.  Having succeeded in the weaker councils they move on to the stronger and, as they go, the case gets stronger.  Before any such increase is granted or sanctioned the local authorities should have an opportunity of deciding whether or not <Col N="1491" /> they are in agreement with the proposed increase.  No local authority should be left in the position in which we find ourselves at the present time; in 25 counties and in more than 25 local authorities the increases are being paid.  Ours is the only local authority which has refused and we are now being held up as anti-Irish Medical Association.  We are not anti-Irish Medical Association purely and simply for the fun of being in that position. If the Minister wishes to inquire he will find that the refusal to sanction the increase to dispensary doctors was not the work of one Party alone.  All Parties in the council were against it and voted against it.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister is aware of this, but the last shot fired in this particular dispute between the local authority and the local Irish Medical Association in Donegal was that at the second last meeting of the Donegal County Council we found ourselves faced with the statement that if we did not pay this increase, or were not prepared to pay it, the dispensary doctors would no longer be available, not any one of them, to do emergency relief duty for a neighbouring dispensary doctor; and, as we all know, in rural Ireland that is an absolute necessity so that a dispensary doctor will be available at all times.</P>
    <P>Now, that was used and it was directed to us by the local Donegal Irish Medical Association branch. I want the Minister to take note of the manner in which that matter was presented to us and to realise that that was a threat.  It was really a blackmailing threat made by those people in the name of their own organisation and one which it was hoped would be sufficient to browbeat our council into giving them something that the previous meeting had decided, in all fairness and justice, they were not entitled to get.  That type of manoeuvre is, I think, something the Minister should have in mind if and when he comes again to decide any such question as an increase in salaries to doctors or any other officials of local authorities who derive any part of <Col N="1492" /> their remuneration from the ratepayers of those local authorities.</P>
    <P>I would ask that the Minister&mdash;let his time be long or short as Minister for Health&mdash;in dealing with these matters in future would set up some machinery whereby all councils would be represented at some round-table conference and that the claims of any of these groups would be before that conference and that only the unanimous opinion of that conference should be taken as a concrete suggestion for all of us.  I think it is only fair to all of us who are members of councils or who may be members of councils in the future that we should not be hamstrung by directives from the Minister or anyone else on what we should pay the officials whom we are helping to pay in any way out of rate money.</P>
    <P>Another matter which I think is not only of local interest in my county but is causing quite a lot of trouble throughout different counties is this question of the payment of disablement benefit as allowed and made feasible under the Health Act.  This disablement allowance is something that I think was very necessary and fills a long-felt want and the very fact that the present Government did not scrap it and has, in fact, since coming into office, allowed it to come into operation proves that there is no division of opinion as regards this particular section of the Act.  However, the good intentions that were behind the introduction of that particular section are in many cases, I am afraid, being nullified or being watered down to say the least of it.  My county is only typical of others; the difficulties are there and we find it almost impossible to get around them.  One finds we have someone of the full age, over 21, who is totally disabled, maybe residing in a home where there is a father or mother, brother or sister, and that father, mother, brother or sister, if they are other than destitute themselves, if they have any sort of means at all, is regarded as a person sufficiently well off to look after this totally-disabled member of the family.</P>
    <P>I feel that there is a certain amount of justice in that approach and that, surely, the first people to lend a hand <Col N="1493" /> to any member of a family should be the father or mother or brother or sister if they are able to do so.  But if we look at the other side of the picture and realise that if these members of the family say: &ldquo;We will not look after the invalid&rdquo;, what is the position? That other member of the household is entirely disabled, or has some form of disability that leaves him or her completely and entirely dependent on others and if the members of his family say: &ldquo;We will not look after this person.  We consider it is too much of a drag for one reason or another&rdquo;, the burden is then placed fairly and squarely on the State or the local authority, to maintain that particular person completely and for the rest of that person's life.</P>
    <P>The £1 per week benefit that is the maximum payable at the moment under this particular Act is not surely, and cannot be at any time, regarded as really sufficient to keep any one person whether they be disabled or otherwise, and that at best, even where the full 20/- is or could be paid, that 20/- should only be regarded as a help to those who are good enough to look after such persons as those who are crippled or disabled and cannot look after themselves.  I feel that even though a parent or parents, brothers or sisters, may be regarded by the local county manager or the health authority as sufficiently well off to look after a disabled relative or member of the family, that is not sufficient reason to say: &ldquo;Your brother has £6 a week and therefore he should look after you&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Your sister has £7 a week and she should look after you.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I feel these members of the family are doing a great service in looking after their invalid brothers or sisters at home and are relieving the ratepayers and taxpayers of this country of a much greater burden.  The £1 we would pay would be a very small contribution in comparison with the cost of maintaining the person in a home or an institution.  I believe that the £1, the maximum amount that can be paid now, should be paid in all cases such as those I have outlined, as an <Col N="1494" /> encouragement and sort of compensation to those very good people who retain at home so long as they can and where it is possible to do so the disabled and crippled members of their own families.</P>
    <P>I think they should be given some little help, and God knows this help is little enough.  It is a pity it is not greater than it is at the moment when the maximum is but 20/- per week if the person is totally disabled.  I feel the brother or sister, father or mother, should not be left unaided by the State and left possibly to deny themselves certain comforts and necessaries while trying in the best way they can to look after some crippled relative.  The State could help and encourage these people to stay in their homes and be kept at home and could discourage sending those people to institutions.  It would be better for all concerned that these invalids should stay at home.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister at least to get in touch with the different local authorities in connection with this matter and if any circular that may have issued in the recent past from his Department is the cause of the stringent regulations that are now being applied, if through any directives from his Department this miserly and niggardly treatment is being meted out, I would appeal to the Minister to undo the damage that has been done in that direction by indicating to the local authorities and the managers &mdash;who are really the boss men in these particular cases&mdash;that the very severe means test should not continue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>As a matter of fact I am well aware it is in the Act, but there is a wide variation as the Minister may well know in the application of it as between county and county.  I believe&mdash;and I am not saying this to try and put the finger on the Minister or his Department; I say this in all sincerity&mdash;from my own knowledge of the manner in which this thing is being approached and has been approached in the past&mdash;a portion of the blame may rest on directives from the Minister's <Col N="1495" /> Department addressed to the local authorities and to the county managers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has spoken but the trouble about it is that when we go to our county manager, as I have&mdash;I have been on committees dealing with this matter&mdash;we find that one official after another, in order to ensure that they keep within the regulations that are laid down, will interpret the laws as they see them and will in all cases err on the safe side, naturally enough.  They are not paid to err on the other side.  I feel that at the moment the Minister himself is the only person who can give the sort of loosening-up directive to many of our county managers and their staffs in the application of this particular benefit. I would ask him to do that and not to take from anything I have said that I am criticising him or blaming him for this situation.  I will blame him if in six months' time it is still the same.  I do not blame him now.  I am asking him to help us because I know these hardships exist and I know that this benefit is not in all cases being paid in full as I believe it should be paid and it could do much good if it were paid.</P>
      <P>Having said that, there is another item or two of more local interest but, before going on to those, I would say one thing to the Minister.  Has the Minister any answer to the position that is obtaining to-day as a result of his action or his Department's action in shifting on to the ratepayers' shoulders part of the cost of maintaining insured workers and giving them hospital treatment?  Is there any answer to that in these days when any person who has been a member of a local authority knows that the ratepayers are paying in many cases very much in excess of what they can afford?</P>

There was no suggestion anywhere in the Act that the local authorities were to be asked to pay a higher contribution to the then existing health services.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister knows very well that, in his breaking up of the Health Act to try to satisfy the different elements that were for and against this bit and the other bit, a complete and absolute wash-out was made of the entire intentions behind that Act.  He knows that.  The Minister is aware of that.  It is proposed in the near future, as published yesterday or the day before, to bring in another part of the Act, the submission <Col N="1498" /> now being that the provision now exists for this additional service.</P>
      <P>I cannot see what radical change has taken place in our hospital services for the last 12 months that can encourage the Minister to change his mind so much that he will put into operation in the very near future part of this Health Act that a year ago was absolutely impossible because we had not the accommodation.  I do not think that that quite sums up the story.  It makes good reading at the moment but it is not convincing and I do not think it will convince others any more than it convinces me.</P>
      <P>No matter what the Minister may say, the point at issue at the moment is that our ratepayers are being asked to pay half the cost of providing hospital treatment for insured persons which they did not have to provide under Fianna Fáil and our rates must carry that addition.  It does not matter to the ratepayers where or how it came about, the fact is that it is taking place and their rate burden will be heavier as a result.  That rate burden is already too high and we feel that the Minister should have taken the necessary steps to prevent this happening.</P>

He should realise that it is not sufficient to come in here and, when faced with some proposition such as I have given to him this evening, or some statement, to say, &ldquo;Oh, but the other Minister before me was responsible&rdquo;. The Minister sitting in the House to-day is the Minister responsible.  I move to report progress.</P>

      <P>On the motion for the Adjournment, Deputy Bartley gave notice that he would raise the subject-matter of Question No. 10 on to-day's Order Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Minister at question time whether a decision has yet been reached in regard to the proposal to improve the main landing place at Inis Thoir, as an alternative to the proposal to carry out marine works at Corr Áit, and, if not, what is the cause of the delay?  The question is rather skimpy but, as it had been a repeat of former questions, I understand the rules did not permit of it going down in the full form in which I submitted it.  However, the Minister did not require it in the full form.  He ought to be pretty well acquainted with it by now&mdash;much more than I am myself.  Having regard to the number of occasions on which I raised the matter here and seeing that the Minister represents a Gaeltacht and congested area, I was almost certain that he more than any other Minister in the Government would examine very carefully and sympathetically a proposal to improve the lot of a small community of islanders in Galway Bay.</P>
      <P>I understood the Minister to say in one of the supplementaries that he was not satisfied that the engineers were influenced entirely by technical reasons and, as far as my memory goes, he introduced the word &ldquo;politics&rdquo;.  The word &ldquo;politics&rdquo; does not appear in the script of his replies which I received.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. O'Donnell) Patrick O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. O'Donnell)</NameTxt>
      <P>And it was not used, either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>And it was not used? The Minister confirms that?  I am glad he does because I was going to ask him at the outset to confirm that he did not use it.  Whatever else may be said about this, I want to assure the Minister and the House that there is no question good bad or indifferent of politics or any question related to politics and that, in fact, this small community of about 300 persons are as completely unanimous <Col N="1501" /> about the viewpoint I am presenting for them in this House as it is possible for any community to be.</P>
      <P>I take a special interest in these islands in my constituency.  I have seven of them to look after.  These three in Galway Bay are three Fíor-Ghaeltacht areas.  A good deal of solicitude is expressed in this House for the Fíor-Ghaeltacht and for the people in the poorer parts of the West generally.  Here was a proposal to translate that solicitude into a very real and beneficial service.  I submitted three proposals and repeated my representations in support of them over a number of years.  There were three specific jobs in the island of Inis Thoir.  The main one was the improvement of the pier.  The second one was the erection of a slip at a place called Poll na gCaorach.  The third was the improvement of a place called Corr Áit, which has figured largely in the exchanges between the Minister and myself on supplementaries to various questions which I put down.</P>
      <P>I placed the main job, naturally, in the first category.  I placed the second one&mdash;a small job&mdash;in the second place and this other one in the third place. I will explain why in a few words.  The main pier and the main entrance to the island quite obviously in the opinion of everybody there and of people going to the island would, naturally, come first. I had succeeded in having the second one done pre-war, but the man who was sent in by the Galway County Council to do the work did not have much experience of marine works.  He was a very good concrete man on land. His work, which looked quite nice when finished, was not substantial enough to withstand the winter storms and was swept away in the first ensuing winter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Corr Áit is a place that serves about one-quarter of the islanders.  There is one village, the village of Forba.  Corr Áit is used when the weather is extremely fine.  It is the ordinary, natural cliff, but in this particular place, although the approach to it is rough, the sea front is usable in fine weather by hookers.  My suggestion was that it would be improved by the blasting of <Col N="1502" /> some rocks and the smoothing-off of the platform or surface.  The total cost of that improvement was, according to the highest estimate which I got from engineers, £1,500.  Some of them told me that a good job could be done for £700.  This is used for the purpose of getting about one-quarter of the island's supply of turf.  It is used for that purpose only.  It is not used for fishing.  It cannot be used for fishing and, therefore, there is no supporting case for Corr Áit other than what I have said but it is worthy of an expenditure of anything from £700 to £1,200.  It was placed in the third place.</P>
    <P>The engineers were sent in with particulars of these three proposals and they went in purely as technical men. I do not know whether they examined the proposals in the order in which they were numbered or whether they went to this place first on some private advice or other but they saw the place on a beautifully fine day.  They saw the very deep water which is very convenient to the rock face.  They very possibly concluded, as engineers, that here was a place where water depth in any event would not be a problem. They did not advert to the fact that there was no sort of harbour in the place; that it was on a more exposed front of the island than the main pier and that it is not used for any purpose other than the limited purpose I outlined. It seems to me that they did not consult or feel it any part of their duty to consuult with the people of the island as to the extent to which these various places were used.</P>
    <P>If, in fact, these other considerations were taken into account by the engineers I have since had evidence from themselves that, in fact, they would have made a different report. My difficulty is to get the Minister for Local Government, who is responsible for Oifig na Gaeltachta agus na gCeantar gCúng, which sponsored this work, to believe that that is so.  If there is anything I could do or say to convince the Minister that it is so and that the engineers who visited the place twice and submitted two reports are convinced themselves it is so, I would be only too glad to do it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1503" /> The Minister, from replies to supplementaries which I put to him to-day, leaves the whole question in a state of suspense.  He would not give me a definite &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; as to whether the Corr Áit proposal for an extension is the one that has been recommended and that that recommendation has not been demolished either by representations from public representatives or by engineers or by other technical advisers.  Would he say now that his recommendation has in fact been demolished by people who are completely non-partisan and non-political&mdash;the engineers of the Office of Public Works?  Will he agree now that these same engineers made an inspection of the island on the orders of their superiors in the Office of Public Works and, I take it, at the same time of the officials of Oifig na Gaeltachta agus na nCeantar gCúng and that the only result of these preliminaries was that they made a second visit to Inis Thoir and that they came back with a report in favour of an expenditure of £11,000 on the main pier as against the original proposal for the expenditure of £8,000 on Corr Áit?</P>
    <P>If the Minister thinks there is any influence in this question other than the opinions and reports of the engineers, would he take this further step in the matter&mdash;when the Dáil adjourns for the summer recess would he pay a visit to the Galway Gaeltacht and go into the Aran Islands?  He can do it in one day.  He can go ashore in a currach and he will find the captain of the <i>Dun Aengus</i> accommodating. The captain will hold up the boat and the Minister can go ashore, not to carry out an inspection of the works, but to meet the people of Inis Thoir and ask them on the strand which of these proposals should take precedence, and if £8,000 is to be spent on a marine work in Inis Thoir whether circumstances would justify that sum being spent on Corr Áit, having explained to them at the same time that if the Corr Áit proposal is adopted there will not be an additional expenditure of £11,000 on the main pier.</P>
    <P>If the Minister tells me now that he <Col N="1504" /> will go ahead with an expenditure of £8,000 on Corr Áit and that he is also prepared to spend a further £11,000 on the pier I would clap the Minister on the back, and all I would ask him is to reverse the order and do the pier first.  But the Minister has left me under the impression that he is not going to do either of the jobs, because when I asked him whether he was standing over Corr Áit he did not agree that he was.  I then asked him: &ldquo;Does the Minister's reply mean that he is standing over the Corr Áit proposals until such time as he may decide the island pier is the better proposition?&rdquo; The Minister's reply to that was: &ldquo;It does not.  The Minister has a completely open mind until he is convinced otherwise.  The Deputy, when he was Parliamentary Secretary, received a report from his advisers advising that Corr Áit would be a much better proposition than the new pier.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I did not give any such recommendation at all.  There was no reference whatsoever to the pier in comparison with Corr Áit in so far as my recollection goes.  They only recommended Corr Áit and because of that I can only conclude that they did not examine the other place at all.  I do not know that as a fact but the circumstances led me to believe that it is so.  Here is where I am puzzled. The Minister said in his reply to my supplementary: &ldquo;Other advisers advised the very opposite, that the new pier would be a better proposal instead of Corr Áit.  I have got to decide myself as to which of these proposals is the better and it is for that reason I have not taken a decision&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Minister's expression was: &ldquo;Other advisers advised the very opposite&rdquo;.  The facts are as I stated by way of supplementary question&mdash; that the engineers themselves made this decision, that they went back and without any pressure amended their report simply on its being pointed out to them that the pier was the main place of contact with the outer world and that it should take precedence and that in the light of that information they decided that they had made a mistake and they took the other considerations into account to which <Col N="1505" /> I referred earlier.  They amended their report and I have no doubt in the world that if they had had an opportunity of discussing this problem in all its aspects with the people of the island they would never have fallen into the error into which they did fall in the first instance and that they would possibly recommend smaller amounts for the construction of a slip at Poll na gCaorach and the improvement of this Corr Áit place for the present.</P>
    <P>In all, about a quarter of the island's supply of turf comes into Corr Áit in the summer when the sea, as they say in Inis Thoir, is &ldquo;ina clár&rdquo;.  Ní féidir leat aon úsáid a dhéanamh de Chorr Áit ach nuair atá an fharraige in a clár.  If Corr Áit can be used only when the sea is like a sheet of glass and for the limited purpose I have mentioned, is it not ridiculous this flaithiúil expenditure of £8,000 should be proposed?  The islanders are very disappointed that the Minister has taken advantage of what was a very excusable error to delay this job for an entire year and to deprive these people of the advantage of either proposal. The tragedy of the whole thing is that the second report came in recommending a pier for a sum of £11,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am really amazed at Deputy Bartley's desire to help the <Col N="1506" /> people of Inis Thoir.  After 25 years of Fianna Fáil, he wakens up and says that these unfortunate people cannot be left without a pier any longer.  Let me give the House the history of this matter.  My predecessor, the then Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Jack Lynch, visited Inis Thoir in September, 1953, and as a result of representations made to him down there, he decided that something should be done to improve landing facilities on the island.  He employed the only engineer available to him for the purpose of carrying out an investigation and he sent a marine engineer from the Board of Works to the island and asked him to report to him what best could be done for the island.</P>
      <P>The engineer came back, having made an inspection, and reported that extensions could be carried out on the island at a place called Corr Áit for a sum of £8,000, which would be ample for the islanders, or, alternatively, a sum of £12,000 could be spent on the old pier in putting it into a state of repair.  These proposals were considered by my predecessor and he submitted to the then Taoiseach, the present Deputy de Valera, a proposal that £8,000 should be spent at Corr Áit.  As Deputy Bartley rightly pointed out, the then Taoiseach sanctioned it, but, as Deputy Bartley also pointed out, left it in abeyance for the new Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Anyhow, the sanction was there for £8,000 by the then Taoiseach.  Immediately Deputy Bartley heard of Corr Áit being the selected spot, he made representations to the then Taoiseach and to my predecessor, Deputy Jack Lynch.  As a result of these representations, the very same engineer was sent back to Inis Thoir and Deputy Bartley pointed out to him, prior to his going back:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Young man, you were misled the day you examined this place.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The day the marine engineer examined the place was a fine sunny day and he told this engineer:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;You were misled by nature because you did not see the island <Col N="1507" /> as you should have seen it.  You also did not realise that your recommendation in respect of Corr Áit was a recommendation to erect a pier at the most exposed spot on the island.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>With these representations from Deputy Bartley, the self-same engineer went back to Inish Thoir and he sent back a further report to my predecessor in which he mended his hand.</P>
