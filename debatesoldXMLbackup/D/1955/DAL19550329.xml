      <P>I am informed by the E.S.B. that they have not, so far, carried out experiments to test the efficacy of wind power as a means of generating electricity.  The board have, however, taken records of wind velocity at various points on the west coast from Donegal to Kerry and a small experimental wind power electricity generating set is expected to be available for testing purposes at a site in County Dublin early in 1956.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The engineering survey of the Maine catchment has been completed and the design of a scheme is in hands.  Pending preparation of the scheme and compliance with the statutory requirements <Col N="835" /> I cannot yet say when works on the scheme will commence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>The engineering survey was completed last October. Work on the valuation survey and the design of the scheme is proceeding. The engineer estimates that, all going well, the preparation of the scheme will be completed in 1956.  There will be a long time involved in inspection and things like that.  It cannot be expected, therefore, that work will start sooner than 1956.</P>

      <P>Certificates relative to the letting of houses at Rockenham, Sullivan's Field and Mount Sion are being considered with a view to determination of the rate of subsidy appropriate to the allocations made.  Further information on matters of detail has been sought arising from examination of these certificates and the reports of the housing authority and of the chief medical officer.</P>
      <P>The certificates indicate that a number of the persons to whom the question relates have now been rehoused. A further number are listed for rehousing.</P>
      <P>I propose to re-direct the attention of the housing authority to the desirability of adopting a graded or differential renting system with a view to ensuring through the equitable distribution of subsidies that, as far as is practicable, applicants for rehousing will not be precluded from accepting tenancies through inability to pay fixed rents.</P>
      <P>I may add for the information of the Deputy that when there is a breach of the letting regulations the only penalty I can impose is the withholding of subsidy.</P>

      <P>All managers, with the exception of the Dublin City and County Manager, are at present paid a basic salary scale of £1,250 rising by annual increments of £50 to a maximum of £1,600.  A cost-of-living allowance of £325 per annum is payable in addition.  Prior to the introduction of this scale managers were in receipt of various fixed salaries ranging from £1,200 to £1,500 plus a similar cost-of-living allowance.  The present salary scale was fixed by Minister's Order dated 6th March, 1953, with effect from the 1st January, 1953.  The present remuneration, including cost-of-living allowance, of the Dublin City and County Manager is £3,075.  The salary was fixed at its present level with effect from 12th February, 1951, by Minister's Order of 16th March, 1951.  Previously the remuneration of the office was £2,600.</P>

That Order was made under the powers conferred by Section 23 of the 1941 Act, but I understand certain doubts have arisen as to the legality of the position.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood the Minister was to include in the Bill some provision similar to that proposed by the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that, if I may take the amendment as moved by the Parliamentary Secretary, I find myself in entire sympathy with the view that it would be desirable if all compound manufacutrers would provide an open formula for the benefit of their purchasers, but I am reluctant to ask the Oireachtas to place a statutory duty on the Department of Agriculture to stand over a warranty that the Department of Agriculture might not be in a position to check.  The trouble is that if you get an open formula declaring that this compound mixture contains so much oats and so much barley and so many vitamins&mdash;so much this and so muchthat&mdash;there is no chemical test which can establish with certainty that the terms of the open formula have been observed.  Therefore, if the Department of Agriculture prescribed it as statutory to provide it I feel that the purchaser would be entitled to turn to the Department with a sample of the compound, if he had any suspicion, and say: &ldquo;Get that tested so that we may check on the terms of the open formula.&rdquo;  In that case I feel I would be obliged to say: &ldquo;There is not any test which will with certainty check the terms of the open formula.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="844" /> The only chemical test which we could apply would deal with factors such as the fibre content, the protein content and matters of that kind but if you ask us to determine how much oats or how much barley or how much milo maize the compound contains there is no chemical test which would enable us to do so.  Furthermore, even though we might be able to identify the presence of a certain quantity of oats in a mixture, we are in the difficulty that there are good oats and bad oats.  It might be possible to establish by chemical test that there are oats present but that leaves open very much the question as to whether the oats present were good oats or bad oats. Therefore, I would advise the House to stand on the traditional mandatory certificate as to the content of a compound mixture&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>And that is?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the one requiring us to declare the maximum fibre content, the minimum protein content and the minimum carbohydrate content&mdash; the maximum oil content, the maximum fibre content, the minimum protein content.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not including carbohydrates?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I know&mdash;perhaps the Deputy may be wiser in this than I am&mdash;protein is in fact the modern equivalent of the albuminoid content of such compounds.  I understand there is some feature in the accepted formula which covers that aspect of it but the Deputy may rest assured that the aim will be to work out a formula which is the common form, as far as I know, of providing against an excess of fibre or oil and against a minimum of protein content. If the Deputy considers that carbohydrates should be dealt with specifically in the certificate I shall give that careful examination.  The House will understand my difficulty and accordingly my recommendation to Deputy Donegan that he should withdraw this amendment on the assurance, which I gladly give him, that any influence I can use with compound manufacturers to induce them to provide the open <Col N="845" /> formula as a voluntary addition to their statutory obligation to provide a formula relating to fibre, oil, and protein content will be used by me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I must apologise for not being present when the amendment was moved by the parliamentary Secretary.  My reason for tabling this amendment, which I am now withdrawing, was that I felt the position of the live-stock trade, excluding the cattle trade, was such as to give us very great concern.  One of my reasons was that in our pig and pork production we had not reached the degree of specialisation which has been reached by our competitors in the British market.  The position exists where a pig feeder who feeds 400 pigs and derives therefrom a profit of £1 per pig can earn, if he feeds them from the bonham stage to the killing stage, a period of four months, a profit of £1,200.  That situation does obtain in the countries which are competing with us but it does not obtain in our country and it is a situation which we must try to develop.  Therefore, any small decrease in the price of compounds or any change in their quality or any information which we can give to the farmer is, in my opinion, very important.  There was the ever-present danger, which has been so evident when profits on pig rearing at any time in this country were not there, of the discouragement to farmers by their failure over a certain period of time to make a profit.  We are lagging behind these other countries in that respect inasmuch as we feed lesser numbers of pigs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position in America is that this open formula is used.  I am informed this has resulted in many farmers using specific formulae for which they found their district most suited.  It is a fact that as things stand at the moment farmers in Ireland most often use a formula which is not suited to their particular economy.  For instance, you have the case where a manufacturer holds a licence for a formula which is used generally when in fact many of his customers are farmers who use skimmed milk.  It is possible to produce a compound mixture which is just as good but costs less if skimmed milk <Col N="846" /> is used in conjunction with it.  This inflexibility in our present situation could, I believe, or believed before I heard the Minister on my amendment, have been remedied if the open formula were adopted and the Department relaxed in their ordinary Orders which they make the standards which they insisted upon, or alternatively, allowed the miller to make, without a licence, a formula which he declared to the public.</P>
    <P>I can see certain other difficulties that might arise, for instance, the possibility of farmers using mixtures which were not the best thing.  It is, of course, the farmers own business what he uses but it is a fact that our farmers in many districts, perhaps through talking to one another or by some other means, may get a certain remedy which in many cases is uneconomic. I can give an illustration of how a better situation could obtain. Let me instance the case of the biggest pig feeder in the country who resides some distance north of here.  His system may be in direct contradiction to the belief of many people who think that when one starts a batch of pigs or other animals on one particular type of mixture one should finish them upon it but it is a fact that this man, who compounds his own rations, changes the constituents of those rations every Monday morning to achieve his analysis, depending upon price.</P>
    <P>I would, however, suggest to the Minister two alternatives or additional amendments to other portions of the Act which might possibly be of greater help and might also be of assistance to the farmer in his future purchases.  In the section of the Act which deals with the right of the Department to enter the manufacturer's premises and search or examine the books, I would suggest that he should introduce an amendment that the manufacturer shall keep and balance monthly a clear record of all stocks held, bought or withdrawn from store&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy not anticipating himself?  That section will come up for consideration and the matter should be discussed on that section rather than on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="847" />
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.  Therefore, I will withdraw the amendment on the understanding that the Minister will do his best to protect the farmers from any unscrupulous manufacturers or from any difficulties that may arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not expecting this amendment to be withdrawn.  What I did say on the Second Reading of this Bill was that under the 1906 Act the manufacturer was obliged to give the albuminoids, proteins and the oils. Now he is not compelled to give the carbohydrates and what I wanted to insist upon when the Bill was being discussed was that carbohydrates should be included.  That was the purpose of my talk on the Second Reading. I thought it might be covered in this way by the amendment that was put forward by Deputy Donegan.  If I could get an assurance from the Minister that that would be included I would be perfectly satisfied.</P>
      <P>The difficulty is that many compounds are put up and we do not know what the constituents of that feeding stuff are.  It is put up under different guises but there should be no difficulty whatever in asking a compounder to give the proteins, the fats, the albuminoids, or the carbohydrates under whatever heading he wishes to give them.  If we are to make any progress, as I expect we will, it is necessary that our people be educated in the proper feeding to use, particularly, as Deputy Donegan has mentioned, in the case of pig feeding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will have to produce a ration here that will produce a good quality bacon.  The people who are producing that bacon must be educated as to the proper feeding to use.  In that way it will not be very long, I hope, until every feeder in the country knows the type of feeding he is giving his animals.  If the compounder is compelled to give an analysis of the feed there should be no difficulty for any feeder in the country in knowing what he is buying.  It is equally important that he should know the unit value of what he is buying as well as the analysis of the food that is in the compound.  He can compare the unit value of proteins, albuminoids and <Col N="848" /> carbohydrates with that of his barley, oats and maize mixture.  He knows whether it is cheaper for him to buy a compound or do the job himself.  For that reason I think the Minister might produce a formula which would be unambiguous, and by which every person in the country would quickly recognise the type of feeding stuff he was using and the type for which he was paying.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is any difference between us in the way we want to do that.  The Deputy speaks of albuminoids.  I understand that, in terms of dietetic science, the word albuminoid is replaced by the word protein.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We are both agreed on that.  I agree with the Deputy that, if it is within the sphere of practical politics to add to that requirement, that you declare the correct carbohydrate content of the mixture, I am all for it and will do it, but as the Deputy fully understands, carbohydrates are derived from a wide variety of constituents. They may be derived from oil, maize or sugar, or any number of constituents.  Whether it is possible to define and determine by analysis the carbohydrate content of a given mixture, I am not sure.  I understand, if it were possible, it would not be an unreasonable demand to make on the compounder.</P>
      <P>I understand that we propose to make these by regulation.  I shall certainly look into the practicability of adding to the protein, oil and fibre declaration, thereby adding the carbohydrate content.  I am not going to deceive the Deputy.  I am unqualified to give an undertaking, because I do not know what practical difficulties may emerge, but if it is practicable, it will be done.  If it is not practicable, I can only let the Deputy know the difficulties which deterred me from doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason that Deputy Donegan finds me unable to accept the amendment is not want of goodwill but want of a way.  I do not want to <Col N="849" /> make a regulation requiring a compounder to declare the specific constituents guaranteed to be present in the compound when I have no chemical laboratory means available to check the veracity of the certificate.  It is only because I am not able effectively to check such a certificate that I ask the Deputy not to place upon me the statutory duty of pretending to do what I cannot.</P>
    <P>I renew my assurance that, in so far as I can influence the compounding industry, I will urge upon them that, after having provided a statutory guarantee as regards protein, oil, fibre and carbohydrates, they should voluntarily enclose with a bag of meal, or whatever it is, their own certificate, showing the specific constituents which constitute the compound mixture.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>On this question of compound feeding stuffs, I wish to say that they are regarded as one of the mysteries of farming.  You often see a bag with proteins, fibres, carbohydrates and all the different constituents. I would like to see a label on that bag showing that there are so many offals and so many barley combings in it.  I would not like to see byproducts of mills which have no practical feeding value at all mixed in compound feeding stuffs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>They will be no longer allowed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the Minister, if it is within his province, or that of his officials, to see to it that any waste products of mills which have no feeding value are not put into the compound feeding products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Hear, hear!</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>At the present time the farmers have to buy these compounds, and have to try them out before they know how they are going with them, or if they are a success.  I have known cases where farmers fed them with success to one batch of pigs, and yet when they fed them to another batch they were a failure.  The manufacturers evidently are not consistent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>There are one or two <Col N="850" /> small points I want to make in relation to this Bill.  I think it is envisaged that there are going to be regulations whereby there will be standardisation of the different feeding stuffs; in other words, that it will be obligatory on the manufacturer to standardise, up to a particular percentage, each of the main feeding ingredients. There are certain cases of specialised feeding in this country which I am glad to say are becoming more prevalent than before, in which certain farmers produce certain foods with a high protein content.  For example, some farms may have a good deal of separated milk at their disposal which has a protein content, and they may wish to make up feeding stuffs by producing some of those ingredients as put out by the manufacturers.</P>
      <P>If it is necessary, as it will be under these regulations, for a certain standardised percentage of these feeding stuffs to be contained in the bag or whatever the feeding stuff is sent out in, it is quite obvious that some of these feeding stuffs may not be required. I understand some of these things are going to be brought into use by regulations.  I would like to suggest to the Minister that he would consider that when these specialised feeders are making an order for a particular stuff, and if they do not require, say, the amount of protein, carbohydrates, fat or whatever the case may be&mdash;mostly proteins in this case&mdash;it could be possible for them by a special order to procure that stuff less the ingredients that they do not want.  That may be a little bit complicated, but I think if the Minister does not make some regulation along that line it will to a large extent block this type of farmer who is becoming increasingly prevalent in this country, and who ought to be encouraged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a precedent for that.  I think under the British regulations manufacturers are permitted on occasions to omit a certain amount of protein, or whatever it may be.  I can appreciate that it is necessary to have safeguards in order to ensure that the farmer gets the proper feeding stuffs, but I would urge upon the Minister to allow this.  It is hard to know how it <Col N="851" /> could be covered.  I think possibly if they kept books and also put on the outside the name of the farmer to whom they were delivering the particular product, with the percentage therein contained, it would prevent abuses in any shape or form.  I would ask the Minister to give consideration to that point when making the regulations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the Minister would have been able to accept this amendment which, in my view, is very important.  Possibly one solution of the problem would be to have officials of the Department inspecting the manufacturers' premises where the particular ingredients are available so as to ensure that the mixture is up to the specification.  Without doubt, it is generally felt that these compound feeding mixtures are expensive and often not very good value.  I believe that if the purpose which is sought in the amendment could be achieved it would ease the minds of the purchasers.  I suggest that if, on analysis, it is found that the contents are not up to the specification, there can be inspection of the premises so as to ensure that the people concerned will produce the article according to the specification.</P>
      <P>Deputy Walsh suggested that we should have a common formula.  I do not believe that that method would be very successful.  There are different views on that matter.  Different feeders have different ideas as to what is necessary.  If you had a common formula which was, possibly, supposed to be the best you would find that quite a lot of feeders would not agree.  They would have their own opinion and quite a lot of them would be dissatisfied with the particular type of feeding that would be available.</P>
      <P>I feel the Minister might find a way out of this difficulty by inspection of the premises so as to ensure that the particular ingredients were, in fact, provided, together with the name of whatever was being put into the mixture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not mean a common formula.  What I had in mind <Col N="852" /> was that particulars of the percentage of the carbohydrates and albuminoids be given so that the purchaser would know what he was buying in that regard.  The Minister has spoken about a formula.  I understand the intention is that the manufacturer will give information as to the percentage of oats, barley, wholemeal, fishmeal or whatever it may be&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>If a farmer knows the percentage of carbohydrates, oils or fats, albuminoids, protein and so forth, I think he is pretty well catered for. Then, again, take oats, for instance. They can vary very much.  So also can barley.  You can have a very high percentage of oats but they may be bad oats and very poor feeding.  I think fibre is possibly more important than anything else.  As Deputy Lynch said, during the war 50 per cent. of the compounds offered on the markets were fibres.  Everything possible in a mill was packed into the sack, as we all know.  If the percentages are given, as I suggest&mdash;and as the Minister has agreed&mdash;I think it is quite sufficient.  In time, the farmers will educate themselves about these things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say to Deputy Lynch at this stage that I entirely agree with him that we must take precautions to provide against the user of unsuitable constituents in compound feeding?  In that connection, may I direct his attention to Emergency Powers (Feeding Stuffs) Order, 1944 which is really being replaced by this permanent legislation.  Paragraph 8 of that Order provides:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;No person shall manufacture by way of trade or sell or otherwise dispose of any compound feeding stuff of which an ingredient is husks derived from the milling or dehulling of oats, hulls so derived, or shudes so derived, whether such husks, hulls or shudes are alone or are mixed with any other article and whether they are whole or ground.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I must confess that I have not the faintest notion what &ldquo;shudes&rdquo; means. Paragraph 10 of the same Order provides:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="853" />&ldquo;No person shall manufacture by way of trade or sell or otherwise dispose of any compound feeding stuff of which an ingredient is Corozo nut meal.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I shall be very much obliged to anybody who will tell me what &ldquo;Corozo nut meal&rdquo; is and also what &ldquo;shudes&rdquo; means.  As Deputy Lynch will see, these things are under constant review and as we become aware of any deleterious matter we exclude it.  I am now able to tell the House that Corozo nut meal is a by-product in the manufacture of buttons.  The House will, therefore, endorse the regulation.</P>

      <P>It is marvellous what a little co-operation from all sides of the House will do.  We now know what Corozo nut meal is and also what shudes are.  I am very much obliged to Deputy Kelly.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hughes has indicated a desire to make it mandatory on the compounder to furnish the open formula.  I think the fact is that we are all agreed that if that were within the range of practical politics we should all like it but my trouble is that I cannot enforce it.  I believe the only practical method of enforcing a regulation of that kind is to be in a position to take a sample at any time and check it by chemical analysis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In theory, I could take stock of the contents of every compound manufacturer's premises on a Monday and again on the following Monday and check the issues of manufactured material for the week.  Then, if it did not correspond with the consumption of stock revealed by the two stock-takings I could call them to account. However, in practice, when you think of the number of compounders in this country&mdash;large and small&mdash;I think that, on reflection, Deputy Hughes will realise that I would want a vast inspectorate <Col N="854" /> if I were to be in a position to give an honest certificate to every purchaser in the community that I was effectively and conscientiously enforcing that open formula condition.  The truth is that I do not believe the Oireachtas would or should authorise me to appoint an inspectorate adequately to discharge that task conscientiously. In my judgment, it would be a piece of extravagant supererogation. Otherwise, if it were administratively possible I would agree with Deputies Donegan, Hughes and, I think, Walsh, that it would be a very desirable thing to have.</P>
    <P>However, I think the administrative difficulties of securing it on a mandatory basis are insuperable and so I content myself, and I think rightly, with making the analysis relating to protein, oil, fibre and carbohydrates, if that is practical, a mandatory requirement, leaving it to the compounder out of his own goodwill to provide the additional information for the benefit of his customers.</P>
    <P>Deputy Esmonde raised another point, which may be summarised in this way, that if a feeder wants a formula which, to take a case in point, omits expensive protein and provides what he requires but which is compound feed without protein, does the fact that a compound meal manufacturer is required to declare the minimum protein oil and maximum fibre, preclude him from making a compound which contains no protein at all? The answer is that it will be possible to do what Deputy Esmonde suggests and it will be done, to provide by regulation that where an individual farmer applies to a compounder to have a special compound made to his own personal formula, the production by the compounder of the specific requisition made upon him will discharge him from the obligations ordinarily attaching to standard compounds which he offers for general sale.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has stated that it would be impossible to create a vast inspectorate to see that compounders carry out their duties, but it would be possible for the Minister to add to sub-section (1) (a) an amendment something like this:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A manufacturer of compounds shall keep balanced monthly a clear record of all stock held, bought or withdrawn from store for production of compounds.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Would the Minister consider that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would certainly consider it, but what I am concerned to do is to protect the average purchaser from having passed off upon him a fraudulent product.  Let us not be carried away, by unreasonable zeal for that purpose, into making a whole maze of regulations which are so complex as to be virtually impossible to enforce and which are so complex as to make the life of the compound manufacturer almost unendurable.  The simpler we keep the law the better.  If you make the law so complex that the average citizen, going about his lawful occasions, finds himself inadvertently stumbling into breaches of the law, rendering him thereby liable to prosecution by the Department of Agriculture, I think he has the right to complain.</P>
      <P>Deputy Donegan has a very specialised knowledge of this business himself and I think he will agree with me that anyone who is in the business&mdash;whether it is as a miller or as a compound feed manufacturer, or as a shopkeeper or in any kind of trade&mdash;by the time he has grappled with the public health regulations, the Department of Industry and Commerce regulations and the Department of Agriculture regulations, is kept pretty busy keeping on the right side of the law.  Therefore, I am very reluctant to add a regulation which is not indispensable.  If I can get the result without the regulation, I would sooner do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I see what Deputy Donegan <Col N="856" /> is aiming to achieve, I suggest we should bear in mind that this Bill gives the Minister pretty wide power to make regulations, that clearly the purpose of the Oireachtas is that the Minister should make any and all regulations necessary to protect the average farmer from having an inferior article fraudulently passed off upon him.  I would ask the House not to press upon me the making of new and further regulations other than those envisaged in the Bill.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, whoever is Minister for Agriculture here is always subject to parliamentary question and always subject to hear reasonable representations.  If experience teaches that whatever regulations we make initially under this Bill when it becomes an Act prove inadequate, we can always strengthen them or, if needs be, amend the Act.  Perhaps I am not going far enough in this Bill, but I do not like to go too far in the beginning; because it is very much easier to add the powers you use as you go along than it is to drop the powers which you have in the first case.</P>
    <P>I think Deputy Walsh will agree with me that once you have a power to regulate somebody, it is a major operation to abandon it.  If you find you have not enough authority to control a situation, it is only too easy to seek and secure more power.  At this stage, therefore, I would ask the House to try this plan out.  If it proves inadequate we shall strengthen it, but I would like to give it a trial in the form in which I submit it now to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>My view is that the Minister may err on this.  It is absolutely impossible for any compounder to proceed without such a book as I suggest.  If the ingredients of compounds are many&mdash;eight, ten or 12 ingredients&mdash;it is obvious that since these are bought ahead and most of them come from abroad, with the exception of home-grown cereals, they must be bought and stocks must be kept up.  It is often very difficult to keep these stocks up and a stock book must be kept.  My anxiety merely is <Col N="857" /> that this stock book be available, that it must be available when the inspector calls, if the inspector sees fit to call or if the Minister sees fit to send him.  Such a stock book exists and there is no extra work being put on the compound mill by the insistence that such a stock book should exist.</P>
      <P>My anxiety simply is to see that if a compounder uses 50 per cent. linseed meal in his calf meal&mdash;and a very good calf meal can be made from 50 per cent. linseed meal&mdash;and if on the first of the month in his stock book there is shown a figure of ten tons of linseed meal and if during that month he produces according to his books 25 tons of calf meal, he must have used 12 tons of linseed meal and if he has not got it something else went in.  That is my anxiety.  This amendment would give the Minister an extra power, which I think he should have.</P>

      <P>I wonder if the Deputy has looked at Section 7?  When I read Section 7 I feel positively alarmed at the powers that I acquire thereby, culminating in the powers envisaged under sub-section (1) (c), that I have a right to any information which I may reasonably require with regard to any purchase, importation or sale effected in the course of the business.  Under these regulations I think I could prescribe all the Deputy has in mind&mdash; and more if I so wished.  My scruple is that I do not want to prescribe more than the minimum necessary to secure the result I have in mind&mdash; which, let us remember, is to ensure that there shall not be passed off fraudulently on a purchaser an inferior article.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We do not charge ourselves with determining the optimum specification of every compound feeding stuff.  All we charge ourselves with doing is to say that no manufacturer will go below a certain minimum.  All must conform to that minimum.  Above that minimum, let one manufacturer compete with the other to draw custom by improving on the minimum requirement. Our only duty in this House, I submit, is to provide minima and to say that nobody will go below them, leaving it <Col N="858" /> to the trade to compete, one with the other, by the excellence of their products to attract custom.  Therefore, I am reluctant to go beyond the limits I have already indicated to the House as my intention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that is what we all desire&mdash;that there will be no fraudulence in the manufacture of compound feeding stuffs, or, for that matter, any feeding stuffs, whether compound or otherwise.  Our intention is to make this Bill watertight so far as these people are concerned who may, for one reason or another, or may have been doing it in the past, offer a commodity for sale that is not up to the standard noted on the sack or elsewhere.  That is our desire.  We do not want to hamper anybody in the production of their commodities.  We want to help them as we want to safeguard the people who will purchase these commodities, who will feed them and try to earn a livelihood out of the feeding of them.  We want to be fair both to the manufacturer and to the feeder.</P>

      <P>Under paragraph (c), the Minister has the power, but the Minister's inspector would need to camp outside the office of the large compounder for a very long time before he could unearth an injustice perpetrated on farming customers.  If such a book as I visualise must, by law, be readily available to the inspector, he can then, from the book, trace, in the ordinary manner of an accountant, the purchases, sales and withdrawals from stock and he can then search for an additional sale, an additional purchase or withdrawal not noted in the book. My suggestion merely gives a readymade headline to the inspector from which he can easily gain the information he desires.  I do not want to press it; I merely say that I think it would be a great advantage.</P>

The question is, when we come to operate this Act when it becomes an Act, how far these powers should be used.  I want to say that my desire is to use them as little as possible, while securing effectively the end we all want.  That is my policy in regard to these regulations, but I can assure the Deputy that, if it appears that moderate exercise of the powers under this section does not protect the consumer from fraudulent exploitation by compound feed manufacturers or fertiliser manufacturers, I shall not have the slightest hesitation in using the further powers I have, in order, as Deputy Walsh said, to make the situation watertight.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1955, for Salaries and Expenses in connection with Forestry (No. 13 of 1946), including a Grant-in-Aid for Acquisition of Land.</P>
      <P>When introducing the Estimate for Forestry last June, I told the House of the clear indication which then existed that the Estimate had been undercast both in relation to wage increases which even at that early date were far heavier than had been anticipated, and in relation to the volume of essential work in the forests. Throughout the year the position was kept under observation to see what savings elsewhere in the Vote could be made available to offset the anticipated excess on labour expenditure and as Deputies will see substantial savings have been effected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the labour heads of sub-heads C (2) (Forest Development and Maintenance, etc.) and C (3) (Timber Conversion) extra sums totalling £38,500 are required.  These are offset in part by a saving of £6,000 on labour on the maintenance head of sub-head C (2) which is included in the gross saving <Col N="861" /> of £24,500 for that sub-head as shown in the details of the Estimate.  The net additional sum required for forest workers' wages on sub-heads C (2) and C (3) is therefore £32,500 of which £18,750 flows directly from wage increases.  The total expenditure on forest labour for the year is expected to be £968,500, representing an average employment of over 4,250 men.</P>
    <P>The extra expenditure on cartage and freight is due mainly to increases in cartage contract rates and to the heavy programme of road construction undertaken this year.  This is an item which is hard to estimate with accuracy.</P>
    <P>For running expenses and repair of machinery on the capital expenditure head of sub-head C (2), an extra sum of £5,750 is needed in addition to the original provision of £23,000.  Under an arrangement which became effective in the current year, the Office of Public Works is undertaking the repair and maintenance of most of the heavy plant utilised by the Forestry Division. Close examination of the plant by Office of Public Works engineers has revealed a necessity for heavier expenditure on repairs than had been allowed for in the original Estimate.</P>
    <P>The aggregate additions to sub-heads C (2) and C (3) total £37,750, of which £25,240 can be met out of savings on other sub-heads.</P>
    <P>I am glad to be able to draw attention to the fact that the remainder of the money needed can be made available by additional Appropriations-in-Aid. Considerable attention is being given to the development of improved markets for the produce of thinning operations, and I can now anticipate receipts from sales of timber exceeding by £10,500 the amount for which allowance was made in the original Estimate.  An additional £2,000 is also to be derived from lettings of areas acquired and held in reserve for future planting.</P>
    <P>I am, accordingly, asking the Dáil only for a Supplementary Vote of a token sum of £10 to enable the savings and increased revenue I have mentioned to be utilised to defray the <Col N="862" /> extra expenditure on the main operational sub-heads of the Vote.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we to take it that the remainder of the savings of £24,500 was on sub-head C (2) (1) which, I think, covers nurseries?  The Minister referred to a saving, as I understood him, of some thousands of pounds on sub-head C (2) and sub-head C (3) but he did not explain how it arose that the remainder of the £24,500 was not expended during the year.  Furthermore, is the saving on the nurseries, or in whatever other respect savings have been made, due to deliberate action on the part of the Department or to any circumstances beyond their control which have arisen during the year?  I think that if there is a saving of £20,000 or thereabouts in connection with particular work such as nurseries, the House is entitled to an explanation of how it came about that that money was not expended.</P>
      <P>It is satisfactory that the sales of timber are showing an improvement and that the Minister expects to have additional receipts during the year of £10,500.  With the arrangements that have been made to expedite the general programme for thinning in the plantations and the administrative arrangements that have been made for the supervision of the marketing of the cuts, I am quite sure that benefit should accrue&mdash;particularly if, as seems likely, the timber imported into this country will not show any decline in price.  It is a commodity, as far as we know, that is likely not alone to maintain its price but to increase in value. Under the arrangements that the Forestry Department have made and the fact that they will have additional supplies available for sale, I feel sure that there will be an increase in these sales and that the Vote will benefit by increased appropriations such as we now have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no State undertaking which deserves more attention and more approval than the Forestry Division of the Department of Lands.  Forestry is probably an example of one of the sins of omission in respect of which successive Governments have been responsible.  I always <Col N="863" /> feel that the House should devote a lot more attention to forestry than it does.</P>
      <P>As a nation, we lack raw materials save such raw materials as we can produce through agriculture but we have at hand the means of producing one of the most important raw materials in the world to-day, a raw material which is in increasing demand and the supply of which is decreasing. The price of timber in the course of the last 20 or 30 years shows that it has constantly increased and that the importance of timber as a raw material has been growing.  As far back as 1902, I think, it was estimated that we had 1,250,000 acres of land suitable for forestry which was lying idle and unused.</P>
      <P>In the past 30 years, since we secured control of our own affairs, we have succeeded in planting approximately only 150,000 to 160,000 acres. That is very far short of what the forestry policy of the State should have been.  I think statistics show that we have a smaller area of timber lands than most other countries in Europe, though we have probably a more suitable climate for the growing of timber.  Timber requires a mild, damp climate.  We have that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All Parties in the country have agreed, in theory at least, that forestry is of the utmost importance.  Yet, for some extraordinary reason, it seems impossible to get the Department responsible to go at more than a snail's pace in the development of forestry. I am not blaming the present Minister for that.  I think the Minister can be assured that he will receive the support of every Party in the House whenever he requires money for afforestation purposes.  He has the land available to him.  He has the money available to him, and he has the manpower; I am glad that there are 4,200 employed in forestry.  But that is only a very small fraction of the number of people who could be employed in afforestation provided we were prepared to engage in large-scale forestry operations.  For 30 years, or more, speeches such as the one I am making <Col N="864" /> here this afternoon have been made both inside this House and outside it, but some kind of dead hand seems to prevent any progress in afforestation.</P>
    <P>In 1949 I was instrumental in getting the then Government to come to a firm decision that a minimum plantation rate of 25,000 acres per annum should be embarked upon.  That decision was not merely a Government decision; it was a decision which received the approval of this House and one which was embodied in the long-term programme prepared in connection with the spending of Marshall Aid.  That policy was published in one of the White Papers approved by this House at that time.  At page 22, paragraph 49, of a pamphlet entitled: &ldquo;The European Recovery Programme &mdash;Ireland's Long-term Programme (1949-1953)&rdquo;, it is stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;So far, reafforestation has been carried out only on a very small scale; in recent years the rate of planting in the State forests has been approximately 6,000 acres per year. It is proposed to step this up to 25,000 acres per year.  The aim will be to plant 1,000,000 acres by annual increments of 25,000 acres.  At maturity, and assuming an average yield of 3,500 cubic feet of timber per acre on a 50-year rotation, the annual return on a 25,000 acre felling will be of the order of 87.5 million cubic feet or approximately 350,000 standards of sawn timber.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now that was the Government policy decided upon in 1949.  In that same year that policy was submitted to this House and approved of by this House. We are still nearly 50 per cent. short of that target though, so far as I know, this House would be prepared to make available the money required to carry out such a programme.  I have reluctantly come to the conclusion that a Department of State is probably not the best way of furthering afforestation and that the time has come when the Minister should consider setting up an independent board, such as Bord na Móna or the E.S.B., to undertake afforestation.</P>
    <P>It is quite obvious that if a Department of State has failed to carry out <Col N="865" /> the wishes of this House, something must be done about that failure.  A Department of State has failed to carry out the wishes of this House for one reason or another in connection with afforestation.  Probably the network and the cobweb of red tape of one kind or another that surrounds the Civil Service renders a Civil Service department unsuitable for the carrying out of field operations of this kind.  I would, therefore, take this opportunity to strongly urge upon the Minister a reconsideration of the present system or the finding of a new system so that the wishes of the Government and the wishes of this House can be given effect to, because they are not being given effect to at the present moment, in connection with afforestation.</P>

I merely raised the point so that the Minister might have an opportunity of considering the matter between now and the introduction of his Estimate and might be in a position then to put forward to the House some proposals to ensure that forestry will go ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one other matter to which I would like to refer.  It has often occurred to me that there should be some greater degree of co-operation between the Forestry Branch of the Department of Lands and the Department of Industry and Commerce in regard to the utilisation of timber.  The Minister referred to that point himself and to the fact that good prices are now being obtained for timber.  It occurs to me that the time has come when the question of setting up pulp mills and subsidiary industries based upon timber should be considered jointly by the Minister's Department and the Department of Lands.  Reafforestation and the question of subsidiary industries fringe on the field of industry.  I, of course, approve of any <Col N="866" /> additional Estimate the Minister may require to carry out forestry operations.  Indeed, I wish he was coming before the House for a much larger sum and I am quite satisfied that if he wants a much larger sum at any stage he will receive it from the House.</P>

      <P>I agree with most of the viewpoints expressed here by Deputy MacBride.  I am one of those who has come to the same conclusion as Deputy MacBride in relation to the progress made in reafforestation. Whatever has been holding up progress in the past, will, I hope, be got rid of at the earliest possible moment because it is both necessary and desirable that there should be progress.</P>
      <P>Reafforestation is very important in particular in that part of the country that I represent, namely, the western areas.  There is mass emigration from these areas.  From the point of view of employment, reafforestation is a worthwhile project.  I suppose it is no use crying over spilt milk, but previous Governments do not seem to have taken this matter of reafforestation seriously and they did not go ahead with it as they should have done.  We have a very considerable acreage of poor land in the western areas which would be ideal for planting with timber.  It is noteworthy that it is from these districts that there is the greatest percentage of emigration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House must appreciate the problem of the uneconomic holder with a £4, £5 or £6 valuation, and sometimes an even lower valuation, with no other income; it is quite understandable that such people must emigrate.  If reafforestation was tackled in the way in which it should be tackled it would go a long way towards redressing that evil.  I would like to impress on the Minister also the importance of increasing the amount of the grant to individuals, small farmers, perhaps, who have tracts of land which should be suitable for the planting of timber.  I am sure there would be quite a number of such people in this country who would be prepared if they found it possible to go ahead with planting on their own. The difficulty seems to be, first of all, <Col N="867" /> that the grant of £10 is insufficient. It is not sufficient encouragement to an individual to take on himself the responsibility of planting forest trees.</P>

      <P>I fully appreciate that, but I would just like to say for the Minister's consideration at this stage that we hope that the points of view which Deputy MacBride has advanced here will be seriously considered, and that the advisability of increasing the amount of the grant payable to individual small farmers who might be prepared to plant some timber would also be considered.</P>
      <P>On the subject of technical advice, I would like to say briefly that the Minister should try as far as possible to make more technical advice available to such individuals.  He can appreciate that we do not know what type of timber, or what type of tree would be suitable for planting in a particular area.  I would stress the importance of trying to make such advice available to individuals who would be prepared to do something in this respect.  I think if in an important matter of this kind the support and co-operation of such bodies as the county committees of agriculture could be enlisted, it would be most desirable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFlynn" hpid="Mr. J. Flynn Mr. J. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am just raising one point.  I do not want to go into the question of this scheme or the Estimate which will be introduced at a later date.  I would like to make one point which I mentioned before by way of a question and that is the number of men employed in forestry schemes in South Kerry.  The number, in some cases, is just a half dozen men in a very important scheme and in a congested district.  I am speaking now of two districts in particular, Glenbeigh and Glencar, because quite a number of people emigrate from those <Col N="868" /> two areas.  We thought that when this scheme was being put through a couple of years ago a good many men would be employed and I would appeal to the Minister again to find some way of developing and extending the scheme so that an additional number of men can be employed in each of the districts to which I have referred. Great play is sometimes made about a forestry scheme and about taking over 1,000 or 3,000 acres of land as the case may be and then you will find after some 12 months or so that only five or six men are employed as a result of all those statements and that expenditure on fencing and so on.</P>
      <P>I do not see the great benefit that is in so far as the unemployed are concerned. I would like, if at all possible, to have the programme readjusted if necessary so that whatever system is devised the men are employed stage by stage in the development of the forestry centre.  I think we have now reached a stage in our part of South Kerry where the number of men could be increased and I would again ask the Minister to consider my proposals in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>To deal with the last speaker, Deputy Flynn, first&mdash;I want to tell him that Kerry is one of the counties where we are most anxious to develop forestry, north and south.  It is also one of the counties where the acquisition of land is most difficult and several attempts to establish new forestry centres&mdash;to sow the seeds of forestry as it were&mdash;have not met with a great deal of success for this reason: that the farmers would not sell to us.  Deputy Flynn mentioned the fact of five or six men being employed. I was not aware that the number in any forestry centre was as small as that.  It occasionally happens that a forestry centre might have 1,000 acres here and 200 or 300 acres some miles away.  At times it might be necessary for the forester to do certain essential work and break up his gang into two or three bunches so to speak to deal with different lots of work in a forest centre.  That may be what is happening here.  If that is not the explanation, I do not know, but <Col N="869" /> I can inquire into it in the case of the areas he mentioned, Glencar and Glenbeigh, and see what is possible and let him know inside a week.</P>
      <P>Deputy Derrig was anxious to get a break-down of the figures.  Of £24,500 on sub-head C (2), the principal part of that is a lump of £13,000 approximately, detailed for the purpose of new machinery, but because certain&mdash; if I might call them so&mdash;experiments are taking place in other countries which we are closely watching here, we do not like to commit ourselves to machinery until we are absolutely certain that we will have the latest and most suitable type for the particular type of work we have to do. While we are anxious to get machinery we must still pay attention to the particular type required, and that results in a sum of approximately £13,000 which might have been expended if we had got that machinery last year.</P>
      <P>The £3,500 also in sub-head C (2) for building came about because the cost of erection of certain buildings did not come to, or at least was less than, what was anticipated due to a drop in the cost of certain materials.  On constructional expenditure and materials there was a saving of £1,500.  On labour there was a saving of £6,000.  Most of these are incidentals that will occur in a Department because where there are certain works laid down to be carried out it may not be possible to have them carried out.  As Deputy Derrig knows, particularly in the case of labour, a very frosty winter or at least a winter with long spells of frost can completely upset expectations.  There is a certain expectation of a certain number of weeks of frost and bad weather during which men cannot stay out working, but this winter was particularly bad and I am sorry to say there was a saving of approximately £6,000.  That was due not to any fault of ours but entirely to weather during which the men could not stay out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Among other savings there is one of £7,900 which is due to a delay in opening Kinnitty, because of certain improvement works being carried out which have not proceeded as rapidly as <Col N="870" /> we thought.  Most of the £7,900 is largely due to the fact that we were not able to put students into Kinnity; in other words, because it was not fit to receive them as early as we had expected.</P>
    <P>To deal with other questions&mdash;I want Deputies MacBride and O'Hara to know that I am very anxious to push forestry and if Deputies MacBride and O'Hara are not satisfied with the rate of progress, neither am I.  We have the money.  I am quite sure from past experience&mdash;and that goes for practically every Minister for Lands that comes in here&mdash;that this House will never deny money to a Minister for Lands for forestry.  I do not like to be saying this all the time but I am convinced (1) that we are the most treeless country in Europe and (2) that forestry can do more than any other thing to hold the people on the land.</P>
    <P>I am afraid, due to the fact that we were conquered in years gone by, the people on the land, particularly in the poorer areas, cling to it.  I have a first-class staff.  I want to pay that compliment to the men in the Forestry Division.  There is no shortage of money.  The land is the great trouble. I hope, before the end of this summer recess, to introduce a certain measure that will help to increase the inflow of land.</P>
    <P>Title is one of the big troubles and the areas in which we would like to push forestry the hardest are the areas in which the land is poorest and where people have their roots deepest in the land.  It is not easy to ask a person who has been engaged in hill farming as it is called, who has had sheep and cattle on the hills, to sell the land to us and to take on employment with us in the forests.  Such people look askance at such a proposition.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacBride mentioned a board.  There is a difficulty about a board.  The E.S.B., for instance, and Bord na Móna, do not take land.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>Bord na Móna does.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Bord na Móna takes bog.  I must say that I would not like either the Forestry Division or the Land Commission to use the methods <Col N="871" /> that I have known to be used on one particular occasion.  The big difference between these two boards is that for the material they produce&mdash;electricity and turf&mdash;they can get revenue within six months.  Bord na Móna cuts turf in March, April, May and June, and most of it is sold by the end of the following harvest.  When the E.S.B. electrifies a rural area or town the revenue starts pouring in within ten weeks.</P>
      <P>Forestry, because this is the most treeless country in the world, must be dealt with on a long-term policy.  We have a very small, poor, miserable acreage of mature timber and have no big reserves.  The Appropriations-inAid at the foot of the Estimate each year are very small due to the fact that our thinning acreage is small and the amount of mature timber we can sell is absolutely negligible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I get all the money I want from the House.  That is my trouble.  I have the money.  I have the staff.  Unless we use compulsion to take the land, that is the whole trouble.  I want to assure Deputies that there would be no trouble whatever in planting 25,000 acres a year if we could get the land.  I have succeeded in stepping up the acreage immensely, up to 20,000 per year.  That is very well and I hope to increase it still further, but I will not be content until we pass acquisition of 30,000 acres a year.  There is bound to be a certain amount of unplantable ground in most of the areas we buy.  Experience has taught us that, in order to get 25,000 plantable acres a year, the total acquisition would have to exceed 30,000 and maybe go as high as 33,000. I hope to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have every hope in forestry.  If a difficulty that exists, because the Forestry Division must have clear title, could be overcome, most of the troubles in acquisition would be eliminated.  A great deal of the land, particularly in mountainous areas, that we want for planting, is held in commonage. A commonage was offered to <Col N="872" /> me in the last three months in the West of Ireland where there were no less than 48 tenants.  I do not believe that four out of the 48 tenants had clear title.  The title might go back to their grandfathers' time.  That is the difficulty.  These people want the money in their hands for the land.  If I could overcome that difficulty, we would have no trouble whatever in attaining 33,000 acres a year intake of land, plantable and unplantable, and it would give us 25,000 acres a year planted, which is what I would like to see.  Our country is purchasing enormous quantities of foreign timber each year, both timber and wood products.</P>

      <P>Fianna Fáil, when they were the Government, made a great cry about growing wheat in this country. That was all to the good&mdash;no Government wants to pay £1 for foreign wheat if they can produce it at home&mdash;but they failed miserably in regard to a crop which is equally important, that is, timber.  We paid £9,000,000 last year for imported timber and wood products.  There is no reason why we should not produce it at home.  Wheat requires the very best land.  Fortunately, timber will grow on medium or poorish land, as has been demonstrated time and again. For that reason I intend to push forestry as hard as possible.</P>
      <P>The question of the user of land is red hot.  Deputy MacBride said there was a dead hand somewhere.  It is the love the people have for the land and their reluctance to part with it that is our big difficulty.  I am afraid any Minister, if he goes to take land by force, would find that instead of there being a dead hand, it is very much alive and red hot.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given a good deal of attention to it because the title difficulty in every case is the hold up in the Forestry Division.  Any measure that would aim to ease that, as far as I see, would mean extinguishing the claims of many people to their holdings.  Take a Mr. X who wants to sell a couple of hundred acres of mountain for planting.  We would be anxious to buy.  He finds that a number of his brothers, sisters, aunts, uncles and their families in England and Australia have equal claim.  The big difficulty is that legislation along those lines would have to aim at extinguishing the claims of these people.</P>
      <P>I am examining at present whether such a measure would be just or not. If it would be unjust or if it would deal a hard blow to these people who have claims on the old sod, as they call it, I would be very slow to introduce such a measure.  I would dearly like to see some way out of the present impasse.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="874" /> That a supplementary sum not exceeding £228,000 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1955, for Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
    <P>The Estimate for Posts and Telegraphs already approved by An Dáil for the financial year ending 31st March, 1955, amounts to £7,340,000. Owing to causes which could not be foreseen this provision will be insufficient and an additional sum of £228,000 will be required to meet expenditure up to the end of the financial year.</P>
    <P>The gross extra expenditure on the sub-heads, for which the original provision is insufficient, is estimated at £308,000.  Against this, however, savings on other sub-heads amounting to £80,000 will be available, leaving a net sum of £228,000.</P>
    <P>The causes of the increased expenditure are briefly as follows:&mdash;sub-head A (2)&mdash;increase £25,000&mdash;due mainly to increases in staff in Dublin, the cost in Dublin of the general election and a pay award to postmen (Dublin) which operated from the 21st December, 1954.  Sub-head A (3)&mdash;increase £25,000.  The increased sum is required to meet a pay award to postmen (provincial) which operated from the 21st December, 1954.  Sub-head A (4)&mdash; increase £14,000; sub-head I (1)&mdash; increase £110,000; sub-head I (2)&mdash; increase £12,000; sub-head K&mdash;increase £87,000.</P>
    <P>The amounts provided under these sub-heads in the original Estimate are net figures which are arrived at by deducting from the cost of staff, travelling and stores that portion of it which is attributable to telephone capital works and which is proper to be paid from telephone capital funds. The relief to each of the sub-heads by this process is less than originally estimated.</P>
    <P>The increased sums do not represent increased expenditure.  They represent merely a transfer of costs from telephone capital funds to Vote.  In <Col N="875" /> sub-head E (5) the increase is £30,000. The additional sum is required to meet the cost of conveyance of increased air mail traffic by transatlantic and British Commonwealth air services, increased charges by the United States Post Office for air conveyance in the United State and payment in this financial year of accounts due to be paid, but not received, last year.  In sub-head L (1) the increase of £5,000 is due to the cost of repairs to the cross-Channel cables being higher than was anticipated.</P>
    <P>Allowing for the amount to be transferred from telephone capital funds to Vote, viz., £223,000 the net additional sum required is £5,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>In the absence of Deputy Childers, who is suffering from a slight indisposition, I propose to make a few brief remarks on this Estimate. I should like in the first instance to thank the Minister for providing me with a copy of the statement which he has just given to the House.  I note that the increases are in the main to provide for wages and I do not think anybody in the House or in the country will have any objection to increases in wages.  Accordingly there can be little said in that regard.</P>
      <P>The only thing I should like to say &mdash;and for that purpose I think I can avail of sub-head I (1) and sub-head K on the engineering establishment&mdash; would be again to refer, as many Deputies have referred in this House from time to time, to the crying need that exists for additional telephones.  I know the Minister is inundated with demands for telephones, especially here in the city, and I know equally well that in certain circumstances it is not possible to provide them as quickly as the people are demanding them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I do think is that the weakness is not now in regard to a shortage of materials but rather I think&mdash;I am assuming this and I may be wrong&mdash; that it may be due to a shortage of highly skilled staff, and I rather feel that it is difficult for State Departments to get that highly skilled technical staff because&mdash;and it is an unfortunate state of affairs to have to say <Col N="876" /> this&mdash;the State does not pay the salaries to professional men that will attract the best type into its services. It may be that the difficulty lies rather in the shortage of highly skilled technical experts than, say, the materials that go to provide telephonic communications for the public.  It has been brought to my attention, however, that in certain areas it is reasonably easy to secure the installation of a telephone and that in other areas it is very difficult.</P>
    <P>It has been pointed out to me by constituents of my own and by people who are living in other constituencies that they have applied for a telephone almost two years ago and that they have failed to have one installed, and I have again been told that in other areas telephones have been installed in a little over a month or a couple of months.</P>
    <P>The Minister may, perhaps, be able to explain why that occurs.  I have had a complaint, for instance, from a man who made an application for a telephone. He lived in the same row of houses as another individual who also applied for a telephone.  The man who made his application first is still without his telephone while the individual who applied at a later date, and who is still living in the same row or terrace of houses as the other, has had his telephone installed.</P>
    <P>I know there are certain answers to these queries and when we get them we may be able to do something to relieve the minds of the individuals who have grievances, but it is very difficult when you come across circumstances such as these.  In one particular area you have a delay of two years, while in another area a telephone can be installed in a short period.  That may be due to planning in relation to the circumstances of a particular area; it may be that there are better installations in one particular area than in another.  But my own feeling is that a lot of the difficulty that exists at the present time is due, as I said earlier, to the lack of highly-trained staff.</P>
    <P>If that is so&mdash;of course, it may not be&mdash;I would urge the Minister if <Col N="877" /> necessary to press his colleagues in the Government to raise the salaries of those professional men who are at the moment inclined to give their services to private corporations rather than to the State.  I think the State should do its utmost to encourage these professional men, especially the young professional men leaving the universities, to stay at home and give their services to the State.  It must be realised, however, that the State must give them some definite encouragement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>Sub-head I (1) and the other sub-heads A (4), I (2) and K are all in the same category.  A certain amount is estimated for the work of the Department each year and is spent on telephones and other maintenance work.  If in the course of the year the allocations do not work out as estimated, then something falls by the wayside and the expenditure which should have been charged on telephone capital has to come on to Vote.  For instance, this particular year it was not possible to estimate in advance accurately how the charge would be borne.  Storm damage cost £85,000 this year which normally only costs £20,000 to £25,000 at the outside.  However, this transfer from capital to Vote is no more than a book-keeping transaction in respect of these four sub-heads. If lines and poles are blown down they are reconstructed and the cost must go on to Vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the provision of telephones, which was referred to by Deputy Traynor, we are very anxious in the Department to install every telephone possible but one of the big delays in satisfying the demands for telephones has been the problem of the supply of spare wires in the underground cables.  In certain areas we have been able to give telephones on demand and it would be my desire to have that position all over the country.  Particularly in Dublin City the lack of wires in the cables has been the cause of the delay and we are not able to get the work in progress until we get the underground cables into order again.  I think half the engineering staff has been working <Col N="878" /> very strenuously night and day to get the position up to date particularly in the centre of the city and then on out to Dún Laoghaire and Dalkey.</P>
    <P>In order to get the position up to date I was successful in transferring a considerable number of men from maintenance to construction.  Men who were skilled in their own way on maintenance have been transferred, by agreement with their union, to do this construction work and bring it up to date.  If and when we get the construction work up to date and there is any question of transfer they will get the first transfer back to maintenance. However, we must have construction as well as maintenance.</P>
    <P>If the Deputy knows of any particular case where an applicant has been waiting for telephone service for an undue time I would like to know as it would help me in regard to the whole position.  I have had a very comprehensive report in the last week and if the Deputy would make me aware of any particular point I would be very glad.</P>

    <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1955, for the Defence Forces (including certain Grants-in-Aid) under the Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Acts and the Defence Act, 1954 (No. 18 of 1954), and for certain administrative Expenses in connection therewith; for certain Expenses under the Offences Against the State Acts, 1939 and 1940 (No. 13 of 1939 and No. 2 of 1940) and the Air-raid Precautions Acts, 1939 and 1946 (No. 21 of 1939 and No. 28 of 1946); for Expenses in connection with the issue of Medals, <Col N="879" /> etc.; for Expenses of the Bureau of Military History; and for a Grant-in-Aid of the Irish Red Cross Society (No. 32 of 1938).</P>
    <P>All the payments for which this Supplementary Estimate is taken can be met from savings on the other sub-heads of the Vote for Defence for the current year.

This was based on a grant of 15/- per effective member of the F.C.A. and 10/- per effective member of an Slua Muirí. This method of financing the F.C.A. units was not found satisfactory as some of the smaller units did not get the minimum amount necessary for their operation, and a new scheme was brought into operation as from 1st January, 1955.  This provides for the payment of grant at a flat rate of £170 per annum to each unit.  To qualify for this grant each infantry unit is required to have a minimum effective strength of 150 and each non-infantry unit, a minimum effective strength of 75.  Of the total of 108 units, 107 have qualified for the £170 this year, which is considered to be a satisfactory development.  In addition certain balances of grant from 1953-54 have also been paid this year, bringing the total required to £21,000.</P>
    <P>The excesses on sub-head C&mdash;Pay of Civilians attached to Units, and sub-head S&mdash;Barrack Maintenance and New Works, arise mainly from the carrying out of three building projects estimated to cost a total of £117,500 for which specific provision was not included in the original Estimate. This year the expenditure on these projects will be: Sub-head C&mdash;£33,750 for labour and sub-head S&mdash;£42,000 for materials and contract work, that is a total of £75,750.  Provision for the completion of these works has been made in the Estimate for 1955-56.  The necessity to devote greater attention to the ordinary repair and maintenance <Col N="880" /> of barracks also contributed appreciably to the excess on sub-head C.</P>
    <P>The excess on sub-head G&mdash;Subsistence and Other Allowances&mdash;arises from an increase in the rates of allowances payable to officers and N.C.O.s on duty with the F.C.A. and the payment of arrears of these increases with effect from 1st April, 1952.</P>
    <P>The increased cost of compensation under sub-head U arises from accidents to Army vehicles.  Expenditure under this sub-head is difficult to estimate with any degree of accuracy, and this year we were unlucky in that the payments were heavier than normal.  The number of accidents, however, was not abnormal.</P>
    <P>The increased expenditure on the Reserve under sub-head Y (2) is due to the numbers reporting for training in all components of the Reserve being greater than anticipated, particularly so in the case of the F.C.A.</P>
    <P>All the payments for which this Supplementary Estimate is taken can be met from savings on the other sub-heads of the Vote for Defence for the current year.</P>

      <P>There is very little in this Supplementary Estimate that one can argue about.  I am glad to find that the F.C.A. units have reached a standard where 107 out of 108 can qualify for the grant, which is almost 100 per cent. qualification.  It is desirable that that should be so because as the Minister himself said on a former occasion it is on a defence unit of that kind that we might have to rely in a time of stress or danger. Beyond saying it is a desirable thing to see that development I have not much more to say.  I notice that the Reserve Defence Force is coming up in very large numbers now and that the addition to the original Estimate is due to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one point I want to raise with the Minister.  I did not see his statement, but I understand that, shortly after the general election, when addressing a post-election meeting at Drumlish, he made a statement to the effect that he had found, on assuming office, items to the value of&mdash;I think he mentioned £117,000&mdash;for which no <Col N="881" /> authority had been secured.  To my mind, that was a rather serious statement. It was only brought to my notice recently.  I have not seen the statement even yet, because it was apparently published only in local newspapers.  To my mind, it was a rather serious statement to make, because it was a reflection, first of all, on his predecessor who happened to be myself, and secondly, it was a reflection on the officers of the Department, because I cannot see how any Minister could start schemes to the value of £117,000 without securing full authority therefor.</P>
    <P>My recollection of securing authority is a rather long drawn out <i>modus operandi.</i>  For instance, you have, first of all, to get authority from the Department of Finance.  Having got the authority of that Department, you then have to submit it to the Government who, in due course, give the necessary approval.  Then it has to be submitted to the House which is finally responsible for giving authority for the spending of public money. That being so, I find it difficult to understand how the Minister could make that statement.  It may be that he misunderstood the position at the time he made the statement.  If that is so, I am sure he will make honourable amend.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the explanation is to be found in the statement which he gave the House when introducing the original Estimate on the 16th June, 1954.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A number of major works, including the provision of more than 80 houses for soldiers at Blackhorse Avenue, Dublin, are on hands. Three of these&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He was speaking of the general scheme of work that was being undertaken by the Corps of Engineers.  He continued:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Three of these&mdash;an ordnance store at Cork, a gymnasium at Galway, and certain works at Naas barracks&mdash;were to have been carried out by the Office of Public Works, but have been transferred, since the preparation of the Estimate, to the Corps of Engineers, as <Col N="882" /> the Office of Public Works saw no possibility of being able to make an early commencement on them.  They are, therefore, not covered by the Estimate.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I presume these are the works to which the Minister referred, but it appears that the statement created the impression that there was something in the nature of a scandal abroad.  I think that the Minister ought to correct that now, if what I have read out is the true statement.</P>
    <P>What actually happened was: the Army authorities were pressing very strongly for these works, the matter was taken up, and in due course agreement, or at least approval, for carrying out of the works was secured.  It was understood then that the Office of Public Works would be in a better position to carry out the works than the Corps of Engineers, and therefore the Estimate for the Office of Public Works carried the amount in the Book of Estimates, and duly got approval in this House.  Again, the position was that the Office of Public Works could not meet its commitments because of the urgent demand of the Army, and they suggested that the matter should be transferred back to the Corps of Engineers.  The position then was that a sum of money had been voted to the Office of Public Works, and it was not, therefore, in the Estimate for the Department of Defence.</P>
    <P>It would only be a matter of coming to this House with a Supplementary Estimate to get approval for the amount required.  That is, when looking through this supplementary statement, beyond the sum of £23,740, I do not find anything that would be likely to cover the £117,000, unless it is included in the original Estimate of £179,019.  I do not think it is.  In view of the statement that this situation was discovered by the Minister, a situation in which schemes to the value of £117,000 were being undertaken without authority, and in view of the statement which I have read out which is the Minister's own explanation, I think it should clear up the situation. I hope to hear the Minister say that this is the actual position.</P>

      <P>I am glad that Deputy Traynor approves of the development of the F.C.A., and I am glad that the F.C.A. is improving in numbers and efficiency.  I invite all our young men to take part in this Army force.  I know that the Deputy will join in welcoming them, and assuring them of our appreciation of their services.</P>
      <P>I do not think there is any matter I wish to refer to except this dispute between my predecessor and myself, over the matter to which he referred in the last part of his speech.  When I took over the Department of Defence my objective was to effect savings as far as humanly possible, and to eliminate all sorts of things without materially affecting the efficiency of the force.  I believe that I met with some success, but, having gone along a certain line, I found then that there were works in progress for which no provision was made in the Estimate of the Department of Defence.  I found that there were three works amounting to £117,000, and such an amount, even in an £8,000,000 Vote, is no small matter.</P>
      <P>I thought that, as Deputy Traynor has said, there was some provision made for it in the Office of Public Works.  There was not.  There was a token Vote of £600 for the Department but there was no provision made in the Office of Public Works so that I could take the money from Public Works into Defence.  Therefore, the Defence Vote had to carry the work that was being done.  What I said here when moving the Supplementary Estimate was that I would have to come to this House to get approval for that expenditure. The House had not, at this stage, approved of it&mdash;nor have they approved of it up to this day.  This is the first time this House has had an opportunity of approving of this particular expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the assistance of the then Tánaiste, Deputy Lemass, I was taken to task by my colleagues in Longford-Westmeath for making, as they alleged, a false statement at Drumlish.  I did not make a false statement: I made a statement of fact.  I am now asking <Col N="884" /> the House to approve of this expenditure. It is true that, by careful management, I have been able to effect economies sufficient to cover it, but if we had to get the amount we should have&mdash;or that was visualised by my predecessors in their Vote&mdash;then, instead of coming here for a Supplementary Estimate of £10, I should be coming here for what we have been able to expend&mdash;as set out, between material and labour, a total sum of £75,750.  I admit I was out that far&mdash;that the schemes visualised an expenditure of £117,000.  Because of bad weather and other circumstances, we were not able to expend the £117,000 this year, but a good deal of the work has been done.</P>
    <P>If the former Minister thinks I tried, by inference or implication, to create a scandal, I want to state here and now that I did not intend any such thing and that, if any such inference was there, I withdraw it.  What I asserted was that he had undertaken an expenditure of £117,000 this year for which this House had not given its approval either in the Vote of the Office of Public Works or in the Defence Vote.  In my speech at Drumlish&mdash;and I suppose that, as attention has been called to it, I am in order in making this explanation&mdash;I tried to explain why it was that I was not able to do as much as I should like to do.  In my own hearing, the former Tánaiste and the former Minister for Posts and Telegraphs spoke at Athlone during the general election and boasted that they were making provision for an expenditure of £60,000 on work in Athlone Barracks. They appealed to the electors of Athlone to support the people who could do such a great piece of work.  I said it was very sound, if they could do it.</P>
    <P>It was only natural that I would refer, in my reply, to their promise of £60,000 worth of employment for which this House had not voted the money.  I do not assert or wish it to be inferred for a second that the former Minister for Defence was in any way responsible for any malpractice.  On the contrary, I believe that he would do what I <Col N="885" /> would do myself, that is, build all he could and do all he could for his troops.  I was speaking on the broad general principle of making a grand bid during the general election and of the fact that the money was not provided for in the Estimate for the Department of Defence or in the Estimate for the Office of Public Works.</P>

      <P>This is a serious situation because the Minister stated in this House, when introducing the Vote for the Department of Defence, that the Estimate was transferred from the Office of Public Works to the Corps of Engineers and that the approval was there.  We cannot have it both ways.  The Minister cannot make a statement here and then forego that statement unless he only read the statement when he was making it for the first time.  I have before me Volume 146, No. 3, of the Official Report of Wednesday, 16th June, 1954. At columns 326-7 it is stated:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Three of these&mdash;an ordnance store at Cork, a gymnasium at Galway, and certain works at Naas Barracks&mdash;were to have been carried out by the Office of Public Works, but have been transferred since the preparation of the Estimate, to the Corps of Engineers as the Office of Public Works saw no possibility of being able to make an early commencement on them.  They are, therefore, not covered by the Estimate.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that three of these works were to have been carried <Col N="886" /> out by the Office of Public Works but the only provision for them in the Estimate of the Office of Public Works was an Estimate for £600 for public works and buildings to meet the quantity surveyor's fees in respect of the gymnasium at Galway.  I do not see how the Deputy could argue that the £600 for the surveyor's fees for the gymnasium at Galway could be translated into a new building at Athlone, the work at Naas Barracks, and so forth.  When I was asked where I would get the money, I said I would have to bring in a Supplementary Estimate.  I do not have to bring in a Supplementary Estimate for more money but I have to bring in a Supplementary Estimate now to get the £10 to carry it because I effected a saving in the Department.</P>

      <P>Actually, the Athlone project was not involved.  The Minister definitely stated that the works were for Cork, Galway and Naas. There is no use in trailing in Athlone now.  Athlone is the centre of the Minister's constituency.  I have no doubt the Minister was fighting a stern election battle but I am not concerned with that.  I am concerned only with the misrepresentation that was involved in the statement made by the Minister&mdash;a misrepresentation that, to my mind, reflected on me as a Minister and on the officials of the Department of Defence.  As I have already said, neither I nor my officials could put up works for which no approval had been secured, no matter what the sum.</P>

      <P>As a means towards protecting and developing the Irish woollen weaving industry imports of woollen and worsted piece goods have, since 1935, been prohibited, except under licence, under the Control of Imports (Quota No. 13) Order, 1935. Following representations that imports of spun rayon cloths, manufactured to resemble woollen and worsted suitings, were being sold here in competition with the products of the woollen weaving industry, the Government, on the 23rd May, 1952, made an Order entitled Control of Imports (Quota No. 13) (Artificial Silk Piece Goods Amendment) Order, 1952, which prohibited, except under licence, the importation of woven piece goods containing more than 85 per cent. by weight of artificial silk staple fibre which exceeded eight ounces in weight per square yard. This Order was confirmed by resolutions passed by the Dáil and Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Evidence was later produced to show that certain importers were offering spun rayon suitings and gaberdines containing less than 85 per cent. by weight of artificial silk staple fibre and the continued unrestricted importation of such cloths would have defeated the purpose of the original Order.  The Government, accordingly, made a <Col N="888" /> further amending Order in September, 1953, entitled Control of Imports (Quota No. 13) (Artificial Silk Piece Goods Amendment) (No. 2) Order, 1953, the effect of which was to extend the scope of the quota on spun rayon suitings to cloths of not less than 40 per cent. by weight of artificial silk staple fibre.  This Order also was confirmed by resolutions passed by the Dáil and Seanad.</P>
    <P>During the year 1954 it was established that substantial orders had been placed with continental suppliers for cloths exceeding eight ounces in weight per square yard, which by reason of the introduction of continuous filament rayon fibres and other fibres had been brought outside the scope of the quota.  At the same time, representations were received from the woollen mills that their production of lightweight cloths not exceeding eight ounces in weight per square yard were being severely affected by imports of rayon cloths mainly of continental origin.</P>
    <P>As there had already been a number of amendments made it was decided, in the interests of clarity, to codify existing amendments and the further changes necessary to deal with the cloths to which I have referred, in one consolidating Order.</P>
    <P>The Government, accordingly, made a further amending Order entitled Control of Imports (Quota No. 13) (Woven Woollen and Synthetic and Artificial Fabrics) (Amendment) Order, 1954; to give effect to these proposals. This Order was made by the Government on the 19th October, 1954, and came into operation on the 2nd November, 1954.</P>
    <P>Subsequent to the making of the Control of Imports (Quota No. 13) (Woven Woollen and Synthetic and Artificial Fabrics) (Amendment) Order, 1954, it emerged that certain difficulties had arisen due to an exemption in that Order for cloths containing a fancy weave.  On 25th January, 1955, the Government, accordingly, made a further Order entitled Control of Imports (Quota No. 13) (Woven Woollen and Synthetic and Artificial <Col N="889" /> Fabrics) (Amendment) Order, 1955, revoking this exemption.  This Order came into operation on the 1st February, 1955.</P>

      <P>We can all agree that if it is necessary to restrict the import of these woven woollen and synthetic and artificial fabrics, particularly from continental sources, in the interests of Irish woollen industry it should be done.  There should be no doubt that the steps to be taken will be sufficiently effective to enable our own woollen mills to maintain their position.  It is lamentable that these synthetic fabrics are interfering to the extent they are with employment in Irish industry.</P>
      <P>From the point of view of quality and value for money, our Irish woollen mills can produce as good a product and as attractive and well-wearing a product as anything that comes from a continental or other source.  At a time when woollens and tweeds are in the fashion in a way they have never been before in our memory in all the fashion houses in Europe, it seems extraordinary that it should be necessary to import these synthetic and artificial fabrics to the detriment of old-established traditional Irish industries in which we all take a keen interest.</P>
      <P>I would like to congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on the steps that have been taken to achieve that employment as far as it can be ensured will be maintained in our Irish woollen mills.</P>

      <P>Many people in the country looked with hope to the Minister's speech on this Estimate.  Unfortunately, they have been very disillusioned indeed.  For the most part, the Minister indulged in generalities and in no instance did he give a specific case of anything which was being done by his Department, except one mention of the oil refinery.  That has disillusioned many industrialists in the country as a whole and it has disillusioned many of those who voted for the inter-Party Government in the last election or for their candidates.</P>
      <P>There are some points which I think should be referred to specifically when the Minister is replying.  I and other Deputies find from time to time that when we put down a question here about C.I.E. the Minister invariably says that he has no function.  He dealt with C.I.E. at very great length in his speech.  What I want to know is, if he has no function in the operating of C.I.E., would he tell me why he interfered with a major decision taken by the entire board and unanimously agreed by them?  I refer to the decision by C.I.E. to establish in Limerick a steam locomotive repair unit.  I understand that that industry&mdash;it could be called an industry&mdash;would have meant 120 employees coming from Dublin to the City of Limerick and I understand also that, in due course, these 120 keymen would have trained other operatives and that an apprenticeship scheme was to be initiated.  It would have meant to the City of Limerick over £60,000 a year in revenue, in wages, and would also have been of great benefit to the rates of the city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister gave as an explanation in relation to one question I put down here that he had no function in the matter and then, when I asked why this decision had been reversed, he said he had made representations to C.I.E.  The Minister cannot have it both ways.  If he has no function, why did he make representations?  The full board of C.I.E. unanimously adopted this decision and then the Minister <Col N="891" /> interfered and used his position.  I should like him to give a detailed statement on that matter.  The employment position in Limerick is not good to-day and this would have meant quite a lot to us down there.</P>
    <P>When I raised the question of the scrapping of the timber wagons, I again got the answer that the Minister had no function.  I again point out to him, as he has interested himself so vitally in the affairs of C.I.E., that every week timber wagons are being scrapped in Limerick for the sake of a cost of £50 or £60 and being sent to Cork and eventually to Haulbowline.  I do not think that is good enough and the Minister should find out the exact details of that situation.  If he wants any further assistance from me, I shall be glad to help him in that line.  I have heard it discussed by workers, supporters of all political Parties, in the locomotive works in Limerick and they say that it is fantastic that this policy of scrapping timber wagons for the sake of such a small expenditure should be pursued.  We all know what Limerick suffered in the past under the Coalition Government.  We know that the wagon shops which were to be built there and which would have given a great deal of employment were scrapped and I can hardly be blamed, therefore, if I get up here to look after the interests of Limerick, in view of what took place in the past and what has taken place in the very recent past.</P>
    <P>The previous Government earmarked a sum of £20,000 from the National Development Fund for the construction of a bridge or a tunnel across the main Limerick-Cork road in connection with the link line connecting the cement factory with the railway station.  That sum has been taken out of the allocations from the National Development Fund and C.I.E has now published its intention and has lodged its plans under the Transport Act of 1950. I have inspected these plans and I find that they show a level crossing.  I submit that, if anything, the tendency is&mdash; and it had the unanimous support of all parties previously&mdash;that level crossings should be done away with on main <Col N="892" /> trunk roads.  It is a very serious thing that, on the main Limerick-Cork road, 220 yards from the regional hospital, C.I.E. should put down a level crossing.</P>
    <P>I cannot see why that sum of £20,000 was taken from us in Limerick.  The Minister for Agriculture took £600,000 from us when he transferred the bovine tuberculosis scheme up to Sligo. Perhaps he had grounds for doing so, but I do say that the Minister should seriously consider making this allocation for a tunnel or a bridge across this main trunk road.  Most Deputies know the Dublin-Limerick road and they know that five miles from Limerick, at Lisnagry, there is a level crossing and that, for some reason best known to C.I.E. when a train is at Castleconnell, cars on either side are held up for quite long periods.  I am sure that every Deputy has had that experience.  I think it was the intention of the previous Government to earmark a sum for a tunnel or a bridge in that area also.  However, it is a matter of major policy which was agreed on by C.I.E., but, due to the intervention of the Minister, or the Government as a whole, the idea has been dropped and it is just another case of money allocated to Limerick&mdash; in this case, £20,000&mdash;which would not have cost the ratepayers one penny being taken from us.</P>
    <P>While dealing with C.I.E., there is another matter in regard to which the Minister might have inquiries made&mdash; the complete lack of bus shelters in the city.  It is not my intention to go over all the policy of the Minister, but I am citing certain specific matters.  I have made representations on several occasions to C.I.E., with a view to having bus shelters erected in the city, but we have got no satisfaction whatever. Certainly their suggestion that, in places, the footpaths are too small or too narrow could not stand up.  The Minister surely cannot say again that he has no function in the matter and that it is a matter for C.I.E., because the Minister interested himself very vitally in the Dún Laoghaire-Dublin route and expressed himself very strongly in this House as being of the opinion that the services given by C.I.E. on that run were totally unsuitable <Col N="893" /> and inadequate.  The Minister can interest himself in these matters and surely he will not forget that there is a city called Limerick and will make representations with a view to getting something done for the unfortunate citizens there who are being drowned every year.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in the whole of his speech, made no reference at all to prices.  Only last Sunday, I was looking again at the document that was hawked around&mdash;they should get a hawker's licence for it&mdash;setting out the prices prevailing in 1951 and in 1954.  It is not my intention to give any more quotations&mdash;we have had enough quotations from election addresses&mdash; but at the bottom of the document there is: &ldquo;Vote Fine Gael for better times.&rdquo;  The citizens of this country know now what they are getting.  They are getting &ldquo;quare times&rdquo;, and it is not Pat Taaffe who is riding&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but Costello, trained by Larkin.  Two of the most important statements on this Estimate were those made by Deputy Kyne and Deputy Larkin.  I wonder did many people take notice of what Deputy Kyne said?  We have Fine Gael, as usual, screaming they made no promises and we have one of the stalwarts of the Labour Party using these words:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I know exactly the promises that were made.  I was the instrument of the Party here in relation to certain essential promises.  I remember quite well what was said: `We would not take part in any Government, and neither would we support a Government, which would not undertake to bring down the prices of essential commodities to the level of the 1952 Budget.  We will not fall down on that promise.  That promise was firmly made.  We have indicated that should subsidies be required they would be made available.  We are of that opinion still'.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the Labour Party and these are <Col N="894" /> the words of Deputy Kyne on the 23rd February.  He then goes to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is sufficient to say that the Labour Party was instrumental in putting as much pressure as possible on the whole Cabinet and to say to them: &lsquo;We feel it is essential that the public should not receive the full impact of an increase in the price of tea&rsquo;...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The operative word there is &ldquo;pressure&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is Volume 148, No. 5, of the Official Debates.  I have been quoting from columns 714-715. As I say, the operative word there is &ldquo;pressure&rdquo;.  By the talk that went on in this House from Fine Gael one would think it was a unanimous decision they lauded it so much but the word &ldquo;pressure&rdquo; would suggest that there was some objection or resistance.  To every action there was an equal reaction.  Evidently, we find out from Deputy Kyne that there was not such unanimity after all.  The matter was discussed at length and there were quite considerable objections. However, Deputy Kyne is evidently far more explicit than the Minister has been in his speech dealing with this matter.  Great note should be taken of that speech by Deputy Kyne and great note has been taken by this side of the House.  It will be used on all possible occasions and we hope much sooner than is expected by members of the Government.</P>
      <P>I would also like to refer to a very important statement made by Deputy J. Larkin on the 17th February when speaking on the Second Stage of the Supplies and Services Bill.  Deputy Larkin said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;...where economic factors were such that it was not possible to bring down the price of essential foods, then, in our opinion, the policy of subsidisation should be utilised.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He then goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;As far as I know, the Labour <Col N="895" /> Party has not changed its view on that up to to-night....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&mdash;that is the 17th February, 1955&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...nor, I think, are we likely to do so.</P>
    <P>But having said that, it does not alter the fact that the election is now some eight months behind us and that in the meantime the problem of prices has still continued to be a problem.  It is quite correct to say, I suppose, that some 15 to 20 items of various kinds have increased in price. Some of them we can easily try to dismiss by the argument that they are not essential.  While the increase in the price of coffee, for instance, has its own significance, nobody is going to suggest that it has the same significance as increases in the price of bread, tea or sugar.  What is significant is that among the number of items in regard to which prices have increased there are some important food groups.  There has been an increase in the price of tea.  There has been, as usual, a periodic or seasonal increase in the price of eggs though the price of eggs is now coming down.  We have had increases in the price of such commodities as cocoa and oatenmeal.  There are essential foods.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then he goes on to make a very important statement:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I think any member of this House who tries to shut his eyes to these happenings or tries to argue that there has been no increase, and that everything in the garden is lovely, is not only being foolish from a political point of view but is storing up trouble for himself. The situation with which we are faced is present to the mind of every Party.  There has been a small or large increase in the price of a number of items, some of them important, some of them not so important. Some of us have the feeling that the index has not changed more than one or two points, that the situation is not serious, and that, maybe, if we hold on for a couple of months more, the index will drop to the previous figure.  My fear is that <Col N="896" /> we are in a situation which, if we do not try to deal with it now, will develop in the next two or three months to a point where we shall not be able to stop a really significant increase in prices and the cost of living, because prices are like a snowball.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is Deputy J. Larkin.  I think members on all sides of the House have taken serious note of his remarks.</P>
    <P>I would also refer the Minister to his statement in connection with the tanning industry as a whole.  I asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he would take any specific steps to try to see that the oldest industry in Limerick City would be re-established after the disastrous fire which took place some years ago.  He said that was a matter for the firm concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The firm is re-established and is functioning.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The question the Deputy asked me was whether I would make them rebuild.  I have no power to make them rebuild.  The Deputy should tell the facts to the House.  He said rebuild and not re-establish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I also asked the Minister to use his good offices with the firm.  I certainly think the Minister would do a good day's work for Limerick if he could endeavour to arrange a conference with the directors of this firm.  Now the Minister has stated that the company is operating, I would like him to make a note of the fact that this firm is operating under the most appalling conditions.  I am not so much interested in the directors as I am in the welfare of the workers. They are working there under a makeshift factory of galvanised sheets with the rain coming through and 80 per cent. of the workers work for long periods out in the open.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not agree the Minister can say that that factory is re-established.  I wonder if the Minister is aware that after the fire four years ago the directors of this factory got an option <Col N="897" /> from the Limerick Corporation of eight acres of land?  That was four years ago and they have not yet done anything about building the factory.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>And for three out of those four years the Deputy's Government was in office.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not necessarily mean because my Government was in office that I could be in agreement with everything that might or might not be done if it affected Limerick City.  It is quite possible that I might have got up and spoken a few choice words to Deputy Lemass if the position which obtains now obtained then. However, I do not think the Minister has as many facts about this matter as I have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has the choice words.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have.  I sincerely hope that in view of what I said to him&mdash;I intend writing to him further on the matter&mdash;he will try to do something for this very old industry which existed in Limerick.  The Minister told me, in reply to a question in connection with employment in the Limerick clothing factory, that he had no function in the matter, but, from the information he had received, he was satisfied that no serious unemployment had taken place or was taking place in the factory in question.  I can tell the Minister now that there are dismissals weekly.  I can assure him that the people affected are not casual employees but employees who have been there for many years.  The company is working on short time.  I would appeal to the Minister to consider the position of that factory at the present moment.</P>
      <P>The Minister was, unfortunately, not present for the most important matter I wanted to raise on this Estimate in connection with the steam locomotive repair depot in Limerick. However, I will not traverse that ground again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I asked a question recently about the scarcity of anthracite in Limerick City and the Minister said that his information was that there was no undue scarcity and that no representations <Col N="898" /> had been made to him by the merchants.  I can assure the Minister, and I am sure the other Deputies representing Limerick City will bear me out in this, that there is a very acute shortage of anthracite in Limerick.  It may seem like parish pump politics to be discussing a shortage of anthracite in Limerick here in this House, but the matter is a serious one for the people concerned and I would appeal to the Minister to use his good offices with those responsible for allocating anthracite to Limerick to ensure that the supply position improves.</P>
    <P>Shannon airport is a matter of importance to us in Limerick and indeed to the whole country.  The Minister referred in great detail to the position of Shannon airport and I am glad to know that the position is not as bad as was expected.  I have no intention now of taunting the Minister; indeed I congratulate him on the conversion that has taken place in his outlook both with regard to Shannon airport and Collinstown.  We all know the strong ideas the Minister had with regard to the operation of these airports prior to the last election.  It is gratifying to note that the Minister, having had certain facts and figures put before him, now appreciates that these airports are a sound proposition for the future of the country as a whole.  Certainly, if a Fine Gael Deputy were Minister for Industry and Commerce to-day we all know the cuts that would have been made in relation to those airports.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on being man enough to take the proper course having ascertained the full facts and come to an appreciation of the full position.  One of the first question I put down here was to ask the Minister if there was any likelihood of a reduction in the staffs at Shannon airport and Collinstown airport, and I pointed out to him then that the gravest anxiety existed among the employees and their families; the Minister's reply was that such anxiety only existed in the unstable and fickle mind of the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has announced that extensions are to take place at Shannon airport in connection with the restaurant and passenger accommodation generally.  When he comes to reply I hope he will be a little more detailed and state when these extensions will take place.</P>
      <P>I understand there is a possibility of Aer Rianta or Aer Lingus making spare parts for their planes.  In that connection I ask the Minister to bear Shannon in mind.  He must recollect, above all, the very serious action of the last Coalition Government in scrapping the Lockheed repair factory in Shannon.  Several hundreds could have been employed in that, but, as a result of the action of the Government of the day, they were compelled to seek employment elsewhere.  Limerick City, Limerick County and County Clare suffered very much as a result of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has stated that he has caused Irish Shipping Limited to have inquiries made into the possibility of having a transatlantic shipping service. The Minister has not been <Col N="900" /> specific.  He did not tell us what the terms of reference are or when he expects to have a report.  The Minister could come in here and say that he has asked the directors of Dunsink Observatory to let him have a report on a passenger plane service to the moon.</P>
    <P>That means nothing as far as the general public is concerned.  The Minister knows quite well in his heart that there is no future for this country in a transatlantic shipping service.  He must agree that the whole tendency to-day is towards air transport.  Now that his conversion is complete, I hope that he will ask for a report on the possibility of opening up a transatlantic airline service, a service which was dropped by the previous Coalition.  If the Minister looks into the matter&mdash;he has not said anything about it so far&mdash;I am sure he will agree that there is a much greater possibility of establishing a transatlantic airline service between this country and the United States than there is of establishing a passenger liner service.</P>
    <P>I feel that this Government like the previous inter-Party Government has completely neglected the third largest city in the State.  I think it is about time that the actions of this Government both now and on the last occasion when they were in office were exposed. It would take too long to go into each matter in detail, but I dealt with some of the more important ones before the Minister came in.  To cite another small example: the Minister betook himself to Killaloe and went up the Shannon to get a first-hand account of the possibilities and potentialities of having passenger boats on the upper and middle reaches of the Shannon.  That idea of his has evidently become a fact and when I put down a question to him as to whether he would use his good offices with C.I.E. to have a passenger service from Limerick to Cappagh I got the usual stereotyped answer that the Minister had no function in the matter but understood C.I.E. were at present contemplating passenger services on the middle and upper reaches of the Shannon.</P>
    <P>I cannot see for the life of me why the Minister would not also consider <Col N="901" /> asking C.I.E. to try if the service I refer to could not be given.  I understand there was a passenger service between Limerick and Cappagh at one time, and it was availed of and was a financial success.  I think, due to the location of Limerick City, such a service would have a great tourist attraction and would also be a considerable financial success.  The Minister might consider that point.</P>
    <P>The Minister, on the question of tourism, has gone into the greatest detail in speaking in this House about the attractive fisheries which exist for sportsmen in this country and about how it should be possible to attract many visitors from Britain.  The Minister must well know that the greatest stretch of salmon fishing that this country ever knew was the Shannon at Castleconnell.  I am not talking about the salmon weir at Galway&mdash; that is only murder and there is no art in that.  The Minister must know that the Shannon at Castleconnell and the Enright rod were world famous, and now, due to action proposed by the E.S.B., which I brought to the attention of the Minister and on which he got misleading information from the board, it is proposed to have a fish pass erected at Ardnacrusha on the head race and that means, in fact, that the salmon will by-pass Castleconnell and land up in Lough Derg.  There has been talk of erecting a bridge across the Shannon at Castleconnell. We would like a bridge there, with apologies to Deputy Corry, but there are other places that want these facilities.</P>
    <P>There was a good deal of talk about developing Castleconnell as part of the tourist industry.  A new industry has started there now or rather has been revised.  I refer to the Enright rod.  I know the Minister is genuine when he speaks of the great potentialities which exist from the point of view of salmon and trout fisheries, but a very serious position will arise if the E.S.B. proposal is allowed to go through.  The Minister cannot get away from it by saying that he has no function.  He can use his good offices with the board. The Minister often said he had no function with C.I.E., but if it appeared <Col N="902" /> to him that an injustice would be done due to an action of the board he stepped in.  He stepped in when there was a suggestion that the locomotive repair shops be set up in Limerick and that 120 families be brought from Dublin.  He used his good offices there with effect to see that that did not happen.</P>
    <P>I say to him now that in the interests of the tourist industry and in the interests of this vast area of the Shannon, he should have the whole position examined by impartial experts, or that is the end of Castleconnell and that is the end of fishing on the Shannon, the part of the Shannon, anyway, that is called the lower reaches of the Shannon.</P>
    <P>When we came back to office when the Coalition was defeated on the last occasion, we completed the cement factory extension which had been knocked on the head by the Coalition, and, as a result of that Coalition action, the people who bought houses since then have been paying very dearly because foreign cement had to be imported and a subsidy paid.  The time has now arrived, evidently, when the maximum output of Drogheda and Limerick is not fully absorbed by this country alone and it appears&mdash;and I am informed by people who know much more about it than I do&mdash;that there is no reason why Cement Ireland, Ltd., would not go into the export trade.</P>

I wonder would they have been in this market if the Coalition had killed the plans for the extension in Drogheda and Limerick?  That is the best bit of news that I have heard for a long time.</P>

      <P>I am amazed that the Minister made no reference to it.  On the question of the oil refinery, I was interested in trying to put in a word for Limerick but I thought I might do more harm than good because some of the Cork Deputies on either side of the House might speak up.  That does not mean I am going to injure the future of this industry first envisaged by Deputy Lemass.  The Minister has not told us why have Esso, Caltex and Shell been given plenary powers in setting up this refinery.  What about the very many other small companies which exist in this country?  Are these three large firms to have a cartel and can the Minister say whether or not, as a result of the setting up of the refinery, oil prices will be reduced?  Recently the O.E.E.C. published a report wherein they alleged a ring existed in oil prices throughout the world and I think the Minister, before he agreed to allow these three companies to set up a refinery, should have been in a position to obtain further information and be in a position to give the members of the House further detailed information on what will be one of the most important projects or proposals ever to come before this House or to be decided in this country.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following amendment:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Before Section 5 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Act, 1926, is hereby amended by the addition of the following paragraph to subsection (1):</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(d)  rate collectors.&rdquo;&mdash;(Deputies McQuillan and Sheldon.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>We were discussing amendment No. 5 with amendments Nos. 6 and 31 and something of a difficulty arose by reason of the fact that amendment No. 31 apparently <Col N="904" /> cannot be taken at this stage.  I was rather hopeful that some procedure could be found whereby we could have a clear-cut vote on the issue whether or not the rate collectors should continue to be appointed by the county councils and that the question of whether they should be appointed through the Local Appointments Commissioners or through an appointments board set up by the county manager could be left over until we had decided the main issue, first of all, of whether or not the House wants to continue the present system whereby they are appointed directly by the county councils.</P>
      <P>I do not want to repeat in detail the views that I expressed the other day on these amendments but I would like to appeal seriously to the Minister to reconsider the whole position.  There is no doubt about it that in many cases these appointments are done on a political basis and in many cases methods amounting to near bribery are used by candidates in order to try to secure appointment as rate collectors. It does seem certainly incompatible with the general policy adopted in regard to local authorities that we should still fasten that liability on members of local councils.</P>
      <P>I know that the Minister has told us that he has obtained the views of a number of councils and that they for the most part expressed themselves in favour of continuing the present system of appointment.  Those views were obtained by the Minister in private consultation with a few members of the county councils.  I doubt very much whether, if the matter were thrashed out publicly at a local meeting, any county councillor would dare to stand up and defend the system which is at present in operation.  Therefore, I do not place very much weight on the fact that selected representatives from county councils have privately informed the Minister that they wish to retain the power of appointing rate collectors. I feel that if the matter were discussed publicly in the local county councils they would realise that the force of public opinion outside is against this system.  Logically, there can be little or no justification for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="905" /> All the other appointments are made either by boards selected by the county manager or through the Local Appointments Commission.  Why this particular system of political patronage should be retained in regard to the appointment of rate collectors is hard to see.  I would ask the Minister to reconsider the position.  I am glad that he has agreed to leave the question to a free vote of the House and I hope that the members of the different Parties will act independently.</P>

If we get the views of the House on that by way of a free vote, then I would give an undertaking to <Col N="906" /> amend by regulation, to comply with what is expressed or, rather, even consult with the Deputies before Report Stage and see if we could come to some agreement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>My objection to the amendments, to be quite frank about it, is that they would take away power from the county councils.  For instance, they would take from the Cork County Council the power which they are exercising at the moment of refusing to appoint a rate collector when a vacancy arises; the Cork County Council allows a central office to do the collection.  That is the trouble with all three amendments&mdash;that they take completely that power away from the <Col N="908" /> county councils, and that is a power which any body of sensible men would like to exercise at the moment in regard to rate collections.</P>
      <P>I pointed out here previously that in Cork, by resolution, when a rate collecting area becomes vacant it is handed over to the office for collection and by that means we save, roughly, something between 2d. and 3d. in the £.  Collection through the office costs something between 2d. and 3½d. and collection through a rate collector costs 7d. in the £.  That is a saving in a period when, to my mind, every possible saving should be made for the benefit of the ratepayers.</P>
      <P>As I said, that is the only difficulty I had with the amendments.  The three amendments completely hand over the power from the local authority of doing what the Cork County Council has done with consequent savings to the ratepayers.  That is my objection to all three.  There is, therefore, no hope of my supporting the three amendments as they are at present.  God knows, I have seen rate collectors enough appointed and rate collectors enough sacked in my time, but in this particular system I think the Minister would be wise if he put something into this Bill that would allow county councils all over the country to have rate collections made through offices.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the point made by Deputy Corry there I should like to clarify the position.  These amendments, to my reading anyway, do not mean that it is essential for a local authority to appoint rate collectors, but where rate collectors are being appointed, under these amendments the local authority must take certain steps in connection with the appointments. There is nothing mandatory under these amendments to force a local authority to appoint rate collectors at all, and I am in perfect agreement with Deputy Corry's views that it would be a much more desirable thing altogether if we could get general agreement that collections would be made under the system at present in operation in Cork.  But it is unfortunate that it will be impossible to get agreement in this House that such a system would be accepted by all local authorities.  However, the safeguard is there for Deputy Corry and for others who think like him, and I am in full agreement with Deputy Corry.  The safeguard is there for local authorities who wish to avail themselves of it&mdash;that the collections may be made through central offices and the question of forcing them to make appointments of rate collectors does not enter into it at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish again to express my personal thanks to the Minister for the way he has met the whole problem here to-night and the other evening.  It is a breath of fresh air in the House to have things discussed on their merits and it is very heartening to think that important matters are left to individual Deputies to exercise their own discretion without their being subject to Party whips all the time.  It is a welcome innovation in this House.  The Minister has suggested in the debate which took place last week on this question that if the appointments were <Col N="910" /> made by the Local Appointments Commission it would mean that all minor appointments would be made by the commission as well.</P>
    <P>I think that could be remedied.  Two of the amendments, particularly amendment No. 5, are very loosely worded but they seek to ensure that if it is considered desirable by this House, very minor appointments can be made by a local board.  But where juicy plums, as I will describe rate collectors' jobs, exist they could not be described as minor appointments. It cannot be denied that to-day there are rate collectors in receipt of between £600 and £800 a year and that is no minor appointment.  We should exercise great caution in the means of appointing individuals to responsible and remunerative posts such as these.</P>
    <P>There are Deputies on all sides of this House who can say in all sincerity that they are satisfied themselves with the system in operation in their own local authorities, where possibly a first-class interview board is set up, but the difficulty is that some local authorities do not decide to set up these interview boards.  What I want to see established is a general system.  It does not matter to me whether it is the Local Appointments Commission or a board set up under the Managerial Act that makes the appointments as long as they are taken out of the political arena.  The two amendments that are here in my name were put down for the sole purpose of ensuring that the best candidates would be selected to fill these posts.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned here to Deputy MacBride the alternative of leaving appointments as a reserved function of the county council or as an executive function.  I understand that an executive function would mean that the appointment could be made by the Local Appointments Commission apart from using the means of a board set up by the county manager.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Regulations could be made governing either, that is, providing the Local Government Bill, which will be discussed in the Seanad tomorrow, goes through.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Minister I have no intention of delaying him on this.  I want to ensure that when this matter goes to a free vote of the House all Deputies are clear in their own mind that what is being decided is whether the appointment of rate collectors is going to be left as it is at the moment, to the individual county councils where in nine cases out of ten the appointments will be made on political pull, or if it is going to be on the basis of his efficiency and general suitability for the position. That is what the House is going to decide in this free vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. D. Larkin Mr. D. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened very carefully to the discussion on these amendments and I would like to say initially that I am all one with Deputy McQuillan when he seeks to have the appointment of rate collectors taken away from elected representatives whether they are county councillors, town commissioners or corporation members.  I feel it is high time that any possibility of patronage by elected political representatives should be removed from these bodies.</P>
      <P>I, fortunately, in my capacity as a member of Dublin Corporation, do not come across this difficulty very much, but even in a small way I have observed down the years that where a position is to be filled by direct vote, whether it is in the corporation or a county council or some other elected body, the members of these bodies immediately become subject to all kinds of pressure, pressure from the ordinary canvassing of candidates themselves, the canvassing of their friends, or maybe political pressure of one kind or another.  Consequently, let me say very briefly that I think this House would do a good day's work if, as regards the appointment of rate collectors, some other system than the present one was introduced.</P>
      <P>Therefore, as this matter is very wisely being left by the Minister to a free vote of the House, I would like to indicate as an individual Deputy that I intend to support the amendment which seeks to remove the appointment of rate collectors from the position of being a reserved function.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="912" /> When that is done, as I hope it will be done, we may find ourselves in some difficulty.  In this House and elsewhere I have expressed some very grave doubts as to the question of whether many posts should be filled by local appointments commissioners. I think posts in local government service, in county councils and particularly in services like the Dublin Corporation&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Dublin Corporation do not like sending very many appointments to the Appointments Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. D. Larkin Mr. D. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saying that.  I think provision can be made to give due reward to the people who serve on these bodies.  It has been mentioned before, and I am sure it will be mentioned again, that people who enter service in public bodies and give long years of loyal and conscientious service feel that they are entitled to promotion when vacancies occur not in positions where there are plums but in posts where there is responsibility and some reward for long service. Therefore, I may find myself in some difficulty because of amendments Nos. 5 and 6.  However, there appears to be this particular choice, that at least there is some hope of persuading the Minister to deal with the filling of the vacancies on some agreed and reasonable basis.  But there is no hope of doing that as long as this House says that the appointment should be a reserved function.</P>
      <P>It seems, first of all, we have the difficulty of tying one knot and possibly tying another one which we subsequently have to loosen.  However, I am supporting amendment No. 31.  I am also supporting the other amendments, Nos 5 and 6, because I think what, in effect, they do is to set down what would really be the effect of removing the appointment of rate collectors from the elected members.  I think&mdash;the Minister might correct me if I am wrong&mdash;that once you remove the appointment of rate collectors from the elected members, there has to be some other system of appointment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. D. Larkin Mr. D. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.  That is actually contained, generally speaking, in these two amendments Nos. 5 and 6. In conclusion, may I say I do not know whether there are any other posts of this nature left in the county councils or elsewhere?  If this is the last one, I think it is a good day's work to see that this post is filled either by way of merit, by way of ability or by reference to service, but at least not as a result of political patronage and that only.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose as elected politicians all of us here consider it our right to take away minor functions from any set of elected politicians down the country if we can do so, we being the superior body of elected politicians who, through political patronage, found our seats in this House.  People are canvassed, and their doors are knocked on 100 times during an election campaign, more often than the door of a county councillor would be knocked on to elect a rate collector. We find ourselves in this House endeavouring to decide how rates shall be collected, and whether or not we shall take away from the elected representatives the bit of power they have.  The Minister, or his predecessor, has not come here and told us that there were abuses or weaknesses in the system, and that it should be changed.</P>
      <P>I am sure that the Minister for Local Government, if advised, would feel that that was so, and on the first opportunity&mdash;he had an opportunity recently on the Local Government Bill and he has one under this Bill&mdash;tell the House that he felt the law should be changed in the matter of appointing rate collectors.  A person coming here for the first time and listening to us politicians talking about political patronage, and about the wiles and ills of politics up and down the country, would think that none of us ever heard of a politician before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two systems in operation at the moment by which a county council can appoint rate collectors. They can be appointed either by direct <Col N="914" /> vote of the county council or, if the council so wishes, they can be appointed by the Local Appointments Commission or the selection board. That power is there at the moment. The county councils, if they so desire, can suggest that they wish the rate collectors appointed by the selection board, or appointed by the direct vote of the council.</P>
    <P>There are three systems by which rates can be collected, and the third is a postal system.  By a free vote, they can opt to have whichever of the three systems they choose.  No amendment of the law is required.  We have the three systems in operation in this country.  We had the system in operation, I think, in County Kerry for a number of years, where all the rates were collected through the post.  That system broke down completely, with the result that, as regards rate collection, chaos reigned in that county.  The county manager was advised to revert to the collection of rates by rate collectors. Kerry County Council did that.  Cork County Council adopted the system of collecting rates by post and, according to Deputy MacCarthy, they find that the system is working satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>It was pointed out on the last occasion that they were operating all three systems at the moment, and had a big number of rate collectors who were appointed by the direct vote of the council.  The postal system was working well; otherwise I think Corkmen would not tolerate it.  Rate collectors are doing their work well.  It is suggested here by some members that there is bound to be abuse because of political influence.  That is all nonsense. It comes very badly from politicians. They all have political views one way or the other.  Let us hope so. No man can tell me he is not interested in politics.  I have said it before, and I say it again, that he is not a person at all who has not some view on public affairs, on political Parties, and all the rest of it.  Whatever way they are elected, they are elected through an independent vote, before the Press and the public, and each and every member of the council casts his vote in whatever direction he desires.  There is no doubt about it.  It is as free as <Col N="915" /> any vote we take here; in fact, much freer.</P>
    <P>The Minister has suggested that he will leave this matter to a free vote of the House.  When that comes from the Government Benches we know what it always means.  We are long enough here to know that.  It means a free vote of his own Party and the free vote of the Parties supporting the Government.</P>

      <P>We spent three and a half hours on the last occasion discussing them.  I was not influenced by anything I heard against the system.  This Bill, as I said before, was introduced by the Minister for Local Government to give back some powers to members of local authorities under the Management Act.  It is now suggested that we will have a free vote on this one question of whether it will be reserved to the local authority to decide in the selection of a rate collector or whether it will be an executive function, that is, a function whereby the rate collectors will be selected through the managerial machine.  That is what it amounts to, nothing else.  Instead of giving them back powers, the members of Dáil Éireann are discussing whether they should take this power from local authorities: they are discussing whether they should further restrict the powers of local authorities or not. I have not read the heading of the Bill but I wonder whether or not it is a Bill to give back more power to the local authorities.</P>
      <P>In his opening statement, the Minister said he proposed to give back and improve the powers which local authorities possessed.  The members of Dáil Éireann are setting out to restrict the powers.  There has been no proof and no Deputy has suggested that there has been corruption or serious abuse or that any responsible Minister for Local Government could be influenced. Nobody has said that the system is bad or that there is anything wrong with it.  I am a member of a local authority and the group to which I belong in that local authority do not represent the majority there. Within the past couple of years we have had to make a number of appointments and these appointments were made by the groups that formed the majority on that council.</P>

      <P>I hope that any person selected by the Local Appointments Commission, by the local selection board or by the county council will be independent enough to have political views, whatever they may be.  Is it the desire that only Simon Pures should be selected?  Is it the desire that only people who hold no political views whatsoever will be selected by, for instance, the Local Appointments Commission? The Local Appointments Commission make their selection behind closed doors and the local selection board will make their selection behind closed doors.  Two or three individuals will determine every selection. There is no doubt about that. Whatever their views, each and every one of them will be politicians.</P>
      <P>It is foolish to think that this earth is a bit of heaven and that everything will be done according to the rules and as it would be done in heaven.  That does not happen on earth.  We are all earthly individuals and, while we remain so, we will make earthly selections according to our own views.  In my opinion, the county council who make their selection by way of open vote will make fewer mistakes than the Local Appointments Commission or the local selection board.  The county council is composed of men and women drawn from all walks of life in their particular county.  They will make fewer mistakes than would be made under any other system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that, almost without exception, every one of the rate collectors who have been selected in Ireland in the past 20 years has given good service in the respective counties.  If there have been exceptions, they are few and far between.  These rate collectors have given very satisfactory service, no matter what political views they may hold.  They are members of the community in their own county&mdash;<Col N="918" /> the Offaly man, the Longford man, the Wexford man, and so forth.  I assert that not a single one of these people would have got the appointment through the Local Appointments Commission. Consider the position of a farmer's son or a working man's son who attended the national school up to sixth standard.  We all know the good education that is given in the national school, and we all know that these people are quite qualified to collect rates.  However, if the system were changed not one of these men would be earning £400, £500 or £600 per annum in his own county.</P>
    <P>We know well the types of people a local selection board or the Local Appointments Commission would get: they would get first class people, estimable in their own way.  They would get careerists who have studied and trained with a view to getting these non-technical posts.  All that is necessary for these posts is an ordinary education and to know the people you will be working amongst so that you can press a person whom you know is well-off to pay his rates within the required period and, on the other hand, ease off where, for instance, you know an unfortunate person is down on his luck.  These rate collectors are natives of the county they work in.  I believe the present system is good and I am convinced Dáil Éireann would be very foolish to depart from it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture (Mr. O. Flanagan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not detained this House by making a speech for quite a while, but I could not allow this opportunity to pass without making my contribution, small and all as it may be, to this very important debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Listening to Deputy Allen and other Deputies who made reference to politicians and to politics, one would be inclined to think that there was no such thing as an honest person in politics or that a politician could not be honest.  I am a politician and I am very proud to be a politician.  I believe it is a very great calling and it is a calling of which we can be proud.  What greater honour can be bestowed upon a person than to be elected to our Parliament by people <Col N="919" /> who have confidence in us and who trust us to do our job here?  For these reasons I feel that sometimes when we refer to politics and to politicians we are inclined to bring a very high profession very low and that, instead of trying to belittle the profession, we should endeavour to boast of it and to be proud of it.</P>
    <P>The matter of the appointment of rate collectors is very important.  I have been associated with a local authority for 14 years.  At every meeting of that local authority some county councillor has remarked that they were wasting their time attending county council meetings as they had no power or authority except the striking of the rate and the appointment of rate collectors.  Here, we have three amendments asking this House to take away from the elected representatives of the people the power to appoint rate collectors.  I was present at many a meeting of the local authority of which I have the honour to be a member and I have voted on the appointment of rate collectors. I have voted for Fianna Fáil nominees and Fianna Fáil nominees have voted for Fine Gael nominees. There may be isolated cases.  Every county in Ireland is not like Galway so far as the political framework there is concerned.  We have many local authorities who are prepared to come together&mdash;Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Labour&mdash;and, when appointments such as this are to be made, they will appoint the person best entitled to the job and the best qualified.</P>
    <P>One of these amendments asks that the appointment of rate collectors be left to the Local Appointments Commission. If the Local Appointments Commission had the appointing of the Deputies of Dáil Éireann I say that 75 or 80 per cent. of us would not be here and, in the event of the Local Appointments Commission having the appointment of rate collectors, I expect they would require applicants to have a university degree, a very good knowledge of the Irish language and, generally, very high educational qualifications.  The result would be that the labouring man's son down the <Col N="920" /> country&mdash;who would not have high educational qualifications but who would be looked upon by the people in general as very honest and very suitable for the post&mdash;would not have a hope of being appointed a rate collector.</P>
    <P>If, as one amendment asks, this House agrees that the county manager will appoint the rate collector, it must be borne in mind and admitted by every Deputy that you have politically-minded county managers as well.  It must be borne in mind by all Parties and it must be admitted that whatever the political mind of the county managers&mdash;and more than half of the county managers are politically-minded &mdash;if county managers set up the board to appoint rate collectors, they will put nominees on the board of their own, that is of their own way of thinking, their own colleagues, their own friends; and those people on the interview board will favour and appoint whomever the county manager tells them to appoint.  Everybody knows, over the past 14 years, ever since the County Management Act became law, of instances such as that.</P>
    <P>Deputies would be well advised to examine the duties that must be performed by a rate collector.  He must collect the rates.  He has the power and the authority to give time to unfortunate people who may not be able to meet moieties when they become due.  The county manager has not that power; the county council as a body has not that power; but the rate collector himself can use his own discretion in giving time to a ratepayer. He will press for the collection of rates on a particular day as they become due, but if he does not like, he need not.  The rate collector has another very important function&mdash;he can levy, he can seize, he can seize the last four-legged beast from some unfortunate person, in spite of his difficulties, the sickness, the bad weather and failure of the crops or other difficulties which may arise whereby he cannot meet his rates.  A local rate collector will not do that, but if the appointment is made by the Local Appointments Commission and someone is appointed who has not an intimate <Col N="921" /> knowledge of the local conditions, the financial circumstances of the ratepayer and the general financial conditions of all the ratepayers in his area, it would lead to very serious criticism by the local authority.</P>
    <P>The rate collector has more power than that&mdash;he assists in the compiling of the register of electors.  Assuming for a moment that in a country district you have an appointment made by the Local Appointments Commission, of someone who has not an intimate knowledge of the district, he can only compile the register on information passed on to him from somebody else. The collection of rates, the granting of time to unfortunate people who cannot meet their rates on the appointed day, the making out of the Electors List and the right to seize and levy, are very important functions held by rate collectors.  It is most important that the right type of person should be chosen.  There is no local collector who &mdash;when he comes, as one of the ordinary ratepayers himself, from a working-class family, who has an intimate knowledge of his friends and neighbours in the area&mdash;who is going to have recourse to the drastic action that a rate collector can take.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I think this House would be very unwise to have rate collectors appointed by the commission.  We do not know who they are.  They may be politically-minded, for all we know. We do not know the inside workings of the commission.  We have experience of many cases where accountants were appointed, secretaries of county councils, county medical officers, assistant medical officers of health, and where resolutions of protest were sent to the Department, because the local authority were of opinion that the wrong person had been appointed.  It may or may not have been that the best qualified persons secured appointment by the commission, but it did not meet with the wishes of the elected representatives of the people in that area.</P>
    <P>On the whole, this is a Bill to give back powers to the local authority, and this amendment is going the wrong way about it.  It is killing the purpose for which the Bill was brought before <Col N="922" /> the House.  The only fault I find is that greater and wider powers are not given in it to local authorities and that the Local Appointments Commission and the county manager are not being deprived of making other important appointments which they can make at present.  However, this House to-night will deal with rate collectors.  Let us hope and trust that, in the wisdom of this House, the appointment of rate collectors will not be handed over either to the commission or to the county manager.  We know very well that 90 per cent. of the appointments made by the county manager are most unsatisfactory and are the subject of criticism by local authorities.</P>
    <P>On this question of men being appointed rate collectors because they are Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil or Labour, that is all ballyhoo.  It may be so in a particular case where a political Party has a very large majority on a council, but there are very few councils in Ireland to-day where one Party has a complete majority.  It would be very unwise of Deputies supporting the Government to give this authority now to the Local Appointments Commission or to the county manager, when for over 20 years the Opposition has enjoyed the benefit of such appointments.</P>
    <P>I am not afraid to stand up in this House&mdash;I have always voted according to my conscience&mdash;as a member of the Party to which I now have the honour to belong, and to say here that in so far as the appointment of rate collectors in County Laois is concerned, we always considered first the financial circumstances of the applicant.  I am glad to say, and I hope it will continue, that the last thing to be considered was his political outlook or Party affiliations.  If the county manager had the appointment&mdash;and there are Deputies in the House who know that to be a fact&mdash;in cases where you have politically-minded managers, and that is over half of them, the first consideration would be the political outlook of the applicant.  Therefore, I hope this House will reject these amendments and that the majority of the House will favour the retention by the local authority of this very important <Col N="923" /> function, the making of these very important appointments of rate collectors.</P>
    <P>We should not forget that the majority of local authorities are comprised of decent men, businessmen, farmers, professional people and labouring and working-class people, who know their job.  In the case of an important appointment such as this, which they have had and which they hold, it would be wrong for this House to deprive them of the making of future appointments of rate collectors. I hope all Deputies will realise that it would be dishonest to deprive a local authority of that power.  We know who the local authorities are who would be making these appointments. As Deputy Allen pointed out &mdash;I do not often agree with him, but he is right when he said it&mdash;the vote is open, the vote is public.  In the case of an appointment by the Local Appointments Commission, no one knows what is going on, what is the consideration or the qualifications to be considered of the respective applicants. We do know at a county council meeting that the vote is open and public.  It is the most democratic way in which the important appointment of a rate collector can be made.</P>
    <P>I am certainly going to vote against these amendments, as I do not believe they are honest.  I am going to vote against them because they are going to deprive me of certain powers and authority I have as a county councillor. I am going to see, in so far as my rights as a Deputy are concerned, that I am not going to be deprived of the right I hold to participate in the appointment of a rate collector in my own county or constituency.  Therefore, I hope the House will reject these amendments and ensure that this important function, one of two which county councils have&mdash;the striking of the rate and the appointment of rate collectors&mdash;is preserved for local authorities.</P>

      <P>It is curious, if one stops to think of it, how very short is the time one has to look back to come to the day when everybody in Ireland <Col N="924" /> deplored the entry of Party politics into local government.  I am not very long on the county council myself, but, when I got on it, everybody was deploring the entry of Party politics into local government and the way they were bedevilling the administration of county councils.  Ideally, a county council is a management committee running the business of the county. Practically all the business that comes before a council can have no Party significance and I think that, when Deputies talk here about politics and politicians, they mean that there is nothing wrong with politics and politicians, but when it comes to Party politicians some of us do take leave to question whether they are just as pure as they might be.</P>
      <P>However, most of the business of a council is fortunately divorced from anything that would affect Party politics&mdash;on the administration side&mdash;but, in the financial operations of a county council, the rates have to be collected and an officer is appointed to collect them in the various districts.  His functions are purely financial.  Why should he be a political appointee?  I listened to the Parliamentary Secretary talking about what happens in his county council&mdash;that the last thing anyone considers is the Party politics of candidates. I know what happens in my own county.  I have not got the slightest doubt that that is the first qualification, and, when Deputies talk about an open vote and about how an open vote safeguards democracy, surely they realise perfectly well that giving a secret ballot at a county council meeting for the appointment of a rate collector would probably preserve democracy much better than an open vote because the open vote secures that every Party member on the council will vote the Party line and dare not do anything else because he will be thrown out and need never stand for election again.  That makes it certain that the voting will be on Party lines. Let anyone try to get a rate collectorship decided by a ballot where no one will know and see how far he gets. Why should the appointments of rate collectors be on Party lines?  Because they are and there is no use in anyone pretending they are not.</P>

      <P>The main point is that no one, to my mind, has established any justification for a continuation of making these political appointments, because they are made in a political way, and it seems to be an absurdity that the financial officer of a council should be appointed on the basis of the chance of what Party has the balance of power or holds a majority in that council.  It may be that some perfectly good people get elected, but it also means that some perfectly good ones are not getting elected, and I do not see any reason why this one office should have been retained.</P>
      <P>On the suggestion to which the Parliamentary Secretary referred, that this is a Bill to widen the powers of local authorities and that it is absurd for Deputies to bring in amendments seeking to go into reverse, whether the Bill does in fact widen the powers of local authorities is, to my mind, of very little importance, because it is not from lack of power that local authorities suffer, but from too many burdens being placed on their backs by the central Government.  If the Minister would bring in some proposals to get rid of a lot of the financial burdens which his colleagues impose on local authorities, the local authorities could stop worrying about their powers.</P>

      <P>The Minister suggested that I ought to do something in the Donegal County Council and I thought it fair enough to suggest that he should do something in Government.  A great deal of heat has been engendered as to whether politics are good, bad or indifferent.  I do not see that it matters.  There has been a good deal of confusion about whether rate collectors do this, that or the other, but it seems to me to be purely a matter of a business arrangement.  A county council ought to be a business <Col N="928" /> committee, and, if it was a business committee, this subject would not arise at all, but in fact it is not.  There was a time not so very long ago when everyone was deploring the way Party politics had got into local councils. Now everybody seems to think that it is the be-all and end-all of a county council to be a reflection of Dáil Éireann politically and that what it does outside that does not matter very much.</P>
      <P>One of the chief pins to keep it political is the appointment of rate collectors.  A great many other things have gone by the board and very few real Party political matters come up except this one.  It is remarkable if you look at the attendance sheets at county councils the very good attendance there is on the day when there is a rate collector to be appointed.  It might be said that this is the only power left to county councils.  It is really because the Party Whip is on and the boys must turn up to see that the Party candidates get their proper backing.  That is only ensuring that Party politics is the be-all and end-all of these appointments.  It is ridiculous when you see perfectly good men turned down for no reason in the world but that they happen to have the misfortune to be on the wrong political side.  The open vote makes it absolutely certain that will happen.</P>

I cannot see my way to vote for them.</P>

    <P>Deputy MacBride and other Deputies referred to the corruption and bribery and all the other things that go on.  I was sorry to hear that said.  Deputy MacBride happens to have some members of his Party on my council and I <Col N="929" /> am glad to say that my vote decided in favour of appointing a rate collector who is a member of Deputy MacBride's Party at our last meeting.  However, if Deputy MacBride thinks that all these things are going on, why can he not get some of his councillors in the different areas to get up and complain that there is corruption?  I think that members of councils are very decent people and that theirs is a very thankless job.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan, the Parliamentary Secretary, referred to the appointment of rate collectors.  If they are appointed by reason of their political affiliations, I say there is a lot more than that to the appointment of rate collectors.  Only yesterday I met a rate collector and we spoke about the closing of his warrant.  He told me he had still £2,000 to lodge within a week.  If he were unable to lodge that, what would happen?  If, as Deputy Flanagan, the Parliamentary Secretary, said, he was appointed by the Local Appointments Commissioners he could afford to let those people carry on, but the unfortunate man who cannot afford to let it hang on will lose his poundage.  What can he do?  It is all very fine to talk about Party politics.  There is not a member of this House but is attached to Party politics.  If Fianna Fáil have a majority on a council and appoint a man what is wrong with that?  If Fine Gael have a majority and do likewise what is wrong with it and if Deputy MacBride had a Party strong enough to have a majority and if they appointed a man what would be wrong with it?</P>
    <P>It is said that the purpose of this Bill is to give back powers to the local authorities, but the purpose of these amendments is to take away from them the one power they possess.  The extra powers we are giving are very little.  I think the Bill is a case of window dressing.</P>

      <P>My remarks will be very brief. Frankly, I have not heard any special case made by any of the members of the Opposition or by those on this side of the House for the appointment of rate collectors by the members of the local authorities.  One of the cases&mdash;a weak case&mdash;that was made here&mdash;I forget by whom&mdash;was that inasmuch as the local representatives struck the rate and determined how much money was to be collected, they should be given the responsibility of appointing the men to collect the money.</P>
      <P>I do not think there is a special case for the appointment of rate collectors in this particular way as against the appointment of a home assistance officer or the appointment of any similar officer in the local authorities. If there is a special case for leaving that particular power to the members of the local authority, then I would say that there is an equally strong case for giving to the elected representatives the right to select tenants for cottages erected by the local authorities as well. If the rate collectors have a big responsibility and must use a certain amount of discretion in the collection of the rates, surely the appointment of a home assistance officer who must use his discretion in certain cases should necessarily then be made by the elected representatives?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Play has been made on the fact that this Bill is designed to give back greater powers to the elected members. It was one of the strongest points made by those who spoke in favour of the retention of the old system.  I do not think that is an issue in this particular case.  I do not think it has the slightest thing to do with the Bill.  Those who called it a twopence halfpenny measure obviously have not read the Bill. I would go so far as to say that if the elected representatives knew their powers under the existing legislation governing county and city management <Col N="931" /> they would find they could do more things than they believe they can do at the present time.</P>
    <P>In any case my sympathies would be on the side of those who favour the appointment of these rate collectors by a system which differs from the present system.  I have various reasons for saying that.  I take no exception to the remarks of Deputy Allen that politics must enter into local authorities.  That is the system in operation and it will continue to be operated as long as we have local authorities in this country.  If I had heard any strong argument in favour of having that power vested in the elected members of county councils, I certainly would support the retention of the old system but if that system is to be adopted in the appointment of rate collectors I would ask what arguments are forthcoming for giving similar power to the elected representatives in the appointment of other similar officers under the local authorities or, for that matter, why not give the elected representatives the power to select tenants for cottages erected by the local authorities?</P>

      <P>I listened with interest to the discussion here this evening.  I have listened to similar discussions all round the country for years back, discussions as to the advisability of local selection as against any other kind of selection.  I do not suppose the present system is a perfect one but it has proved satisfactory and has worked well.  I doubt if we could evolve a system which would meet with the complete approval of everybody.  I appreciate the fact that the Minister has left this to an open vote of the House.  That is a democratic gesture and one which I hope to see adopted more often on matters of vital importance to the community as a whole.  Not merely is this of importance in relation to the future appointment of rate collectors but it is an exercise in general democracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not agree with those who say that the present system is unsatisfactory or that we could improve upon it. I know from experience that the <Col N="932" /> appointment of rate collectors can cause considerable annoyance to elected representatives.  Local representatives recognise, however, that their functions carry with them some disabilities.  I think a word of commendation is due to representatives generally who, knowing all the difficulties and inconveniences attaching to the work, are yet manfully prepared to undertake the burden.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that politics enter too largely into the selection of applicants.  It has been suggested that political influence is undesirable. I do not think political influence is wrong.  Other influences enter into it too.  It will do nothing towards maintaining the morale of the people if rate collectors are appointed whom they do not know, in whose appointment their local representatives have no say and in whose selection they play no part.  Taking away one of the few remaining powers left to local representatives will not improve the morale of the people.  Neither will a substitute system give better or more efficient results.  Rate collectors have given efficient service.  They have given satisfaction.  I would like those who decry the present system to give specific instances.</P>
    <P>Representatives in this House are elected under a Party system.  Why should they sit in judgment now on people no less worthy and no less self-sacrificing, namely, those who administer the county councils throughout the country?  They have no more desire to be unjust or unfair, or to use political influence, than we have, sitting here as Solomons.  This debate is very like Satan rebuking sin; Deputies are prejudiced because they say county councillors vote according to a Party system.  They hold that thereby they make wrong appointments.  In practice these appointments have worked out very satisfactorily over a long period of years.</P>
    <P>Rate collectors have acted honestly, humanely and leniently where lenience was called for.  They have to carry out a very distasteful duty in collecting the rates.  I do not think it is democratic that we should seek here to deprive county councillors of yet another <Col N="933" /> function.  If county councillors are not anxious to discharge that function they can either resign or not seek reelection. There is no case made to justify the removal of this power from local bodies.  They have done their duty well and faithfully in the past in that respect.</P>
    <P>Is it a crime to be politically minded?  If it is, then we are all criminals.  There is no evidence they have discharged their duties in an unfair way or to the disadvantage of the community.  It is hypocrisy to talk here about politics entering into these appointments.  Politics are our existence. It is politics that have all of us here to-night.  If it is virtue in our case why is it a sin in theirs?  I am opposed to anything that may remove this power from local authorities.</P>

      <P>When I sought the votes of the people of my native constituency for the fourteenth time during the last general election campaign I promised, among other things, that I would use my influence to secure the restoration of some of the powers that had been taken away from local authorities by the various City and County Management Acts, Acts against which I myself had voted on almost every occasion. I never even hinted, privately or publicly, either in my election address or any speech that I would proceed to take from local authorities one of the few powers left in their possession.  In addition to that, I was present with the Minister when he met a very representative group of the members of the Laois County Council.  There are three groups there&mdash;Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and Labour.  There are no Independents.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>On that occasion they unanimously asked the Minister to allow them to retain this power of appointing rate collectors.  I am not an interested person, and I have already said so here, inasmuch as I am not and never have been a member of a <Col N="934" /> local authority, and at this stage of my career I have no high hopes that I ever will be because I have no intention of being a candidate.  Because of that I hope that I can look at this matter in a disinterested way.  Like other Deputies here, and like a very big percentage of the electorate, especially in those areas where these jobs are given away, I know for a fact that after the appointments are made the unsuccessful candidates and the friends of the unsuccessful candidates carry on a whispering campaign relative to corruption, political and otherwise.</P>
      <P>I have had as much experience of investigating these allegations in my own way as any other Deputy who has represented that constituency for the last 34 years.  If I got&mdash;I am sure the same would apply to all of my colleagues who have served with me over that long period&mdash;clear evidence on any occasion of corruption as it is commonly understood, I would regard it as my duty to report it to the Minister in office at that time.  But in spite of all this whispering campaign around the country alleging corruption very little action has ever been taken by any Deputies from the areas concerned to bring it to the notice of the Minister who has power to deal with allegations of that kind.</P>
      <P>I do not believe it exists.  I am not blind, and I believe, of course, that there is nothing wrong about this&mdash; and it has happened in my area&mdash;that members of a county council are influenced wherever the candidate for rate collectorship approaches them. They are bound to be influenced.  It is only natural that they should be influenced by the fact that as well as being a fit and suitable candidate for the rate collectorship a man has certain close affiliations with certain members of the local authority.  I do not see anything wrong with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think political affiliations have influenced members of local authorities in counties in my constituency on more than one occasion.  Does anybody suggest that is corruption in the sense that corruption is understood by the people or by the electorate?  I do not <Col N="935" /> think it is.  The one thing that I am influenced by in my vote here in this House and the one thing which I would like to influence any member of a local authority is that the candidate whether he is of my political faith or not&mdash;and I do not think a man should be punished when looking for a political office for his political faith; I think it is criminal that he should be punished in that way and deprived of something that he is fit to do because his views are in opposition to those who have the responsibility for making the appointment&mdash;I am influenced by the knowledge that a man has of the people in a collection area.  I entirely agree with my colleague, Deputy Flanagan, on that.</P>
    <P>If an outsider is appointed through the Appointments Commissioners or through the county manager, who in the majority of cases has no previous association with the people of the county, does not know them and does not care a curse about them so long as the rates are collected he will not have that knowledge.  The county manager, in my opinion, no matter how efficient he may be in the discharge of his duties is not the best person to appoint rate collectors.  The man who knows the people well enough to know when he goes at a particular period to collect rates from a farmer, who says he is not able to pay, will know that he is not able to pay, is, I think, the proper man.</P>
    <P>The last thing I want to see is to have the collector handing over his warrant to the sheriff's bailiff and going out and collecting the personal property and goods of the ratepayer at the wrong time instead of doing, as a good rate collector would do, for instance in the case of the sale of live stock, giving the man time to sell his live stock at the next suitable fair and sell them to the best advantage and pay his rates.</P>
    <P>I would like the Dublin Deputies to forget about the position that exists here in Dublin and to realise that the position is quite different in the rural areas from what it is in Dublin.  No rate collector could be expected to <Col N="936" /> know, even if he is the most popular and well-known man that could be found, the same percentage of people in his collector's area as a local authority collector would be expected to know very well if he secured the job.  I am not influenced by these insinuations or allegations of political corruption. Suppose you have some political corruption of one kind or another which influences the votes of members of local authorities&mdash;in how many cases has that happened?</P>
    <P>I would also ask certain Deputies who have taken part in this discussion to get away from the point of the system of collection for the moment at any rate, because the system of collection is not under consideration in any of these amendments.  What is under consideration is whether we would leave to the members of local authorities what nearly every one of them has requested the Minister to leave to them, this power to appoint rate collectors, or hand it over to the Appointments Commissioners, who would probably appoint outsiders, or to the county managers which would be far worse from my point of view. If the county manager did not make the appointment himself he would get it made by a selection board nominated by himself.  I do not see much difference between an appointment made by him and that made by a board nominated by him.  If this is a Bill to restore powers to the local authorities I appeal to the Deputies who promised their constituents that they would support a Bill to restore these powers, not to take the power out of the hands of the people for whom they promised to retain it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise more or less to uphold the honour and dignity of public representatives in this country. In a couple of months' time&mdash;next June&mdash;I will be celebrating my 48th year in public life.  It is a long time to look back upon and during that long number of years I have had vast experience of many men coming into public life and, unfortunately, many men going out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I hear young men as I did hear to-day, criticising the honour and <Col N="937" /> integrity of men elected to public boards and when I look back and remember what I lived through, and the decent men, and the honourable men I met, and the honourable way in which they conducted the affairs of their counties, I blush with shame to think that such reflections as were cast here this evening on such men should be made now that many of them are in their graves.  Out of my 48 years' experience I can say without fear of contradiction that the finest type of men that one could meet in rural Ireland are the men elected by the people of rural Ireland to represent them on the local councils and it is the greatest tribute, as the Parliamentary Secretary said, that can be paid that they are elected by the honest people of our rural districts.</P>
    <P>The Minister came up to Monaghan and came before a representative gathering of our county council and put it very clearly to them whether they wanted to dispense with this authority or not and without hesitation they all said no; they would retain it. Let me speak of those men who gave the Minister that assurance.  I have seen those men&mdash;20 of them&mdash;all down the years elect rate collectors from time to time.  I have never yet found that they appointed a collector who was not in every way suitable and fit to carry out the duties to which he was appointed.  Never one defaulted.  To my mind that is a tribute to the men who made the selection.  Listening to some of the Midlands men here this evening I felt that perhaps we were unduly blessed north of the Boyne, that if you want to find an honest man you must come north of the Boyne.  According to the speeches here there was no area in all Ireland immune from corruption. I have never witnessed corruption during my time on the Monaghan County Council extending over a period of 48 years.</P>
    <P>I would like to join with the Parliamentary Secretary and those who have defended the very name &ldquo;politician&rdquo;. There is a gentleman just entering the House who boasted more or less that he was not a politician but, in the next breath, he boasted that he held the <Col N="938" /> power to decide who was to be appointed as rate collector when it would come to a vote of his county council.  In other words, he is delighted to be an Independent because he can weigh the balance whichever way suits him best.</P>

      <P>At a Monaghan County Council meeting about two years ago a motion was tabled to abolish rate collectors and to have the rate collector appointed by a selection board. That was defeated on a vote of the council.  That was prior, of course, to the Minister's visit.  Again, on the Monaghan County Council we have had all shapes and makes of politicians and all shapes and makes of religious parties appointed rate collectors by the open vote of the council without any ill-feeling between the political Parties of any kind.  I feel it would be a mistake to change the system for the reason already explained by different speakers here this afternoon.  It is all right to set up a selection board. A selection board of two or three would be much easier got at, if I may use that expression, than a full council of 20, 30 or 40 members, as the case may be.  For that reason I think we should not alter the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From my own experience in Monaghan, I am satisfied that the members of county councils as a whole judge the character of the applicants and satisfy themselves that the selected applicant is suitable for the job and one they can stand over.  If he belongs to the political Party to which you happen to belong, naturally <Col N="940" /> you will vote for him but, on the other hand, you will see to it that he is a capable man and a man who can be relied upon to do the job honourably and well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the Minister is weary of this debate and I suppose we cannot blame him but, since I propose to support the amendments, I am not going to allow anybody in this House to suggest that we are supporting the amendments for the sole purpose of castigating members of local authorities.  That is entirely untrue.  I am not a member of a local authority but I have intimate knowledge of county councillors and they are usually honest, decent men. At the same time I do not think anybody, unless he is speaking against his conscience, can say that a man should be appointed to a job as rate collector solely because of his political affiliations. I have heard Deputies this evening saying that the rate collectors do a good job and always have done. Rate collectors in general do carry out their work very well but have the people who make these statements ever stopped to think of the people who could have made an infinitely better job of rate collecting but for the fact that they were on the wrong political ticket when the rate collector for the particular area was being appointed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a shame that a man must carry a particular political badge before he is appointed.  I am sure even Deputy Allen would not like to follow his line of reasoning to its logical conclusion when he said that it was right that the political Party which had the majority, no matter who they were, should have the right to appoint rate collectors. That would mean that they should have the right to make all the other local appointments and we would find that even county council labourers would obtain work or be deprived of work according to the political Party that ruled the local county council.  While I did interrupt Deputy Allen to point out that in some cases the appointments are made by the Fianna Fáil Party, I am quite sure that Fine Gael, Labour and Clann na Poblachta also <Col N="941" /> do the same thing in certain counties and I believe they are all wrong.</P>
    <P>Somebody asked what was wrong with an open vote.  Did anybody ever hear of the appointment of a rate collector on a Wednesday by a county council?  The 30 members of that county council were called together to go through the formality of having a vote on the appointment of a person who had been appointed by the political Party on the previous Sunday. Does not everybody know that that happens and even if the person appointed happens to be a good man is it the right way to appoint somebody to a responsible job?</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy O. Flanagan, made reference to the fact that rate collectors were highly qualified to compile the register of electors because of their intimate knowledge of the localities in which they worked.  I think he was talking with his tongue in his cheek, although I know he does not often do that.  But we know enough about rate collectors to be aware that when appointed to an area they have not got such an intimate knowledge of it, even though they might live in it, to enable them to be experts at the compilation of the register.  They go to the local shopkeeper who knows everybody in the district.  If he knows everybody they go on the register; if he does not they are not put on the register.  As has been said already, people are left off the register deliberately.</P>

Perhaps the amendments here do not offer the ideal solution, but I am firmly convinced that no matter what happened we must get away from the system that operates at the moment whereby a man gets a job <Col N="942" /> because of the colour of his political tie.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidJohnMadden" hpid="Mr. Madden Mr. Madden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Madden</NameTxt>
      <P>I was much impressed by what was said by my old colleague over the way.  I did not think there were very many of us left.  I have been a long time associated with public administration&mdash;ten years in the district council and 31 years of uninterrupted association with the county council&mdash; and surely every system that operated during these 41 years under the jurisdiction of these domestic administrations ought to be well known to me. It amuses me when I hear young men here, relatively inexperienced in public life, coming in here and criticising a system that has served the community so long.  Recently a large delegation from the ratepayers attended a meeting of my council without being clear of its facts, and it carried absolutely very little conviction with some of us. The members of the delegation thought that a system of collection other than the system that operates would be more efficient and that a considerable figure of money would be saved to the community if it were initiated.  I thought that they had established their case with some cogent facts but found that the basis on which they had built their case was like a house built on sand.</P>
      <P>I am not concerned here with the changing of the various administrations from one political Party to another.  Each Party in turn, when they had the majority vote, made their selection from their own Party and in my long experience those selected by the different Parties discharged their duties with credit to themselves and to the benefit of the ratepayers.  We were not unmindful down along the years of changes which might be desirable if they relieved to a fairly considerable degree the burden of pressing and increasing rates.  We had a very fine chairman in those years&mdash;a very extensive farmer whose rates were quite considerable.  He suggested one day that there was a council beside us in another county which had been suspended by Sealed Orders of the Government and which had changed its system.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidJohnMadden" hpid="Mr. Madden Mr. Madden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Madden</NameTxt>
      <P>It was suggested that the system was a very fine one and a much more efficient one as far as the relief of the ratepayers was concerned. We all know that there are 70 per cent. of the ratepayers who will pay a rate collector or who will pay anyone.  But you will find that the other 30 per cent. are dodgers and the only man who can successfully collect from these is the man who has lived among them and who knows precisely when and where to touch them and get the money. The county secretary brought us into a big room and showed us a big iron case and in the case there was an enormous lot of <i>nulla bona</i> decrees due to the fact that the council had departed from the system the council had operated up to then.  The council had brought the ratepayers who had not paid to the courts and all they had got were these <i>nulla bona</i> decrees which meant overdrafts and overcharges in the bank against the county council.  We decided to operate the system that had worked so satisfactorily down the years.</P>
      <P>That is the system which it is suggested should be changed now. Last year our collection of rates was anything from 96 to 99 per cent. in the maximum.  That is a very good total rate collection.  It is highly satisfactory. I know perfectly well that the system is not the acme of perfection because you will find men who will go the wrong way.

      <P>I wish to point out that since I spoke before I have examined the amendments and I cannot find any way in which I can support them without preventing the county councils doing what they desire in this regard. That is the exact position.  Listening to the statements made by Deputy James Tully one would think the only place politics are to be found is in county councils.  Does not the county manager go into the polling booth to vote?</P>

      <P>Deputy James Tully maintained that it was a bad thing to have county councils making these appointments on account of their politics and I suggest to him now that the remedy envisaged through the amendments will not prevent political appointments.  If it goes to the manager&mdash;and if he is a man at all he has politics and he votes&mdash;the manager will say: &ldquo;I will give it to one of my own crowd&rdquo;; and if the appointment goes to the selection board which is appointed by the manager there is nothing to prevent that board being two-thirds one way and one-third the other, and so the same political bias might be brought to bear in the case of the board's appointment the same as in an appointment made by the county council.  Even civil servants have got politics.  Every man in this country has politics one way or the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the appointment are to be made by somebody, they might at least be made by the fellow whose brand of politics is open and whose politics everyone knows.  That is the way I look at it and I think that is the honest way of looking at it.  I instanced the different ways in which those people used to be selected before in county councils and I would suggest again to the Minister that it would be well for him, even in the Seanad, to which the Local Government Bill has gone now, to get such an amendment in, which would cover this whole matter.  For instance, the standing orders in the Cork County <Col N="945" /> Council were changed.  When different political viewpoints took control there, the standing order &ldquo;All positions of emolument in the case of the county council were filled by competitive examination&rdquo; disappeared.  That would be a good thing to see in the new Local Government Bill and would end all this thing straightway.  It should be put in the standing orders of all councils.</P>

      <P>While I am satisfied there is sincerity behind these amendments, still I am not going to support them.  I am 18 years in public life and a man in public life has to take the rough with the smooth.  The appointment of rate collectors is, perhaps, one <Col N="947" /> of the roughest jobs we have in our county council but whether it is rough or not it is our duty to stand up to it and take our decision.  Whether we like it or not county councils are political in the main and they will vote politically and work politically.  There is nothing we can do about it and we must accept it.  As far as my county is concerned I could be one of those who could readily support the amendment because for 15 or 16 years the political Party in power have appointed their rate collector at any time that suited them.  However, I am satisfied that taking everything into consideration the rate collector position in my county is wholly satisfactory and I do not think there was one bad appointment. I would not oppose it because I think it is one way of getting a small appointment for our own men in our own county.</P>
      <P>When an appointment is advertised in the newspaper eight or ten small farmers or workers from the area will put themselves forward for the appointment.  They may belong to the different political Parties.  The Party may have a meeting the night before and decide which of their men they will vote for.  I find nothing wrong with that.  We could do that ourselves as Fianna Fáil have done in some cases. Perhaps if my Party was in the majority we would have a meeting too to see which of the eight or ten men we would support, first, second or third.  I see nothing wrong with that except that the public have left Fianna Fáil in power for 20 years.  In my county they made 20 or 30 appointments but the public gave them that democratic right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had hoped these amendments would be withdrawn.  They may be sincere but the present position leaves the only hope of a small man in a country area getting a position.  I can honestly say from long experience that not one of those men has failed in his job.  There was honesty and sincerity in every one of them.  I could have voted for the Fianna Fáil man just as I could for my own because I found they were all decent and honourable men and it made no difference to <Col N="948" /> me which side of the House got that appointment.  Perhaps in the course of a few months my side of the House will be in the majority in the Meath County Council and will perhaps be able to exercise the same power as Fianna Fáil have exercised over 20 years.  I expect we will operate in that way, but I know the men who were appointed over a long number of years are a credit to the community. It is one of the few functions that are left to us.</P>
    <P>We are all crying out against the County Managerial Act taking away our powers, but here is a little power we have.  It is an awkward little power.  People are afraid to face up to it, but I was never afraid to face up to anything, big or small.  I would not be afraid of voting openly for any good man.  I have done it before.  The fact that you vote cannot fail to make enemies.  In public life you have to take the rough with the smooth.  I am one of those who believe in men in public life standing up to their responsibilities. If they do not feel like doing so they should step out of the way.  They should do their duty or get out.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that there is no need for this amendment.  If rate collectors are to be appointed, let every county council appoint its own.  As Deputy Corry suggested, there could be a selection committee appointed by the county manager to select rate collectors. We all know that their votes will be cast in a certain direction.  For all we know the county manager may use his political leaders and appoint the man he thinks they should appoint.  I think an open vote at the county councils is the right way to select rate collectors.</P>
    <P>Of the men who have been put forward for these positions there is not one who could be turned down.  They are a decent type of people, maybe drawn from the working class or the small farmer class.  Those of the small farmer type may have ten acres of land on which they cannot live, and they say: &ldquo;Here is a nice little job in my area, and if I am able to secure it through the vote of the council I would be glad to get it.&rdquo;  That is the type I want to see getting these jobs.  We <Col N="949" /> have people coming from the South of Ireland and up to the Midlands to Dublin, and if they can secure these jobs, well and good.  This is a case where counties can appoint their own rate collectors, and I think it is the right way.  It makes enemies for every one of us, but we are bound to do our duty.</P>
    <P>I say again that an open vote is the best way of appointing rate collectors, and that public representatives should not be afraid to have the courage of their convictions and make up their minds honestly and publicly.</P>

      <P>I think Deputy Giles was very near the mark when he stated that the appointment of rate collectors led many to a political graveyard.  I also think that factor is influencing some of the speakers who have spoken against the existing system. They want to run away from the local pressure groups.  All of us who are members of local authorities know <Col N="950" /> that appointments of this kind can be annoying and awkward, and can, in practically all cases, have political repercussions.  I think, in principle, that an elected representative of a local authority should be the last to cast away that small power which has remained.  We are all aware that there are small, influential groups in every constituency who make it their hobby and pastime to cast reflections and aspersions on the public representatives. You will always find that Smart Alec who will try to imply and impute that elected representatives, who were once honest men, are people who have fallen from a great height, &ldquo;the last resort of rogues and scoundrels,&rdquo; as somebody once said.</P>
      <P>My colleague, Deputy Corry, spoke of the competitive examination, but I think that that is only part of the job. Again, the question arises: how are we to select the interview board?  I think that most speakers have said that the system of appointment which has been exercised up till now has produced the right type of man.  No speaker&mdash;while many admitted that most of the appointments had a political back-ground&mdash;implied that rate collectors, once they were appointed, used their offices to the detriment of the people who might have voted against them.</P>
      <P>There was a lot of talk about appointments by the majority of a political Party, but there are very few councils on which any Party has a clear-cut political majority.</P>
      <P>I always think that the successful rate collector in most counties will have to depend&mdash;while he may have to find a political Party to sponsor him&mdash; invariably upon support from other political Parties.  Besides being a successful candidate, he is, in many instances, a super-diplomat.  I think that the system of appointments which has been exercised up to now has given satisfaction, and I see no reason whatever why we should change it. Why should we hand the appointment of rate collectors to the county manager, to the selection board or to the Appointments Commission?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Giles said that no man should be afraid to go out and cast his vote in the open, as we do on <Col N="951" /> county councils.  We know that there are hidden things in other forms of appointment, and that there is a long line from the bottom to the top.  We are well aware of that, but that particular system and that particular form of exertion is not spotlighted, nor can it be.  I think that anything done in the light of day can be kept under observation, and if there is any member of a local authority who does anything dishonourable he is soon found out.  It is invariably found that an intelligent electorate will soon eliminate that individual and render him innocuous.</P>

      <P>I have never been in favour of the Appointments Commission or of the County Management Act.  Therefore, I am in favour of the local representatives having the power of electing rate collectors.  If I had my way they would have complete power and control.  As a previous speaker said, if there is anything dishonourable done in a county council or a corporation down the country it is out in the broad clear light of day. However, if anything dishonourable is done by the Local Appointments Commission it is done behind the cloak and dagger and nobody will ever know about it.</P>
      <P>We have to take the measurement of appointments made all down through the years.  I have taken a keen interest in the local affairs of the city where I was born.  I have noticed that whether the Party I support was in power or whether the Party I oppose was in power they elected a good deal of officials&mdash;some of them higher officials than rate collectors&mdash;and every one of these officials was well worth his salt.  Every one of these officials was a front line man.  I doubt if we would have got better officials from the Local Appointments Commissioners. We have got some officials from the Local Appointments Commissioners and, while I am on the subject, I might say that I do not like to see strangers sent hundreds of miles to take up appointments.</P>

      <P>Let me come back to the subject of rate collectors.  Some people here are of the opinion that county councillors should not have that power.  The borough council to which I belong have not that power. We should have that power.  Recently in County Waterford there was the election of five rate collectors.  There was a division in the ranks of Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and everybody in the council.  Five very good men were elected.  I doubt whether we would have got five better men from the Local Appointments Commissioners. As a matter of fact, I would say I am sure we would not have got five better men from the Local Appointments Commissioners.  God knows how we would get them from the Local Appointments Commissioners.  As a Deputy beside me has just asked me, how would we get them?  My answer to that is God alone knows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me repeat that there is too much hobbledehoy with small groups of people here and there throughout the country who have not the pluck to be in any political Party but are always picking on the people who go out and do their duty in public service and public administration.  I am talking of the people who are always getting up in various self-elected bodies and little organisations here and there throughout the country and finding fault with this, that and the other.  These people never offer themselves for public service but, at the same time, they are frequently behind motions such as this. They hold up their hands in dismay when somebody with political opinions is voted into an office.  If, like the rest of my Fine Gael colleagues, I am appalled if a Fianna Fáil man is elected a rate collector, the Fianna Fáil Deputies are likewise appalled if a Fine Gael man is elected&mdash;but we will <Col N="953" /> put up with that because I would prefer the present system.  I am old-fashioned enough to believe that, when the Irish people go to the polling booths and elect representatives, these representatives should have much more power and control than just the electing of rate collectors.</P>

      <P>I have listened to quite a number of the contributions which were made to this debate.  Many of the speakers have had great experience on local authorities.  My experience is very limited, but during my membership of a local authority we have appointed some rate collectors and we have done so by the system of open vote of members of the county council.  I am going to vote to-night for the retention of that right.  During his visit to the local authorities, the Minister for Local Government was asked to take this right away from them.  I can assure the Minister that that does not represent the views of the elected representatives of the Wicklow County Council.  That county council is comprised of two Parties&mdash; the Fianna Fáil Party and the Labour Party: I think there is one elected Fine Gael representative there and the rest of them are Independents.  In the last year, there was a 97 per cent. collection of rates and that is good enough for me.  I believe the present system is all right.</P>

      <P>I should like to comment on what a previous speaker has said&mdash;that the views of the elected members were taken into consideration by the Minister in preparing this amending legislation.  That is somewhat similar to what we have heard from both sides of the House about the feelings of members of local authorities. It is suggested that there is a feeling of annoyance amongst the elected representatives on local bodies at the thought of this power being taken from them.  It is extraordinary what little heed was passed on the views of members of local authorities when the County Management Act was rammed down their throats.  From both sides of this House, the whole appeal has been: &ldquo;We, as members of local authorities, believe we should have far more power than just the <Col N="954" /> appointment of rate collectors.&rdquo;  Was it not the votes of people on both sides of this House that took away the powers from these local representatives? The elected representatives in this House cannot ride two horses at the same time to-day.</P>

      <P>It has been put forward here that it is dishonest on my part to submit these amendments.  I challenge any Deputy to show me where I have been inconsistent in my remarks with regard to the powers of local authorities.  Possibly, if I had 44 or 48 years' experience on the job, I would be bound to have made errors. It is a well-known fact that the longer you are in public life the more you learn about the evils of it.  My argument has been that it is wrong to have Party politics brought in to the appointment of rate collectors.  We had a very honest contribution from every member of the House.  Deputies set out exactly what they believed and made no bones about it.  Both sides have stated they were satisfied that the main qualification necessary for the appointment was political pull.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot see how that can be challenged.  Where the appointment is made at present by the local authority on a so called open vote, it is the man with the greatest political pull who will secure the job.  That is the system, and evidently that is considered to be the most desirable system by the major Parties here.  The discussion we had during the last two and a half hours and for three hours last week will be of great assistance in the future, when the people realise that Fianna Fáil have had 16 or 18 years of this and, now that the local elections are coming off next June, the people on the opposite side let the cat out of the bag and say, in the words of their representatives: &ldquo;Fianna Fáil were able to make the appointments on local authorities for 17 or 18 years when they had a majority: our day is coming, so why should we accept these <Col N="955" /> amendments?&rdquo;  They have been very fair in expressing their views.</P>
      <P>I am in thorough agreement with portion of the contribution made by Deputy Giles.  I should like to see the small farmers' sons and relations appointed to these jobs in rural Ireland.  If the system I suggest is brought into operation, they will have every chance of being appointed.  At present we have competitive examinations for typists, clerical officers, staff officers and others on the local authority and it is the small farmers' sons and daughters from the rural areas who sit for those examinations and are appointed on a panel.  What is wrong with including rate collectors on that panel?  Is it necessary for small farmers' sons to use political power to be appointed as a staff officer?  I do not think so.  The main things are his qualifications, his intelligence, his standard of education and general suitability.  I want to see a similar line of approach in the appointment of rate collectors.</P>
      <P>If we take the contributions of Deputies on both sides who have spoken against these amendments, I do not think it is unfair to suggest that their argument was, first, abolish the Local Appointments Commission and, secondly, abolish county managers and make all the appointments by the local authorities.  That has been the argument from both the Fine Gael side and the Fianna Fáil side of the House. Deputy Giles rightly said that, for months before the appointment of a rate collector, the knocker was worn off the door of every local representative. If Deputies are logical in their arguments about restoring powers to local authorities, the unfortunate county councillors will need new sets of knockers every week, on account of the rapping for the appointment of gangers, clerks and other positions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Social Welfare made a very reasoned statement and a reasonable type of contribution to the debate.  His argument to those opposing the amendment is: &ldquo;If you are serious and if it is a question of principle that is worrying you, why is <Col N="956" /> it that this is the sole appointment left to county councillors?&rdquo;  I accept what the Deputy from Monaghan has said, that the majority of men elected to local bodies are honest men.  It is a slur on them that the appointment of rent collectors and other appointments were taken away from them.  Regarding the line of thought put forward by some&mdash;I think Deputy Kelly from Monaghan&mdash;I never suggested that the local representatives were dishonest, but I believe they should be saved from unfair and undue pressure.</P>
    <P>The open vote is suggested by Deputies here as being in operation in various counties, but that is utter nonsense.  The actual final vote before the county council is an open vote, with every potential candidate watching over the shoulder of each county councillor to see how it is going; but the appointment is made before the council meets at all.  That is what I want to get rid of.  I do not care what Party has a majority in a council, I do not think these jobs should be given to individuals who happen to have been loyal friends of a political Party for a number of years. That is the basis they are given on now.  I hope that cannot be construed as a suggestion that these men who are appointed are bad men or evil characters.  I am not saying a word against the individuals themselves, but I am saying that the system which selects men on the basis of political jobbery is wrong.  The argument has been put up to me and others: &ldquo;Have you produced evidence that rate collectors have been dishonest or that the system has not worked in a satisfactory manner?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There was never any intention on my part of suggesting that rate collectors who have been appointed on a political basis have been dishonest or inefficient.  I have never suggested that; I suggested that the main qualification for appointment has been pull within the political Party.  Let us take it that there are three appointments of rate collectors to be made by a county council; that Mr. X happens to be organiser for a political party and is a single man; and that we have Mr. B. a married man with a small <Col N="957" /> holding of £3 or £5 and four or five children within the age limits&mdash;we find the organiser to the political Party is selected and given the job, while the man with the wife and family is turned down because he has not the political pull the other man has.  Is it not time that system was changed if at all possible?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Killilea that we will not have perfection. I am making no claim that these amendments will give a perfect solution. It will satisfy me&mdash;and I think Deputy Killilea and others will agree &mdash;if the same system can be brought into operation as applies to the appointment of young men and women <Col N="958" /> in a county as clerical officers, typists and so on.  If we consider that system to be working reasonably well and subject to the minimum of political pressure, then I see no reason why we should not include the appointment of rate collectors in it.</P>
      <P>I would ask Deputies to accept these amendments on that basis, to accept No. 5, No. 6 or No. 31.  I do not know if I am in order at this stage in suggesting that the most satisfactory way of getting what Deputy Corry and others want, a competitive examination basis, would be by accepting amendment No. 31.  The reason a county manager enters into it is a technical one. It is not my desire that the county manager should make the appointment but, as Deputies know, there are technical difficulties involved in drafting suitable amendments.  I am not an expert in drafting amendments to meet the wishes of all sides of the House, but I felt we would have to get a decision on this basis, that it was fairer all round to everybody that the appointment of rate collectors would be on the same basis as other officers of the local authority, rather than on the basis of political pressure alone.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 7:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 8, sub-section (10), to delete paragraph (a), lines 23 to 27, and substitute the following paragraph:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  Where an office of manager becomes vacant the local authority shall with the sanction of the Minister appoint a person to be manager temporarily until a permanent appointment is made but such temporary appointment may be terminated by the local authority with the sanction of the Minister at any time.</P>
      <P>This amendment is intended to cover the eventuality which might arise on a council failing to pass a resolution requesting the Local Appointments Commission to recommend a person for appointment as county manager and to cover the interim position.  The amendment seeks to delete paragraph (a) of Section 5 and substitute a new paragraph. The new paragraph provides, in effect, that, where the office of county manager becomes vacant, the local authority shall have power, with the sanction of the Minister, to appoint temporarily a county manager until a permanent appointment is made.  It is to obviate a situation in which, where there is a vacancy in the county managership, some temporary official might be appointed by the Department and left in a semipermanent capacity.  It is to ensure that the local body would have full power of control in that situation.</P>
      <P>The amendment also tries to safeguard the position of the Minister by providing that any person appointed would have to be sanctioned by the Minister.  It seems to me to be an amendment which should not cause very much difficulty.  I do not know if the Minister has any opinion on the amendment or whether he would consider he can accept it or some similar provision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>My amendment reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Before Section 6 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>When it becomes necessary for a local authority to make a temporary appointment of an officer or employee pending the receipt of a recommendation from the Local Appointments Commission of a person for permanent appointment, such temporary appointment shall be made by resolution.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of my amendment is really in line with the spirit of the Bill, as interpreted for us by the Minister and other Government speakers, to give more power to the local councils.  Now, the appointments I had in mind when putting down this amendment were appointments about which the county councils would not have to make up their minds in any event in relation to the qualifications of the candidates.  For instance, if a doctor is to be appointed, it is quite obvious that he must have qualified as a doctor before, in fact, he can be in the running for the appointment; the same is true of the other executive positions to which this amendment refers.  This would have one decided advantage, I think, and that is that the manager in each case would proceed with all expedition to secure the making of the permanent appointment, seeing that the temporary appointment was not of his own making, and I think it would be desirable that permanent appointments in all cases should be made as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is, therefore, at issue the question of taking from the manager the power of making a temporary executive appointment and handing it over to the council.  I take it the period or duration of such appointments would be short.  It would certainly be much shorter than it is at the present time if an amendment of <Col N="962" /> this kind were the law.  As I said in my opening remarks, I think this is within the spirit of the Bill which the Minister is recommending to the House and I do not see that there can be any serious objection to the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that I am unable to accept either amendment.  I will deal with amendment No. 7 first. At the moment sub-section (10) of Section 5 provides that temporary appointments to the office of manager shall be made by the Minister as at present.  That is the law at the moment.  The purpose of this amendment is to enable the local authority to appoint a temporary county manager.  Now, let me deal first of all with the drafting of the amendment. A county manager is not only manager of a county council; he may be manager of a number of urban bodies in his particular county.  The amendment, as drafted, does not specify which local authority will have the appointment of the temporary manager. Can each of them select its own? Can the town commissioners of Ballydehob, for instance, select their own temporary manager, and the county council likewise?  I could not possibly accept that amendment as at present drafted.  Neither does it specify that this appointment will be a reserved function.  Again, I could not accept it on that account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely that is easily remedied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly.  I am merely dealing with it as the amendment stands at the moment.  The amendment suggests that the local authority will have the appointment of the temporary manager subject to the sanction of the Minister.  Can we not visualise a county manager dying suddenly? Once he dies all executive functions cease.  Can we imagine the county secretary calling a special meeting of the county council&mdash;he would have to do that&mdash;and asking them to appoint a temporary manager? But it is not the county council which appoints the temporary manager. They appoint him subject to the sanction of the Minister.  His name has <Col N="963" /> to be sent up to the Minister and his qualifications have to be studied and examined.  The Minister may not be satisfied that he is the ideal person and he will send down a further request to the county council saying that he will not accept this particular individual and asking them to send up another name.  Then another meeting of the council will have to be called to select a second man.</P>
      <P>An obstructionist local authority, politically opposed to the Minister of the day, would keep on sending up names merely for the purpose of holding up the entire business of the local authority.  That would be a very serious objection in my opinion.  At the moment when a county manager wishes to vacate office, the Minister may immediately, within 12 hours, appoint a deputy.  I think that is the most expeditious manner in which to carry out the business of the local authority.  It is ridiculous to suggest that in a scattered area, such as my own native Donegal, every time the county manager gets ill and takes a few days or a week off a special meeting of the council should be held to appoint&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the section and the amendment only deal with an actual vacancy.  If the manager is ill for a few days the question of a vacancy does not arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.  I have been unfair to the proposer of the motion. The Deputy, however, sees the other argument.  In the event of a sudden death there would have to be a special meeting of the local authority for the purpose of appointing a temporary manager.  The Minister may refuse to sanction that appointment.  Another meeting would have to be called and the entire business of the council would be held up.  The only objection I see to the amendment is that the local authority would not be in a position to deal with the matter as one of urgency. I am in sympathy with what both Deputy MacBride and Deputy Bartley have said but it is a question after all of dealing as efficiently and expeditiously <Col N="964" /> as possible with the business of a council.  To suggest that a meeting should be held, accompanied possibly by a wrangle as to who should be appointed, and the appointee's name sent up to the Minister for sanction would take a considerable time and then the Minister might not accept.</P>
      <P>With regard to Deputy Bartley's amendment, only a very small minority of local officials are appointed by the Local Appointments Commission.  The majority are appointed in a different manner.  If we accepted this amendment the majority would still be appointed by the manager in accordance with existing procedure and statutory regulations and only a minority would be appointed by the local authority.  I think it would be very unfair to draw a distinction. Clerical officers and library assistants are appointed by the manager.  If this amendment were accepted a distinction would be drawn because under this in the small minority of cases where appointments are made by the Local Appointments Commission the Deputy wants the temporary appointment made by the local authority and not by the manager.  I think that distinction would be very unfair.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bartley said on the Second Stage of the Bill that if the elected representatives had power to appoint such temporary officers it would have the effect of speeding up the manager's request to the Local Appointments Commission.  In actual fact managers usually send in their request before the vacancy occurs, and I can assure the Deputy that, if any delay takes place, it is not due to the manager neglecting to send in the names to the Local Appointments Commission. Managers have been repeatedly requested not to wait until vacancies occur before approaching the Local Appointments Commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>

Now, one of the greatest complaints, the fundamental complaint, is that it has taken too much power from the elected representatives and concentrated it in the hands of what has been described as bureaucracy.

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I will give you an answer.  Take, for instance, a dispensary district out in an isolated area where a doctor suddenly goes sick. Deputy Bartley wants me to call a special meeting of the local authority to appoint a doctor temporarily in his place, even though a doctor may have a pain in his tummy and wants a week's holiday.  We are continually appointing&mdash;county managers are continually appointing&mdash;temporary dispensary doctors to replace men who have been taken ill and the Deputy wants to call a special meeting of the local authority every time we have to make one of these temporary appointments.  I think it is better, simpler, and less costly on the taxpayers as it is, because all the local councillors will have to receive their travelling expenses if they come to one of these meetings and if this suggestion were accepted they would be meeting practically every week.  In our county alone we have at least 30 or 40 doctors.  Each doctor may be <Col N="967" /> sick, let us say, once a year and if you are going to call a special meeting of the council every time you want to appoint a deputy or a <i>locum tenens,</i> I think, if the Deputy considers it, he will see the danger, the expense and frustration of the whole thing.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister has made quite a strong case against Deputy Bartley's amendment.  As regards the amendment standing in my name, I do not think the Minister has made a strong case.  His approach seems to be illogical because it seems to me that we have spent the last few hours in discussing whether or not it was right for a county council to have the power to appoint rate collectors, and the House decided against me that <Col N="968" /> it would be a gross infringement of the civil liberties of county councils if they were not allowed to appoint rate collectors. The issue in my amendment is whether county councils should have the right to appoint temporary county managers, or whether the Minister should have that power exclusively. Now the attitude of the Minister is&mdash;&ldquo;by all means, let county councils appoint rate collectors but let me appoint county managers, even in temporary capacities.&rdquo;  It does not appear to be very consistent with the earlier attitude adopted by the Minister and the Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I see it only to a very limited extent.  I was just trying to recollect while the Minister was talking, cases in which there had been vacancies, and I feel the positions were left vacant for some considerable period by the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that is right.  All executive functions cease in such a case and we would not have left it open.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>There are provisions for appointing a deputy manager, and I believe in a number of cases there is a deputy manager to cover the period during which a county manager is indisposed, or away or on leave or something like that.  Presumably, in the fortnight, three weeks or month following the death of a county manager the deputy county manager could perform the functions of county manager without grave difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will be quite frank.  I will tell the Minister exactly what was operating in our minds when we put down this amendment.  We felt that very often vacancies in major posts of this kind are left unfilled for a very long period and that inevitably there would be a tendency on the part of the Department to put in some official as acting county manager who would be left there for a very long time before the appointment was made.  It was to obviate that eventuality.  It was to obviate having departmental officials acting as county managers in various <Col N="969" /> county councils, while a new county manager was in process of being appointed.  We felt that if the appointment of the county manager was left in the hands of a county council in a truly democratic fashion, restoring full powers to the local authority, there would be less tendency on the part of the Department to appoint some of their officials to administrative positions in county councils.  That was the purpose of the amendment and I do not see that there is any very grave objection to it.  There is very little more I can add.  I do not know if the Minister could see some method of reaching a compromise on it or not.</P>

      <P>To be quite honest, I cannot understand the mind of the Minister at all.  I do not know whether it is because I am too far south and he is too far north or not.  Apparently, the same kind of mind is being brought into this as was brought in in the difference between Youghal bridge and the bridge in Athlone.  There is about the same line-up.</P>

      <P>Here is the Minister fighting hard for four hours to preserve to the local authority the right to appoint rate collectors and sticking to his guns and winning.  Now, when it is a question of the appointment of a deputy county manager he twists around and says that he must go up to the Department to be appointed.  The Minister's argument is completely ridiculous.  I say that as a member of a local authority for the past 30 years. What happened when a county secretary fell ill?  Did not the man next in charge step in and take over?  Was not that the way it was done?  There was no special meeting called to appoint a temporary secretary who, in those days was far more important than the manager is now.  There was no question of sanction from the Department of Local Government. Cannot this matter be settled very simply?  While the manager is all right and has no pains in his tummy, the county council can appoint a deputy to act whenever the county manager is ill or absent for other cause.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="970" /> If you wish, let the matter be submitted to the Department of Local Government for sanction.  That deputy is there always in that capacity to act as manager if the manager for any reason is absent.  I cannot see any reason for the Minister's objection to that course.  It is a procedure that has stood the test of time and to which there was never any objection by the Department of Local Government before the County Management Act was introduced.  That procedure was always carried out.  If the county secretary fell ill the county accountant took over.  In this case why should not the county council make the appointment?  With all due respect to the Minister and his Department, I say that the county council has a far better knowledge of the capabilities of its officers than either the Department or the Minister can have.</P>
    <P>I hope it is not because the Minister has got a pain in his tummy through walking around the Lobby that his outlook on this matter has changed.  I would be very sorry if that were the case but some great change seems to have taken place in the Minister's attitude in the last quarter of an hour.</P>

      <P>In addition to what I have already said, I think it is but fair to say to Deputy MacBride that we do not want the manager to be the creature of any particular section.  We want him to try to hold a balance.  If you have two candidates on the staff of a local authority and both are ambitious enough to become temporary managers they will pull strings and, if one of them is appointed, he feels possibly, or may feel, that he is under obligation to certain sections of the council who sponsored him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, there are checks.  Under this particular Bill, it is proposed that the county councils <Col N="972" /> will send the statutory request to the Local Appointments Commissioners and not to the Minister, so that there will be no delay.  The councils are the people who will make the request and accordingly, as I have pointed out already, there should be no undue delay on their part in making the application.  But supposing for a second that the council had the appointment of temporary officers and at the same time that they had the power to make the statutory request to the Local Appointments Commission, they could appoint one of their pets and they might be very, very slow in sending in their statutory request to the Local Appointments Commissioners.  They might delay a considerable time if they had the power to make a temporary appointment.  If Deputy Bartley had considered that point he might see the objection.</P>

This is a trivial matter, if you like, but it is a step in the right direction towards giving more power to the elected representatives.  If we cannot trust the elected representatives to make a temporary appointment pending the selection by the Appointments Commission, of a person to fill the vacancy permanently, they are hardly worthy of being trusted as representatives of the people at all.</P>

    <P>I understood the Minister in his reply to state that the likelihood would be that the council would be canvassed for temporary appointments, that a section of the councillors would lean towards a particular candidate <Col N="977" /> and that thereafter the successful candidate might feel under an obligation in some way or other to those members of the council who supported his appointment.  That again is taking a very poor view both of the person who has been selected to fill the vacancy and of the representatives who would appoint him.  Under the present system, where temporary appointments are being made in some cases by a local board selected to make the appointment, everything is not satisfactory.</P>
    <P>There is one thing that would be in favour of the suggested method of selection even for a temporary post; whether the period would be short or long the appointment would be made openly and above board and the public would know whether the candidate whose merits were outstanding was the person selected or not.  All of us know cases where local boards have selected what obviously was not the best qualified candidate.</P>

      <P>It might not be fair to give an example but I could give one.  If the selection were made by resolution of the council, as asked in the amendment here, it would certainly be publicly discussed and those supporting a particular candidate could state what were the merits of the candidate whom they were supporting.</P>
      <P>We will have local elections this year and it is expected that the people will select representatives who are capable of carrying out their duties as local representatives.  I am afraid the Minister is not showing much faith in the new councils to be set up if he is not going to trust them with this little bit of power that is being asked for under this amendment.  I think that on second thoughts, when the Minister takes into consideration that this Bill is supposed to have a leaning towards giving more powers to local representatives generally, he will not hesitate to give this little extra power.</P>

      <P>I think I even had amendments submitted not dissimilar to this one, if I remember rightly. However, when the Minister was telling us how much power he was going to restore to elected representatives, one would not even dream of suggesting a trivial matter like this. Surely if the Minister's Bill is worth what he claims it to be, he will not hesitate to give that little extra power to the new council which will be elected in June next and thereby do away with this system which prevails at present of making appointments by local committees which does not seem to be satisfactory to anybody.  I strongly urge that the Minister should accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I think we had the question of principle discussed here for six hours on the appointment of rate collectors, and I suggested to the Minister that there were Deputies in this House trying to ride two horses in the same race.  The Deputies who are opposing this amendment now and who voted against the three former amendments are attempting to ride two horses at the same time.  I was practically accused here of casting a slur on members of local authorities when I suggested the removal of the power we discussed under the previous amendment.  Here is an amendment to restore powers to the local authority and it is being turned down.  I cannot understand that unless it is showing a <Col N="979" /> mentality &mdash; this is not towards the Minister for Local Government &mdash; a general mentality on the part of the Custom House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;unless it shows a desire on the part of various Governments to be little members of local authorities.  If power is left to play cat and mouse with regard to the appointment of rate collectors, why should the Minister for Local Government, when higher responsibility can be given to them, turn down the suggestion as outlined in this amendment?  I am putting a case, repetition if you like, but as far as the Minister and members of the Opposition are concerned they are restoring more powers to local authorities.  As far as I am concerned, I will personally oppose that amendment because, if a man is to be consistent in this House, he must show, in a logical way, the arguments which he puts up for amendments which follow each other so closely that he cannot just vote a different way on each of them.</P>
      <P>The same abuses can creep in if this amendment is accepted, as are apparent at the present time in the appointment of the gentlemen to whom we have been referring for six hours&mdash; the rate collectors.  If we have a dispensary doctor appointed on a temporary basis, and if it is left to some resolution of a county council, there will be general canvassing immediately.  If there are two doctors in for the temporary appointment as dispensary doctor, each of them will have to prove that his political record is good enough to get the votes of whatever party has the majority on the council.  It is a matter of bringing politics straightway into it.  I find myself supporting the Minister in resisting this amendment, but I think that the Minister should be accepting the amendment if he was being logical in his argument on the former amendment on rate collectors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister <Col N="980" /> that he is opposing the principles of his own Bill.  The Bill states:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The purpose of this Bill is to amend the City and County Management Acts so as to give to the elected members of local authorities greater and more detailed powers in regard to expenditure, and greater powers of direction, supervision and control over the actions of city and county managers generally, and to make certain minor amendments in the law relating to city and county management.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is the purpose of the Bill&mdash;to give the elected representatives more power. Will the Minister kindly accede to the request of his colleague and tell us how temporary doctors are at present appointed, and who appoints them?  I think it would be enlightening to know that.  There is no difference whatever between the line we are taking in this and the line we took with regard to rate collectors.  The only difference is that the Minister is drawing a line of distinction.  My only objection to those two amendments is that they are not going far enough.  I think the manager would be a lot more human, and would pay a lot more heed to what the representatives would tell him, if he were elected by the people.  I think it is a huge joke to bring all high appointments before the Local Appointments Commission or selection board.</P>

I am putting the case to the Minister that, having opposed the taking away the power of appointing rate collectors, I cannot see how he can completely turn about now and oppose giving those powers which are, after all, the principle of the Bill.  If one is right the other is right.  I am supporting Deputy MacBride's amendment because I consider it is a wise one.  I have given the Minister previous instances of what has gone on for 30 years.  If anything happened to the secretary of the county council in pre-managerial days, the accountant always stepped in and did his work.  There was no noise about it.</P>
