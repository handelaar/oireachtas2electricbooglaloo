      <P>On the occasion in question the car, which has been allocated for the use of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government, was in use in accordance with the conditions prescribed by the Government in 1940 for the regulation of the use of State cars by Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries.</P>

      <P>I would like to know, and I am sure the members of this House would like to know, if there is any statutory authority under which State cars may be used to transport Coalition speakers and canvassers in local government elections?  If there is no such authority, then such a practice can only be described as a shameful one.  This practice was widely resorted to in Laois in the recent local elections.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Keyes)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Radio Éireann correspondent in the fish market has not been supplying the price of grilse recently.  I understand a question arose as to whether a price supplied to the correspondent on a recent occasion was the correct price for this fish and that the merchants then decided to suspend supplying the price.  The Director of Broadcasting is making inquiries into the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaureenOCarroll" hpid="Mrs. O'Carroll Mrs. O'Carroll">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that a false price was suggested to Radio Éireann by one of two merchants in order to secure the monopoly of the market for this fish? Furthermore, as these published prices are supposed to safeguard the producer and the consumer, the fishermen are complaining that because of the absence of a price in this case they are getting very low prices and they have <Col N="162" /> very large catches?  We are paying salmon prices for grilse.</P>

      <P>It is obviously desirable and essential that if prices are to be given they must be the correct prices. The position is being considered at the moment by the director of Radio Éireann.  The matter is still <i>sub judice</i> and an investigation is taking place.  I will give the Deputy more information when the matter is cleared up.</P>

      <P>The recent abnormal weather has interfered seriously with the programme of drainage work on the outfall section of the river through Galway City and the opening of the sluices at this stage would cause further interference and delay, without effecting any appreciable improvement in flood conditions on lands bordering Lough Corrib.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. J. Larkin Mr. J. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister give us any kind of general indication as to when he will be in a position to fix the appointed day?  The present Bill before the House has been contemplated for some considerable period and during that period injured workmen who are dependent on weekly payments have been waiting from week to week in expectation of the House being able to pass the Bill and for it to become law in due course.  We have lost a good deal of time and those of us who are concerned with the matter are daily being pressed as to when injured workmen may expect to receive the benefits provided in the Bill.  I quite appreciate there are certain matters to which the Minister will have to give consideration especially in regard to a possible revision of insurance policies and premiums but it should not be impossible for him to give a general indication of the period he would envisage as being necessary.</P>
      <P>I think I could also at this point refer indirectly to another aspect of the matter.  So far as it is necessary to have certain consultations with the insurance companies special regard should be had to the adjustments which insurance companies might have in mind in regard to premiums in so far as we are imposing additional burdens on the employers, which I think are quite proper.  I think as far as possible the Minister, through the machinery available to him, should provide for those employers as much and as reasonable protection as he can against the imposition of an unjust impost on the employers.  On every previous occasion where the workmen's compensation code has been increased there have been adjustments in premiums. It is difficult at the moment to know the extent of the increases that were subsequently found necessary. Certain figures were mentioned during the Second Reading, but we have had others, especially in regard to suggested increases in premiums, where closer examination of the matter induced the insurance companies to take a more moderate view of what they regarded as their increased commitments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the appointment of a day <Col N="166" /> and the position arising from the Bill in regard to adjustments of premiums the Minister might give us his views as to the probable day and as to the desirability of ensuring that we do not impose additional burdens on employers and that they will not be mulcted twice over.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Norton) William Norton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Norton)</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been the practice in the past in connection with alterations in the workmen's compensation code to permit the lapse of a certain period in order to enable the insurance companies and the employers to make the necessary changes consequent on the legislation. In the last case I think it took at least six weeks before that change was operated by bringing the Act into effect.  However, I do not think the alterations on this occasion will be so complex in character as to necessitate that delay and I would hope it would be possible to bring this Bill into operation within two or at the most three weeks from the date on which the Bill is passed.</P>
      <P>On the second point raised as to the reasonableness or otherwise of the premiums charged arising out of this Bill, I do not think that is a matter we can legislate for or discuss adequately at this stage, but every Deputy knows there is machinery in the form of the Prices Advisory Body which I think could examine the question of the reasonableness of the premiums if it is found that employers are being asked to pay rates of premiums for workmen's compensation insurance which are not justified by the risk involved.  That machinery is available for use if we desire to use it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to know if the Minister will see that consideration will be given to the increases that the employers are paying all along since the last increase in compensation. The employers have been paying on increased wages ever since and I think that should be very carefully considered by the Minister to ascertain what exactly the increases are that have been paid on premiums by the employers on each increase in wages <Col N="167" /> since.  I think that a very careful examination should be given to that aspect of the matter whether any other body will inquire into it or not.  It should be recognised that every increase in wages brought an increase in the premiums paid and nobody seems to wonder why, because any time there has been an increase in compensation the insurance companies have added it on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. J. Larkin Mr. J. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(3)  Notwithstanding anything hereinbefore contained the provisions of sub-section (3) of Section 25 of the Act of 1934 shall apply to all cases where a workman is entitled to a weekly payment by way of compensation under the Acts of 1897 and 1900 or the Act of 1906.</P>
      <P>This amendment is intended to remedy a defect which has existed in the code since the passing of the 1934 Act. Under the 1934 Act there was a new provision set out in Section 25 by virtue of which it was possible for a workman who was in receipt of weekly payments to secure a revision of those payments in relation to changes in the rate of wages in the particular employment in which he met with the accident. If it were the position that the workman would have secured a higher income through increases in wage rates if he had not met with the accident it was possible for him to seek that revision so long as the changes were not less than 20 per cent.  That section has continued in operation but has not been applicable to cases under the 1897 Act or the Act of 1906 but all cases since the Act of 1934 have got the benefit of that particular provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the position stands, there would, <Col N="168" /> in fact, not be very many cases that would require this remedial action, but the legislation is not measured merely by the extent or the number of people to whom it is to be applied; it has also to be measured in relation to the persons involved and the measure of justice being accorded or withheld. Since the time when injured workmen would have their payments determined by the earlier Acts, there have been very considerable changes in the existing wage rates.  In the case of workmen who had the benefit of the 1934 Act, apart from the adjustments made from time to time, they have been able to secure reviews in the life of existing wage rates.  All that is being sought in this amendment is to extend the benefits of Section 25 of the Act of 1934 to those injured workmen whose payments were determined under the earlier Acts.</P>
    <P>It may be said that the number is very small but that is not an argument that has ever appealed to this House. The other argument that may be advanced is that it is unfair to an employer to compel him to assume a liability of which he was not aware but that is the principle which we have been embodying in the amending Acts since 1948.  On each occasion that we have increased the payments we have imposed an increased liability on the employer to an extent of which they could not have previously been aware.</P>
    <P>The argument that it cannot be applied to this small group of workers who have been left out is not very logical.  There has been one other argument used in the course of the debate and that is the question of the additional burden to be imposed on employers.  To the extent that the number of these men who will be affected by this amendment is relatively small and will become increasingly smaller as the years pass that argument also is not very sound.</P>
    <P>There is some doubt as to whether the attempt to remedy this defect might give rise to some difficulty in the case of injured workmen who already have had certain settlements made and to whom increases have been given. That is a matter we have got to look into in any case where we tried to <Col N="169" /> remedy a defect of this kind.  There is a strong feeling that it has been an oversight on our part that we have not remedied the defect before this. The Act of 1934 did repeal the earlier Acts, but certain provisions of the earlier Acts were continued in it and it seems to me that it is now time that we remedied this defect.</P>
    <P>It may be argued that in so far as the maximum of these injured workmen I am referring to has been increased only to a certain extent, they have a grievance as against the men who have met with injuries subsequent to the 1934 Act, but so far as an Act provides benefits of any sort those benefits should be provided equally for all those in a similar position.  There should be an application of the principle that where it is possible under the 1934 Act to secure a review the same principle should be extended to those who have had their benefits determined under the earlier Acts.</P>

      <P>There is nothing very controversial in this amendment proposed by Deputy Larkin.  I think that one principle should guide us here and that we should make every effort to make the law even for all classes of persons irrespective of technical distinctions.  If the principle is accepted, technical distinction should not be allowed to segregate otherwise comparable cases.  Such segregation means that one person is placed at a disadvantage as against another.  It seems to me that the case which Deputy Larkin is making is sound enough.  Perhaps we might all regard it differently if the date of the passage of the other Acts was nearer because of the numbers involved.  I do not think that there would be very many persons concerned in this.  On these general grounds I think the Minister would be well advised to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I have the fullest sympathy with the desire of Deputy Larkin and Deputy de Valera to meet the problem of the pre-1934 cases. There are not a great many of them left.  It was estimated in 1948, when <Col N="170" /> the Workmen's Compensation Bill of that year was going through, that the number then was 100, and it must have diminished considerably in the intervening seven years.</P>
      <P>In every case of total incapacity the injured workman under this Bill will receive a weekly payment of the maximum amount which is 90/- or he will get a payment of five and a quarter times the amount of the original award. In view of this the number of cases in which a workman would benefit by a review of the kind introduced in the 1934 Act must be very small.  Any increase which he would get in the weekly payment would hardly be considerable and there is, I think, a danger that a review might operate to the disadvantage of the particular workman.  However, no generalisation of that sort will enable us to get a picture of the position but there still may be a danger that the review might be to the disadvantage of the workman. It is because of this difficulty that it might be desirable to allow the commission which is being set up to inquire into this matter to go into the whole position.</P>
      <P>I am advised also that Deputy Larkin's amendment will not meet the cases of those he has in mind.  We think that Section 25 of the 1934 Act applies only where the accident took place after that Act came into operation so that pre-1934 cases could not get the review granted under the Act. If that is the position we do not catch the cases which the Deputy has in mind and if we do catch them it would be well to consider whether it would be to the advantage of the injured workman to take advantage of the review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as this Bill is concerned, the position is that where the original award of workman's compensation was 17/- per week the workman was already entitled to the maximum weekly payment and consequently he could not benefit by any review.  Where the original award does not exceed 17/- a week, the weekly payment after the present Bill comes into operation will be five and a quarter times what it was originally.  All the workmen concerned, that is, in the pre-1934 cases, know now that they can get either the maximum <Col N="171" /> provided in this Act or five and a quarter times the original award.  At least they know that and they can enjoy these benefits.  What the review will give them, I cannot say; it may be slightly up or slightly down, but in any case there is an imperfection in the amendment.</P>
    <P>However, I will undertake to look into the matter further between now and the Report Stage or between now and when the Bill reaches the Seanad. I know the Deputy is as interested in this matter as I am and, because of the fact that we cannot see clearly where we are going in this matter, it is quite possible that a commission set up to deal with it could probe more thoroughly and make sure that the provisions we make will be beneficial provisions, calculated to raise the rate of compensation and that we should not run the risk of putting in a section which may operate to reduce it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps what the Minister says in this connection is very reasonable.  There is a need for having the whole of the provisions of this code looked into.  It would be trespassing beyond the bounds of this amendment to go into it now, but it is very clear that the whole approach to workmen's compensation is outdated and that a new approach is needed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as this particular problem is concerned, if we had only 100 cases in 1948, by the time the commission would deal with the problem and bring in its report and we were in a position to deal with it, I am afraid that the number would be drastically reduced.  We might save the time of the commission and ourselves by deciding not to proceed any further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate what the Minister said, that he would be prepared to look into the matter more closely from the point of view of the amendment and on the question as to whether there would be any benefit from it.  As I see it, there are two main types of cases.  Take the case of the man who had an award made to him of, say, 10/- a week; that is below the limit of 17/-.  If he gets <Col N="172" /> the five and a quarter times increase the Minister speaks about, that would give him £5 2s. as against our now proposed maximum of £4 10s.  That 10/- would have been originally based on his earnings for the period and there is no doubt that when we consider the wage rates in the pre-1934 period and compare them with the present rates, there is a tremendous difference and it would appear at least in regard to that case that the man would be likely to gain.</P>
    <P>There is the other type of case about which we should not speak in public, yet I do not think it would do any harm, that is, where the man has got part of the award, has been receiving it for years, but in the meantime either has recovered some loss of capacity or has been lucky enough to fit himself into some other niche and technically would not be entitled to continue to draw payment.  However, it was doubtful if there would be any advantage taken of this situation as a whole, so that on balance it would seem to me the greater number would benefit even though that greater number is less than 100.</P>
    <P>If the Minister feels that it would be worth while to look more closely into the matter between this and the Report Stage, I would be quite prepared to let the amendment stand over.  I prefer to deal with it finally at that point rather than leave it to the commission, because quite clearly this is not a problem that will continue to exist in any permanent state until such time as the commission have completed their work.  However speedily the commission worked, by the time we would have their advice and be able to act on it, these cases would have finished altogether and we would have no problem left.  Therefore, we should deal with it now or leave it over altogether.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finlay</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one gap still left in these increases to which I would like to draw the Minister's attention. It might be possible to consider it later on.  The effect of the increase so far as the juvenile lump sum is concerned is to turn the figure which was £4 3s. 4d. into, I think, £6 5s.  If you go back to the Second Schedule of the Workmen's Compensation Act, 1934, you will see that sub-paragraph (1) (b) of Section 3 of that Schedule reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;where the compensation consists of both the children's and adults' lump sum, and there is one juvenile dependent only, the children's lump sum shall be a sum equal to the amount arrived at by multiplying 2 Is. 8d.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>&mdash;we substitute £6 5s.&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;by a number equal to the number of complete calendar months between the date of the death of the workman and the date on which such juvenile dependent will attain the age of 15 years ...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It is 16 years now.  So far as I can read this Act, the situation is that there is no minimum limits on the lump sum and the situation can arise whereby if a workman leaves a widow and one child not far short of 16 years of age, the widow will be entitled to an adult's lump sum of a considerable amount but the child, though it may be wholly dependent on the workman at the time of the death of the workman, will receive only something in the nature of £5 or £6.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I confess that this probably should be in the form of an amendment at this stage, but I would like to point out to the Minister on the section that it might be possible to introduce a minimum covering that particular case. The case does not really arise where you have two children because you must have a reasonable figure of £50 or £60, as the figures go at the present time.  Where you have two juveniles the figure is double £6 5s., multiplied by the number of months between the time at which each child reaches the age of 16 years, so that you are bound to have a longish gap and get a reasonable figure.  In the case of one child who was totally dependent on the father he would receive something <Col N="174" /> around £5 or £6.  I should like to point out to the Minister the possibility of putting a minimum limit on that figure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to explain the reasons which led to the decision to withdraw that section.  The section was put into the Bill in an attempt to do something about two particularly bad features in regard to workmen's compensation.  As things stand many workmen cannot go back to their old positions on account of the operation of the Act.  They cannot get other employment&mdash;some of them may be no longer young&mdash;and it was felt that if they could secure some capital in the form of a lump sum in lieu of compensation which they might invest in some little business such as a shop, they would be enabled to make better provision for themselves and their dependent relatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was one of the features which was sought to have remedied by this section.  Another is the case where the injured workmen, under pressure of economic circumstances, were often prevailed upon to settle for an inadequate lump sum and it was thought that the bringing in of the courts might possibly remedy that position and that such workmen would get a lump sum which would be more reasonable than experience has shown to have been the case in the past; it was to give the workman a right of redemption somewhat similar to that enjoyed by the employer.  We are satisfied now, after an examination of the section, that the courts would have great difficulty in deciding whether the incapacity was permanent or as to how long it was likely to last. <Col N="175" /> There was also always the danger that an element of injustice might occur in certain circumstances and against such a background.</P>
    <P>This section alone was estimated by an insurance company to involve an increase of nearly 50 per cent on existing premiums and meanwhile some employers who now carry their own workmen's compensation risks and who are paying in respect of past accidents substantial sums in weekly compensation, have pointed out that if they were compelled to meet their obligations under Section 8 as it stood it would probably mean they would have to go out of business in order to liquidate the liabilities which might be imposed by the courts through the operation of this section.  In view of all these difficulties and complexities, and as this is a new feature in the pattern of workmen's compensation as previously operated, it was felt it would be better to withdraw this section and allow this particular problem, which does call for a remedy in some form or other, to be dealt with by the commission in the hope that they can work out a solution which will be fair to all sides.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. MacCarthy Mr. MacCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>I was interested in this section by reason of the fact that I thought it provided an opening for such cases as I mentioned on the Second Reading of the debate.  Supposing, for example, an employee of a local authority loses a vital organ like an eye in the unloading of road materials, and in consequence that he cannot resume his employment, he is told that until the weather improves and until the medical men have some experience of what improvement may occur in the case of his eye or how it may affect the sight of the other eye, he cannot resume employment.  Therefore he is idle from very early October until the following April or May&mdash;until the weather makes it possible for him to go back to work.  During that time he is on a very small weekly payment &mdash;say something like £2 10s. a week&mdash; whereas his normal wages would have been in the region of £5 a week.  He gets no compensation whatever for the loss of the organ and he is on that <Col N="176" /> reduced payment over that period.  He resumes work during the summer months while the weather remains good but when it gets bad again it may affect his sight and he cannot as a result of the accident continue in employment over the winter period. Are there any means of dealing with the case under which this man would get a lump sum sufficient to cover the difference between the weekly compensation allowances and the wages he would earn during the period he was employed fully?</P>
      <P>Is there any provision under existing legislation where the loss of a vital organ like that could be compensated for?  I agree with the Minister that there are difficulties and complications in the whole scheme of things and that these must be examined but at the same time I think we should try and cover such cases.  Instead of an eye a workman may suffer the loss of an arm or a leg or so forth, thus being incapacitated for a considerable time. There is a danger of the renewal of that incapacity in bad weather and in consequence the whole career of the workman is affected.  In the case of the loss of an eye perhaps the workman's effectiveness is not impaired fully as far as carrying out his work is concerned during certain parts of the year but there is permanent incapacity caused as far as his full sight is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not possible for me to say in any given case whether the workmen would be entitled to compensation in the circumstances described by the Deputy.  That is a matter on which only the courts could express a legal opinion as to what incapacity was present.  If the incapacity is present the customary practice has been that the person is entitled to compensation.  Where only partial incapacity occurs provision is made for the payment of portion of the compensation, but if a workman meets with an accident to his eye and cannot as a result follow his ordinary occupation&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. MacCarthy Mr. MacCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;it does not mean under the Workmen's Compensation <Col N="177" /> Act that he will be paid compensation for the loss of the eye.  He will be compensated only for loss of earning power.  If as a result of the negligence of an employer he lost such an organ he could proceed under another Act and recover compensation for negligence. The Employers' Liability Acts would enable him to get compensation in respect of an eye or any other organ or in respect of any injury brought about by the negligence of the employer. If the Deputy's question is whether the workman is entitled to workmen's compensation as a result of incapacity for work through the loss of the organ the answer is, so long as he is incapacitated he has a claim, but what view the courts would take I cannot say.  Clearly if he were incapacitated through an accident he would be entitled to compensation for loss of earning power.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not very often that a Deputy has to say that a Minister went beyond what was being sought by the ordinary members of the House.  This is actually the situation in regard to this section.  As far as I am aware for some time there has been among people interested in workmen's compensation a certain feeling and a desire that an opportunity would be provided for the workman to apply to the courts to have his weekly payments redeemed in the same manner as the employer can apply to the courts.  More than that, I think, was not envisaged at any time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the position stands, the case for such an avenue being opened to the workman does not depend so much on the type of case mentioned by the Minister, namely, the position of a workman who had met with an injury and who, at that point, if he had the financial means, might find it possible to engage in some form of industry or handicraft by which he could maintain himself whereas, if he continued for a further period of years on the weekly payment, that opportunity would not be available.  Rather, it depends on a much more gruesome and objectionable feature, one that is very prevalent in workmen's compensation cases, that is, the practice, which still continues, that where an injured workman is <Col N="178" /> receiving weekly payments, for not merely week after week and month after month, but for year after year, that man is kept on these weekly payments by the insurance company in the hope, quite frankly, either that he will die and therefore terminate the liability or that eventually he will become so desperate as to make an approach through his employers to the insurance company in the hope of getting a lump sum redemption. Immediately he makes that approach he exposes the weakness of his position and is then easily taken advantage of in regard to the actual sum which can be secured as settlement of his claim. Many of us who are familiar with this type of case know of cases where men have been kept on these weekly payments.</P>
    <P>Even the weekly payment that it is proposed now to provide as a maximum in this Bill is a very inadequate sum for a man on which to maintain himself and, possibly, his wife and a number of children.  Where that maintenance has to be secured, not in relation to a period of months&mdash; because a period of months may not exhaust entirely the man's resources or his credit&mdash;but over years, it does mean towards the latter portion of that period complete and continuous and never-ending destitution.</P>
    <P>I am aware of a case of a man who is permanently disabled.  For more than nine years he was kept on the old weekly payment of 35/- a week by one of the largest corporations in this country.  During those nine years he had to keep himself and his family on that sum of 35/- a week.  During the period the family grew and finally he had, I think, six children.  Eventually, the payment was redeemed.  He was then a man of over 50 years of age. He was crippled for life.  The elder children had gone out and had started in life for themselves.  He was still left with a number of children.  When he had received his lump sum payment and paid off his debts, he was left with the sum of £60 on which to maintain his family for the rest of his life or until they could maintain themselves. That period of nine years was a period of never-ending destitution for that <Col N="179" /> family.  At no point had he any solution to the problem even though, indirectly, approaches were made to try to secure a lump sum settlement which at that period might have made it possible for him to find some other ways of providing support for his family.</P>
    <P>The difficulty in discussing workmen's compensation is that we take it for granted very often that on one side we have an injured workman and on the other side we have a sympathetic employer.  That, very often, is not the case.  Very often, on the other side, we have a commercial insurance company to whom the injured workman is merely a name in a book and they operate their insurance transactions on a strict economic basis which, in so far as the injured workman is concerned, could better be translated into terms not merely of sweat and blood but of tears and degradation and destitution for himself and his family.</P>
    <P>The solution that was being sought and which this section intends to provide was, in fact, to try to give to the injured workman the protection of the court, not in any arbitrary fashion, but that in an ordinary manner he could apply to have the court review the general position and if at the discretion of the court it was thought advisable that the weekly payment should be redeemed then the ordinary legal process could be set in motion.</P>
    <P>It is not often that a Minister or a Department goes beyond what ordinary back-benchers in the House look for but that appears to be the case in this present section.  They have embodied the principle of providing access to the court for an injured workman seeking redemption but they have gone much beyond that.  They have raised a number of problems which, on examination, quite clearly may be able to create a situation in which those of us who wish to have the courts open to the injured workman for this particular purpose may well find the court forming the opinion that it is either impracticable or undesirable to try to apply and operate the section as set down in the Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="180" /> It is not necessary, I think, to go into the many difficulties that would reveal themselves.  For example, in regard to the question of incapacity, while it is referring to permanent incapacity, it has no qualification as to whether the incapacity is total or partial.  We are all aware of cases of partial incapacity where, in subsequent years, through readjustment, an injured workman can find himself in a much more secure financial position than even at the time he met with the accident.  There was a difficulty pointed out on Second Reading by Deputy Dr. Ryan of the possibility of having a succession of these cases arising.  Finally, then, in regard to the calculation of the lump sum, the calculation is arbitrary once the decision is made by the court and that in itself may give rise to difficulties which will induce the court to be exceptionally reluctant to exercise its discretion to the point where it has to calculate the lump sum.</P>
    <P>For all these reasons it would appear that, however anxious we might be to open the court to the injured workman for a review of his claim for redemption, if we seek to do it by virtue of the present section we may in fact create a position which makes our whole purpose ineffective.</P>
    <P>However, while the Minister suggests that we should leave this over to the commission, I wonder would it be possible between this and Report Stage to consider the possibility of confining ourselves just to the simple proposition that the injured workman would have access to the court?  As the thing stands at the moment there is certain protection for the workman in so far as any agreement that is made has to be registered and we know from experience that a fairly watchful eye is maintained to protect the workman's interest but, as the position stands at the moment, we have the workman left in the position that, unless it suits the insurance company, he will be maintained indefinitely on weekly payments and there is, therefore, the invitation either to let that weekly payment stand in the hope, to put it very crudely, that physical factors will terminate the existence of the workman <Col N="181" /> along with the weekly payment or, alternatively, that the economic pressure on the workman will become so great that he will seek to make approaches to secure settlement himself and, as everybody realises with these cases, to put it on a very commercial basis of buyer and seller, the workman puts himself in the position of a seller and he immediately reveals himself as an over-enthusiastic seller who will be taken advantage of by the cautious buyer.</P>
    <P>That is the kind of position we thought should be remedied.  Giving all due credit to the Minister and his Department, it does appear that they have gone too far and have created a situation which, in fact, may render null and void the very provisions that we are all anxious to see.  For that reason, I would ask the Minister, between this and Report Stage, to see whether or not, even now, it would be possible to put in a simple amendment in substitution for the whole section, under which it would be possible for the workman to apply to the court and then, subject to the court's discretion and the protection of the court, to secure a lump sum settlement of his weekly payment if, in the opinion of the court, it is thought desirable to protect the injured workman against this form of exploitation or, alternatively, to make it possible for him, by having a lump sum in his hand, to make use of either his own talents, his physical strength at middle age, rather than be let go on until a later period when his initiative or physical or mental ability would be such that it would be no longer possible for him to put to proper advantage any lump sum he might gain as a means of providing himself with an alternative form of livelihood.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing here with a distinction that many have thought is an inequitable distinction between the rights of the employer and the rights of the workman.  I think it is under Section 27 that the employer has certain rights of redeeming a weekly payment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy James Larkin has pointed out the disabilities on the workman's side.  I wonder is there in one way a <Col N="182" /> somewhat unfair advantage on the employer's side under the law as at stands at present?  For instance, it is quite clear&mdash;or, is it?&mdash;that in anticipation, say, of a situation where an increase in wages is likely to come and where one can reasonably expect that some Minister will introduce increases in the rates of benefit under these Acts employers will choose to seek to redeem these weekly payments on the basis of Section 27; and that simply means that an employer has in certain circumstances the right to decide in effect as to whether the workman will be kept on a string, as Deputy Larkin has pointed out, or whether, to change the metaphor slightly, he will cut the painter and get clear of the trouble in the most expeditious and economic way for him.</P>
    <P>That seems to indicate that some such equalising position as the spirit of sub-section (1) of Section 8 should be retained in the Act.  We think the Minister should retain something on these general lines to restore the balance as between workman and employer. If the workman is kept to the present system of weekly payments indefinitely he is clearly at a disadvantage, as everybody knows.  The whole system is such that it works as an insurance, and has so worked, that that man will never seek work because the risk involved is too great.  Very often it is a manoeuvre to see whether it can be proved that the man is able to work and he then loses his compensation. But, apart from anything else, the temptation involved in a situation like that is a little bit more than should be put in any workman's way.</P>
    <P>I think there is foundation for the statement that this section is too involved.  It seeks to do more than is really necessary.  The difficulty I see in it, from the Minister's point of view, is that the wording of Section 8, sub-section (1), and of sub-section (1) of Section 27 of the 1934 Act is pretty nearly the same, if the sub-sections are not actually word for word.  I find it hard to escape some of the difficulties which Deputy J. Larkin admits are contained in the section as a whole, difficulties <Col N="183" /> which lead the Minister to withdraw the section as a whole.  I find it hard to escape these on the initial wording of that section.  There seems to be a case, therefore, for something simpler, something more direct.</P>
    <P>While withdrawing Section 8, I would suggest that this matter could be met by the substitution of a simple direct section seeking to do what we want done.  What is wanted is the substitution of a simple provision which will enable under appropriate circumstances a workman to secure a lump sum payment in complete discharge of the employer's liability instead of continuing weekly payments under the Act contingent on, say, cesser through complete recovery or even partial recovery. I admit there are difficulties in that. The difficulty of interpreting the word &ldquo;permanent&rdquo; alone has been adverted to by the Minister.  But there is another difficulty.  There are the interminable costs.  There are the administration costs for, say, insurance companies with the workman himself, legal costs and all the other things that mount up and which are incidental to such machinery as is all too frequently provided in this workmen's compensation code.  I think we lose sight of these things.</P>
    <P>The risk involved in doing the direct thing can be argued minutely here. Such risks can constitute heavy burdens and would probably be offset to a considerable extent by a simplification of the procedure and a saving of the incidental costs incurred in establishing anybody's right under these Acts&mdash;incidental costs which are not by any means inconsiderable.  In order to simplify the provision one is tempted to suggest that &ldquo;at the discretion of the court as to whether or not this is an appropriate case to redeem the sum for an appropriate value&rdquo; might be as efficient in the long run as anything else.  The only drawback I see to that is that courts &mdash;at least the courts of law as distinct from other bodies which we have come to describe as courts&mdash;are rather bound by precedent.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, there is in the case of the law courts a certain <Col N="184" /> certainty.  There is a certain certainty of values.  There is a certain insurance of equity for all citizens that one gets nowhere else and the use of the courts as machinery gives one, when it is-necessary to have any arbitration at all, a stability within the social system that one does not get by the setting up of <i>ad hoc</i> tribunals with looser powers and without the same standing as law courts have.  This could very easily take us into a discussion as to what this legislation should be.  In general, this type of legislation should to my mind merely provide for administration machinery in insurance matters reserving to the courts only those matters which are strictly controversial and which in their nature require arbitration and judicial decision.  Such matters, instead of being passed to <i>ad hoc</i> tribunals, are better passed to courts of law.</P>
    <P>After that digression, I come back to the other point.  I see the Minister's difficulty in this.  I agree with Deputy J. Larkin that possibly the Minister was attempting too much in this particular case.  On the other hand, I see the Minister's difficulty particularly in regard to the problem initially based on the existence of the section in the Statute Book giving the right to employers. In all these circumstances it might, therefore, be best to be bold and make a simple provision that the court should determine a matter of the nature expounded here by Deputy J. Larkin and to leave it at that pending the fixing of the law in a final and proper shape, as is apparently visualised.</P>
    <P>I share the view expressed on the other section that if we start taking the easy way out in this particular Bill by saying that the problem is a difficult one and leaving it for a commission or someone else, we will merely put the whole thing on the long finger and there are large numbers of workmen throughout the country who will continue to suffer as a result of such delay.  It is an unfortunate fact, and it is no harm to underline what Deputy J. Larkin has said, that where a workman finds himself in receipt of weekly payments for a permanent incapacity he runs the risk of <Col N="185" /> being kept on a string; he knows himself to be in that position and he will surely consult a solicitor who will advise him.  He will know that any attempt on his part either to rehabilitate himself or get employment or even to work in his own back garden will be used as evidence against him to cut down his compensation without any guarantee to him or even any hope for him of getting employment that will give him remuneration which will compensate for what he loses in compensation.</P>
    <P>Any of us who have been in the courts and who have heard or seen, or taken part in workmen's compensation cases have listened to a barrister or a judge saying to an unfortunate man in the witness box: &ldquo;Hold out your hand&rdquo; and he will proceed to prove that the man worked in his garden or dug potatoes or something, proving that he was able to do work.  I think we have all had that experience frequently and where a workman is compelled to stay on a string&mdash;it is bad.  There are difficulties, no doubt, but these are perhaps legal difficulties and so far as they may be legal difficulties, perhaps a bold administrative decision will get over the difficulties.  I am not at all so sure that we should wait for a commission to do something to remedy that position. Apart from the inequity, apart from the fundamental disparity between the rights of the employers and the workmen in this case, you have a situation that is intensely demoralising and degrading for the unfortunate workman.</P>
    <P>Sometimes there may be cases where there is malingering and all the rest of it on the one side&mdash;there is never complete virtue on one side as against the other, perhaps, in these cases&mdash;but the position does make for demoralisation of the worker and I would urge on the Minister even if he does not retain this section&mdash;and I think he has very little option but to delete it now&mdash;that something corresponding to Section 8 should be written into this Bill&mdash;the point being that if it is put on the long finger, goodness knows when legislative action to mend the injustice&mdash;I will call it that&mdash;will be taken.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to urge on <Col N="186" /> the Minister the question of considering some alternative to Section 8 if it is withdrawn.  Deputies Larkin and de Valera have given some instances of the hardships that occur in cases of workmen's compensation and of the pressure that can indirectly be brought on injured workers to force an unjust settlement or a settlement that is not in the interests of the worker.  It is only fair and proper that the worker should have the right to elect to accept a capital sum where the court agrees and start off again.  I agree there is a great number of difficulties and I think the biggest difficulty is the threat of a decrease in payments that will be put forward by the insurance companies. It is the view of the insurance companies, as far as I know, that every workman who had weekly payments would immediately cash in on this clause.</P>
      <P>That is very far from the actual fact. With the amount of compensation at 90/- there would be less inducement than ever to avail of that clause.  It is only those who would feel that this course would be in the best interests of themselves and their dependents who would avail of it.  In fact it may be availed of to such a small extent as to be of very little use.  But the right of the worker should be protected and some clause should be put in to prevent the insurance companies exploiting such a position, some means of limiting the rights of the insurance companies should be worked out by the Minister or his Department.  As the Minister himself pointed out, there is the Prices Advisory Body.  I would at least suggest that the Minister should consider the suggestion of Deputy Larkin and he might then be able to bring in some simple amendment on the Report Stage&mdash;perhaps on the lines Deputy de Valera suggested &mdash;which would protect the interest of the worker and cover what the trade unions and those interested in the workers desire to have covered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one other point.  On the Second Reading&mdash;I do know how far the Chair can allow me to deal with this; I just wanted to draw the attention of the Minister to it&mdash;a number of Deputies expressed the wish that if <Col N="187" /> this section went through there should be an amendment by the Minister to cover retrospection for cases that are now being settled hurriedly. I would suggest to the Minister that he should also consider that aspect of the matter before the Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. MacCarthy Mr. MacCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>While there are some vital differences in the type of case about which I am speaking and those referred to by Deputies Larkin and de Valera, I am prepared to advocate something on the lines indicated&mdash; that is, access to the courts.  Insurance companies, for example, do not enter into these cases where local authorities carry their own insurance and where the permanent injury means there is undoubtedly a permanent injury but not complete incapacity.  There may also be cases of partial incapacity due to impaired vision and undoubtedly considerably more risk for the worker in his future years because, if another accident should occur to his other eye, he would end up in complete blindness.</P>
      <P>There is also the point that until he was restored to his job he would have the very small weekly allowance and consequently, not only would he have lost a vital organ but he would also have lost his earnings and he suffers risk as well of a renewal of unemployment if his sight is affected by weather in the bad season or in winter.  I am prepared to agree that a court might be the appropriate body to deal with that but at least the workman should have access to the court.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasAFinlay1954" hpid="Mr. Finlay Mr. Finlay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finlay</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one thing I would like to mention on this section. In so far as the requirement for access to the court in the case of permanent total incapacity is concerned, I have very considerable sympathy with the Deputies who have spoken in favour of some method of giving that.  So far <Col N="188" /> as temporary and, I think we may say, certain cases of partial permanent incapacity are concerned, my experience of the working of the Act over some years is that these usually work out very well from the workman's point of view.  Under the present system I believe&mdash;having been associated with the working of the Act for some considerable time and seeing one side of it one day and the other side the next &mdash;that so far as temporary incapacity is concerned, lump-sum settlements with all the safeguards there are nowadays are satisfactory enough.</P>
      <P>With regard to permanent total incapacity, I would like to see access by the workman to the court, but with regard to that, both this section and the amendments that have been put down to it display the fact that if you are going to bring in a section of this sort, no matter how you frame it, either as a simple short section leaving all discretion to the court, or a detailed section circumscribing the discretion of the court, if the section permits a person to redeem permanent total incapacity payments you have got to have two safeguards.  You have got to ensure that a court does not let the workman do that unless it is in his own interest and you have also got to ensure that the court does not do that to the severe detriment of the employer.</P>
      <P>That is the great stumbling block.  If an uninsured employer is going to be protected against redemption which would mean rain or financial ruin for him, there is only one way you can do it and that is that you must insist that the court does not redeem, even if it is in the workman's interest, if it is going to mean substantial financial hardship to the employer.  If you are going to work that out in any form of amendment you will find yourself in the position that the employer who is not insured must go to the court and prove that he is unable to meet the redemption. There is a number of classes of employers who through no fault of their own are not insured.  Take, for instance, the coal mining trade, which is economically quite sound, but the insurance rates make it impossible for them to insure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="189" /> In cases such as this, where there is a young workman suffering total incapacity, the redemption of which would cause financial ruin to the employer, the only way he can do it is to come into a public court and prove that he is not good for £3,500 or £4,000 as the case may be.  I would like to see some amendment introduced to meet such a case, but it is a very difficult matter.  Take the case of a good employer who, through no fault of his own, is not insured and has a young workman who through accident is totally incapacitated.  The redemption value of the weekly payments might be £3,500 or £4,000.  In order to avoid paying that amount and financially beggaring himself the employer has to come into court and prove that he is not able to pay.  That is not feasible and it will not work and I think that is our main difficulty in this section.</P>
    <P>I have the greatest sympathy for giving access to the court in regard to the redemption of permanent total incapacity, but I have not yet seen any method of getting over the difficulty I have mentioned unless this House decides in some future legislation that workmen's compensation should be compulsory.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the sentiments expressed on all sides of the House are sentiments which express considerable sympathy with the injured workmen and particularly with the workman who is totally incapacitated. This section of the Bill was brought in by the Minister for Social Welfare, whose Bill it is, in order to try and deal with the problem thrown up in the life of the injured workman by reason of the fact that he may be kept for many years on a weekly payment at a rate which is totally inadequate to sustain even a tolerable standard of existence.  Sometimes it is not the private employer that is responsible.  I remember, as a Deputy, dealing with the case of a constituent of mine who for nine years was trying to get a Government Department to redeem his weekly payments so as to buy himself a small shop to operate in a turf camp where there was need for such a shop.  The Department concerned <Col N="190" /> refused to consider the injured workman's claim for a lump sum.</P>
      <P>Quite recently I had to deal with the case of a constituent who was receiving compensation from a State-sponsored body for some time.  That body refused to consider a claim for a lump sum, but now that they have seen this Bill they moved to redeem the compensation at the old rate.  That would mean cheating the injured workman out of the compensation with which this House is attempting to provide him.  Can you imagine how an injured workman has to fight for his rights when both a Government Department and a State-sponsored body tried to beat the benefits provided for him by this House?  I hope we will be able to teach that State-sponsored body that the Ten Commandments still run in this country.</P>
      <P>This section is a difficult one.  One of the biggest difficulties is determining whether incapacity is permanent after a person has suffered from it for six months.  It is difficult for a court to say whether that incapacity will last for the remainder of that person's life. That is difficulty number one.</P>
      <P>There is a further difficulty now that it is felt that sub-section (4) of Section 8 is pretty difficult of interpretation and that it may cause all sorts of difficulties not contemplated when it was drafted.  I think that there is a case to be made for giving an injured workman his permanently injured payment if he has been receiving benefit for a substantial period and everybody recognises that he is permanently incapacitated and is never likely to work again.  I think that man should be entitled to go to the court to ask the court, if it thinks fit, to give him a lump sum in lieu of those weekly payments. I think he should be permitted to have that access to the court and that the court should be allowed to decide whether or not it would be better to give him a lump sum than to keep him on in receipt of the maximum payment of 90/- a week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are difficulties now revealed so far as the drafting of this section is concerned but if it is the desire of all <Col N="191" /> sides of the House that it should be examined between now and the Report Stage I would be willing, when the Minister for Social Welfare returns, to discuss the matter further with him and see if any reasonable method can be devised which will enable the court to exercise its judgment and give the injured workman a lump sum, or, if it feels it more prudent, to allow him to continue to receive his weekly rate of compensation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Finlay raised the question of the person who cannot pay.  I have a lot of sympathy with that point of view, but I do not think Deputy Finlay would say that it is desirable that other people who can pay, and who ought to pay, and whose payment would help to rehabilitate the family of the injured workman, should be able to shelter behind the case of the employer who is not able to pay.  If we could get a form of words which would oblige the court to have some regard to the circumstances it might be possible to provide a practical amendment to bring the matter before the court for review, allowing the court to have complete discretion.</P>
    <P>If that represents the viewpoint of the House I will have the matter further examined between now and the Report Stage.  If, however, it is not possible to find a satisfactory amendment for the Report Stage I take it the House would desire that the Bill should proceed without the introduction of a substitute for Section 8. Otherwise this Bill could not be passed into law until the Dáil reassembles after the Summer Recess.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Having heard what Deputy Finlay and the Minister had to say, I am more than ever convinced about my point of view.  We are apt to become confused with such words as &ldquo;permanent&rdquo; and &ldquo;total&rdquo;.  There would be a large number of cases where this does not really create a problem.  If a man loses a leg the question of total or partial incapacity does not come into it so much.  I would be quite prepared to argue that a similar type of provision should be made available in the case of partial <Col N="192" /> incapacity if it is permanent because it is just in the case of partial incapacity that the workman finds great difficulty in regard to employment. There will be many cases of partial incapacity where the workman is virtually incapacitated for the type of work he was doing before and at the same time where he is capable of doing other work, such as opening a shop, as was mentioned here.  In exceptional cases, however, there may be difficulty. Many cases, of course, will appear in court and will attract the limelight because they are difficult cases and there will be a great deal of argument around them, but the vast majority of cases should be disposed of very easily.</P>
      <P>I do not think this argument as to whether the injury is permanent or partial or total is really a serious one. It is a question of whether, in the circumstances, it is likely to be permanent. I wonder is permanency a necessary test at all either in the case of the employer or the workman?  In cases of common law in regard to the assessment of damages this problem arises in almost every case.  The counsel on behalf of the plaintiff will, if the facts warrant it at all, go to the extent of suggesting that something is likely to be a permanent disability for the claimant for damages, and counsel for the defence will be at great pains to show, according to his brief, that the injury is transient in its effects. Constantly, therefore, the courts are confronted with this problem as to what is the real value of the injury, whether it is to be measured in terms of earning capacity or in terms of pain and suffering.  In the case of this Act I agree it has to be measured in terms of earning capacity but there is nothing exceptional in that.  Therefore, quite frankly I think the Minister is unduly apprehensive when he invokes the word &ldquo;permanent&rdquo; as a reason for delay in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree, however, that there are other things in the section that make it desirable to recast the whole thing.  In regard to Deputy Finlay's point, at first sight the case he made in regard to the employer is very convincing.  In fact, he almost convinced me for a few moments until I had time to think <Col N="193" /> about it.  There is no doubt that you would probably have to put in some provision that the employer would have to go into court and prove he was unable to meet the commitment in the instance such as Deputy Finlay mentioned and that it would perhaps be embarrassing for him to prove his inability to meet it.  Equity seemed to demand that a certain stage must be reached where a balance of fairness to the employer would certainly come into play.</P>
    <P>Certain cases may arise, in regard to the relationship between the individual employer and his workman, in which it will be necessary to determine the greater of two hardships.  However, in these days when insurance is largely resorted to, if there are very big sums of this nature involved I would imagine the employer who might find himself embarrassed and possibly damaged by coming into court to say that the payment of £4,000 could not be met would be quite big enough to safeguard himself from such embarrassment by insurance.  Therefore, I would not accept that argument in that case at all.  It would be a most reasonable thing for him to provide some kind of insurance.  If he is really very big he may provide his own insurance. In the average run of businesses the insurance will be provided by an arrangement with an insurance company.  There could be no hardship in these cases because these insurance companies are not in this business just for philanthropic motives.</P>
    <P>In the case of the small shopkeeper or the small farmer, however, if he does not insure for the type of work, I think the risk of embarrassment must be taken as incidental and as less than the hardship of a workman employed by him would suffer.  For instance, supposing you have some person in a small way employing a man who has a family.  This man loses his capacity for working: which is the greater hardship, to have that man continuing in these degrading circumstances which, as Deputy Larkin says, can amount to destitution or to have that person who had employed him coming in to try to prove that he is not in a position to meet this claim?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="194" /> The real difficulty that arises here is of another nature.  It is the whole question of the insurance of people in their employment and it is a broad question of social insurance.  There are very few of us nowadays who, one way or another, are not in the capacity of employees, of working people.  Most of us have to live by our own efforts in our modern community.  It brings up a big question of proper insurance to meet such cases.  With respect, therefore, I would not accept the Minister's argument.  I think he did not put up a very convincing case against the principle here but I accept absolutely his statement that there are difficulties. I think Deputy Finlay's argument can be met.  If we postpone this too long it might go on the long finger altogether.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste is a past master at suggesting that certain things will hold up legislation.  He said that the Bill would be held up completely and that a lot of people would suffer if we held up the Bill as a whole for this provision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>If this thing is to be done at all, if the principle is accepted, I think it probably could be done next week.  After all, legislative provisions have been rushed through this House a lot faster on occasions.  I think that is all I can usefully add to this discussion.  I should like to say, however, that this entire Bill brings out the point that the whole framework of the workmen's compensation code is now out of date and that it has many bad features.  It wants a complete revision and there are a large number of insurance schemes and so forth which operate without the impedimenta hanging on to this particular code and the quicker the Minister can move to have the whole thing put on a rational and equitable basis the better for everybody concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceEDockrell" hpid="Mr. M.E. Dockrell Mr. M.E. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister has been very wise in withdrawing this section.  It is a very <Col N="195" /> complicated matter and various Deputies have brought out different aspects of the problem.  One of the aspects of this matter is the capacity of industry in general to pay.  The Minister mentioned that and we must not lose sight of the fact that in this country at the present moment we are going through a period when we are using every means in our power to try and encourage the industrial side of the country in an endeavour to build up exports.  A very heavy burden in the way of insurance for workmen's compensation would tend very much to put up the cost of our manufactures generally and in fact to increase our cost of living.</P>
      <P>When I say that I must not be taken as suggesting in any way that the very greatest care should not be given to our injured workmen.  That is so, but at the same time I think this section went too far in that respect; it might have had very serious effects on the whole question of the industrialisation of this country.  Mind you, we would not be the first country in the world to have got a stranglehold on industry by legislative methods without intending to do so.  Other countries have done that in the past with very disastrous results.  There is another side of this question, that connected with the capacity of the individual firms to pay.  In industry and in trade generally in this country you have various classes of employers.  At the top, you have employers who pay trade union wages, and in some cases you have firms paying perhaps more than is actually demanded by organised labour&mdash;of course, under conditions which capital and labour and, I might say, philanthropy would allow.  Most of these firms have to pay workmen's compensation and they have in most cases, unless they are selling proprietary articles of some sort, to exist in the teeth of competition.  This has a very great effect on the capacity of firms to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If you make conditions too bad for such firms you will tend over the whole field to drive those firms out of existence and most certainly we do not <Col N="196" /> want to drive them out of existence. Still less do we in this House want to discourage them in any way.  Deputy Finlay mentioned a point which is very important in discussing this question. He said that if everybody had to pay workmen's compensation you would have equal conditions.  That, I consider, is the whole kernel of this matter.  I agree that if everybody pays you are going to have equal conditions for all except, of course, in so far as your export trade is concerned. But the way we have been operating up to now is that certain firms pay workmen's compensation and others do not; others get away with it although they may be selling or making similar articles to those who pay and although they may be tendering for the same sort of business.</P>
    <P>We do recognise that principle in our Government Departments and in local government contracts and supplies&mdash;we see that trade union conditions, if recognised, should be insisted upon. Actually, firms that pay workmen's compensation are carrying out that idea.  This is not the place to go into that matter, but I think it is something that is of very great importance.  I am sure it was one of the factors taken into consideration when withdrawing this section that you must not place an undue handicap on the decent firms who do their best to follow out the principles which would ensure that the workmen when injured would get paid properly and would get looked after properly.</P>
    <P>There are undoubtedly some individual firms who do not do that and because of that if this section were insisted upon as it stands now, in my opinion one of the very serious effects would be that a large number of firms would be handicapped very severely, because of the fact that some of their competitors get away scot free.  These latter firms could, under sub-section (4), plead that their circumstances were such that they could not pay the required sum in compensation.  I might say that nobody buying the goods of the cheaper manufacturer or employing the services of the cheaper employee quite possibly would take advantage of that and I think the Minister has <Col N="197" /> done a wise thing in withdrawing this section and in letting the very obvious benefits of the £4 10s. per week be made available to injured workmen. Let us examine this question by all means very, very carefully before we rush into something that might injure the whole industry of this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. J. Larkin Mr. J. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I must suffer from an unstable mentality because I came into the House quite satisfied that the section should be withdrawn and the more I have heard the argument in favour of my point of view the more convinced I have become that I am wrong.</P>
      <P>If you look at the section in the 1934 Act and if you put in one word, that is, in addition to giving the employer the right of making the application, also the worker, there is not one single change being made, either in regard to total incapacity, partial incapacity or anything else, so that we can leave that to one side.  It is the consequential factors that are probably giving rise to the difficulties.  I think, largely, Deputy Finlay has put his finger on it but not quite definitely.</P>
      <P>Actually, what is wrong, of course, here is the cost.  The cost has become a problem because, not merely are we suggesting the opening of this section to the worker, but we are doing it at a time when we are raising the weekly payment from 50/- to 90/&mdash;by four-fifths. That is what has got everybody scared.  If we had come along with this section at a time when there was no increase in the weekly payment, we would probably have a lot of difficulties but probably not to the same extent. We have already been told that the insurance companies estimate that this particular section alone will represent a 60 per cent. increase in the present premium.  Deputy Dockrell has been concerned at this.  My conscience started troubling me when I found Deputy Dockrell and myself on the same side.  It is never a very good side for me to be on.  I started looking at the thing a little closer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First of all, let us examine the question of the uninsured employer.  A good employer is not a man who complies <Col N="198" /> with the law.  That is no special qualification.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceEDockrell" hpid="Mr. M.E. Dockrell Mr. M.E. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>He is not a bad employer, surely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. J. Larkin Mr. J. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but he is not a good one.  As an example of a good employer&mdash;Deputy Dockrell knows many of them, like I do&mdash;I will give the picture of an employer who, when a workman meets with an injury in his employment, does not pay him, as at present, 50/- a week but, as many good employers do, pays him his full wages as sick pay.  There are many good employers like that.  They recover part of the payment in the form of refund of the workmen's compensation sum from the insurance company. But, as far as the ordinary employer is concerned, who complies with the law&mdash;in some cases because he has to&mdash;this House is not under any particular obligation to that particular individual.</P>
      <P>The problem is, as Deputy Finlay says, the problem of the uninsured employer.  First of all let us get clear. If an employer is not insured, it is for one of two reasons&mdash;either because he wants to save on his insurance premiums&mdash;and then he is not a good employer&mdash;or he is ignorant of the fact that he can insure against this risk.  I think, on the whole, there will be very few people, especially those who propose to employ people, who are unaware that you can get insurance cover for this particular risk.  Generally, the attitude is that we take a gamble. If we have no accidents, we save the premiums and, if we do meet with an accident, then we hope to God we will escape the consequences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us look at the other angle.  An employer is not merely liable under the Workmen's Compensation Act, he is also liable under the Employers' Liability Act for a much more serious sum.  If we argue that we should not impose this burden on the employer who is not insured, why should we impose the burden on him if he is not insured in respect of the Employers' Liability Act?  Granted, there is the element of negligence, but every man who employs people knows very well <Col N="199" /> that, while he may take very careful measures to avoid negligence on his part, there is always the element that there may be an oversight and he may still be held liable.  It is ordinary common sense to insure against that.</P>
    <P>It may be argued that there is not the same onus to insure against an accident under the Workmen's Compensation Act because there is not the element of negligence or carelessness charged against the employer but every employer knows that, once you employ people, no matter how careful you are, there is the element of an accident arising if it is only an accident caused by a worker's own carelessness or through the carelessness of another workman or purely through an act of God.  To that extent, it seems to me that there is just as much onus on the employer to protect himself and his workmen against the risk covered by the Workmen's Compensation Act as there is under the Employers' Liability Act.</P>
    <P>I doubt if anybody in this House would have very great sympathy for an employer against whom an order was made for heavy damages on the basis of his negligence if that employer was then to get up in court and plead that he should be relieved of meeting the sum because he was not insured.  In fact, the immediate reaction is that the damages should probably be doubled for his negligence, not only in regard to his workman, but in regard to himself.</P>
    <P>I recall a case some years ago where we had to act on behalf on a young man who lost part of his arm.  The employer was found to be negligent. We got an award against him.  We were never able to recover.  He went bankrupt.  He evaded all his liabilities. Three years later he was up in business again.  That kind of employer every body will condemn.</P>
    <P>Under modern conditions, the factor of insurance is widely known.  Every day in the papers even the small farmers can read of workmen's compensation cases in the courts where there is an award given.  There can be no suggestion that there is any <Col N="200" /> great element of ignorance in failure to insure on the part of the employer. Rather, I think, it is the element of indifference, carelessness or very often, the ordinary economic element of cupidity, trying to save a few pence.</P>
    <P>That is the type of employer who is now held up as an obstacle to doing what all sides of the House believe should be done.  As I said, if we insert one word in the 1934 Act we have in fact got Section 8.  The only difference, of course, is that the workman is able to apply.  That is not a principal difference and that in itself is not giving rise to the difficulty.  The difficulty is arising from the fact that the workman will now be able to apply when his weekly payment will have been increased from 50/- to 90/-, but the basis of calculation in so far as permanent incapacity is concerned remains the same under the section as it was under the old Act.  The basis of decision in respect of partial incapacity will continue to be the same under the section as it was under the old Act.  The only difference, in fact, is that we have gone to the extent of safeguarding the employer, the so-called good employer, who has no regard for himself or his workmen and, therefore, does not protect himself and his workmen by taking out insurance.</P>
    <P>We put in sub-section (4) to say that, having applied to the workman the provisions of the 1934 Act, which have been applied in the case of the employer for a good many years, and the court having decided, on the facts in the case, that redemption would be a good and proper thing for the workman, we then turn around and say that, having decided all that, the court shall be entitled to exercise discretion on behalf of the employer.  In other words, if, having found the workman has a fully sustainable case for redemption of his weekly payment, the court then finds that it is faced with one of these peculiar employers who will not protect himself and his worker, the court can then decide in its discretion that, even though the Legislature has decided that this protection will be given to the workman, it has now got the discretion of twisting that protection to protect the indifferent <Col N="201" /> employer who has placed himself in the position that he has to admit that he has to go bankrupt because he cannot meet the particular claim or who has to come into court and admit that he has been at fault in not maintaining protection both for himself and his worker.</P>
    <P>Listening to this debate, it occurred to me that in fact we are colouring this whole proposal in the section much more than is really necessary.  I have to confess that I am as much at fault as anybody else in that respect.  I feel we are being misled by two factors: first of all, the cost; now the cost does not arise out of the section itself.  The cost would be no different in principle in so far as the 1934 Act is concerned merely because of the inclusion of the word &ldquo;worker&rdquo; and if, as I said earlier, we were dealing merely with the amendment of the section and not with the amount of weekly payment there would probably not be the same difficulty as we are experiencing at the moment.</P>
    <P>The whole difficulty is that we are trying to do this at the same time as we are trying to do another overdue justice to the worker, namely, increase the weekly payment.  First of all, because the amount involved in, say, the case of a young man of 21&mdash;the lump sum redemption for total incapacity&mdash;may run into the neighbourhood of £3,000 or £4,000, we are all starting to get a little bit afraid of putting £3,000 or £4,000 into the hands of a workman; but every day of the week we are putting many times that amount into the hands of other individuals who have got less sense of responsibility than a worker has, and no one objects. In the case of the worker that figure is arrived at after a court of competent jurisdiction has fully examined and determined the worker's legal right. There is no other element in it and, if the court determines that right, the man then has a full right to secure that amount.  That is one of the factors causing difficulty, namely, the actual amount of money involved.</P>
    <P>If this question had arisen in 1934 when the original Act was passed we would have been talking then in terms <Col N="202" /> of £1,000 or £1,500 as compared with £3,000 or £4,000 to-day.  That was big money in these days.  The value of money has changed so much that the comparable value to-day of the sum that would have been secured in 1934 seems to be so inflated as to look completely out of proportion and certainly to go outside the limits to which an ordinary worker is entitled.  Secondly, we have the problem of increased premiums.  With all due respect to Deputy Dockrell, there is no sense in giving him a living.  We know from the figures for this type of insurance that the total amount collected in premiums from industry is not a very big figure.  I think it is a matter of something less than £2,000,000.  We are told that if we implement this section there will be a 60 per cent. increase in premiums and we boggle at that.  But we do not boggle at the fact that out of a sum of less than £2,000,000 at present paid by industry to insurance companies the insurance companies are picking up 30 per cent. in the form of profits.  If there is a good argument against passing this section because it will impose an additional 60 per cent. on industry why does industry not concern itself with the fact that it is already paying 30 per cent. to insurance companies for which it gets no value at all?  There is at least a good case behind all this to justify the increase.</P>
    <P>With regard to the overall costs, I suppose that even if we cost out the total increase that may flow from the passing of this Bill, including Section 8, it is doubtful if it will add .5 per cent. to the total costs of industry and if Irish industry will collapse because of the imposition of .5 per cent. on its costs, then I think the future for Irish industry is very black indeed.  Of course, nobody believes that.</P>
    <P>Again, while I and other Deputies have been quite frankly in a somewhat confused state of mind over this, and I think we are only starting to see the light now, I do not think it is proper to have us further confused as between the principles involved and the costs. If the principle is good, and the principle has been applied for many years on behalf of employers, then there will have to be a very strong argument as <Col N="203" /> to why the principle should not be applied on behalf of the workers.  By merely putting one word into the section of the 1934 Act we can do exactly what we have in mind and we will impose on the courts one additional problem which did not exist under the 1934 Act once the employer made the application; the only addition will be this discretionary power given to the courts under sub-section (4).  That was not in the 1934 Act.  I have no particular objection to it, but I think that, having accepted the viewpoint that the court should have that discretion to deal with the special circumstances on the part of the employer, we should not overstress the case that can be made for the employer and we should not be unduly led astray because of the difficulty of the good employer who is so good, either from his own point of view or from the point of view of the workman, that he fails to take this elementary precaution.</P>
    <P>Deputy Finlay mentioned industries in which there are special difficulties, such as the mining industry.  Section 78 of the 1934 Act makes ample provision whereby various enterprises in an industry can by mutual arrangement cover their costs under workmen's compensation so that no one firm will be unduly burdened.  Really the problem arises in regard to the individual employer and so long as he has got the possible liability that can always exist for an ordinary civil action for damages arising out of his own negligence or default, then he should as an ordinary sensible man insure against that risk.  Once that principle is accepted, the argument is equally strong that where a man enters into the employment of any person he should accept that there is always the possibility of a genuine accident and there should be the same liability on him to secure insurance cover.</P>
    <P>It may be argued that when this matter has been considered and examined by the commission and duly reported on, we may at a later stage deal with it by making insurance compulsory. But I do not think that we should leave it until that stage.  The <Col N="204" /> commission will have a very heavy job of investigation and it may well be some time before we get its report and, in so far as both sides are anxious to try to secure the passing of the main principle embodied in Section 8, I would again urge the Minister to give more careful examination to this matter between this and the Report Stage.  If he does that he may well agree that members of this House, and possibly the Minister for Social Welfare and his officials, have allowed themselves to build up bogies to frighten themselves away from something they know is desirable and is in fact quite practicable if we examine the matter with a little less colouring and a little less labouring of such extraneous factors as cost and the increase in premiums, the alleged increase in cost so far as industry is concerned and particularly this whole bogyman of the good employer who has forgotten to insure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Until the 1953 Act was introduced the practice was to pay the workman a percentage of his wages in accordance with scales determined by the separate Acts of Parliament which existed.  In 1953 a new principle was introduced.  The 1953 Act provided an increase for a married man.  It gave no increase to a single man or a single woman.  It provided only for an increase where the man was married and <Col N="205" /> had a wife living; and it provided an increase also where he had one or two children, two children being the maximum number which could qualify for the increased children's benefits.  That was the first time we broke with the long record of paying a percentage of the man's earnings.  In 1953 when the Act was introduced a very strong view was expressed here that it was a mistake to get away from the pattern of a percentage of earnings because the worker is employed to do a particular job and is in receipt of a particular rate of earnings which is not related to whether he is married or single or the number of children he has.</P>
      <P>This Bill gives expression to that view, that if he gets a particular rate of pay for the job he does, so he ought to get a regular and recognised percentage of his earnings if he meets with an accident in the course of his employment. From the time the first Workmen's Compensation Bill was introduced until 1953 that was the pattern. This section puts the pattern back into the mould where it was previously.</P>

      <P>I can see the force of that argument which is, in a sense, just an argument on precedence.  There is some advantage in exploiting the idea that we deal specially with cases where there is a dependency.  It enables us sometimes to balance out things.

    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 60 of the 1934 Act was amended by Section 61 of the Workmen's Compensation (Amendment) Act, 1953, to ensure that an injured workman in the course of his employment as a result of the employer's negligence would not be barred from taking action <Col N="206" /> for damages against the employer by accepting workmen's compensation.  It was believed that the 1953 Act made that position clear but a High Court decision subsequently suggested that the 1953 Act might not have done what was intended.  This decision was appealed to the Supreme Court and the case had not been heard by the Supreme Court before this Bill was drafted.  It was thought, therefore, desirable to put in Section 11 so as to remove any possibility of doubt that the 1953 Act did what it was intended to do.</P>
    <P>Since the Bill was drafted, the Supreme Court has given a decision confirming the interpretation of the 1953 Act and, therefore, I do not think it is necessary to make this special provision in Section 11.</P>

      <P>Last night when I moved to report progress, we were dealing with the question of applications for medals and the case of those who had also applied for military service certificates. I pointed out that most of the views expressed in the House were views I had already expressed myself on some previous occasion and that it was a legal question that the person who had applied for a military service pension was not regarded as having applied for the medal.  I also said that there was a reason for that&mdash;namely, in my opinion, a number of people who filled in applications for medals thought they would lessen or reduce their claim for a service certificate.  I want to say that the whole question of the medals is giving me very serious concern.  It gave my predecessor very serious concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to take the House into my confidence to show what sort of situation has developed.  Let me point out at the start that applications for certificates of service under the 1924 Act numbered 22,050.  The number of applicants under the 1934 Act was <Col N="208" /> 64,480.  On these figures, at least, I would be satisfied that that number would include everybody who did anything in the struggle during the period 1916 to 1923 inclusive&mdash;it does not matter which side they were on.  They did not include everybody.  The number of 1916 medals alone issued is 2,480; for 1917 to 1921 the number of medals with bar issued is 14,615.  You could take all these as people who had been granted certificates of service.  The number of medals without bar issued is 36,797.  The total number of medals issued is 53,820.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us not bother with that.  The total number of applications for medals without the bar is 62,473.  Of that number 34,797 are issued and the number refused is 2,605. The number of applications withdrawn or not followed up by the applicants is 9,206, and the number of claims still under consideration on the 31st May, 1955, was 13,865.  That gets every member of the Old I.R.A. thinking very seriously, and it certainly gave me to think very seriously on the whole question.  I do not want to commit my predecessor but I feel that it made him think also.  If he were here perhaps there are further statements I could make but in his absence I am not going to do so.</P>
      <P>The number of service certificates granted under the 1924 Act was 4,093 and the number of applications was 22,050.  Under the 1934 Act the number that applied was 64,480 and the number of certificates issued to date is 13,225.  Under the 1949 Act the number of certificates issued is 1,600 odd. The disturbing feature about medals is that they have been and are still issued on the certification of two officers of the battalion or brigade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last night Deputy Flynn appealed to me for a loosening-up of that form of certification so that it might be made easier.  In the County of Kerry alone there are 58 cases in which medals were granted and subsequently 29 of the persons concerned were granted special allowances.  Subsequent <Col N="209" /> to the issue of the medals and the special allowances, four senior officers of the Kerry Brigade reported that these people were never in the Volunteers at all although in most of the cases the people reporting that were the people who originally certified that they were in the Volunteers.</P>
    <P>That shook my predecessor.  It certainly shook me.  When that information came to my predecessor he did the only thing he could do and that was to withdraw the medals and cancel the special allowance where it was being paid until there had been further examination and investigation.  It was because Deputy Flynn asked me to open up this matter and made certification easier that I mention County Kerry but on reinvestigation of these 58 cases it was found that only eight people qualified for restoration of the medal and allowance.</P>
    <P>The total number of these cases all over the country in which reports have been received is 106 and there is not a brigade area in Ireland where there is not a person who appears to have received the medal improperly.  That forces me into the position that I will have to review the whole question. There will have to be a complete examination of the whole problem. How I am going to do it and how I am going to advise the Government as to what they should do I am blest if I know because of all the pieces of legislation that ever went through this House this is the most difficult that was ever given to a Minister to operate. Why it should be the unfortunate Minister for Defence that is called on to operate it I do not know.  It should not be part of the defensive problem of the country as to how pensions should be paid.</P>
    <P>I for one would surrender the thing to any other Minister with the utmost alacrity were it not for one fact and that is that I would be afraid that I would be avoiding my responsibilities and that some of my comrades of the past would not be given what they are entitled to.  That is the problem.  I am sure there is not a Deputy listening to me who does not realise that it is a terrible situation.  I have met deputations <Col N="210" /> from the Old I.R.A. and put the difficulty to them.  I have asked them to give me a solution&mdash;to give me a record from each brigade area of who were and were not in the pre-Truce Vouunteers, and I have told them that I do not care in what circumstances some of the previous records were made, but that I will agree to consider the matter on the records now supplied by them to me.  It is a big task to ask the brigade officers of any particular area to do that.  Some of them have accepted the task and some of them have done so not so willingly.  There is that problem.</P>
    <P>On the question of allowances raised by Deputy Gilbride, the Act lays it down clearly that there must be an examination of means each year. Where the applicant has the old age pension himself it is not taken into consideration but where the husband and wife are both in receipt of the old age pension the wife's pension is taken in.  Where a son is contributing a sum to the house&mdash;say £2&mdash;it is not calculated at that rate for means purposes but at the rate of 10/- and in some cases it is down to 5/-.  The means test is there since special allowances started and to do anything about it would mean new legislation and, as I said last night, that does not arise upon the Estimate.  Whatever steps I am going to take about fresh legislation will have to be examined and brought forward as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hilliard referred to the commencement date for special allowances. Again I am bound by the statute.  The allowance must date from the date the medical board examines the applicant. They can only find on examination that on that particular date the disability is present; they are not able to decide or asked to decide that it was there three or six months ago.  Therefore, the only thing that may appear to be wrong is the delay between the date of the application and the examination. We have tried to speed that up by appointing all over the country certain medical officers of eminent quality and qualifications.  They will examine the person and send up the report to the board and the board will act upon the information sent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="211" /> I admit that does not always work out in the interests of the applicant because some of the medical officers down the country have not always the experience of the board.  They have not the technique which the board has and which I must say is in favour of the applicant whenever possible.  I would say that 999 times out of 1,000 the applicant gets the benefit of the doubt and that as we are getting on in years the board is now becoming more lenient.  When they find a man of 59, 60 or 62, suffering a certain degree of disability, they take the view that that man is nearing the end of his labour and that he is not fit for physical labour in order to earn a livelihood. They are erring upon the right side, if I might put it that way, and I am glad they take that view.</P>
    <P>To go back to Deputy Traynor's speech, I might say that I have the exact figures here.  Since the 1949 Act was passed the number of new certificates issued was 1,604.  Might I just remind the House that in 1947 the then Government decided that everybody who was entitled to a pension had got it?  On examination even by the same Referee&mdash;God rest him&mdash;it was found that there were people whom he previously rejected who were in fact entitled to pensions.  I am not blaming him but, as I said then in the Dáil and as I said to the Referee himself, it was unfair to ask him to revise and reject his own decisions.  It was not fair either to himself or to the applicant.</P>
    <P>I will run through these figures because they are very important.  The total number of petitions received under the 1949 Act was 20,827.  There were 154 applications late and I suppose if it were left for another two years there would still be 154 late. There is always somebody trying to come in when the door is closed. Negative reports after hearing numbered 3,050, and negative reports without hearing, 2,105; <i>non-prima facie</i> cases numbered 9,132.  The number still to be dealt with by the Referee is 4,148.  There were 88 forms yet in the hands of the Department not sent to the Referee.  In view of what I have said you can see the difficulty.  I must <Col N="212" /> amend the Act or do something else in regard to this problem and I will need all the help I can get from everybody concerned.</P>
    <P>Deputy Traynor expressed the hope that the reduction of £100 in sub-head D for travelling expenes did not mean that there would be a change in the policy of the board about going down to the country.  No, the board will go down.  That has been taken into consideration and this was the expenditure, as it turned out.  The reduction is of no significance.  The decrease of £8,807 in respect of disease and disability pensions represents the reduction in the number of new pensions expected to come on pay during the the present financial year as compared with last year.  It does not represent any alteration in relation to the pensions already being paid.</P>
    <P>The Deputy has asked a question in regard to hospital treatment.  The reduction of £550 in the present provision is based on current expenditure. Nobody entitled to hospital treatment will be deprived of it because of a reduction in the amount.  Deputy Traynor also referred to the latest date for applying for eligibility for the special allowance, and as I have already said that is fixed by statute and there is nothing I can do about it.</P>
    <P>There is this difficulty under the 1953 Act and it is rather disturbing. Deputy Gilbride raised the question of an applicant under the 1953 Act who died before the award was made and whose daughter was unable to apply owing to the statutory date being passed.  Again an amendment to the Act is necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EugeneGilbride" hpid="Mr. Gilbride Mr. Gilbride">

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>This is what I am advised.  This is a case where an amendment of the Act would have to be made.  The latest date for application was August 5th, 1954.  The woman died in May, 1954.  If her death had been reported in time it would have been possible to have the matter put in order from the daughter's point of view.  Because she did <Col N="213" /> not notify the death my hands are tied.  It is hard luck; it is not her fault, because the difference between May and August is not very great.</P>
      <P>There is just one other point to which I would like to refer.  I had no intention yesterday evening of being discourteous to Deputy Kennedy who raised a question in connection with the F.C.A.  With your permission, Sir, I should like to say a word or two on it, if I may.  Deputy Kennedy raised the question of the F.C.A. attending a memorial ceremony in Auburn and he quoted from a speech made by the person who delivered the oration.  I should have liked previously to have given the circumstances of the case, but I had not the opportunity.  This memorial committee was composed of all sections of the community.  When I say all sections I mean all the Old I.R.A. who were on both sides of the fence during the civil war.  An application was made to the F.C.A. to attend.</P>
      <P>It was arranged that the parish priest would unveil the memorial and that he would inspect the guard of honour and do all the other things necessary.  That was done and we had no indication whatever that anything unusual would occur.  A local school teacher was called upon to give the oration and as far as I can ascertain the words he used were approximately those quoted by Deputy Kennedy last night in which the person concerned eulogised the happenings at Omagh and Armagh.  I would like to point out that neither the O.C. in Athlone nor myself could be expected to muzzle anybody's right to speak.  Sometimes, I admit, I would like to muzzle Deputy Kennedy if I could get the chance.  The parish priest repudiated the speaker and asked everybody else to repudiate him which they did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think Deputy Kennedy should have gone into the barracks to lecture the O.C. for having allowed the F.C.A. to attend the ceremony.  Of course it is a matter for himself but I wanted just to explain that and to show that there was no discourtesy intended in my failure to refer to it last night. I was endeavouring to try to get both <Col N="214" /> votes through as quickly as I could.  I should like also to take this opportunity of reminding Deputy Kennedy that he attended a Fianna Fáil convention for County Westmeath in Mullingar.  He was accompanied by a colleague of his, Deputy Patrick Smith.  At that convention the Athlone branch of Macra Fáil proposed a resolution almost identical in its terms with the suggestion of the speaker at Auburn.</P>

      <P>I want to ask the Minister a question, but first of all I want to apologise for being unable to be present earlier in the debate.  There is a case which I brought to the attention of the Minister and on which I should like the Minister to take some action.  It is the case of an Old I.R.A. man with a £30 service pension.  He is a single man and on account of the £30 pension all he gets at the local labour exchange is 4/- a week.  I understand there is a departmental committee dealing with these matters. I would ask the Minister if he would consider taking up the matter with this departmental committee because I think it is a scandal that an Old I.R.A. man who gave service to his country should have his unemployment benefit cut to 4/- a week because of his pension.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Minister if the basis of entitlement to the medal without bar is the cause of the trouble in the special allowance cases.  The figures he has given of the people who have applied appear to be extraordinarily out of proportion to the number of people who took part in the actual engagments throughout the whole country.  A very large number of people are entitled to apply and are entitled to be taken into consideration, as the basis for entitlement to the medal is three months' membership before the 11th July, 1921, and is applicable to all persons who served in the organisations named in the Act; that is, the Irish Volunteers, I.R.A., Cumann na mBan and Fianna Eireann. The total membership would have been very large and is the Minister satisfied with the basis of entitlement to the medal?  If we got such a statement it would solve some of the difficulties.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £4,912,000 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1956, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="217" /> The net Estimate for 1955-56 amounts to £7,707,000, being a gross total of £8,159,876 less Appropriations-in-Aid of £452,876.  The net provision represents an increase of £139,000 on that for 1954-55.  This figure is not that shown in the published Volume of Estimates (page 297) but there is a simple explanation of the difference.  Because of the early date by which the Estimates Volume had to be circulated this year it was not possible to show, as is the custom, the effect of the Post Office Supplementary Estimate approved by the Dáil on the 30th March, 1955.  This Supplementary Estimate was for £228,000, and this amount should be deducted from the increase of £367,000 shown in the Estimates Volume to get the net increase of the 1955-56 Estimate over the previous year's figure.  In making comparisons between sub-heads of the Estimate, account has been taken of the provision made by the Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <P>The more substantial variations&mdash; those of £10,000 or more&mdash;occur on the following sub-heads:&mdash;In sub-heads A (1), A (2), A (3) and A (4)&mdash;Salaries, Wages and Allowances&mdash;the increase, £154,206, is due to the grant of higher wage rates to postmen, an additional weekly pay-day falling within this year and normal incremental increases.  In sub-head G (1)&mdash;Stores (other than Engineering Materials)&mdash;the decrease, £31,000, is attributable to greater use of emergency reserve stores and to a reduction in the number of departmental motor vans due for replacement.</P>
    <P>In sub-head G (3)&mdash;Manufacture of Stamps, etc.&mdash;the decrease, £19,500, is due to an improvement in the stock position of stores covered by this sub-head, and in sub-head I (1)&mdash;Salaries, Wages and Allowances (Engineering) the decrease, £132,000, is due to a larger amount of the gross provision being chargeable to telephone capital than last year, offset by normal incremental increases.</P>
    <P>In sub-head K &mdash; Engineering Materials&mdash;the decrease, £42,000, is due to greater use of emergency reserve stores.  In sub-head L (2)&mdash; Contract Work&mdash;the increase, £17,000, <Col N="218" /> is due to greater provision for contract work on telegraph construction, and in sub-head M&mdash;Telephone Capital Repayments&mdash;there is an increase of £70,228.</P>
    <P>Funds for the development of the telephone system are provided under the authority of the Telephone Capital Acts (1924 to 1951) which authorise the Minister for Finance to issue sums out of the Central Fund for this purpose. Repayment of these funds is made by means of terminable annuities extending over a period not exceeding 25 years.  In consultation with the Minister for Finance provision is made each year under sub-head M for the repayment of the instalments of principal and interest on the annuities created.  The increased provision in the sub-head is an indication of the continuing expansion of the telephone system.</P>
    <P>In sub-head N (1)&mdash;Superannuation Allowances, etc.&mdash;the increase, £35,200, is mainly due to (1) higher pensions arising from salary and wage awards, and (2) allowances under the new Superannuation Act, 1954 (No. 14 of 1954).  In sub-head O (2)&mdash;Civil Aviation and Meteorological Wireless Services&mdash;the higher provision, £35,800, is due to the installation of additional equipment to meet international requirements.</P>
    <P>Mail services worked satisfactorily during the year.  There was some dislocation of rail services, as a result of the floods in December, 1954, but alternative arrangements were made for transport of mails which reduced delay to correspondence to the minimum.</P>
    <P>Letter traffic, especially printed paper post, showed an increase during the year, but there was a decrease in parcel traffic, notably to Britain, due probably to the cessation of food rationing there.  The raising of the weight limit for parcels in both the inland and foreign post services from 11 lb. to 15 lb. in April, 1954, did not appreciably affect the overall volume of parcel traffic, but the fact that 12 per cent. of foreign parcels now handled come within the extended weight bracket indicates that the additional facility provided for exporting and importing <Col N="219" /> porting goods by post is appreciated. Proposals are under consideration for raising the weight limit in the foreign parcel post service to 22 lb., the limit generally obtaining internationally, and it is expected that it will be found possible to introduce this extension which should prove of great benefit to concerns engaged in the export trade.</P>
    <P>Letter traffic last Christmas attained record proportions.  Despite widespread publicity aimed at inducing the public to post early, last minute postings were very heavy and this, coupled with the increase in traffic, led to considerable difficulty, especially in Dublin, in effecting delivery before Christmas. Nevertheless, mail posted before the advertised dates was duly delivered, with the exception of a relatively small quantity for one section of Dublin. Special attention is being devoted to the problem of dealing with the growing Christmas traffic in the light of last year's experience.</P>
    <P>The re-equipment of the larger offices with modern sorting fittings was completed during the year.  The general reorganisation of postal services in rural areas was continued and a daily frequency of delivery and a better standard of service were provided in the head office districts of Tuam, Skibbereen and Sligo.  The groundwork on the reorganisation of Bandon, Killarney and Tralee districts was also undertaken and effect will shortly be given to the schemes prepared for these three centres.  It is hoped this year to undertake the reorganisation of the services in the head office districts of Castlerea, Enniscorthy, Galway, Limerick and Waterford.</P>
    <P>A special postage stamp in the 2d. and 1/3 denominations was issued in July, 1954, to commemorate the centenary of the opening of the Catholic University of Ireland under the rectorship of Dr. (afterwards Cardinal) Newman.  In December 8d. and 1/3 denominations of air mail stamps, printed by the recess process, were issued.  The designs replaced the 1d. and 3d. air mail issues which were withdrawn.</P>
    <P>Telegraph traffic suffered a further <Col N="220" /> drop last year, the number of telegrams handled being 3,161,000 as compared with 3,375,000 during the previous year.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware, the telegraph service presents a serious problem, to which I shall refer again later, of high costs of operation, low receipts and declining traffic.  The question of reducing expenditure on the service has been the subject of exhaustive investigation and a scheme has been worked out to secure substantial economies in operating costs which constitute the bulk of the expenditure.  The scheme is primarily designed to reduce the number of handlings per telegram to a minimum.  Already the use of the telephone for direct transmission of telegrams from accepting office to delivery office has been considerably extended and appreciable savings have been secured in this way by elimination of re-transmission costs at intermediate offices.</P>
    <P>Hitherto, owing to the extensive use of the morse method of transmission, it has not been possible to adjust costs to declining traffic except within very broad limits.  The policy of abolishing morse is, however, now well under way; it has been discontinued at 47 offices leaving about 40 offices still to be dealt with.  The change over at these places is held up primarily by lack of suitable lines, but this difficulty will be largely overcome within the next year.  Teleprinter equipment has to date been installed at 21 main offices.  There will altogether be some 30 such offices for handling long distance telegraph traffic.  These offices are, or will be, connected directly to the Central Telegraph Office at Dublin where traffic between the teleprinter offices and traffic between teleprinter offices here and teleprinter offices in Great Britain will be switched, thus cutting out a considerable amount of re-transmission work at Dublin.  The question of installing automatic telegraph switching equipment in the Central Telegraph Office for this purpose is at present at an advanced stage of investigation.</P>
    <P>During 1954 telegraph facilities were provided at 40 additional sub-offices <Col N="221" /> and the old radio telegraph equipment serving the larger islands was replaced by modern radio telephone equipment. Telephone calls may now be made over the radio links from the islands to subscribers on the mainland.</P>
    <P>The growth of the telephone service continued during 1954.  Trunk calls totalled 12,780,000, an increase of over 8 per cent. on the 1953 figure.  Local calls increased by 1,685,000 to 82,000,000. 6,300 applications for telephone service were received and a total of 6,543 new subscribers' lines were provided.  At 31st December there were some 3,600 applicants on the waiting list.</P>
    <P>The foregoing figures were, of course, affected by the extensive storm damage during the latter portion of the year which caused very serious disruption of trunk and subscribers' circuits and for a period necessitated virtual suspension of new construction work. Although all interrupted services have long since been restored, the effects of the storm are still being felt in arrears of construction work which accumulated when restoration work had to be undertaken.</P>
    <P>In Dublin, telephones are being provided readily in areas where the plant position is good.  In many areas in the city and suburbs, however, there are acute underground cable shortages. Until comparatively recently such difficulties could be overcome by local underground relief schemes, but the high connection rate of recent years has made heavy demands on the capacity of the main (as distinct from local) cables and it has been necessary to undertake major recabling schemes affecting most of the Dublin automatic area.  Good progress has been made in complete recabling of large blocks in the Crown Alley, Ship Street and Merrion exchange areas and in the north main exchange area which covers the central city area north of the river. In the suburbs major cabling schemes are on the point of completion at Sutton and Dalkey.  This work is being extended as rapidly as our skilled engineering staff resources will permit to relieve cable shortages in the remainder of the city proper and the suburbs.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, major underground <Col N="222" /> schemes take a considerable time to complete and it is quite impracticable to cater for more than a few localities at one time&mdash;hence long delays in reaching particular areas are unavoidable. I am hopeful, however, that it may be practicable to expedite progress by putting more work out to contract and so supplementing the Department's efforts.  In the meantime in order to use to the best advantage what lines are available in difficult areas shared service is being offered to applicants where the plant position permits.  Under this arrangement two subscribers share a line to the exchange but they have different telephone numbers and get separate accounts.</P>
    <P>Outside of Dublin, arrears of construction work in respect of subscribers' applications and trunk lines were reduced, although progress in this direction was, and is still, affected by the extensive storm damage to which I have already referred.  The rural call office scheme for providing telephones in every rural post office has been virtually completed; applications for telephones involving normal work are being cleared on demand or within a few months in most of the larger exchange areas; and long outstanding applications involving abnormal work, which were deferred pending completion of the rural call office scheme, are being cleared roughly in order of year of application.</P>
    <P>Fifty-four telephone kiosks were provided in 1954 and at least as many are scheduled for erection this year.</P>
    <P>A new automatic exchange linked with the Dublin automatic network was opened in October last at Sutton (serving the Sutton and Howth areas). A similar exchange will be brought into service at Foxrock within the next few months and it is hoped to open automatic exchanges at Whitehall and Walkinstown before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>Kildare manual exchange was converted to automatic working and recently small automatic units of new design have been used to provide automatic service at some small exchanges in County Waterford.  Cahir <Col N="223" /> manual exchange has now also been converted to automatic working.</P>
    <P>A new auto-manual exchange at Mullingar is expected to be ready for service about August next.  Automatic exchanges will be provided later in the year at Greystones, Cobh, Celbridge, Lucan and Rath Luirc.</P>
    <P>Switchboard equipment was extended during 1954 at 80 exchanges and modern equipment installed at Ennis, Carlow, Bandon and Monaghan.  Old switchboard equipment will be replaced by modern equipment this year, it is hoped, at Thurles, Ballina, Tralee and Wexford.</P>
    <P>The trunk service was improved by the addition of some 4,600 miles of trunk circuits.  Work on the underground cable from Dublin to Mullingar with branches to Athlone and Sligo is proceeding apace.  The Dublin-Mullingar circuits are already in service and the branch to Athlone will be finished within a few months.  The whole scheme is due to be completed by the middle of next year.</P>
    <P>Apart from the routes affected by the cable scheme, the trunk programme for the current year includes provision for thousands of miles of additional circuits throughout the country by installation of multi-channel carrier systems on the longer routes and erection of additional physical circuits on shorter routes.  This programme will greatly reduce the number of routes on which calls are now being abnormally delayed.</P>
    <P>Continuous service was introduced in 1954 at 11 exchanges where the hours of service were previously restricted and the hours of service were extended by two hours per day at 41 small exchanges.  Over 97 per cent. of all subscribers connected to the telephone system now have continuous service. Exchanges where the hours of service are restricted are the very small ones where the extra cost of 24 hour attendance would be out of all proportion to the extra revenue; indeed, the extra cost would in many cases exceed the rentals of the subscribers concerned. The solution of this problem probably lies in the installation of small automatic units connected to the <Col N="224" /> nearest operator-staffed exchange. Hitherto, such units have not been available at suitable costs, but the position has improved and we have now in operation some units of a kind which may meet our requirements in this respect.</P>
    <P>New telephone exchange buildings were completed during the year at Whitehall and Foxrock (Dublin) and at Mullingar and Greystones, and others are in course of erection at Limerick and Sligo.  New post offices (in which provision is being made to meet the requirements of the telephone service) are also being erected at Drogheda, Kilrush, Rath Luirc and Cootehill.  A new branch post office was opened at South Anne Street, Dublin, to replace the Duke Street office.  Structural alterations to provide new or improved facilities at existing buildings were carried out or are being put in hand at Cahir, Tralee, Ballina, Ballymote, Monaghan, Kilkenny, Dundalk, Fermoy and Clontarf.</P>
    <P>In the present financial year provision has been made for the commencement of the erection of new post offices and telephone exchanges at Galway, Naas, Letterkenny and Athenry, as well as telephone exchanges at Palmerstown and Dundrum, County Dublin.  Provision is also being made for the commencement of work on schemes for the alteration and improvement of existing buildings at Loughrea, Roscommon, Bray, Kildare, Carrick-on-Shannon, Carrick-on-Suir, Cork Head Office and Longford.  The Commissioners of Public Works are engaged in the preparation of plans of new post offices for Wicklow, Youghal and Droichead Nua.</P>
    <P>Good progress continues to be made with the planning of the proposed new combined letter and parcel sorting office for Dublin.</P>
    <P>Deposits in the Post Office Savings Bank rose from £14,073,000 in 1953 to £14,517,000 in 1954 and withdrawals from £10,812,000 to £11,101,000, a net surplus of £3,416,000 as compared with £3,261,000 for the previous year. Interest earned during the year is estimated at £1,589,000 and the total amount standing to the credit of depositors on the 31st December, 1954, was approximately £66,772,000.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="225" /> Deposits during the year by the Trustee Savings Banks amounted to £1,162,500 and withdrawals to £508,000, an increase of £182,000 on deposits and of £46,000 on withdrawals.  The balance to credit of the Trustee Savings Banks at the end of the year, including £285,000 for interest, is approximately £10,229,000.</P>
    <P>An appreciable amount was withdrawn from the Post Office Savings Bank and the Trustee Savings Banks for reinvestment in 4½ per cent. National Loan.</P>
    <P>The estimated combined balances, Post Office and Trustee Savings Banks, on the 31st December, 1954, amounted to £77,001,000 compared with £71,057,000 on the same date in 1953.</P>
    <P>Business for the year showed a decrease as compared with the previous year.  Receipts from sales of certificates amounted to £2,364,000 repayment of principal to £1,318,000 and interest to £445,000.  Corresponding figures for 1953 were £3,037,000, £1,375,000 and £517,000.  The decrease in sales represents the natural falling off in purchases after the exceptionally high demand in the first and second years of the fifth issue.  The decrease in repayments was partly due to smaller investments by Savings Certificate holders in the 4½ per cent. National Loan than in the National Loan floated in 1953, and partly to a fall in the amount of transfers from other issues to the fifth issue.</P>
    <P>The amount of principal due to investors at the end of the year stood at £17,980,000 compared with £16,935,000 at the end of 1953.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that on a commercial account basis the deficit on the overall working of the Department has declined and this despite very heavy additional expenditure in respect of salary and wage awards and higher costs generally.  For the year 1953-54 the overall deficit was £343,860 and for 1954-55 it is estimated that the deficit will be £200,000 approximately, viz:&mdash;postal service deficit, £126,000; telegraph service deficit, £352,500; telephone service profit, £279,300.</P>
    <P>While it is satisfactory that the overall <Col N="226" /> financial position shows signs of improving it will be realised from the figures I have just given that the loss on the telegraph service continues to be very heavy.  Each year since 1922 the working of this service has resulted in a loss and in recent years the loss has shown a tendency to increase.  In 1953-54, the last year for which audited figures are available, expenditure on the telegraph service amounted to £646,000 while revenue only amounted to £295,000.  In other words revenue was only 46 per cent. of expenditure. This continuing loss on the telegraphs is a permanent obstacle to the Department's efforts to become self-supporting.</P>
    <P>In 1953 the previous Government decided that telegraph charges should be increased and to enable this to be done my predecessor introduced the Telegraph Bill, 1953.  In sponsoring this measure he explained fully the need for higher telegraph charges.  He indicated, however, that, before fixing revised charges, he proposed to await the report of a departmental committee which he had set up, with the widest terms of reference, to examine the whole problem of the heavy deficit in the working of the service and to make recommendations to improve its financial position.</P>
    <P>This committee has concluded a very thorough examination of the telegraph service.  In addition to recommendations of an organisational nature, the adoption of which will lead to substantial economies and more efficient working, the committee also recommends that the present telegraph charges should be increased.  Some of these charges were fixed as far back as 1920, the others in 1928 and 1937. The committee's report has been considered by the Government which has decided that in view of the continuing loss on the telegraph service, it is essential that telegraph charges should be increased.  A White Paper summarising the committee's report and giving details of the increased charges will be published shortly.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to express my appreciation of the zealous service given during the year by the staff of all ranks.</P>

      <P>First of all, I should like to thank the Minister for the helpful attitude he has shown in regard to matters concerning his Department during the past year.  I always think of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs as a member of the Government entitled to hit out as hard as he can in the political sphere outside his Ministry, but in his Ministry he has to keep politics as far apart as possible from his administration, and so far as the present Minister is concerned, he has continued in that tradition. I hope he will not be attacked on political grounds as often in the next year as I was in some years of my office when I was conducting the Ministry.  Certainly, he can have no complaints as far as that is concerned during the past year.</P>
      <P>I have very little to say of a political character and I think I had better begin by referring to matters where political policy is involved and where the Minister himself is only partly responsible.  I may as well deal with the question of Post Office savings first of all, because the rest of what I have to say deals with matters mostly related to the administration of the service where there is no acute difference politically between the two sides of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the first period of the Coalition Government's office there were repeated warnings by the then Minister for Finance that unless the country saved more it would be unable to pay its way and there would be a necessity for the restriction of expenditure. Announcements were made that the Government at that time was contemplating ways and means of increasing the volume of savings particularly in the Post Office.  I found, when I became Minister, that nothing had been done about it and no special steps had been taken.  During the three years when the Fianna Fáil Government was in office I appointed a most able man, Mr. Charles Kelly, as Director of Savings, and Mr. Kelly under my guidance&mdash;I might add he is a person of imagination and considerable ability, a former Director of Radio Éireann&mdash; made all kinds of proposals for ways and means of advertising Post Office <Col N="228" /> savings and encouraging people to increase their savings and encouraging the opening of new savings books.</P>
    <P>A number of these proposals were adopted and were mentioned by the Minister in reply to a parliamentary question the other day including the inauguration of far more imaginative advertising and so forth.  A number of proposals still awaited consideration or had, in fact, been&mdash;at least in the initial stages&mdash;questioned by the Department of Finance as of doubtful value.  During the course of the general election among the few tempting things that were said by the present Government Ministers who were then in opposition was the proposal that much more could be done to encourage savings, whereas, in fact, as I have pointed out a Director of Savings was appointed and had already increased the tempo of propaganda for savings by various means of which the Minister is aware and I had expected that as the Director of Savings was only a very short time in his office during the former Government's period of office that after a lapse of years we would be able to see some new plans formulated.</P>
    <P>I am not criticising the Minister because I think the Minister is only in one sense the agent for the Minister for Finance, but I am suggesting that it is about time that the wordy promises of more propaganda about savings were implemented.  I have not noticed any great outbreak of even more vivid advertising; I have noticed no decision being taken about the formation of savings committees in industries as practised abroad in many countries where employers help to save for their workers and the amounts are placed in savings books, and where the whole administration is carried out by means of local committees on which the employers are represented.</P>
    <P>There has been no decision about that yet.  Nor, apparently, has there been any decision by the Minister for Finance in directing the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to proceed with the experiment to see whether, if there were savings banks or special offices for savings established in medium-sized towns where the public might go <Col N="229" />&mdash;particularly those who require absolute proof of secrecy in regard to the savings they deposit&mdash;there might be a still greater inflow of savings.  In other words, along with the commercial banks in the larger towns, there would be a small attractive office kept specially for savings where people could go and where there would be a staff of a special kind whose general character and personality would attract people.</P>
    <P>There were other proposals&mdash;I have forgotten them&mdash;but what I am saying is that I trust that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs will press upon the Minister for Finance to implement the wordy promises that were made when it was stated that we were not doing enough about encouraging savings now that a director of savings is available with considerable imagination and now that a considerable time has elapsed since these proposals were first formulated.</P>
    <P>I do not think I need say very much more of a political character, but I am very much aware that an immense amount has yet to be done to encourage savings.  I am not even satisfied with the more imaginative advertising that was initiated during the term of office of Fianna Fáil.  I think the advertising was better; I think still more could be done, and I think possibly still more could be done in relation to rather spectacular advertising to be put on Post Office vans.  I do not think we have yet seen the best that can be done in that direction and many others.</P>
    <P>It would be very easy to produce films telling the story about savings. The Minister could ask to see the Swedish film about savings in which there is no mention during the course of the film that people should save money and put it in the Post Office, but the implication is left, and the film is all the more effective for that reason.  The film has already been shown and it is a good beginning but I think even better films can be produced.</P>
    <P>So far as Post Office services are concerned, I am glad to note that the losses which became acute in the 1950 <Col N="230" /> period are gradually diminishing.  I am glad to see they are diminishing because the postal charges would seem to be almost at maximum having regard to our present productivity and present value of money.  I hope the Minister will not hesitate to press upon the methods and organisation section of his Department to do all that is possible to secure further economies in the expenditure on the postal side without sacrificing the service.  In that connection I hope that the Minister if he possibly can will speed up the reorganising of the postal services in the areas where this has had to be done. We have now been at this job for a very considerable number of years and I see there is a great number of areas where reorganisation still has to take place.</P>
    <P>The Minister is aware that during the period when an area is awaiting reorganisation there is considerable disturbance in regard to the normal movement, promotion and retirement of staff because of the fact that a reorganisation is contemplated.  There may be all sorts of transfers and changes, and in order not to press too hardly upon the officers of the Post Office who might otherwise suffer there are these&mdash;what I might call&mdash;special conditions that arise and they do not bring efficiency in their train.  It seems to me that that business should be completed as quickly as possible.  I am well aware there is only a limited number of officers in the Department who have the special knowledge required to plan a postal area but I trust the Minister will expedite the work.</P>
    <P>During the time of the Fianna Fáil Government I asked for an inquiry into the use of mechanised transport for postal deliveries and an experiment took place of a very preliminary kind in regard to the use of motor bicycles and carriers.  I am not convinced that we have properly examined that question and I would ask the Minister to examine again the question of using mechanised transport in rural areas. It would seem to me to be a natural concomitant of modern life and although I am aware that the cost of maintaining small mechanised equipment <Col N="231" /> whether motor bicycles or auto-cycles or small vans is heavy and involves all sorts of administrative difficulties and involves such difficulties as stores, garage accommodation and repair facilities, I still think in areas where houses are widely separated we shall have to make a beginning some day and the best way of making it is not to conduct a preliminary experiment of a purely theoretical kind but to mechanise one area, if it can be done without hurting the employment interests of any person, and see the results and measure them over a period.  I am convinced that there will have to be an element of mechanisation in the future if the public is to be served with speedy deliveries of post and if the cost of so doing is to be kept at a reasonable level.</P>
    <P>I am not criticising the experiment that was carried out but even in private business experiments when undertaken at a particular time do not seem to be successful and later on the company has to make another experiment of a more exhaustive kind and very often some more modern method is adopted and the fruits of the first experiment are discarded.</P>
    <P>I was very glad to hear that new uniforms were about to be adopted. Partly arising out of the British tradition, of all the public services the postmen had the least smart uniforms, and whereas there are countries in Europe where postmen measure up to the police or even to the army, of course in country districts it is not poossible to maintain uniforms in condition particularly when postmen have to travel up by-ways and boreens and so forth.  I am very glad that the Minister has agreed that it is in the long run economic to use a really good, smart cloth for postmen's uniforms and for the uniform to be exceedingly well-fitted. I hope the Minister will see to it that the new uniforms are kept as clean as possible under the circumstances, and again I think it will be found economic to ensure the continuing cleanliness of uniforms, bearing in mind all the practical difficulties.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister whether he could not do more publicity <Col N="232" /> for the charge-on-delivery service which was instituted in the last few years and whether he thinks the public is fully aware that such a service exists.  I am aware that the service has been found rather costly to administer, that it is a source of considerable difficulty to postmen, but nevertheless it is a feature of modern commercial life and although it has been found necessary to make rather high charges for that service the Minister might find if it became more popular, giving a greater turnover, the charge for collecting the cost of a parcel from the purchaser of that parcel could possibly be reduced.  I have met literally dozens of people who are still unaware that such a service exists and, as it is of immense benefit to people living in the country where, for example, people are already beginning to use it in connection with the dry-cleaning of clothes&mdash;I understand many tens of thousands of parcels are distributed each year&mdash;it obviously could be extended for other purposes.  I think the Minister should make up his mind to face the difficulties involved, the difficulties that the postmen have to face, the difficulties of the cost, and try to make it more popular.</P>
    <P>Equally, I wonder whether the business community are fully aware of the service by which an envelope can be returned without a stamp in the case, for example, of a sample or circular sent out offering new services or goods or samples.  I would like to ask the Minister whether he has evidence that all the commercial community know of that service, because there again, I have met quite a number of people who did not even know it had started. That was the case even during 1954.</P>
    <P>There is one more service about which there is no publicity and which is hardly ever used, and that is, the rather elaborate and extraordinary system by which a letter or parcel may be sent by train or bus from one place to another and actually delivered by express outside the normal postal hours of delivery.  At the moment, it is a fairly complicated business, because telegrams have to be sent and messengers have to be summoned by quite an elaborate process.  Quite a number of postmasters have never yet <Col N="233" /> had to avail themselves of these services, but there are occasions when people wish to send urgent parcels or letters when the post has gone and when the parcel or letter should be sent before the post leaves and where a bus or train service exists, when this service could be utilised.  I am wondering if the public know of it fully, because I have mentioned it to a number of people in the last two years, people who were badly stuck for want of an immediate delivery service and the people I spoke to had no idea that the service existed.</P>
    <P>I am glad to hear that the Minister is pressing forward with the reconstruction of post offices and the improvement of existing post offices, and I hope that the Minister will continue the tradition of the Department in the years when I was Minister and that he will utterly abolish the English Victorian brown-coloured paint which had infected the post offices of this country far and wide, and that he will insist in all redecorations of post offices that whatever colour is used, unless the wood is natural mahogany, we will have bright colours and that we will not get a return of what was purely a British Victorian tradition.  I am not blaming the British entirely for it; it just so happened that it came across from there.  In the case of a wood like mahogany, there is no purpose in staining it in anything but its own colour, but otherwise bright colours should be used, and I hope the Minister will see that that tradition is continued.</P>
    <P>I note from what the Minister says that there was a certain amount of congestion last year in regard to deliveries of Christmas mail, and I think he is quite right in trying to decide whether further steps should be taken to expedite deliveries.  Equally, I think he should do some more publicity to encourage the public to be reasonable.  I do not know whether the issue of notices&mdash;I think there were also occasional broadcasts&mdash;is sufficient.  In any event it was quite obvious last Christmas that deliveries of Christmas mail became almost impossible under the prevailing circumstances.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister exactly what stage has been reached <Col N="234" /> in regard to the provision of the new sorting office at Amiens Street.  I know that a good deal has been done, but when I hear the Minister say in his speech that plans are under active consideration it strikes a rather unhappy note.  Plans are so long under consideration for so many years past in regard to that matter that if the Minister could give some assurance that even working drawings are becoming available it would be very helpful.  The Pearse Street sorting office is utterly out of date and not a source of pride to us in any sense.</P>
    <P>I put a question to the Minister in regard to the progress made in the establishment of temporary full-time auxiliary postmen.  He informed me that the number of full-time posts has increased from 2,202 to 2,386 between 1950 and 1955.  I always felt that that progress was very slow and I would like to inquire from the Minister whether it would not be possible to have more frequent examinations or whether there are difficulties, whether he feels that a great number of these temporary postmen would be unlikely at this stage to pass their examinations, or what steps he could take to increase the number of fully established postmen.  A full-time temporary postman, although he may secure a gratuity when he retires, retires on a very slender basis of income and it would seem to me that no Government on either side have had sufficient regard to the necessity for increasing the number of full-time established postmen.</P>
    <P>Could the Minister say whether he has had time to examine the status of the junior female postal sorters whose remuneration is, by any standards, extremely low?  As I understand it, girls who take up these positions and who happen to come mostly from the country receive an income from the Post Office which leaves so little margin over their mere subsistence costs that the Minister should press the Department of Finance to reorientate the scale of pay of these junior girl sorters employed mostly, I believe, in the postal order section.  I confess that I failed to take any useful action in the matter but I always felt that, once the period of Korean inflation was over, <Col N="235" /> that when the cost of living was at least levelling out, when the Post Office was no longer suffering from acute inflationary conditions and was finding its expenditure rapidly mounting above its income, as was the case from about 1950 continuously onwards until 1953, more might be done to deal with this particular class.</P>
    <P>What does the Minister think of the present situation whereby he has the personal appointment of all the temporary postmen, cleaners and many other classes of people in the State? For a considerable period this was the subject of a good deal of patronage on either side of the House.  I found in regard to applications that, however, by and large, pressure for the appointment of a particular person was practically non-existent because under present conditions the preferences that exist already in regard to the classes of people to be appointed are absolutely evident to everybody concerned. The fact that a man is unemployed, has a large family and is otherwise suitable, gives him priority, and a man with a large family who has Army service has even greater priority.  I found that appointment in many cases was either perfectly obvious or that there were several candidates with equal capacity.</P>
    <P>At this stage of our history I think it would be possible for the Minister to save considerable administration expenses by allowing the postmasters to appoint temporary postmen.  I see no purpose in all the machinery required to bring those appointments up to the ministerial office.  It seems to me a further stage in the sophistication of the Post Office which everybody desires.  The Minister is perfectly aware of the reason why patronage existed, because of the period up to 1932 and the consequential period in relation to which it was felt necessary to remedy a position that was created through the civil war.  Such things have occurred in other countries and are still occurring.  However, I found that Deputies on both sides of the House were usually sponsoring the same person and that was the person who most merited the post.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="236" /> I can see no reason for the added expense to the Minister of having to canalise all these appointments into his office.  I am sure he will agree with me when I say that in most cases no matter what political pressure is put on him there is generally only one person to be appointed or there are perhaps three equally qualified candidates whose names you could place in a hat and in that way choose the person who would get the position.</P>
    <P>I wish also to speak about the question of the permanent issue of our stamps.  I hope the Minister will continue to fight the Department of Finance in regard to their view that philatelic sales when a new issue appears do not justify the cost of the new design for a stamp.  I found myself that the Department of Finance was the most pessimistic administration in Europe.  I found that in every other country in Europe the Departments of Finance there believed that reasonably frequent changes in the permanent stamp issue did not cost the administration any money in the net sense.  I found also some administrations where they claimed to make revenue for the State by producing new stamps.</P>
    <P>The Republic of San Moreno and the Republic of Liechtenstein are examples of small States where revenue is made by changing stamp issues.  We have the oldest permanent stamp issue in Europe.  I think in every other country it has changed with the exception of Britain.  They have the continuing tradition that the monarch's head must be on the stamp and to that extent they have not changed their stamps in any fundamental particulars, but they have at least changed the design.</P>
    <P>Some countries encourage the sale of stamps by advertising the idea of stamp collecting and in many a German post office there is a window section devoted to encouraging stamp collection and to encouraging young people to learn geography and history by collecting stamps.  The Commissioners for Revenue have never admitted that it was possible to encourage stamp collecting here and thus to increase the sale of stamps by selling <Col N="237" /> to stamp collectors.  The turnover on the sales of our stamps, as the Minister knows, is enormous and it should be possible to reckon a very minute cost per stamp for a new design including the making of the design of the stamp and the recess engraving process.  As far as I know, about 274,000,000 stamps are used per year, and in the lower denominations the numbers for each value are anything from 30,000,000 to 70,000,000 per value.</P>
    <P>Even of the stamps of higher value from 8d. to 4d.&mdash;there are 3,000,000 and 5,000,000 of each printed every year. It seems fantastic therefore to be able to say that we are going on forever using the same permanent issue when we have admirable opportunity for advertising the country and of giving to our people and to those abroad pictures of our castles and abbeys and saints and scientists, of our industries and of our agricultural life.  Ideal and magnificent new seals could be designed and some of the older designs perfected.  I might add that the designs of many of our permanent issue stamps are what one might call the Irish-Victorian style.  If we have a design at all it is linked with the designing fashion of the British during the 19th century and it is far from perfect.</P>
    <P>For example, take a stamp which consists of the map of Ireland.  It has a Celtic arch.  The arch is not a sculptured arch; there is an appalling&mdash;I would not like to use the word because it would be unparliamentary&mdash;mixture in the design.  It is very bad Celtic art and is very bad British-Victorian art as well.  The present 3d. stamp has the Cross of Cong.  If you examine the design of the cross you will find it is not really a beautiful architectural design at all, nor is it a beautiful cross, although it would have been quite possible to have copied the actual Cross of Cong and have incorporated it in the design of a new stamp.  It would be possible also to have a far better artistic indication of a cross whether or not a Celtic type was used.</P>
    <P>The present contribution is not a credit.  If you examine the four provinces <Col N="238" /> stamp you will find that the arms of the four provinces are perfectly satisfactory, but the floral design behind the provinces is, in the first place, invisible.  There is too much detail to be seen by the average eye. Secondly, it consists of closely interwoven shamrocks and the fewer closely interwoven shamrocks we have on our stamps the better for the future of this country.</P>
    <P>I should like also to ask the Minister whether he has been able to make any improvement in the mechanisation of the issuing of stamps at the larger post offices.  I understand it has been extremely difficult to find a machine which will issue a half-dozen 3d. stamps at once and save the customer time.  Stamps could be given in the form of a roll.  Have any better designs been found of such machines?</P>
    <P>Another question I want to ask the Minister is whether or not he has been able to reduce the cost of the handling of 6d postal orders, because at one time the State was losing money on their handling.  Accordingly the poundage had to be increased.  Whatever amusement the public here get from the doing of crosswords, it became obvious the Department should not be allowed to lose money through the handling of those postal orders.  The poundage was accordingly raised and now it is very high.  I should like to know if any method has been found for reducing the cost of handling postal orders of small denominations and if some simple method could be made available so that the losses on the handling of these postal orders would be overcome and economies effected.</P>
    <P>The question was being examined in 1954 of the counter staff in the Dublin postal district and I think it was found that a certain amount of reorganisation was required.  I hope the Minister will see that speedy progress is made in this matter.  It would be to the advantage of everyone concerned, including the staff.  In so far as the telephone service is concerned I note from the information given by the Minister that owing to the storms last year it was not possible to maintain the tremendous rate of progress recorded in 1953 in regard to the provision of new <Col N="239" /> exchange lines, kiosks, call-offices, and junction circuits and I do hope, now that the storm has passed and that the many hundreds of miles of cable have been restored, that the Minister will be able to resume the progress made in 1953.</P>
    <P>The Minister may remember that the staff increased from 1950 to 1953 by 16 per cent. but that in 1953 as compared with 1950 there were 14 per cent. more exchange lines connected and, a record of all time, 7,600 exchange lines in operation.  There was a 77 per cent. increase in the number of kiosks provided, an increase of 208 per cent. in the number of rural call-offices opened, 223 per cent. more miles of trunk and junction circuits added and there were 133 per cent. more automatic exchanges provided.  That included some work in hands before 1953.  In addition, 29 exchanges were extended.  That was a good example of what Government administration can do when a tremendous effort is made and I hope the Minister will be able to begin the resumption of that progress as far as is practicable and bearing in mind the changes which take place in the nature of the work done and the fact that putting the work into operation now may be more difficult than it was previously.</P>
    <P>Perhaps in 1953 the work being done was less difficult than that which must now be planned; perhaps the circuits to be installed now would be of a different type.  I hope, however, that the Minister will be able to get back to the 1953 level.  I always like to mention those figures in order to prove that as far as the engineering staff of the telephone service is concerned there could not be any evidence of any great redundancy in staff because if a staff is increased by 16 per cent. and is able to do nearly twice the work there can be no evidence of redundancy.  In his speech the Minister spoke of the recabling operations in Dublin and he mentioned that because of certain difficulties it might be more practical to give some of the work out on contract. I was rather disappointed at that because I had hoped the Minister would be able to tell the House that it had <Col N="240" /> been decided the work of laying these cables would be carried out by contract.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister how soon the decision will be made because, as the Minister is aware, the filling up of the existing cable system came rather rapidly upon the engineers in the Post Office and it would seem to me to be very, very urgent work indeed. My own belief is that, if there is goodwill shown by everybody, it should be possible to do some quite unusual contract work even if it means a change in the normal procedure and the routine of the engineering section. I hope the Department of Finance are not in any way impeding the Minister in getting that work done because it involves some slight changes in regulations in regard to accountancy.  I hope, whatever else occurs, the Minister will not allow the Department of Finance to hold up any new method by which the cabling work is to be done.</P>
    <P>I trust the Minister will press on with the construction of automatic exchanges in the suburban districts of Dublin and County Dublin.  I know a considerable amount of work has been done but that work ought to be completed at the earliest possible moment.</P>
    <P>As the Minister knows, the telephone service is paying the losses of the rest of the service and although a good profit, some £286,000, was made by the telephone service, the Minister is also aware that it would seem very difficult for him to increase the telephone charges and very unwise.  At the same time, the actual net profit of the telephone service is extremely fine; there is not very much margin; the £286,000 is produced from a very large turnover and it would seem essential to proceed with the work of increasing the efficiency of the telephone service in every way possible.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister whether the mechanisation of the telephone accounts is continuing, because there were great difficulties in deciding what method of mechanisation to use and what machines to purchase.  Certain machines were purchased experimentally or were rented experimentally and at the same time other changes were made with a view to increasing the <Col N="241" /> amount of accountancy work that could be done by each official.  I should like to ask him how far that is proceeding now.</P>
    <P>Much can be done still&mdash;in fact, great improvement has always been taking place under the aegis of the officers of the Department&mdash;in reducing paper work and I was amazed to find how much paper work had been in fact eliminated in order to improve technique and to reduce costs.  I should like to ask whether the proposals that were being made in 1954 for the reduction of paper work had been adopted.</P>
    <P>I should like also to ask the Minister whether he still considers the present engineering districts to be the best that can be devised or whether they are too much based on rail transport and whether there should not be a revision of the engineering districts to take into account modern methods of transport and the general development of the telephone service.</P>
    <P>At one time it was extremely difficult to get assistant engineers in the Post Office, particularly graduates from the university, partly because of the tremendous attraction of the higher wages in Great Britain and partly because of the conditions in the service itself.  I notice that the salary scales of the engineering staff of the Post Office, in the higher grades, show that there has been completely inadequate compensation for the increase in the cost of living.  That applies, of course, to other officers of the Department but the development of electronic work in Great Britain and other countries and the tremendous developments in the nuclear field and the huge expansion of the British electronic industry must be making it difficult even to keep the existing staff or to secure additional staff.  I believe that in the technical field it is entirely wrong not to pay engineers what they deserve.  I can see little justification for a rate of pay in the case of a district engineer, for example, that does not relate to the increase in the cost of living that has taken place since 1939.</P>
    <P>I am well aware that the Minister is only partly responsible for salary scales, that it is part of the work of <Col N="242" /> the Department of Finance but I know the Department of Finance have found through the years that they have continuously to increase the salary scales of engineering staffs in order to recruit staff.  They had to increase the salaries of meteorological engineers and of mechanical engineers to the Board of Works.  Men who are looking forward to an interesting career, bringing some reward, are hardly likely to be attracted if the salary scales in the Post Office for what is the most vital work, the planning and design of new telephone circuits, are kept at such a figure that a man who becomes a district engineer is not compensated for the increase in the cost of living that has taken place since 1939.</P>
    <P>I should add that I found it extremely difficult, outside of what was being done in the Department of Finance, because of the inter-relationship of all salary scales and, of course, during a period of acute inflation these matters were still more difficult to work out.  One had to rely on the general improvement in the salary scales as a result of the award made prior to 1951 and later but the problem still exists and will have to be solved.</P>
    <P>I should like also to ask the Minister whether a decision has yet been made in regard to the arbitration claims of some other classes of staff in the Post Office where there seem to be some particular men.  I should like to ask him where, in the general movement towards arbitration claims, come the postal sorters, the post office clerks, the clerical officers and the female telephonists.  It would appear that, as I have said, now that the inflationary period is over and that it is possible to adjust the salaries by individual arbitration claims, these classes still deserve consideration.  I should like to ask the Minister whether some decisions are likely to take place in regard to them.</P>
    <P>The Minister has, no doubt, found that he is pressed to establish kiosks all over the country, and the pressure is difficult to resist for obvious reasons. I understand that the annual cost of a kiosk, which is placed upon it before any profit can be made, is £35.  I hope <Col N="243" /> the Minister will adopt a consistent attitude in regard to the granting of kiosks, that he will either be liberal and say it will be at the expense of the service or that he will say that in the long run, if we establish too many kiosks, telephone charges will have to be raised in order to meet the enormous cost of inadequately used kiosks, and the only result will be a burden upon the public.  I found great difficulty in regard to that when I was in his position.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister might remind the public again that, although telephone charges were increased, they still are very moderate compared with those in 1939 and, naturally, with a view to attracting subscribers and to increasing the volume of calls.  The rental charges have increased by only 50 per cent. since 1939 and the call charges have increased by amounts which vary from 28 to 33 to 40 to 50 per cent.  There is very little one can buy or very little service one can get in this country at a figure so little above that of 1939.  Although I am quite sure there are a few others with the Post Office, they are certainly very few, indeed, from that point of view.</P>
    <P>I come now to the telegraph service. I am glad to hear that the Minister is installing teleprinters and at a fairly rapid rate.  I would ask him whether or not the departmental committee, when they were considering the question of telegraph charges, considered the use of greeting telegrams.  A great many countries in Europe have, I understand, a greeting telegram service in respect of which the Post Office make money by charging for the greetings telegrams.  Have the departmental committee considered the offer of that service to the public here?</P>
    <P>As the Minister stated, the telegraph service has been the Cinderella of the three services and the taxpayer has been bled continuously during the years in respect of the sending of telegrams. Continuously during the years, the deficit in the Post Office has mostly been caused by the losses in the telegraph service.  I think one can put it this way.  If the Minister for Posts <Col N="244" /> and Telegraphs decided, quite illegally, to accumulate all the losses in the telegraph service for seven years and were then suddenly to inform the Minister for Finance of the fact, the Minister for Finance would have to impose a tax of 3d. on every pint of stout for a 12-month period in order to defray the losses on the telegraph service for the previous seven years.  I should like to put it that way in order to give as picturesque an idea as possible of the constant burden on the taxpayer of these continuous losses.</P>
    <P>I note that in 1954 some 2,300,000 telegrams were sent at a loss of 2/- each.  As the Minister points out, the rates have been unchanged for many years.  I do not want to take a political attitude in regard to this.  As the Minister says, I did commit the former Government to an increase in telegraph charges on the grounds that the taxpayers should be relieved of the cost of maintaining the postal, telephone and telegraph service.  I remember that when we took steps to reduce the loss on the three services we were told business would be ruined, business would be crushed, and a lot of other nonsense.  I pointed out over and over again that, though the previous Minister for Posts and Telegraphs had quietly and unobtrusively increased charges during the previous two years by £1,000,000 a year, he had not been able to make up the losses and further increases in charges had to be made so that the general level of charges in the postal, telegraph and telephone services are in the order of 50 per cent. or less over those operating in 1939.</P>
    <P>The position of the Post Office in general is that between 1939 and 1954 there were, I understand, aggregate profits of £1,000,000 and aggregate losses of £2.8 million.  Therefore, there has been a net loss since 1939 of £1.8 million and most of that has been caused by the loss on the telegraph service.  I should mention the fact that in Great Britain, with a far higher density of population, the telegraph service only recently lost £4,000,000 a year.  Therefore, there can be no question that the losses here were due to any inefficiency or lack of zeal on <Col N="245" /> the part of the officers of the Department. The greater part of the losses, as the Minister knows, is due to the high cost of delivering telegrams compared with the charge for them.  I agree with the Minister that to lose money on the postal, telephone and telegraph services is absolutely wrong. It is bad for the temperament of our people.  It must inevitably encourage inefficiency.  No matter how efficient or zealous the officers may be, a losing service can only, in the long run, encourage still more losses&mdash;and, as far as I can see, the loss on the three services amounted last year to 3? per cent.  There is no reason or excuse for that.  The service itself is simply a miniature feature of the whole of Government services and there is no special reason why it should lose money any more than the Government should lose money in conducting its total operations.</P>
    <P>Take, for example, the E.S.B. or the Dublin Gas Company.  There must be individual parts of these services which run uneconomically, and likewise in the case of the Post Office.  There are rural telephone lines, and there are certain areas where telegrams are delivered at a loss.  There must be postmen who, because they travel with few letters every day, are a source of loss to the Post Office.  The losses should be recouped by the revenue of the Post Office in the wealthier and denser areas.  There is no more excuse for the three services to lose money than there is for the Dublin Gas Company to lose money or for the E.S.B. to lose money or for the State to lose money. Now that C.I.E., with its long and tragic history of losses, is beginning to reach the point where it is hoped that the loss will be extinguished, it would be a desperate thing if the Department of Posts and Telegraphs were the last of the semi-industrialised services to be losing money.  Therefore, I have to agree with the Minister that he should relieve the taxpayer by increasing the charges for telegrams&mdash;and if he can do it in a way which will cause the least difficulty and the least burden upon the public, why, then, I hope he will do so.</P>
    <P>It is absolutely ridiculous, in the present state of our economy, for the <Col N="246" /> taxpayer to pay for the cost of sending a telegram to somebody in the country congratulating him on the birth of a child.  It is ludicrous hypocrisy that we should be in that state at the present time, particularly having regard to the improvement in financial conditions.  Therefore, as I have said, the Minister found I was determined to make the service pay and I hope that, in the course of the next two years, we will be able to see a service that balances.</P>
    <P>That is all I have to say except once more to express the hope that the Minister will do all he can to extend the facilities of the three services particularly in areas where quick communication will bring happiness to many people and at the same time that he will increase the efficiency of the services by every means that lies in his command.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to draw the attention of the Minister to a matter that caused a great amount of inconvenience last Christmas in Cork.  I refer to the transferring of the liner mails to Dublin&mdash;mails that were usually landed at Cork and sorted in Cork.  A number of protests were sent to the Minister and the excuse was given that it was the liner company who, for their own convenience, transferred the mail to Dublin.  The Minister should see that these mails are delivered where he wants them, where it would be most convenient to sort them and where that work would give the usual extra employment that was always given.</P>
      <P>I understand that one of the causes of the delay was that it was not easy to get extra staff in Dublin to do the sorting.  This caused great hardship to a number of people who were looking forward to the usual financial gifts from their relations in America.  In a great many cases, they did not get these until January.  It also caused hardship to the people who were depending on employment in the sorting operations.  An affair like that should never occur again, of these mails bypassing Cobh, going to Dublin to be sorted there and sent back again to Cork and district.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to support Deputy <Col N="247" /> Childers in his plea for the temporary postmen.  The temporary postmen have been treated, as I said in Cork recently, very badly by all Governments. They have been doing a good service for 25 or 30 years and have then been thrown on one side.  The Minister should very seriously consider doing what Deputy Childers suggests, that is, taking on more whole-time permanent postmen.</P>
    <P>I should like also to draw the Minister's attention to the low rate of pay operating generally throughout his Department.  Postmen, clerks and others do not seem to be anything like as well paid for their services as the employees of other Departments.</P>
    <P>So far as Cork is concerned, we are not catering properly for the newly built up areas.  It takes too long to make a decision as to whether there will be a sub-post office in a particular area or not and the usual reply that further development of the area is being awaited is, I think, entirely wrong.  We should have more sub-post offices in newly built areas and more facilities in the form of kiosks, stamp machines and collection boxes which should not cost a terrible amount of money, but which would be a great convenience to the people.  I think also that there should be a revision of the present collection boxes.</P>
    <P>With regard to telephone kiosks, I know of one kiosk installed about 12 months ago which has not yet got a light in it.  It is in my own area and I do not know what the cause of it is, but it is most difficult for a person going in there at night to find a number in the phone book when there is no light there.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of young men and women getting appointments in the Post Office service, and, while I realise that there will not always be vacancies in their home headquarters, the Minister should as far as possible facilitate them in getting back to their homes as quickly as they can.  He should see to it that a Dublin man or girl will not be doing a job in Cork, while a Cork man or girl is doing the same job in Dublin.  This is especially the case where younger people are <Col N="248" /> concerned.  They would be much better off in their homes because they would be able to live more economically and would be still under parental control.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay a tribute to the courtesy of all the officials with whom the public come in contact in Cork City and district.  I do not think anybody can have any complaint about the way they are served by these officials, from the postman to the postmaster.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. A. Byrne Mr. A. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the request made to the Minister for an extension of the telephone system and to draw his attention to the need for kiosks in the City of Dublin, that is, in the added areas, the newly built-up areas, such as Ballyfermot, Cabra and all these housing areas of the municipality.  They are not yet properly served with a telephone system and I appeal to the Minister to make an inquiry to see what can be done to extend the system of kiosks and to do so at a very early date, because these housing schemes from three to five miles outside the city are inadequately served at present.</P>
      <P>I support the claim made by all sections with regard to the system of temporary postmen.  It is not satisfactory and when it is found necessary to take on temporary postmen for permanent employment, they should go on the permanent service for the purposes of pay, pensions and holidays.  The Department should not avail of temporary men for prolonged periods. These men are entitled to be put on the permanent staff and receive the benefits which go with permanent status.</P>
      <P>The uniform of the postmen could be made far more attractive, and, as well as having a winter style of uniform, they should have a summer style of uniform.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCasey" hpid="Mr. Casey Mr. Casey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer to the arrangements that obtain in the Department regarding the reappointment of staff who have been off for a long period because of T.B.  Successive Ministers for Health have, quite rightly, urged all employers&mdash;private employers, public boards and companies&mdash;to have a scheme which would operate as leniently as possible in <Col N="249" /> respect of staff who fall ill with T.B. To my amazement, it came to my notice quite recently in relation to Post Office staffs that the arrangements obtaining are not at all comparable with what one would expect in a Government Department.  I know of cases, one of which I drew to the attention of the Minister, in which it was quite obvious to me that people who had to go away for treatment of T.B. came back to the Post Office service at a decided disadvantage.</P>
      <P>I am conversant with the arrangements that the clerical staff and other grades have in C.I.E. in this regard and I can safely say that, no doubt at the behest of the Minister for Health, boards like C.I.E. are acting very fairly to their staffs.  I urge the Minister to review the arrangements in his own Department in that respect. It is a shocking thing to find a Minister for Health urging lenient and sympathetic treatment for these people and another Department of Government not responding to the call.  It is hard to expect private employers to respond in a manner in which the Departments themselves will not respond.  I was really shocked to find that state of affairs existing and I would ask the Minister to look into it without delay. I think he will have to consult the Minister for Finance, who has some responsibility in the matter.</P>
      <P>Deputy McGrath referred to telephone kiosks.  In newly built-up areas around cities such as Cork, there is a great demand for these kiosks and for stamp vending machines at the sub-post office.  It is all very well to say they are open during the day when you can get the stamps you may need by night, but it is the experience of all of us that people are caught out and need stamps in a hurry and when they go to the sub-post office they find it has just closed.  These machines could be provided at very little expense for practically all the sub-offices in the suburbs of cities like Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The public telephone facilities at these sub-offices are not adequate.  I speak of the Cork area, but I am sure the same obtains for the rest of the country.  In very many cases the telephone <Col N="250" /> is not enclosed and there is absolutely no privacy.  That privacy to which the public are entitled could be provided at very little expense.  Perhaps a greater inconvenience is that these telephones are absolutely no use to the public after six or seven o'clock because the office is closed.  These telephones should be placed outside in a kiosk, so as to be available at any time of the day or night whether the office was open or closed.</P>
    <P>I join with Deputy McGrath in urging the Minister to ask the Minister for Finance to deal as quickly as possible with the rates of pay that obtain in the various grades in the Post Office. The outdoor staff have secured increases quite recently which were very acceptable and I hope this was an indication of a more humanitarian approach to the wages and salaries problems of the staffs of the Department. I hope the revised arbitration machinery will speed up the solution of the claims in the other grades in the Post Office.</P>

      <P>I was really surprised that there was no protest from the Fine Gael Benches or by Deputy Alfred Byrne that the postal charges introduced in 1953 by Deputy Erskine Childers when he was Minister are still being maintained, in view of the vicious opposition then to his proposals to ensure that the Post Office service would be self-supporting, or as nearly so as possible.  Vicious opposition was displayed by the Fine Gael Party and by the satellites supporting them then.  The present Minister's own Party, the Labour Party, was not involved in that business.  Deputy Norton, who was then speaking as Leader of the Labour Party, agreed with the proposals and agreed that a State service like the Post Office should be run on a self-supporting basis.  There was vicious opposition form the Fine Gael Party and others to these increased charges, but I do not hear any protest now that the present Minister does not propose to reduce them and bring them back to what they were prior to 1953.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to see more telephone kiosks provided in the smaller towns <Col N="251" /> serving rural areas, particularly as it is so difficult for people now after a certain hour to get telephone calls through sub-post offices, as the hours of service have been reduced.  I think the attitude of the Department towards the installation of these kiosks is hyper-conservative.  The more the telephone service is extended the more it would be used by the public.  It is an immense boon and the Department should take more chances in the provision of these kiosks.  Eventually the kiosks would be used and would pay for themselves.  I am particularly interested in more amenities of that sort for the small towns and larger villages serving rural areas.  They should have available the same type of telephone service as is available in the larger towns and cities.</P>
    <P>If these services were provided, they would be respected.  There would be a better sense of civic responsibility towards these structures than is displayed in the bigger areas, particularly in Dublin.  I know from personal experience that the condition of several of the kiosks provided in this city is a public disgrace.  There is displayed a lack of sense of civic responsibility and there is a display of vandalism in the treatment these kiosks receive in the City of Dublin.  I have observed that personally, but I do not think there would be the same lack of civic responsibility in these areas for which I am pleading.</P>
    <P>There has been in recent years an immense improvement in the telephone service in the areas with which I am familiar, but there is still room for more improvement.  In certain areas it is still difficult to get telephone calls through quickly.  In some cases there is a quicker service to Dublin than from one town to another ten miles away. I know there are obstacles and problems still to be solved.</P>
    <P>We usually experience the greatest courtesy and assistance from the operators, but now and again there are examples of neglect and discourtesy.  I hesitate to refer to this matter and I hesitate to put anybody in the dock, but there is one particular instance I know of that has been reported to me, <Col N="252" /> in the constituency I represent, and if things do not improve there, averse as I would be to doing anything about it, I would find it incumbent on me, in the interests of the public I represent, to report the condition of affairs to the Minister and ask him to have the matter investigated.  Generally speaking, there has been a big improvement in recent years in the telephone service. There is much quicker service and far less time trying the patience of the individual who is trying to get a telephone call nowadays, particularly with long-distance calls.  That is all to the good.</P>
    <P>Those are the only remarks I have to make, but I am particularly interested in the distribution of the telephone service as quickly as possible to applicants from rural areas.  The number of people in rural areas who are asking for the telephone is growing.  I hope the Department will make a special effort to give priority to applications of that nature, because this is one of the many ways in which conditions can be improved and the facilities and amenities available for people living in the rural areas will be put on a par with those available to their fellow citizens in the larger towns and cities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>Whilst I wish to join in the tribute paid by Deputy Donnchadh Ó Briain to the staffs of the various departments of the Post Office and to the improvement of the facilities offered to the public in recent years, I would like to join with him, too, in asking for a speedy extension of the telephone system.  I do that because I have been disappointed in very many applications I have made.  It should be realised that the demand for a better telephone system is just an ordinary development of progress at the present time, because people require the telephone service in case of sudden illness for medical reasons and I have also known cases where there was a loss of stock owing to the fact that the telephone was not available for veterinary services.  All these things are developing in modern life, apart altogether from the requirements of trade and business.  I think, therefore, that the demand that has <Col N="253" /> been mentioned by the Lord Mayor of Cork and other speakers here is a very general one.  We know that everything cannot be done at once, but at the same time when you find that within five or six miles of big centres these services are not yet extended, there is disappointment.</P>
      <P>I raised some time ago the matter that there are no lights in certain kiosks in the Cork suburbs.  There is such a kiosk in my neighbourhood&mdash; at least one, erected over a lengthy period&mdash;and after darkness people have to bring a flashlight or a bicycle lamp or something like that to enable them to use the telephone.  Lighting matches or a thing like that in trying to get numbers is not very desirable or efficient, and whatever holds up the matter it is about time that it was remedied.</P>
      <P>Mention has been made about stamps after hours.  It seems very peculiar to me that if a shop has a stamp licence they can sell stamps as long as the shop is open but if you go into a sub-post office where there is also a shop attached and you require a stamp there you are told that the post office is closed and they will not give you a stamp.  If there was no sub-post office at all, only a stamp licence, you could get the stamps.  Even if they have automatic stamp machines in the post office a person in some line of business or even a Dáil Deputy himself often does not want merely one stamp.  He may want to post 20 or 30 letters, and where is he going to get the small change to enable him to get the stamps from such a machine?  He cannot post the letters unless he gets stamps beforehand.  Occasions occur when the supply of stamps of that kind is very necessary and they are not readily available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to join, too, in what has been said about temporary postmen, the routes they are on and the service they give.  I know a temporary postman who recently retired after a life of service and he was never put on the established list.  The reason was that during the trouble a big house occupied by a naval or a military officer of a foreign force happened to be burnt <Col N="254" /> down and it cut 20 minutes off his route.  By reason of that he never had enough time afterwards to give him the qualifications for establishment.  These small little minor things should not come into the reckoning, and if a man is employed giving service recognition should be given for it and a proper rate should be apportioned to the post rather than to the time he is at it. Somebody goes around and checks up the time, and the pay used to be, at any rate, dependent upon the amount of time that was expended on the work.  When a man went on a bit in life and his years of cycling had passed there was no recognition at all for the fact that he had to take a pony or some vehicle of that kind in order to carry out his work in difficult areas.</P>
    <P>The service, I know, is improving, and I know that the Minister and his staff are anxious to bring that service up in every way in efficiency and in pay with every other Government and public service.  I am not calling attention to these matters for the purpose of criticism but so that they may be remedied.  I do not know what the fault is that in certain cases they have not already been remedied.  To put a light into a kiosk does not seem a very difficult thing.  It does not seem very difficult to give permission to people in a sub-post office to sell stamps on a special licence or otherwise after hours. If they had a special licence as well as the ordinary person who has no sub-post office they would be able to supply the stamps as long as the post offices are open.</P>
    <P>These are minor points, if you like, but the extension of the telephone system would be a great boon to the public and I think it would be a paying service.</P>

      <P>There are a few matters in connection with the Estimate which I would like to bring to the attention of the Minister.  One is the delay which occurs in the postal service as between the City of Dublin and the rural areas I represent.  The County Wexford is not very far from the City of Dublin, <Col N="255" /> and yet the fact is that if letters are not posted in Dublin before 4 o'clock in the afternoon they are not delivered for two days in the rural parts of that county.  They are delivered in the towns on the following morning, where there is a second delivery.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true to say that 20 years ago there was a more up-to-date delivery of letters in the country areas than there is to-day.  That may seem extraordinary, but nevertheless it is a fact.  I suggest to the Minister that he should check up on that.  Letters which are posted in Dublin before 4 o'clock in the afternoon come down to the country on the night mail and are available for the postmen when leaving the local offices generally about 8 o'clock in the morning.  The letters are then delivered to the people in the rural areas.  Letters, however, which are not posted in Dublin before 4 o'clock in the afternoon are not brought to the country until the following morning. They arrive by the morning train and by the time it reaches the local towns the postmen on the rural deliveries have already left their offices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to put it to the Minister that this is a serious matter.  I have heard numerous complaints about it during the last few years.  I suggest to him that it is something that should not happen.  There is no reason why the Post Office, with the perfect organisation which is available to it, could not speed up the dispatch of letters posted in Dublin up to 6 o'clock and intended for delivery in the rural areas.  I imagine a letter will reach London much more quickly than it will reach some Irish town situate 60 miles away from the City of Dublin.  I think it would be well if the Minister would instruct all the post offices throughout the country to check up on this matter. <Col N="256" /> The Post Office has a very perfect organisation and, in my opinion, the people who live in the rural areas are entitled to as up-to-date a service as those who live in the towns.  But for the fact that there is a second delivery in the towns the same complaint would arise there as the one I have mentioned in connection with the rural areas.</P>
    <P>I am suggesting to the Minister that letters which are posted in Dublin up to 6 or 7 o'clock in the evening should be brought to the country towns in time so that the postmen attached to the local offices will be able to take them for delivery in the country when leaving their offices at 8 o'clock or so in the morning.  My friend from the County Wicklow would appear not to have had the same experience as we have, but he is living in a more&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Speaking generally on the Vote, I have no complaint to make with regard to the Post Office service.  I think it is a first-class one, well run and highly organised, and I do not think anyone could find fault with it.  The anomaly that I have referred to has arisen from probably over-efficiency, if one cares to put it that way.  That is quite possible.  I could mention the names of many parishes in my constituency to the Minister where it actually happens that three days elapse in the case of letters posted in Dublin before they reach parts of our rural areas. I hope the Minister will see to it that there will be an improvement in this direction.  I think that all that is needed to correct what I have mentioned is a little bit of reorganisation.</P>

      <P>At the outset, I desire to thank the Deputies who have spoken on this Estimate for the many helpful and constructive suggestions which they have made.  I want to assure them <Col N="257" /> that, even if I do not reply specifically to each point that was raised by them, all the suggestions they have made have been noted for consideration.  I appreciate the manner in which they have brought forward a number of matters in this debate.  I am thankful to them for the suggestions which they have made, and I assure them that these will get very careful consideration.</P>
      <P>With regard to the point raised by Deputy Childers in connection with savings, I would like to assure him that every conceivable effort is being made to follow on the lines suggested by him for expanding savings.  At the moment representatives of the Department of Finance and of the Post Office are engaged in considering every kind of suggestion that may help to speed up that very desirable project.  I am not so sure that the idea&mdash;although it is under consideration&mdash;of separating the savings service from post offices may not be an unmixed blessing.  I feel that there may be disadvantages in separating savings offices from post offices.  Every consideration will be given the matter and nothing short of wasteful expenditure in boosting savings will prevent the Department from getting publicity for it.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of uniforms, great attention has been paid to the selection of the material for uniforms and the type of uniform. The Department is determined to have the best possible and most attractive uniforms.  They will be issued as the House knows on the 1st November. The other point in regard to the preservation of the uniforms is a moot one but every effort is being made to ensure that recipients of uniforms will treat them with the respect that is due to State uniforms.  With regard to rural areas, I am rather reminded of what Jack Cruise said one time: &ldquo;Will he not want one to dig the garden?&rdquo; Everything possible is being done to ensure that the uniforms, which are very well and wisely chosen, will be treated with respect by recipients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reorganisation of the rural postal services is going on as Deputy Childers is aware.  It is a slow enough process. <Col N="258" /> It takes a good deal of time and thought to revise all these postmen's routes which must be traversed so as to ascertain where the necessary saving can be made without disruption.  I think reasonably good progress has been made.  A number of areas have already been covered and the process goes on, perhaps, not as fast as we would like but I would prefer to do it slowly and do a decent job than to do a bad job and have to go back over it again.  We are doing our best about that and in the course of a couple of years practically the whole country routes will have been revised and be on a more up-to-date basis.  That is contributory to the point raised about the improvement of part-time posts.  We try to eliminate as far as possible lowly-paid part-time postmen but it will not be possible to eliminate them entirely.</P>
    <P>The 1954 Christmas traffic in Dublin reached record proportions.  The traffic in the Dublin sorting office during the period increased by 3,250,000 or 15 per cent. on 1953 and the delivered traffic over the Dublin district was up by 800,000.  The 21st December was advertised as the latest date for posting local correspondence for Christmas delivery, and generally speaking, with one exception, correspondence posted up to that time, including the 22nd December, was delivered in time. The exception occurred in the case of the Rathmines delivery office, where, on account of the great pressure, it was not possible to keep the traffic in absolute sequence and a relatively small number of items posted on the 21st December was not included in the Christmas deliveries.  In comparison with the total involved the number was insignificant.  The postal staffs worked untiringly very long hours and in many cases worked 17 hours per day. It is a tribute to their efforts that a vast volume of correspondence was dealt with so successfully.</P>
    <P>With regard to the new Dublin sorting office, sketch drawings have been drafted and officers of my Department are visiting the Swiss post office to see the latest mechanised principles in practice there with a view to their application here when the sorting office <Col N="259" /> is in full swing.  The project is a long time in train.  We do not want to be behind in this regard.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of buildings, design and colouring, we did inherit a good lot of Victorian stuff.  It is only natural that we would have inherited that.  It is not easy to shake ourselves loose of that but I think we are making some progress.  The Board of Works do very decent work and in the course of the next few years a number of their buildings will be finished and I feel confident they will be a credit to the Board of Works engineers and architects.  There are certain fundamentals in regard to the building of a post office which one must have regard to.  The architects and the engineers do their very best to work in co-operation with us in order to give us a decent job.</P>
    <P>A few points were raised with which I cannot very well deal in connection with the wage rates of some of the grades.  At the moment the rates in connection with the grades referred to by Deputies Childers, Casey and MacGrath are the subject of negotiaation through conciliation and arbitration machinery and it would not be proper to discuss them at all.  I do not want to be saying too much but I think that, generally speaking, the unions are doing a good job.  I am glad to see them doing a good job.  They are fighting hard.</P>
    <P>The question of the business reply service was raised and it was said that that facility was not as well known as it should be.  There is an amazing growth having regard to the short time it is in operation.  A licence is necessary for it and licence applications are coming in nice and steadily. That in itself should be the best advertisement for it.  It will grow like a repeating decimal.  It is certainly growing in popularity.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the question of stamp designs.  In that connection, I should like to say that the Department are very particular about the design.  They might not have been in years past but they are getting very squeamish about designs and their aim <Col N="260" /> is to get the most artistic design.  There is definitely a determination to secure the most artistic stamp.  It is only fitting and right, if we go to the expense of issuing a stamp, that we should have something to be proud of. The Department is not so sure that we will be able to recover on the cost of production by philatelic sales but that is not here or there.  We do the best we can.  We want to try and get the best possible stamp and the most artistic stamp.  If we cannot recover on the cost of production by these sales we have got to put up with it.</P>
    <P>On the question of the full-time temporary postman, the position is that the Department will recognise any full-time post regularly required as justifying the creation of an established and pensionable post.  This is done to the utmost extent practicable and the Department is always willing to listen to representations in the matter.  We feel that the appointment from temporary to permanent positions is to be encouraged wherever possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with the points made by Deputy McGrath in a moment.  In connection with contracts for cabling, Deputy Childers regretted that there was not more progress made.  I can assure the Deputy and the House that tenders are actually coming in and a decision will be taken by the end of this month.  As a matter of fact we had some difficulty in getting tenders of the type we wanted.  However, we have got them now; they are <Col N="261" /> actually in and they are being considered and inside a month a decision will be taken on them.</P>
      <P>The question of the mechanisation of postal services was raised.  That could be a very thorny matter.  I think there is a limit to the extent to which such services could be utilised.  We might have a very serious reaction from the staffs themselves.  There may be cases where mechanisation could be utilised, but I would not think a general utilisation of motor cycle deliveries would be desirable.  I would like to have more concrete evidence, first of all, that the utilisation of such services would not have a bad reaction on the staff.  The staff at the moment is fairly content and they are doing their job in a decent way.  In so far as mechanisation is concerned possibilities are, of course, limited.  We might utilise it but not in a very general way, because the possibility is that its use might be outweighed by the adverse reactions it might have.</P>
      <P>Reference was made to the mechanisation of telephone accounting.  For some years the Department has been experimenting with punched-card accounting machinery for trunk ticket sorting and listing.  Within the limited field covered the experiment was successful.  Recently, however, the possibilities of mechanising the whole telephone accounting system have been examined and it was found that a slight extension of the sorting work hitherto done at large local exchanges with mechanisation of accounting work after the sorting stage by simple, inexpensive adding-listing machines proved far cheaper and more flexible than the overall mechanisation on a punched-card basis.  The punched-card machinery has accordingly been dispensed with and the new mechanised system will be in operation within the next few months.  It is a very satisfactory and up-to-date method.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the salaries of the engineering staffs and sorting assistants, that comes into the same category as the investigations to which I have already referred.  The conciliation and arbitration machinery is available to the staff.  The unions are doing a very good job.  I know that as a result <Col N="262" /> of some experience I have had with the unions myself they are very tough men to overcome.  I think conciliation and arbitration is a very satisfactory machine and all the staffs seem to be very pleased with it indeed.  If there is any complaint it is in relation to its slowness of operation.  However, I think it is a very good machine and so far it has proved to be the best.  The scheme is still in its infancy and we are hoping that, as time goes on, any defects will be remedied.  The question of greeting telegrams has been considered and will be dealt with in the White Paper.  The telegraph committee has dealt with that matter.</P>
    <P>With regard to the salaries of clerks, postal clerks and telephonists, these are all the subject of negotiations under the conciliation and arbitration scheme at present and the claims are all more or less <i>sub judice</i> at the moment.  Deputy McGrath referred to the lower grades.  All these are being dealt with at the moment by the unions.  The machinery is there now and if there are any ill-paid grades the machinery is there to bring the claim forward.  I do not know that any grades have been left out of these negotiations.  The general service grades naturally come within the scope of the General Conciliation Council and their claims go forward with those of the other Departments.  Post office clerks and postmen, etc., are dealt with by conciliation and arbitration. They are using that machinery very effectively and I hope they will continue to do so.</P>
    <P>The decision to divert a ship from Cork to Dublin, which was referred to by Deputy McGrath, was not taken by the Post Office.  It was taken by the shipping company.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that.  The shipping company said they had a cargo coming to Dublin and that was the reason for their bringing the mails to Dublin.  I think the Minister should have insisted on the mails being landed at Cobh and not have them sent up to Dublin, where there was a long delay in sorting, and then sending them back again to Cork.</P>

      <P>I do not think we had much control in the matter.  Unless we get our own fleet we cannot exercise any control.  We will bring them up the Shannon!  With regard to the point made of establishing officials in their own towns or as near as possible to their own towns, the method obtaining at the moment is that anybody anxious for transfer to his own native town, or indeed to any particular town, is listed in the order of application and is transferred in that order. I have had no representations about changing the present method which seems to work out quite satisfactorily.</P>

      <P>A question was raised as to there being no lights in certain telephone kiosks.  In passing, let me say that it is our intention to erect kiosks in every new housing scheme where there is any reasonable hope that they will pay their way.  But there should be lights in every kiosk and if Deputies know of any that are not lit I would be glad to be informed of them.  As a matter of fact I intend to have the matter investigated because that should not happen.</P>

      <P>With regard to the absence of cabinets in some sub-post offices, we have extended the telephone service to practically all sub-offices. That took a bit of doing and if we put a telephone cabinet in each and every <Col N="264" /> one it will entail quite a considerable cost.  I think it is something that should be done by stages.  It is not desirable that one should have to use a telephone in a post office without any privacy of any kind.  I think we will possibly be able to devise a cheap type of cabinet, but that will take some time.  We will get on with the job as fast as we can.</P>
      <P>Deputy Casey referred to the question of staff conditions.  I have already covered that point two or three times. The staffs have the arbitration and conciliatory machinery.  Cases not proper to that scheme have direct access to the Department and can raise such matters.  Every grade is provided for from the lowest to the highest.  Everything can be discussed between the unions and the Department. I am satisfied that this machinery is working very satisfactorily and I hope that it will be speeded up.  I will do everything possible to try and speed that up because I am glad to see workers and the representatives of the Departments sitting down to discuss in a friendly atmosphere problems which might otherwise lead to friction and trouble.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I want to say how grateful I am to Deputies for the reception they gave to my Estimate, and particularly to Deputy Childers who has given me so much assistance especially in regard to the proposals with reference to the telegraph charges.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That a sum not exceeding £278,740 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which <Col N="265" /> will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1956, for salaries and other expenses in connection with Wireless Broadcasting (No. 45 of 1926), including public concerts.</P>
    <P>In introducing this Estimate I would like to express my appreciation to Deputies on all sides of the House for their forbearance during the year in refraining from putting down parliamentary questions on the ordinary day-to-day running of broadcasting.  Both my predecessor and myself asked for this indulgence in order to give a full and fair trial to the experimental organisation set up in 1953 of operating the broadcasting service through a comhairle or council who had not a special broadcasting statute to give them legal powers such as they have in other countries.  The House has generally accepted this experiment in the spirit in which it was undertaken and Deputies have been very fair in refraining from criticism of the free expression of opinion on controversial matters which is now permitted on the radio even where they might think that particular statements made in the course of radio discussions or particular items of news were harmful to the interests of their Parties.  There has been a welcome absence of questions on Party lines about sins of omission or commission in the news room or by radio speakers in discussions, etc., and the House has generously and quickly recognised that broadcasting is being operated as a national service.</P>
    <P>On the occasion of the annual Estimate, however, we welcome a full discussion on every aspect of broadcasting. I would, at the same time, hope that even on this occasion Deputies would not tell me that &ldquo;Dinjoe&rdquo; is better or worse than Joe Lynch or that the &ldquo;Balladmakers&rdquo; is the best or the worst programme on Radio Éireann.  It would be more effective to tell that to the director in a letter or on a postcard.</P>
    <P>Under the approved arrangements by which a sum equal to the licence and sponsored programme fees, together with a smaller sum for other minor adjustments, is devoted to the <Col N="266" /> ordinary operations of broadcasting the sum provided this year in sub-head A of the Vote is £505,800. Normally, only £10,000 of the cost of equipment would be carried on this sub-head, the balance being provided by subsidy in sub-head B.  This year, however, it is proposed to purchase equipment to the cost of £44,940 instead of the usual £10,000 out of the A sub-head, thus reducing the subsidy provision which would otherwise have to be made in sub-head B.  The undertaking to devote an extra £34,940 this year for equipment leaves the sum available for day-to-day running fairly tight.</P>
    <P>Expenses of broadcasting have gone up sharply and inevitably during the past few years.  The House recognised generously last year that there has been a great improvement in the general programme content of the Radio Éireann transmission but it is desirable to bring briefly to the notice of Deputies the broad headings which call for considerable increased expenditure apart from the straight question of higher fees for more and better artistes.  Since the reorganisation in 1953 the hours of broadcasting have been increased by 11 a week, that is, an expansion in broadcasting time of about 20 per cent.  It can easily be appreciated, therefore, that an increase in time by one-fifth had to involve heavy additional expenditure. Comhairle Radio Éireann and the director had to strengthen the orchestras, including a long needed addition to the light orchestra which, as listeners know, plays day in day out music of the most varied kind&mdash; classical music, ceilidhe music, variety music, music with the Radio Éireann singers and music with soloists.</P>
    <P>The news room staff was increased to deal particularly with bulletins in Irish and to bring the scope and vitality of the news in the national language up to that in English.  That has, I think, now been achieved even to the extent of providing a daily topical talk in Irish.  There has also been a wide expansion in the local news service both in Irish and in English.  On the engineering side the longer hours have obviously made it <Col N="267" /> necessary to engage additional highly-skilled staff&mdash;both engineers and technicians.</P>
    <P>Apart from the hours there is one aspect of broadcasting in which a gradual change in practice has made it essential to provide considerable additional resources both in engineering and programme personnel and equipment. I refer to recording.  Nowadays, recording technique&mdash;especially on tape &mdash;is so good that Radio Éireann, like all other stations, can pre-record many people and things that it could never get if it could only broadcast them &ldquo;live.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is a general impression that recorded programmes are inexpensive for the station.  That is not so and, in fact, it takes about three times the number of hours to produce a tape recording programme as a &ldquo;live&rdquo; one and it makes more demands on the technical staff.  Three figures will illustrate the vast increase that has taken place in recording work in Radio Éireann.  In the years prior to 1945 the average annual number of hours of station recording was about 100.  In 1952, however, it had reached 6,000 hours and in 1954 there was a total of almost 11,000 hours of recording in Radio Éireann.</P>
    <P>I have given the House a general idea of the developments which have inevitably led to considerably increased expenditure in broadcasting, but I should say that the money expended still on broadcasting in this country is considerably less than what is expended in other comparable countries in Europe so far as we have information on the subject.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that the licence numbers are still increasing steadily and this will enable the broadcasting service again in the current year to pay for most of the equipment required out of sub-head A.  Deputies will have seen from sub-head B in the Estimate Book that the subsidy provision for equipment is only a little more than it was in 1954-55.  One would expect that with over 430,000 licences as compared with a total of about 650,000 households in the country the rate of progress in new licences <Col N="268" /> would by now be slowing up.  That is not so.  For the past ten years there has been a steady normal increase of the order of 20,000 licences a year and we are, in fact, estimating for an increase of that order in the present year.</P>
    <P>We believe that the problem of the unlicensed set is gradually being brought under control but that it still exists.  In a special drive in 1948 the huge number of 70,000 people were discovered without licences.  In a similar drive in 1952 the number was 30,000. We believe the number to be now much smaller.  We must, however, try to eradicate that unfair position under which some people are paying for the radio entertainment of others and those who still have sets without licences should take warning that the Post Office inspectors must follow them up in the near future.  They would be well advised to anticipate that by taking out licences now.</P>
    <P>As far as the programme improvements are concerned it is scarcely necessary to outline them to the House or to listeners because, unlike the work of most other State Departments which is, so to speak, done behind closed doors, there is a glare of publicity about broadcasting which makes good or bad work immediately apparent to everybody with a turn of the knob.  I hope the House and licence-holders who are, in that way, as well aware as I am of what Radio Éireann is doing for their entertainment and education will agree that the improvements mentioned here last year are being continued and developed.</P>
    <P>The broadcasting authorities have made special efforts to provide more attractive variety programmes which is a task of the utmost difficulty for most broadcasting stations.  The more serious types of programmes have not, at the same time, been neglected, and series such as the Thomas Davis lectures have been continued as well as dramatic productions of the best types.</P>
    <P>I have referred to the developments effected in the news service in Irish. For the better production of programmes of traditional music and folklore an additional full-time officer <Col N="269" /> has been appointed with expert qualifications.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention specially the series of programmes for children which has been broadcast since the opening of the station was brought back from 5.30 to 5 o'clock.  These are not addressed to schools, which are not open at that time, but they offer a valuable adjunct to school work by providing entertainment and instruction in Irish and English with a sound national character.  They could profitably be listened to by adults as well as by children.</P>
    <P>I have no further progress to report in regard to the provision of a headquarters building for broadcasting but considerable improvements have been or are being carried out in the existing accommodation.</P>
    <P>A scheme of reconstruction work is about to begin in the Phoenix Hall from which the orchestral concerts and many other musical programmes are broadcast.  We hope that the new broadcasting studios in course of erection in Cork in the new School of Music building will be ready for occupation before the end of the financial year.</P>
    <P>I have some trepidation about mentioning Cork in connection with broadcasting because I know that before this Estimate is through the House I shall be hearing a renewed demand from the Deputies from Cork, united as one man, for the provision of a Radio Eireann Orchestra in Cork City.  I may as well, therefore, anticipate their demands and explain the broadcasting side of the picture.  The upkeep of the orchestras that we have already is a heavy task for a small country, although I know I shall be told that some small countries do more in that direction than we do.  The symphony orchestra throws a particularly heavy burden on the broadcasting service of a small country such as ours, because Radio Éireann could really do with the part-time services of a symphony orchestra, if one were available outside Radio Éireann.  There is no such orchestra in the country, however, and <Col N="270" /> broadcasting has, therefore, to carry the cost of a full-time orchestra.</P>
    <P>By maintaining an orchestra of this kind, Radio Éireann is in fact providing the country with a national orchestra, which, of course, does valuable work for the dissemination of good music, but it is work which is not exclusively broadcasting work in the strict sense.  Cork benefits from the broadcasts of this orchestra as much as any other part of the country, except Dublin.  Because the orchestra has to have a headquarters somewhere, Dublin undoubtedly derives particular benefit from this orchestra inasmuch as the citizens of Dublin and visitors to the city can be present at the live performances.  We try to give Cork and other parts of Ireland opportunities of hearing the orchestra.  These visits cost money to Radio Éireann as well as to the local organisers and may also be said to be outside the real functions of a broadcasting organisation, which discharges its duty when, in the matter of orchestral music, the orchestra is put out over the air.</P>
    <P>Radio Éireann has also a light orchestra which, although not as expensive as the symphony orchestra, is still a relatively costly affair.  It has been suggested that this orchestra should be transferred holus-bolus to Cork.  I want to show that that is impossible.  The light orchestra is one of the props of the broadcasting service.  It contributes a great deal of music on its own to the programmes of Radio Éireann and performs in conjunction with the Radio Éireann Singers and other vocalists and variety artistes in a multiplicity of shows that can only effectively be organised in Dublin.  The light orchestra could not be taken out of Dublin without detriment to the whole structure of the Radio Éireann programmes.  Apart from that, it would not be a job to my liking to uproot a whole combination of people who have their houses and families in Dublin and transfer them elsewhere <i>en bloc.</i></P>
    <P>If a third orchestra is to be provided, a question immediately arises as to its functions and as to where the money is to come from.  Radio Éireann has <Col N="271" /> limited finances, limited time on the air, and some urgent needs that it will take a good deal of money to satisfy. Music is already filling a large part of the transmissions and it is not easy to see how room can be found for any more, without encroaching on other features for which there is often a greater public demand.  A new orchestra in Cork financed by Radio Eireann would have to justify itself in terms of regular broadcast programmes.</P>
    <P>This, I can see, would create a problem for Radio Éireann.  It would create another problem which is bound to have repercussions in Cork in that most of the players for this extra combination would have to be imported. I am not opposed to Cork having an orchestra.  I want to make that very clear.  Like my predecessor, I believe that with the progress of broadcasting, especially when we reach the point of having a second programme, this will be a natural development.  Meanwhile an important step is being taken in Cork in the provision of the new studios.  We shall have a programme staff there, who can tap the local resources of Cork and the South, and provide live and recorded broadcasting of a miscellaneous character, in a way that was not hitherto possible.</P>
    <P>I would not be averse, if the money could be found, to an arrangement whereby Radio Éireann and the Cork vocational authorities would jointly finance and benefit from the presence in the city of a number of players of distinction.  Between the school of music and the broadcasting studios, musical activities could grow in Cork and, as local material became available and Radio Éireann's own programme possibilities expanded, the enlargement of this group could be undertaken more rapidly.</P>
    <P>I may mention here that since I have prepared this statement I have had a development in the form of the presentation of a petition from the citizens of Cork, presented through the medium of their Deputies and the Lord Mayor, Deputy McGrath.  I have read the grounds to be put forward by this petition and I may say that they have <Col N="272" /> opened up new possibilities.  There are certain proposals contained in it which are well worthy of consideration and I will bring the matter before the Government for their close as possible consideration before I reply to Deputy McGrath.</P>
    <P>The new 100 kw. transmitter at Athlone was put into regular operation on the 17th June.  While the old transmitter, which was probably the oldest of its kind in Europe, was still operating faithfully and sending out a good signal it is hoped that the more up-to-date installation will give a signal of more clarity within the service area.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate to mention here the question of interference which is giving many people serious concern.  I should first refer to local interference, that is, interference caused by electrical apparatus of various kinds in the local areas.  We have a staff continuously investigating the causes of such interference on the spot and fitting suppressors where requested but much can be done locally by wireless dealers and owners of electrical apparatus by arranging between them to suppress offending equipment.  We are hoping to be able to arrange for a conference of all interests concerned in this question of local interference with a view to getting new electrical apparatus suppressed against interference before it is sold.</P>
    <P>I should say, however, that a great deal of the trouble in reception is at present being caused by interference from foreign stations.  It must be admitted freely that the position about interference between stations in Europe is most unsatisfactory and unfortunately there is no ready-made solution for it.  The number of wavelengths in the medium-wave band cannot be increased and it cannot be expected that broadcasting services in any country will close down any of their stations to improve the situation for some other country.  This matter has been seriously exercising the minds of broadcasting engineers during recent years and after considerable experimentation the use of V.H.F. broadcasting transmitters is being looked upon as at least a partial solution for the congestion in the medium-wave bands. <Col N="273" /> The German radio depends mainly on V.H.F. transmissions and the B.B.C. recently inaugurated a V.H.F. service to improve reception in Britain and proposes to extend the number of such transmitters in the period immediately ahead.</P>
    <P>We have areas of poor reception in this country, particularly in places such as Wexford, which is the nearest point to the continental transmitters, West Cork, Kerry and perhaps some parts of the West and North-West of Ireland also.  We propose to make some investigation as to whether the use of V.H.F. transmitters would be a solution for poor reception in such areas, but the investigation will take a long time and even if V.H.F. is considered to offer a good solution for the trouble its introduction would be costly.  The scheme would mean the provision of a number of transmitters situated in various parts of the country and connected by land-line to supplement in the areas of poor reception the existing medium-wave stations.  It would also involve listeners who wished to get the V.H.F. transmissions in the purchase of an adapter for their existing sets at a cost of some pounds or in the purchase of a new set which would receive V.H.F. as well as medium and short-wave transmissions.</P>
    <P>I shall only say a brief word about television.  I have had an opportunity of speaking with representatives of the European Broadcasting Union which met in Dublin this year and the general plaint by the representatives of the smaller countries who have television or are about to embark on it is that the cost is a nightmare to them. The proximity of these countries to one another is pressing television on them but, at the same time, exchanges of programmes are easier than in a country separated from Europe by many miles of sea.  Happily, our people here have the common sense not to press for the introduction of television because they have an understanding of its difficult problems and I think it may be taken as fairly certain that it will not be introduced until such time as many of its present technical and financial problems have, at least, been eased.</P>
    <P>People need not hesitate to purchase <Col N="274" /> sound broadcasting sets.  They need only look to Britain with its nationwide television service where they will see that the sound broadcasting service is still being developed to the utmost even by the introduction of V.H.F. broadcasting to which I have referred already.</P>
    <P>I have left to the last what is perhaps the most important matter in broadcasting because I have little to say about it at this stage.  It is the subject of the future status of Radio Éireann. As the House knows, the comhairle in charge of Radio Éireann was established in January, 1953, for a period of two years.  They were appointed as direct servants of the Minister and did not get the legal powers for the operation of broadcasting which are possessed by broadcasting corporations elsewhere.  The period of office of the comhairle expired on the 31st December last but they have been good enough to agree to remain in office until the Government gets an adequate opportunity of examining the statutory position of broadcasting. Examination of the matter is going on at present.  The existing organisation is working well but there are considerations in favour of giving it a legal basis.  This is not the time to go into the matter because it has not yet been fully considered.  If the Government proposes to make any change in the statutory position of broadcasting the matter, of course, will come before the House with legislative proposals.</P>
    <P>Before I sit down I wish to thank the comhairle, director and all the officials of the broadcasting station for their work during the year.  I have not been in day-to-day contact with them because of the policy both myself and my predecessor have adopted of keeping out of the day-to-day working of the station.  However, even as a listener I am in a position to know that good work is being done and, of course, I am acquainted with anything of real importance that happens in regard to policy.  I am satisfied that Radio Eireann is being run in the efficient and imaginative manner so necessary for a service like broadcasting.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish, in the first instance, <Col N="275" /> to say how delighted I am that the present Minister finds that the reorganised administration of Radio Éireann continues to accomplish a great deal and that the Comhairle and the directors and other officers continue to improve the programme.  As everyone knows, Radio Éireann has to cater for a multitude of tastes and to compete with foreign broadcasting organisations of immensely greater resources. It is obvious from hearing the programmes that the director is doing his best to combine the need for interesting those who like light music and who like serious discussions and serious music with the need for including all the various elements of taste as far as possible.  However, until there is a second and alternative programme it will be impossible for him to satisfy everybody.</P>
      <P>I was very glad to read from the reports of the Listener Research Inquiry that Radio Éireann is the most popular station in this country and that the proportion of our people who listen to the more serious and cultural parts of the programme is not unsatisfactory. It compares very well with the proportion who listen to similar programmes from broadcasting systems in other countries.  Could the Minister tell us whether he would be able to extend the length of the programme still further in the near future, whether for example the programme could be longer on Saturdays, particularly in the winter months?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like also to congratulate the director, through the Minister, for the improvement in the sponsored programmes. The sponsored programmes still are, naturally, disliked by people who have a rooted objection to American music, but it is obvious that there is a great deal more variety in the kind of programmes that are being sponsored in the whole of the period from 1 p.m. to 2.30 p.m.  There is more light music, more opera, more light classical music and there are more Irish programmes in the sponsored portion of the programme, which indicates a great improvement over the days back in the 'forties when it was possible to hear an almost continuous surge of <Col N="276" /> Tinpan Alley music.  I hope the Minister will encourage the director to be as stiff as he can in insisting on variety in the sponsored programmes and in the upward cultural direction. I am absolutely certain that the charges for sponsored programmes are extremely reasonable and that, bearing that in mind, the sponsors can afford to try experiments in new types of programmes to the country's advantage.</P>
    <P>I have also noticed that the increase in the variety of Irish songs sung and tunes played has continued.  Some years ago if all the recorded Irish music available was played in Radio Éireann it would last, I think, only for one half-hour a week without repetition. Now there are more arrangements of Irish music, but I still think there is a vast amount to do.  I would like to ask the Minister whether a special section yet exists in Radio Éireann for the popular arranging of Irish music? Irish songs and melodies have been played and sung in three different ways.  They are being recorded, played and sung in the purely traditional manner, which is of great value to the country.  There are also pleasant but more modern arrangements for voice, for combinations of instruments, for light music and symphony music, which are more tuneful to the contemporary ear, and more pleasant to the young people for whom something has to be provided as an alternative to the tremendous wash of Anglo-American music that comes their way.</P>
    <P>Then there is the third method of arranging music, of arranging Irish tunes and songs, which is simply to swing them.  I am not concerned with the third method, but I am concerned with the first and second.  The Folklore Commission have, of course, recorded purely from the historical point of view, hundreds and hundreds of traditional airs and songs and I understand that the music department of Radio Éireann have searched through the records collected by Mr. Delargy and Mr. O'Sullivan and that they have been arranging some of these less well-known Irish songs and melodies. It seems to me, however, that there is still a vast amount to do.</P>
    <P>In that connection I would like to <Col N="277" /> speak of the Radio Éireann choir. This choir is very pleasant in many ways and their renderings of folk music of different countries are really delightful to hear, but I do not know yet whether the choir of Radio Éireann understands yet how to present Irish songs in a way which, so to speak, relates to the traditional manner of singing and at the same time is tuneful to the modern ear.  I am not quite sure whether the right kind of arrangements are being prepared and I would like to ask the Minister whether he has enough staff in Radio Éireann to do this work.  Radio Éireann, as the director remarked in one of his first public speeches, has to do far more in this country than a purely professional broadcasting organisation.  It has to do work for Irish culture that may not be immediately related to broadcasting and although I am well aware the amount that can be done with the funds available is limited, I still feel a great deal more needs to be done if we are to preserve the huge corpus of Irish music we have.</P>
    <P>The variety of Irish songs sung by our people is extremely limited and when songs are sung in English the <i>Galway Bay</i> type of song appears to predominate, whereas in fact as the Minister knows, there is a vast amount of material which has never been arranged for the modern ear and which can be arranged in such a way that it could be preserved.  To give an example of another country, one would imagine that the English people with their vast industrial civilisation had almost irretrievably lost the great body of traditional music and song which they had.  But the B.B.C. were able to revive a great many of the traditional dances purely by presenting them well and although the dances changed in character and were not danced in the same way as previously, nevertheless there has been in England, with its very different conditions from here, a great revival in English traditional music.  The position here is that a great deal will have to be done if we are to preserve all these very beautiful melodies.</P>
    <P>We are rather disappointed too that in respect of the arrangements made <Col N="278" /> by the director for debates in which Deputies on all sides of the House would participate have not taken place. I think he should persevere in that matter because I think it would be an excellent thing both for the members of the House and for the country.  I think myself that broadcasting is going to grow as a medium of political declamation.  The number of debates so far arranged has been disappointing. I would also like to ask the Minister whether the director intends to go on with another portion of the scheme involving political broadcasts&mdash;namely stated broadcasts in the period from October to March.  It was agreed between all the Parties that there would first of all be election broadcasts during general elections and that in years when there was no general election there would be a certain number of stated broadcasts at reasonable intervals during the winter months.  May I accordingly ask the Minister if the broadcasts of that nature have been arranged for this autumn?</P>
    <P>The Minister has stated that nothing further is being done about the provision of a proper radio building.  I am aware that in the period of the last Government the actual proposals for such a building never reached the Government because the general election took place.  As the Minister well knows the position of Radio Éireann in the G.P.O. is that it is occupying space that could be more economically used by the telephone accountancy section or by other sections of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  It is, I think, the most antiquated radio building in Europe at the present time and in my view it would, in the long run, be more economical to have a proper radio building on a site acquired by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs for such a building.  That project should be planned now and put into operation in stages.</P>
    <P>I understand such a thing is possible, that once having prepared the site it is possible to construct a radio building by stages.  It need not cost too much in any one year because it could be planned in successive stages.  I understand that initial plans have been prepared showing development by <Col N="279" /> gradual stages.  I would like to ask the Minister to press forward for a radio building because the provision of such a building is inevitable under modern circumstances.  Broadcasting has come to stay and if television follows Radio Éireann will have to take part either directly or indirectly in television programmes and as the administration in connection with television is similar to that for sound broadcasting there would be an ultimate economy were a broadcasting building provided.</P>
    <P>I was always hoping that Radio Éireann could have its own radio journal but I was unable to pursue the matter beyond a certain point.  I wonder if the Minister has had any greater success.  The Minister referred to the possibility of incorporating Radio Éireann.  It would seem to me that the present organisation has been so successful that there is nothing to stop the Minister taking the further stage of incorporating Radio Éireann in the same manner as other such organisations abroad.  We have always been afraid in this country that, because of conflicts over the civil war, if the broadcasting organisation were made an independent body there would be political difference of one kind or another.  But the comhairle has operated successfully since the beginning of 1953 and there has been no complaints of partiality of any kind. Accordingly, it would seem an excellent thing if the Minister would proceed to make legal what is in fact strictly illegal.  As the Minister knows, as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs he is immediately and absolutely responsible for every single thing Radio Éireann does, whereas if Radio Éireann were incorporated he delegates his responsibility by Act of Parliament but retains his responsibility for certain important matters in connection with the operation of the service.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows that if he incorporates Radio Éireann as an independent organisation, he can exercise reserved powers for any period, he can exercise reserved powers on such matters as the character and the scope of sponsored programmes and as regards <Col N="280" /> preventing the excessive commercialisation of the service.  He can also exercise reserved powers on questions of capital expenditure and on the amount of the licence fee and in regard to matters of international law. He can reserve powers, if he so desires, in regard to the proportion and the character of the Irish language portions of the programme.  The Minister could have reserved power to ensure political impartiality.  My own view is that some of those reserved powers may be necessary but others will certainly not, but I do think it is time the position of the comhairle was recognised in the way I suggest.</P>
    <P>Another reason is a humanitarian one.  While I believe part of the staff of Radio Éireann should be fluid in character and that the Minister should encourage the director to give short term contracts to various contributors, I think the Minister should also ensure that Radio Éireann would be prevented from becoming as civil service as the B.B.C. has become where the organisation has grown top-heavy in spite of all its freedom.  Like other broadcasting organisations Radio Éireann has a number of workers who could continue within the organisation because they have the type of talent which could be perpetuated.  There is no need to get them to go and refresh themselves at another source and then return or perhaps not to come back any more.  There are a number of such people in Radio Éireann who have no chance of getting a pension as the Minister well knows. That is another of the reasons why the incorporation of Radio Éireann is desirable.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows well that unestablished civil servants cannot receive pensions.  In similar organisations abroad they can take advantage of some kind of elasticity in regard to pensions.  They can get pensions in an unusual form.  A form of insurance policy is taken out on their behalf and if, after a few years, they leave the organisation they can take it away as a partly paid up policy and can go to some other organisation where the policy can continue and where the broadcasting corporation contributes to <Col N="281" /> the policy.  I am not saying that, if Radio Eireann was incorporated, the pensions would be of a kind that necessarily encourage people to remain, willy nilly, within the organisation. They should, at least, cover the devoted officers of Radio Eireann who have given years and years of excellent service and who have contributed to the growing improvement of the programme; it should at least cover their needs.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Minister can defer the question very much longer.  He will either have to provide pensions for certain classes of officers in Radio Eireann who normally will never get them, or he will have to incorporate the organisation.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred very pessimistically to the possibilities of television in this country.  Of course, as the Minister knows, the new television station in Belfast can already be seen and heard very successfully over a very large stretch of the country.  There will be one more purely English and partly American medium of propaganda, a medium of culture, spreading through the country, of a very pervasive and very important kind.  Television is probably the most potent source of influence that exists in the world to-day, even more potent than the foreign Press, foreign cinema or the foreign radio, and the Minister will have to face up to the fact that the new station will spread its picture throughout quite a large part of the Twenty-Six Counties and that he cannot indefinitely defer the coming of television but, of course, he may decide that there will have to be some other way of dealing with it than the way that was adopted in the case of Radio Eireann.</P>
    <P>I believe that television offers one of the few media for general education, so much required in this country, in the cultural field and in the technical field of agriculture and that the Minister can have an excuse for establishing television if he makes use of it in the way, for example, the British would have liked to make use of it if they had not already started a huge organisation for educational purposes using sound broadcast.  As I understand, they find the cost of transferring from sound to television the <Col N="282" /> whole of their educational programmes is excessive at the moment but I am perfectly certain that, if they had known that television would come, they would have begun their educational programme through the medium of television.  Television can be seen by as many as 300 people at a time, using a suitable screen, and it could help local organisations of a cultural and agricultural character throughout the country.  Whatever steps the Minister takes in regard to television, he should examine its use for educational purposes.</P>
    <P>I would like to conclude by saying a few words about the now almost world famous problem of the Cork orchestra.  I should, first of all, congratulate the people of Cork because I do not think there has ever been so much propaganda for a particular innovation in Radio Eireann as there has been for the Cork orchestra and I must admit that, from the very outset, in so far as I could, I committed Radio Eireann to establish a Cork orchestra. The position was that when the request was made to me the comhairle had been established.  At the early stages I said to the comhairle that I would like to have an immediate and direct interest in the development of the serious music side of Radio Eireann because I felt there was a great deal to be done and at that time I did tell Professor Fleischman in Cork that I would hope to establish a third and small little orchestra for Cork and that it would work and operate in conjunction with the new studio there.</P>
    <P>Probably the principal reason for my decision lay not only in the enthusiasm of the people of Cork for music, not only because they have shown that they are interested in serious music, not only because of the tremendous success of the Tóstal celebrations in Cork City for the last two years, particularly this year, but in the fact that, in the development of any serious aspect of culture, to keep the whole of that development in Dublin City seems to me to be, in the long run, suicidal, discourages people in the country, discourages provincial groups of people interested in the development of culture.  There must be some effort made by the Government, if they can, <Col N="283" /> if it is conceivably possible, to establish a unit of some development for culture somewhere else besides Dublin and Cork, with its traditional interest in music, with its many amateur musicians and singers, seems to me to be fully deserving of the privilege of having a section of the Radio Eireann Orchestra.</P>
    <P>I am absolutely aware that the Minister, sooner or later, will have to face an almost impossible problem in regard to the development of serious music in Radio Eireann because of the cost and, sooner or later, the Taoiseach of the day, through the Arts Council, will have to help Radio Eireann because, as the Minister has said, Radio Eireann is primarily a broadcasting organisation and upon it devolves the special duties of encouraging culture, of offering programmes in the Irish language to perhaps a greater degree than any other medium of publicity in this country, of encouraging all sorts of good ideas for the development of the nation.  The whole of the programme is not only a professional entertainment programme, it is a programme devoted to the resurrection of a nation.  Of course, such a programme must be interlarded with popular items and items that attract the ordinary individual. Nevertheless, it is quite obvious that Radio Eireann has been in that position for some time.</P>
    <P>The development of serious music provides a very heavy charge for Radio Eireann and the cost of the symphony orchestra and the other orchestras is already heavy compared with the total expenditure of Radio Eireann and the total amount of time during which those orchestras play but I still feel that, having regard to the increase in the revenue coming from the increased number of licences, the Minister should do his best to encourage interest in serious music and in the symphony orchestra.</P>
    <P>There was, during the last Government's period of office, the most ridiculous, contemptible, propaganda about the introduction of foreign musicians into the symphony orchestra, propaganda that was utterly ludicrous under <Col N="284" /> the circumstances.  You only have to look at the names of the people who form the B.B.C. orchestras to see that, although they may be English citizens, they originally came from Germany and Italy.  You only have to examine the nationality of half the symphony orchestras of Europe, where they have had a longer musical tradition than we had and the opportunity to develop music that we never had here due to our history, to find that these orchestras are composed of large numbers of foreigners.</P>
    <P>We eventually got over the difficulty of providing a first-class orchestra in this country but the difficulty still remains of attracting the people of this country to study instruments up to concert standard.  By concert standard I mean the standard of, shall we say, the original orchestra of the B.B.C. I do not mean the standard of the New York Symphony Orchestra or the Philharmonic Orchestra in London.  I mean the standard of the original orchestra of the B.B.C. or the standard of an orchestra in some small German town.  We still have the job of encouraging people to study instruments in this country.</P>
    <P>Part of my reason for suggesting the formation of a Cork orchestra was that it would enable the Minister of the day to encourage the director of the day to perpetuate the promise I gave that it was inconceivable that anyone who learned an instrument of any kind used in a symphony orchestra would not be able to get a job in one of the three orchestras of Radio Eireann in the next ten years.  In other words, I think it is desirable to have enough orchestras in this country to be able to promise that all the vacancies would be filled so that you could get even 20 or 30 young Irish men and women who would accept that promise and see the three orchestras and proceed with advanced courses of study and eventually you would have a higher proportion of our own people in the three orchestras than to-day.  It is a big thing to ask the Minister to make that promise.  I made it and I made it in good faith. I am certain it would be possible for <Col N="285" /> the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs or for the Taoiseach, whoever is responsible in the future, either through the Arts Council or the Department of Posts and Telegraphs or Radio Eireann, to have that promise honoured.</P>
    <P>As the Minister knows&mdash;again with the object of finding more Irish players&mdash;the form of audition for persons seeking a position in the symphony orchestra was changed from what was a very stiff Civil Service procedure to something more flexible. The position now is that every single July, I think it is, vacancies are advertised for the orchestras.  When applicants have been examined they are not simply told that they cannot be given a position or that they can: they are told that if they study still further they may be suitable for a position. Some of them have been taken on as juniors on the basis of half time in the symphony orchestra.  As these auditions take place every year for every instrument, we have a fair idea of what talent is likely to come forward. As the Minister knows, the results of the auditions&mdash;again, based on a very reasonable standard&mdash;have been extremely disappointing for nearly all the wind instruments and the 'cello. There appear to be only a certain number of viola and violin players studying music in this country who are liable in the near future to be suitable for the three orchestras.  That is the position, unfortunately.  It is also true that the Feis Ceoil ceased presenting prizes for many of the wind instrument competitions because not enough people were able to compete adequately for these competitions.</P>
    <P>There is a desperate dearth of Irish wind instrument players of all kinds. We need not be ashamed of that.  There was a time when the Germans provided the wind instrument players of most of the European orchestras.  Between 1912 and 1920 the English orchestras were full of German wind instrument players.  We are just a little behind most other countries in that respect but we can catch up on them.  The Minister and the Director of Radio Éireann have a responsibility to encourage a serious interest in music <Col N="286" /> and that can only be done by encouraging people to learn music to an advanced standard so that they can join the Radio Éireann Orchestras.  It is a unique position.  I know that the Arts Council made available some scholarships to the Royal Irish Academy of Music and, partly through my efforts and the efforts of other people, grants to that academy were increased&mdash;grants which, I think, had not changed in 30 years.  The Municipal School of Music is making efforts to increase the amount of instruction for players of advanced standards but an immense amount has yet to be done.  I myself feel it is quite possible that the scholarships are not valuable enough yet to warrant people deferring taking a job in the ordinary way of life and studying wind instruments, and so forth, to concert standard.  It may be that the value of the scholarships offered to the Royal Irish Academy of Music and the emoluments offered to the Municipal School of Music will have to be still further increased.</P>
    <P>Again, in order to try and get something done, the Minister for Education of the last Government was going to have an investigation into the general problem of instruction at advanced level for musical instruments here between the two schools of music in order to see what needed to be done and possibly in the hope of founding a conservatoire of music here.  This is probably the only country in Europe without a proper conservatoire of music for advanced standards.  The Minister for Defence was just beginning to examine ways and means of improving conditions under which Army Band players could rehearse and also of improving their conditions.  So far as I know, the Army School of Music has still no proper rehearsal rooms for members of the bands who wish so to improve their playing as to enable them to join a symphony orchestra at a later date.  As the Minister may know, the standard required for wind instrument players for any army band is not the same and is lower than that required for a symphony orchestra. However, in a number of countries the best wind instrument players from <Col N="287" /> bands join symphony orchestras by taking courses of study.</P>
    <P>The facilities for study are insufficient in the Army School of Music to enable persons who join the Army Band to reach a stage adequate to qualify them to join an orchestra.  The last Minister for Defence was inaugurating an examination of that position with a view to finding more players.  I wanted to indicate all the steps taken to encourage Irishmen and Irish women to take concert standard instruction in all the instruments.  One of my objectives was to have enough orchestras here for all the vacancies which would be available. I feel that if there were three orchestras&mdash;one of 70, one of 24 and one of seven&mdash;they would provide a corpus of players from which vacancies could be filled as they arose and that they would encourage more students to come forward for advanced standard instruction in Cork City and elsewhere. Therefore, I should like to commend to the Minister that he should examine the petition presented to him by the people of Cork because I do not think any aspect of national culture should be confined to the City of Dublin.  I think Radio Éireann have responsibility in that regard.</P>
    <P>I did not mean to speak so long on this subject but it is a complex one.  I hope the Minister will ask the Taoiseach for help in connection with the Arts Council.  The Arts Council have very limited funds at their disposal. I would say the Arts Council, during the former Government's term of office, in making available some small and modest scholarships to the Royal Irish Academy of Music, were doing all they could.  I know the Taoiseach is interested in the work of the Arts Council.  I believe the time will come when the propaganda work in connection with the symphony orchestra will require contributions from the Arts Council on such a scale that the Arts Council will have to have more to give.  Money is difficult to find. Taxation is heavy.  We are still very far behind in the world in the matter of serious music and also in the arrangement and development of Irish melodies so that they will be perpetuated <Col N="288" /> and so that the variety will grow greater in those two very important matters in relation to the work of Radio Éireann.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart altogether from the references made by the last speaker to a movement in Cork for the decentralisation of some of Radio Éireann's musical activity, I think the speech we have just heard from Deputy Childers is a particularly good one and I pay that tribute to him for his fine conception of what we should do about music in this country.  There are many people in this House who are very glad to support him in moving and pressing along the lines of the speech he has just made.</P>
      <P>It would be very difficult to criticise this Estimate and I think it would be most unfair to do so because of the remarkable progress that has been made by Radio Éireann in the past few years. The people generally are now, I think, quite satisfied with the output from Radio Éireann.  It is a good station to switch on to.  The only trouble is that you cannot switch on to it at all times of the day and that it is a shortcoming which I feel we shall have to overcome soon.  Listeners should be able to switch on to the national radio station at any time of the day.  It is very desirable that they should get into the habit of using that station only, because when we tend to study the programmes of foreign stations and the B.B.C. we tend to forget our own service at home, and now that that service is improving so much, the more people who use it, the more people will continue to use it, so that it is very important that there should be no afternoon break.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In connection with good music&mdash;and those who have spoken seem to be very interested in maintaining the programme proportion of good music&mdash;the development of the long-playing record might solve some of the technical orchestral details.  About once a month, the B.B.C. broadcasts at least one very good concert of international standard, presided over by conductors of international repute.  I do not know if it has been thought of by the broadcasting authorities here, but I should like to see these concerts relayed by <Col N="289" /> our radio service.  Reception from English stations is not always very satisfactory, but the music is generally very fine, and if we could have access to that music from the Irish station, with the good reception it is now providing, particularly in Cork&mdash;and I must congratulate the Minister's predecessor on the great improvement in technical quality of the output of the Cork station&mdash;it would be a very desirable development.</P>
    <P>There is a better quality noticeable in the commercial broadcasts, although I still shudder when I hear some of the things broadcast by these people who advertise.  I wonder have they ever seriously considered that possibly programmes of good music might sell as many tins, cans or bottles of the product they advertise as the kind of music they broadcast.  I think also that the details of the musical programmes to be broadcast might be published in the daily programmes printed in the newspapers.  It is important because we all have likes and dislikes in regard to music, and one has no way of knowing what the particular music is going to be, until one switches on and possibly then find that it is not worth waiting to hear.</P>
    <P>Electrical interference is, I think, getting worse in the cities and the Minister should get after it.  There is a service supposedly designed to hunt down these people who maintain apparatus which leads to this disturbance, but it does not seem to work very well.  My reception is sometimes intolerably bad because of this, I wonder if any attempt has been made to get the electrical trade, or the people who sell this apparatus, to cooperate with the broadcasting authorities in making sure that every article of this kind installed domestically is properly earthed, so that this interference will not take place.</P>
    <P>With regard to the orchestra in Cork, the Minister's very favourable reaction to the petition from Cork in his opening speech will prevent me from dealing with the matter in any other than a very gentle and amiable way, because I am satisfied that the Minister's intention and objective are very welcome. The petition which the Minister received <Col N="290" /> this evening from the City of Cork is rather an important one.  It was signed by many thousands of people, representing people in every walk of political life and in different social strata.  The demand has come from every quarter of the city.  It represents something unusual and none of us can resist it as public representatives, and none of us will want to resist it as people interested in culture. It is nationally and culturally very important that this development takes place.</P>
    <P>If we are ever to create a musical public in this country and if children are to have teachers available locally, so that they may be taught how to play properly and be able at a later stage to man our orchestras, we must get away from centralisation here in this city. Centralisation in this regard will prove to be a very barren thing, and our musical future will be enormously advanced if, as in other countries, people have the opportunity, not alone of hearing good music, but of seeing it played, of having the players living in their districts and available for teaching and for lending themselves to other combinations of music, large or small.</P>
    <P>The atmosphere of music will have to be diversified.  One must be able to see the players and be in the centre of musical activity.  The children of the country who are musically inclined will then feel that there is something of a future in their progressive musical education.  At present, if children express a desire to learn music as a career by which they propose to live later on we would probably arrange to have their heads examined, because there is absolutely no future in this country for a musician.  The only person who can give that future by moving in the right direction is the Minister.</P>
    <P>In Australia, the broadcasting service established radio orchestras in five or six of the principal cities 20 years ago, and the growth of public interest in music was enormous.  The result is that Australian nationals have now become world renowned figures as musical performers.  I do not believe that is impossible here.  Our people have always been very musical, but they are denied the initial facilities for <Col N="291" /> producing good performers.  I know what the Minister's difficulties in this regard are, and I think the main thing is to get the principle accepted that a combination, no matter how small, should be stationed outside Dublin.</P>
    <P>Very expensively fitted out studios have been built for Radio Éireann in Cork and the only human quantity that is to be attached to them in the planned future are an announcer and an assistant announcer.  That sounds a bit cockeyed to me, in view of the fine studios, and I suggest that we should have a musical combination stationed there.  There are too many cultural amenities in Leinster being supported by the rest of the country. I go very frequently into the National Gallery some mornings when I have an hour to spare when the House is not sitting, and very frequently I am the only citizen of the State examining the magnificent pictures on show there.  I feel that if that gallery were somewhere else it would provide much better education and much more enjoyment for the people who help to pay for it.</P>
    <P>I do not want to talk any further about the demand for an orchestra from Cork.  I think the Minister will find that this petition will help him to make the case to the Government as strong as possible and I welcome his attitude as disclosed in the few words he spoke apart from the typewritten speech which gave us a report of his Department's work.  All the Cork Deputies will be glad to go back and report that our musical outlook is, as we hope, very much brighter.</P>

      <P>We are all agreed that Radio Éireann has developed as a very big institution.  The revenue from wireless licences in 1954 was £374,000. Over the past five years there has been an increase of 148,000 licences, an average of 30,000 a year, amounting to £21,000.  Some years ago, when requests were made for extensions to Cork, it was mentioned that the revenue had reached saturation point. The figures show that that is not the case and that development is continuing gradually but very substantially. <Col N="292" /> Our issue of licences at present is only 14.7 per cent. of the population, as against 17 per cent. in the Six NorthEastern Counties of Ireland, 24 per cent. in Scotland, 25 per cent. in Wales and 27 per cent. in England.</P>
      <P>The expending of practically all the money in the metropolis is not a good development.  A survey was made of a three months' programme in Radio Éireann.  There were 183 solo performers&mdash;159 of these were metropolitans, 12 were foreigners and 12 were Irish men and women from outside the metropolis.  The whole contribution, with the exception of 6 per cent., was from the City of Dublin.  I do not say that some of these people did not come to Dublin from other centres, just as they would in any other walk of life.  Still, these figures must naturally make an impression on anyone who is interested in the development of music and culture and its encouragement over the whole country.</P>
      <P>The Cork station was closed down in 1930.  We are asking that it be reopened by siting an orchestra there. We asked first for the light orchestra, we asked for an orchestra of some kind that would not be too expensive on Radio Éireann or on the State; and it was pointed out to us&mdash;and in all reason we will have to accept it&mdash;that it would upset matters here now if the Radio Éireann light orchestra were transferred.  However, I see no reason why we could not have a variety orchestra or a chamber orchestra situated in Cork, composed of 20 or 21 members or whatever the appropriate number of musicians may be.</P>
      <P>It certainly has been of great advantage to have the symphony orchestra on circuit throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No matter how you may hear from Radio Éireann or from broadcasting programmes of any kind&mdash;in music, no matter how beautiful, there is nothing that can compare with the personal touch and contact, seeing an orchestra actually in operation.  The fact that they came there personally had a greater effect than would have been the case if they had been listened to on wireless sets for many years. The whole set-up was so magnificent that it made a wonderful impression <Col N="293" /> on the &ldquo;House Full&rdquo; audiences in various populous centres.  I hope that will continue.  If the Minister concedes an orchestra to Cork&mdash;as I think he will, on reflection&mdash;I hope that it will go on circuit personally also in the southern cities.  It would gain strength from the best musicians in the southern cities, who could be incorporated on the occasion of such visits. Such local musicians of talent could be incorporated for the occasion, after a certain number of broadcasts, and that would help to expand the musical culture of the south generally.</P>
    <P>We are behind other countries in the number of our symphony orchestras. We are far behind even countries in Europe that are not the size of the Province of Munster and which have far more orchestras in various centres than we have.  Cork being the second city in the State, with a population of 130,000 in the city and immediate suburbs, has an unanswerable case, not by reason of population so much as by the interest&mdash;as has been said by Deputy Childers and others&mdash;that has been shown in the city generally in good music, not only now but over the years.</P>
    <P>To pass from that for a while, let me say that I appreciate very much the improvement in the quality and the diversity of the programmes in our own language now being put over Radio Éireann.  For a number of years it used to be a matter of criticism: now it is rapidly approaching the stage for congratulation.  I hope the development that is taking place will continue and that it will be of immense cultural advantage to our country and a great stimulus in the revival of our national tongue.</P>
    <P>The sponsored programmes also have improved.  There is room for further improvement, but we cannot expect miracles.  We cannot expect things to be done in a day or a year, as we know these programmes have to be booked far ahead and that one cannot make cancellations.  No doubt, as time goes by and as things develop, they can influence the programmes and their quality and their nature, and in so doing give general satisfaction to <Col N="294" /> those who subscribe to the broadcasting system through the licence fees they pay every year.  A development of that kind such as has been going on will give general satisfaction to the people.</P>
    <P>Professor Fleischmann has been a wonderful advantage to us in Cork.  He is professor in the university and he is doing his best to develop musical talent, not only through the orchestra but through the ballet and, in a combination of both, arousing the musical and cultural taste of the city.  Before the radio orchestra comes to Cork he arranges for the senior students of the school to have a day with that orchestra.  He explains to them in Irish and in English what is being played and thus gives them an idea what to expect and the quality of the music for their entertainment.</P>
    <P>The Cork School of Music is doing its best also to encourage new talent.  I must agree with Deputy Childers that the general complaint is about the quality of those who are available for the playing of wind instruments, that that is the branch of orchestral music that has to be developed.  No matter what we might say about foreign musicians we have to make a beginning somewhere, and if we have not the standards or somebody to show the standards and teach up to concert pitch there is no use in scraping around ourselves on a basis which will lead us nowhere.  We must have a certain amount of training and development in the country.</P>
    <P>I will finish by quoting the last paragraph of Professor Fleischmann's lecture, if I may so call it, to the citizens of Cork when we were looking for this orchestra quite recently.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We have a very ancient claim to such an orchestra.  There is a manuscript called the psalter of Cashel written in the 9th century which contains a reference to Eimhir, son of the Milesian king Miledh.  Eimhir and his brother Eireamon divided the country between them, Eimhir taking the south and Eireamon the north.  And the psalter tells us that &lsquo;the sweetness of string music in the <Col N="295" /> south, in the south, is found.  It shall be so till the end of time with the illustrious race of Eimhir.&rsquo;  Let us warn the Minister that he is running a grave risk if he attempts to go against this ancient prophecy.  Let him know that the illustrious race of Eimhir has risen to ensure that the prophecy will be fulfilled, and that there will be an almighty clamour throughout the land if he does not divert some of that &lsquo;sweetness of string music&rsquo; from the Liffey to the Lee.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for his approach to the petition and for the work he is doing as Minister&mdash;work which he is so generously and sympathetically continuing.</P>

      <P>The Minister in his opening statement anticipated a barrage of appeals from Cork Deputies on the question of this radio orchestra for Cork City.  I will not play the same tune too long, but representing Cork a Deputy is expected to make this case to the Minister if only for that reason. I feel that most of the Cork Deputies, irrespective altogether of the duty they feel they owe their constituents&mdash;and there is a great deal of unanimity amongst the electors of Cork that this orchestra should be provided&mdash;irrespective of that duty I believe each representative from Cork feels that there is the greatest merit in the claim that is being put forward.</P>
      <P>The Wireless Broadcasting Estimate is usually one of the mildest debates in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1943" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Very often there are fewer Deputies on what appear to be more important occasions.  Nevertheless, I think the experience over a number of years is that a very constructive approach has been made in the course of these debates by all Deputies.  The reason is obvious, that there is no single institution in the State that is more in the people's homes than wireless broadcasting.  The Minister referred to the number of <Col N="296" /> wireless licences that have been taken out in the past few years, and it indicates a very high percentage of receiving sets in the homes of the citizens. That being so, what strikes me is the comparatively small figure of £278,740, just over £250,000, it takes to provide that service for the people.  We are a country of limited resources but, nevertheless, even in relation to our limited resources the amount of service given to the people, and particularly to the people who need some form of entertainment most, is out of all proportion to this comparatively small sum.  Therefore, I would not be surprised if that sum had to be considerably increased. The point I am driving at is this.  The Minister made the case from the broadcasting point of view in reference to this radio orchestra for Cork that finances were the problem, but I feel that to bring this sum up to £300,000 would probably make the difference from the financial point of view between a radio orchestra for Cork and none at all.</P>
      <P>The Minister was candid enough to admit that the symphony orchestra being located in Dublin did give Dublin residents and visitors to Dublin an advantage over the rest of the country. That advantage is very apparent when one considers the benefits that a live orchestra can give to a community.  In my own particular case I must admit that some years ago I was not very interested in what might be described as heavy music, but for one reason or another I had occasion to go to listen to some of those orchestras which visited Cork&mdash;perhaps because I was a Dáil Deputy and was expected to be seen there.  Strangely enough I got interested in it and I found a much greater pleasure in sitting and listening to an orchestra than ever I did in listening to it over the air.  For that reason the presence of an orchestra in any city must, of necessity, stimulate a greater degree of interest in that type of music.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, the Dublin Grand Opera group is in a particularly advantageous position inasmuch as Radio Eireann usually associates with that group in the putting on of operas.  The <Col N="297" /> orchestra used in these presentations consist of or is largely augmented by the Radio Eireann Symphony Orchestra.  That is a benefit which is being denied opera companies in other parts of the country.  There are opera companies which endeavour to put on operas of high standard and to bring artistes of high standard from abroad to take part in their productions.  In Cork we are largely confined to the remaining few old professional musicians whom there are, augmented by some outstanding young students and by members of the No. 2 Army Band.  The time will come when those old professional musicians will pass out and the source, the fountain of material with which these orchestras will be made up, will be drying up. Ultimately the time will come when the position which now is a happy one in Cork that a greater interest is being displayed in music of a good nature will again recede for want of professional musicians.</P>
    <P>One of the arguments advanced by Deputy Childers which impressed me very much when I heard him speaking on this demand for an orchestra in Cork was the limited facilities there are outside of Dublin for learning music on those instruments which are not very well known.  He said that these limited resources are such that in time to come and as soon as the old professionals will have passed on there will be few, if any, people in the country capable of performing on these instruments.</P>
    <P>From time to time we hear criticisms in the House of the employment in Radio Eireann of foreign musicians. In so far as we desire to get the best musicians we can for our symphony orchestra, and in so far as people are entitled to that standard, I think the policy of Radio Eireann is correct in getting musicians from abroad, but that policy should surely be only a temporary one.  The policy should envisage the stage when native musicians can take the place of these foreign musicians and be able to perform on the various instruments at least as well, if not better than, those who, of necessity, we have to import at the present time.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="298" /> In the case of any industry in this country, the policy is that if there is not a technician of sufficient training and standard to do a particular job, to bring in one from abroad, whether from England or Germany, and at the same time to train our own young technicians to be able, at some future date, to take the place of the imported technicians.  That should be the policy in regard to musicians as well, apart altogether from the fact that by doing so we are going to stimulate an interest in music, we will be providing a means of livelihood for a number, even though it may be small, of our citizens.  From that point of view, I think it is desirable that we should have as many orchestras of this nature as the country can possibly support.</P>
    <P>I think it must be admitted that the Minister himself is sympathetic to the point of view put forward by the people of Cork.  There is no doubt but that his predecessor also was and expressed that view when he was Minister. He repeated it here to-night. I think, however, it is only too obvious that the people who control broadcasting have the mentality that their responsibility is to provide broadcasting material: in other words, to provide entertainment over the air and there their responsibility ends.  If that mentality prevails, I think we can throw up our hats here and now at the request of the people of Cork, and, indeed of the entire South for this orchestra.</P>
    <P>I do not want to repeat what has already been said, but I should like to remind the Minister that their demand is there and to warn him that it will be persisted in.  As I said at the outset, if money is the only consideration, I do not think anyone would cavil at an increase of, say, £20,000, in an Estimate for £250,000 to provide a service for the people which forms so much a part of their daily lives, particularly of those in the rural areas.</P>
    <P>The Minister paid tribute to Deputies on all sides of the House for their forbearance in criticising the quality and the subject of broadcasts throughout the year.  I think it is only fair that the House should do so, since the Minister has adopted the <Col N="299" /> same policy as that of his predecessor in trying to interfere as little as possible, and even not at all, with the arrangements for broadcasts or with the subject matter of these broadcasts. During the year there was one question put down by a Deputy which implied some victimisation of supporters of the G.A.A. in relation to the number of broadcasts which have been given from Radio Éireann of matches and other sporting events.  I would like, as a keen G.A.A. supporter, to tell the Minister that personally I had no criticism whatever to make, and I think the Minister's answer satisfied everybody who may have had apprehensions about that matter.  As far as I know, and as far as I can ascertain, the question was not sponsored by any responsible source, and if some Deputy saw fit to criticise, even by implication and by putting down a question, the number of hours devoted by Radio Éireann to the broadcast of G.A.A. matches, I do not think that any criticism which he had to make, or any implication there was in the question against Radio Éireann, was shared by the general body of G.A.A. supporters.</P>
    <P>There is one small matter that I think the Minister or his Department should clear up at an early date. Throughout the country prosecutions have been brought from time to time in respect of persons holding wireless receiving apparatus, or parts of such apparatus, and district justices, who usually administer the law in respect of these charges, have been giving conflicting decisions.  People who are fortunate enough to be able to afford a radio on their car do not know at the present moment, as far as I can judge, having regard to the conflicting decisions given by the district justices, whether or not they should have a licence in respect of these car radios if they already have a radio licence for their homes.</P>
    <P>Likewise, even though I think it has been clearly stated on one or two occasions, if a person has two receiving sets in a house, whether he is liable to take out a licence for both.  I think the position is that one licence is sufficient <Col N="300" /> in such a case, but nevertheless there is an element of doubt in the minds of ordinary people.  They do not, as a rule, read the decisions of district justices on this matter of car radios.  There is certainly a great deal of confusion in the minds of the public about it which should be cleared up.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to delay the House any longer beyond expressing the hope that the day will be speedily reached when we can have an alternative programme in this country and when Radio Éireann can compare with the radio stations in the countries all over Europe.  I think that, having regard to the results of the census, or whatever the radio people call it, the time is fast approaching when Radio Éireann, by reason of the excellence of its own programmes, will be able to command in this country the bulk of the attention of the listening public for its own programmes.</P>
    <P>The difficulty in regard to interference from stations abroad is something which perhaps the Minister has only a very limited power to grapple with, but it is a very serious matter in parts of the country, particularly along the southern and south-eastern coastlines, which are so near some powerful radio stations throughout Europe.  There are parts of West Cork where there is no such interference from abroad, and nevertheless Radio Éireann is not well received there.  I know that the Minister made a special effort to find out in what areas the difficulty of hearing broadcasts was prevalent.  I can assure him that anywhere in the part of the country from Macroom West, where there are hills and valleys&mdash;and there is no part of that country where there are not hills and valleys&mdash;serious difficulty is experienced in hearing broadcasts from Radio Éireann.  Sometimes it is quite impossible to hear them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears that the debate this evening was monopolised by the Cork Deputies who wanted everything for Cork but I should like to put before the Minister what I want for the constituency I represent.  We want to hear the news from Radio <Col N="301" /> Éireann and there are very many complaints in the County Wexford regarding the reception at times. Indeed, you may switch off your set and tune in to Luxembourg or some other station because you can hear nothing but buzzing and noise from Radio Éireann.  That is the complaint all over my constituency.</P>
      <P>Deputies MacCarthy and Lynch referred to the great increase in the number of wireless licences.  It is very easy to account for that because, on account of rural electrification, the people have to get an all mains set instead of a battery set.  The greater portion of these sets are got on the hire-purchase system and every radio dealer will give you a radio set if you just give in your name.</P>
      <P>The question of musicians was also raised.  I think it is a shame that we should have Irish musicians unemployed while foreign musicians are employed and given higher wages.  I think that is wrong.  After all, we ought to have as good talent in Ireland as there is in any other country.  Irishmen have proved their ability in other spheres. Listening to the debate on this same Estimate some years ago, I heard great criticism from the Fianna Fáil Benches about the employment of foreign musicians.  Their attitude has changed because to-night they played a different tune.  They are in favour of employing foreign musicians.  They tell you that you must go to Germany or Italy for musicians.  I think we have as good musicians in Ireland.</P>

      <P>Deputy Lynch referred to Germany and so did Deputy MacCarthy.  You have to go to Germany for musicians for Radio Éireann. I think that is all wrong.  We have our <Col N="302" /> own people unemployed and they have to leave the country.  We were told that the musicians should learn the young people.  What did that mean?</P>
      <P>I am not at all in favour of some of the announcers.  Sometimes they are women on the radio and it is very difficult to understand them.  Representations were made to me by very important people in the constituency I represent to bring this matter before the Minister.  I said I would do that when I got the chance.</P>
      <P>I think we are too much taken up with looking for things for Cork or Dublin in the House.  Should no consideration be given to the other parts of the country?  Cork wants an airport and radio station.  They want everything. It is the same so far as Dublin is concerned, and then we talk about decentralisation.  Why not establish stations in the rural districts outside Cork and Dublin?  Dublin and Cork are congested enough already.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister to make some investigation in regard to the noises and buzzing of wireless sets in our constituency.  As I said, we have to switch off and tune in to some other station because we cannot hear anything from Radio Éireann.  I do not know what is the cause of it, but I am sure that the Minister has received complaints from people before this.  I should like the Minister to do something to ensure that the people in the County Wexford will get good reception.</P>

Is go Sráid Graftuin nó áiteacha eile a théas na slóite anois chun failtiú roimh dhaoine de shaghas eile ar fad, daoine a ndéanfar dearmad orthu i cheann cupla seachtain nó cupla mí go dtí go dtagann duine éigin eile. Beidh clú agus cáil ar dhaoine mar John McCormack agus ar dhaoine eile mar é sa tír seo agus i dtíortha eile ar feadh i bhfad.</P>
    <P>Is dóigh liom go bhfuil dualgas ar Radio Éireann, ar an Aire agus ar an Rialtas cuidiú leis na nGaeilge i ngach slí is féidir agus cuidiú freisin leis an gceol agus aon ábhar eile a bhaineas le cultúr ar dtíre.  Bhí áthas orm a chlos go rabthas ag tabhairt aire faoi leith do chúrsaí béaloidis agus ceoil na ndaoine fé mar cantar agus a scinntear é do réir an tsean-nóis agus go mbíonn cláracha ar an radio a bhaineas leis na sean-amhráin.  Is cóir do Radio Éireann cláracha ceoil Gaelach a bheith acu go minic agus seans a thabhairt do na daoine óga.  Ba chóir dóibh, freisin, féachaint chuige go mbeadh lucht na Mainistreach agus lucht an Gheata le clos níos minicí ar an Radio ionas go bhféadfadh an Stát, trí mheán Radio Éireann, cabhrú leis an ndrámaíocht.  Nuair a thagas cuairteoirí a bhfuil clú na drámaíochta orthu go Baile Átha Cliath dob fhiú dhúinn tairbhe a bhaint as ar son na drámaíochta anseo.  Tá a fhios agam nach féidir linn gach rud a dhéanamh.</P>
    <P>Maidir le ceol, is dócha go mba chóir do Radio Eireann agus don Roinn cuidiú níos mó leis an bhFeis Ceoil agus úsáid a bhaint as daoine a bheadh i ndan léachtaí nó siamsaí a thabhairt. Ba cheart, freisin, do Radio Eireann caoi a thabhairt do lucht buaite chomórtais dul ar an radio.  Tá a fhios agam go mb'fhéidir nach mbíonn sé sáthach maith uaireanta chun dul ar an radio.  Níl a fhios agam cé acu slí is fearr chun cabhrú leis na ceoltóirí óga, scoláireachtaí a bhronnadh orthu nó &ldquo;audition&rdquo; a thabhairt dóibh i <Col N="305" /> dtreo is go bhféadfaidís airgead a thuilleamh ar an radio.  Daoine iad siúd a rinne dian-shaothar ag ullmhú ar an bpianó nó ar an bheidhlín agus dá mbeadh clár speisialta ann dóibh, tar éis éirí leo sa bhFeis Ceoil, thabharfadh sé misneach dóibh dul ar aghaidh. Muna féidir linn scoláireachtaí a thabhairt dóibh chun dul thar sáile le feabhas a chur orthu féin, ba cheart dúinn gach rud is féidir linn a dhéanamh doibh anseo.  Fé mar adúirt an Teachta Childers, dá mbéadh &ldquo;Conservatoire&rdquo; ceart anseo, b'fhéidir go mbeadh sé indéanta, fé mar a shíl mé go minic, dlúbhaint a bheith idir an Ard-Acadamh agus an radio.  Níl Ard-Acadamh againn ach tá Acadaimh eile agus tá Scoil Cheoil na Cathrach againn, agus iarraim ar an Aire gach rud is féidir leis a dhéanamh chun cabhrú leis na daoine óga a bhfuil féith an cheoil iontu.  B'fhéidir nach bhféadfaidís dul thar lear ná maireachtaint ar an gceol anseo ach an fhad is atá siad ag dul ar aghaidh agus go bhfuil caighdeán reasúnta maith acu, sílim, más fiú linn cláracha amhránaíochta do thosnaitheoirí a bheith againn, gur fiú an rud céanna bheith againn i gcóir na gceoltóirí óga, fiú amháin chun seans a thabhairt do cheathrar, cúigear nó seisear teacht le chéile agus sraith ceoil a chraoladh.</P>
    <P>Tá an gá úd ann a ndearna an Teachta Childers tagairt dó, nach bhfuil na daoine óga ag teacht chugainn, go mór mhór i gcás an bheidhlín agus an cello.  Caithfimid rud éigin a dhéanamh maidir leis sin agus d'fhéadfaimis cuidiú leis an bhFeis Ceoil.  Cad ina thaobh nach bhféadfadh Radio Eireann páirt níos mó a ghlacadh sa bhFeis Ceoil.  Ní ceart gan cabhair éigin a thabhairt do na daoine atá ag obair leo le caogadh bliain anuas chun an Fheis a chur ar aghaidh.  Cabhraíonn an Rialtas le Oireachtas na Gaeilge maidir leis an dteanga, agus is rud tábhachtach é sin, ach nach bhfuil an Fheis Ceoil an-tábhachtach? Is í an Fhéile Cheoil is mó atá againn agus is an-deacair do na daoine atá ag obair ar a son í a choimeád beo, agus í a chur ar aghaidh.  Muna bhfaghann siad cabhair ón Radio nó ón Aire cé uaidh a bfaihghidh siad é?  Is dóigh liom gur chóir seans <Col N="306" /> a thabhairt do na ceoltoirí óga agus do chóracha scoile, go mbeadh fhios acu, má éiríonn leo, má fhaghann siad an chéad, an dara nó an triú áit sna comórtais, go gcuirfí fios orthu dul ar an radio.</P>
    <P>There is special responsibility, to which Deputy Childers has called attention, upon Radio Éireann from the point of view, not alone of providing a broadcasting service, but of doing everything it possibly can for the Irish language through that medium and also of keeping our traditional music well in the forefront of these programmes and maintaining and improving the cultural level.  One of the ways in which I think that can be done is by giving more assistance to the Feis Ceoil and I have been suggesting that since the Government assists a very laudable organisation, Oireachtas na Gaeilge, more should be done to make the Feis Ceoil an even greater national festival.  I think it is the oldest existing musical festival we have.  It has been carried on on a voluntary basis up to the present and if the public in Dublin do not support the Feis Ceoil as they should, we who have some responsibility in these matters and the Minister, who, I am sure, would be glad to give all the help he can, and the authorities of Radio Éireann should consider whether in the absence of some better machinery for encouraging young musicians, the Radio Éireann organisation should not come in more directly and take more part in the Feis Ceoil.  They would then have that amount of official assistance and support that would make the festival a great musical event, and we would not have to be imitating what is being done in other capitals.  We have our own musical festival here if we only developed it properly.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear that more is being done and that officers have been appointed to look after the folklore and traditional music.  The radio authorities are also to be congratulated on the great improvement in the Irish programmes which are more lively, brighter and more interesting.  What a great pleasure it is to hear some of these programmes coming from Gaeltacht areas where native speakers tell <Col N="307" /> us about their lives, their occupations, events of the locality, the news of the day and anything else which they think might be of interest.  I believe the success of these programmes which have improved so much in recent years, not alone in Irish but in English, is due to the staff work, the organisation, the arrangement and the preparation which must be done in advance to get the high level of achievement and to secure the success that has been obtained.  I hope that even greater success and achievement will be attained in the future.</P>
    <P>With regard to cultural and educational standards, while it is difficult for the radio to take the place of the teacher in the primary school or in the secondary school&mdash;it is certainly a difficult matter to try to arrange a school programme that will fit in with the work of the school and that might take the place of or be compared with the work which the teacher does personally in his class&mdash;nevertheless, in the sphere of what we might call adult education, continuation or popular education, a great deal can be accomplished. From the musical point of view Radio Eireann has done very good work in recording and broadcasting, as occasion required&mdash;and I hope they will do it much more frequently than they have been doing it&mdash;the excellent performances we have heard by the Italian and German opera companies which visited Dublin and gave such satisfying and such splendid performances. Deputy O'Leary might be glad to hear that they were subsidised to a certain extent, I understand, by the Governments of their countries to come to Dublin and to give us the pleasure of listening to them.</P>
    <P>I suggested that younger players such as those who win competitions at the Feis Ceóil ought to be given more opportunities and more encouragement. Whether that should be done by way of scholarships or by paying them some fees for performances at Radio Éireann, I do not know, but until we get better machinery it is absolutely necessary that these young musicians should get more encouragement.  They should be encouraged, for example, to give concerts of chamber music.  If <Col N="308" /> our friends in Cork do not succeed in getting the full symphony orchestra in the near future&mdash;I hope they will get it later on&mdash;surely they could, in the meantime, as Deputy MacCarthy has suggested, secure a light, a variety or a chamber orchestra and have concerts of a character similar to those which the Royal Dublin Society or those which our Army Band and the Radio Symphony Orchestra itself have given to the children on the one hand and, on the other hand, to adult audiences when they visited Cork, Limerick and the other centres.  Choirs also ought to get more encouragement since we have to depend on the work of the schools to a great extent in regard to improving our musical standards. Where you have a good school choir it is a great encouragement, as in the case of the individual performers, if they get an opportunity to be heard on Radio Éireann.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister has had his attention called on many occasions to the difficulty Irish listeners in Britain have in getting reception.  Difficult as it is to hear Radio Éireann in certain parts of our own country it is, of course, much more difficult in Britain and now that we seem to have a much larger Irish listening population in Britain than many of us thought, I wonder whether something more could not be done.  If we cannot make our radio station available to every prospective listener and if we are not in a position to enable prospective listeners to hear our programmes, could we not arrange to get in touch with some of those people and give them an opportunity when they visit Ireland of going on the radio and telling us something about their lives over there and about their problems?  If we hear at first hand what their experiences are and what their views may be that would, I think, be valuable.</P>
    <P>With regard to the point that Radio Éireann is to a certain extent a branch of our adult education administration, I think it is a very welcome thing that speakers of university calibre have been enabled through the medium of the Thomas Davis lectures to speak on scientific, archaelogical and architectural subjects as well as historical topics.  I think it is equally welcome <Col N="309" /> that the general public has had an opportunity of hearing those people.  I only wish that the Museum and the National Gallery could be associated in some way with our radio pro grammes so that we might have talks about them.  Deputy A. Barry referred to the fact that our people do not seem to be fully aware of the existence of these institutions.  At any rate they do not visit the National Gallery and the National Museum to the extent to which these institutions should be availed of; we have some exquisite treasures in both.  If attention were called by a series of talks on the radio to the contents of these important national institutions more interest might be taken in them.</P>
    <P>In connection with debates, there is no doubt that a great number of the public would be intensely interested in debates but it would be essential that such debates should be removed from acute political or other controversy.  If, for instance, one were to start a debate at the moment in relation to the question of corporal punishment in the primary schools and if one were to receive several thousands of postcards on that matter one would, of course, have to check as to whether such postcards were or were not <i>bona fide.</i>  It is a matter, too, upon which the Minister for Education might have very strong views.</P>
    <P>While giving the public, and particularly the younger element, the programmes and the features that they wish to have I hope that the policy which has been pressed here this evening of trying to raise the standard generally and improve the programmes in Irish as well as in English, both the sponsored and the ordinary programmes, will continue and I hope that something more will be done to cater for what may be described as the regional or local interests and that the hopes of the people of Cork, for example, or any other area&mdash;be it the Wexford Festival or the Dublin Feis Ceoil&mdash;will not be in vain.</P>
    <P>Finally, in relation to news, I am one of those who believe that the news should be presented as objectively as possible.  When we are dealing with happenings in other countries we have <Col N="310" /> to be very careful that the agency reports which are quoted are unbiassed and <i>bona fide.</i>  I am afraid that is not always the case.  There is a natural temptation&mdash;it is a very understandable one&mdash;for news editors to try to make the news as interesting, lively and up to date as possible &mdash;&ldquo;hot news&rdquo; in other words; there is very often the difficulty of verifying such news particularly when it deals with events outside this country and where one has to depend on these agencies one may find very shortly afterwards that the reports were not, let us say, altogether accurate.</P>

      <P>There are just two criticisms I want to make.  One is that in these talks people have complained to me that there is a habit on the part of those participating to laugh inordinately at their own jokes.  Now there is no objection to that provided they have their laugh out before they resume the talk.  A good deal of the discussion is lost because of this inordinate laughter.</P>
      <P>With regard to Irish speakers, I am not one of those who criticise the Irish I hear over the radio but there are two matters which require attention: one is that the speaker should be distinct in his pronounciation and, secondly, his method of speech should not be marbhánta.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>Generally speaking, most of the remarks have been laudatory in relation to the work done by Radio Éireann.  I am very grateful for the suggestions that have been made.  I am particularly grateful to Deputy Derrig for the suggestions he has made.  I would like to say that all the suggestions made will be passed on immediately to the Director of Broadcasting for his attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to reception by Irish people living in Britain the matter is not so easy.  A good part of that area is practically outside the range of our station.  Occasionally people can get Radio Eireann but reception is not altogether satisfactory because it is, as I say, outside the really effective range of the medium wave station. <Col N="311" /> People there get Radio Éireann but reception is not altogether satisfactory because it is, as I say, outside the first-class range of a medium wave station.  I am afraid we cannot do very and so forth, will not extend the range.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lynch referred to a judgment given recently by a district justice in connection with radios in cars.  Our advice is that radios in cars must be licensed.  One licence will cover the set admittedly but the district justice recently seemed to say that no licence is necessary for a car radio.  A case is being stated for the High Court in connection with that, but the Post Office ruling is that until there is some change we must continue to collect for radios in cars.  We feel there is a liability.  It is true that only one licence is required in a house in the occupation of one family even though there may be a number of different sets.  In connection with flats, separate licences are necessary for each flat.</P>
    <P>In my opening speech, I referred to the position in connection with a radio orchestra for Cork.  Since then a petition has been presented to me by the Lord Mayor of Cork and <Col N="312" /> the other Cork Deputies.  New proposals have emanated.  A new basis of negotiation has been opened up.  I promise to put this matter now before the Government and, provided we can raise the wind&mdash;after all, money is the main factor&mdash;we will endeavour to resolve the outstanding difficulties between ourselves and Cork.</P>
    <P>Finally, I can only say that every effort will continue to be made within the limited funds at our disposal and the limited accommodation to serve the people as well and as truly as we possibly can in Radio Eireann. It was pleasant to hear the pæan of thanks from Deputies in all Parties this evening for our efforts and those of the Director of Radio Éireann and the Comhairle.</P>
