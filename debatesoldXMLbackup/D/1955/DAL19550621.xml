      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if the report of the investigation into the plans and prospects of Min Fhéir Teoranta will be published, and, if not, if he will state the considerations which led the Government to come to the decision to wind up the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhelimAlfredCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce (a) when the investigations referred to in the Government's statement concerning the winding up of Min Fhéir Teoranta were begun; (b) by whom they were undertaken; (c) whether the terms of the investigators' report were conveyed to the board of the company; (d) whether the board was given an opportunity of expressing its views on the report; (e) whether the company's activities were suspended during the investigation; (f) the amount of money invested in the project to date; and (g) the number of workers employed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhelimAlfredCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce why it was considered necessary to wind up Min Fhéir Teoranta in order to enable the Department of Agriculture and the Forestry Division of the Department of Lands to carry out the experiments mentioned in the Government's recent statement; further, why those experiments could not be undertaken in another centre in North Mayo while allowing the Min Fhéir Teoranta project to continue at the same time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Norton) William Norton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Norton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 3, 4, 5, and 6 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The plans and prospects of Min Fhéir Teoranta were examined by an inter-departmental committee which commenced its investigations in September, 1954.  The committee comprised officers of the Departments of Finance, Industry and Commerce and <Col N="1511" /> Agriculture.  During the course of its investigations the committee met the directors of the company who were given a full opportunity of expressing their views.  After careful consideration of the report of the inter-departmental committee the Government reached the conclusion that the prospects of economic working of the scheme for the production of grass meal at Glenamoy were not such as would warrant continuing with the scheme; and that measures other than those contemplated when Min Fhéir Teoranta was established would prove of more lasting economic and social benefit to Bangor Erris, and would contribute towards a solution of the general economic problems of the western region.  As already announced, the Government decided that the Department of Agriculture should carry out comprehensive experiments to ascertain how blanket (shallow) bog can best be reclaimed for agricultural use and applied to the creation of cultivable holdings in the West and that the Forestry Division should carry out a full scale experiment in the afforestation of tracts of blanket bog.  These experiments will be long term and it is hoped that the results will provide employment and contribute to the economic well-being of the area on a basis which could not be secured from completion of the grass meal project. The decision that the experiments on bog reclamation and afforestation should be carried out on the land occupied by Min Fhéir Teoranta at Glenamoy, rather than in any other area, will enable alternative employment to be provided for the company's workers.</P>
    <P>The answers to other points in the Deputy's questions are as follows: (i)  it is not intended that the report of the inter-departmental committee should be published; (ii)  the terms of the report were not conveyed to the board of the company; (iii)  the company's activities were not suspended during the investigation; (iv)  the amounts provided from State funds for the company to date total £35,557; (v) it is expected that the afforestation and bog reclamation work which will be undertaken will involve expenditure <Col N="1512" /> from the Exchequer which will be of a productive character and which in time will exceed substantially any immediate saving resulting from the winding-up of the company; (vi) the number of persons employed by the company is 29.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhelimAlfredCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that there are plenty of bog lands in the Glenamoy area where those experiments could be carried out &mdash;plenty of bog lands adjacent to the present area in which the grass meal company were working?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that those experiments were substituted for the present activities of Min Fhéir, Teoranta.  If the experiments which are now being substituted for their activities were carried out otherwise than in Glenamoy the workers at Glenamoy would be disemployed. This scheme of carrying out the substitution works at Glenamoy will enable the workers now employed by Min Fhéir, Teoranta to be switched over to the new activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhelimAlfredCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>But there is plenty of bog alongside where the workers are engaged at present.  There was no necessity for closing down the grass meal development company.  There was no reason why the Minister should not start his other experiments alongside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>That goes to the whole economic roots of the scheme.  An examination by the committee convinced the committee, convinced me and convinced the Government (1)  that there is no home market for grass meal; (2) that there is no evidence of any export market being available, and (3) that the price at which grass meal would be produced by Min Fhéir Teoranta was so high that the company would start off, at the beginning of its career, with a substantial loss and that it could not hope even to get rid of its products unless by muscling in on other companies which are at present producing grass meal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not say.  The directors of the company, of course, are <Col N="1513" /> merely the instruments of Government policy.</P>

      <P>The Minister has said that the report will not be published. Has it not been published already to some members of the Dáil?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the companies now producing grass meal in this country are not in a position to meet the requirements of the market at all?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not so; and if the Deputy will show me or furnish me with evidence of inability to supply the market I will have the matter examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can give the Minister plenty of evidence that, in spite of the fact that Gowla bog is producing to its utmost in grass meal, it is unable to meet half the demand for that product at the present time and <Col N="1514" /> will not be able to meet it for many a year to come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, there are other sources of production of grass meal products, of which apparently the Deputy is not aware.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a question of that.  Sufficient is not being made in the country at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say if the company received offers from a Six County factory for the purchase of all the grass meal it could produce?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Not that I know of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that there are hundreds of thousands of pounds spent per year in importing high protein food, which is what grass meal is?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of this fact, that this company could not, on its own figures, supply grass meal except at a price substantially higher than the present price&mdash;and that is only its own estimate before it gets into production. I am satisfied that, on a realistic appraisal of the yield per acre of grass sown on this reclaimed land, the company's price for grass meal as produced there would be such that its product could only be sold at a price substantially higher than that charged by existing grass meal producers, and that if they endeavoured to sell grass meal in competition with other producers in the country they could do so only by starting off with a heavy deficit on the sale of their products and that they would have to face up to a continuing and, in fact, a permanent deficit on the working of this company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government decided that it was much more profitable nationally and much more beneficial to the workers of the area, that we should instead carry out large scale schemes of experimental afforestation on portion of the land and that in addition the Department of Agriculture should be asked to carry out certain experiments there to see to what profitable and economically rewarding use this land could be put, <Col N="1515" /> after treatment at the hands of the Department of Agriculture.  These new activities will provide much more employment for the workers in this area and a much more reliable type of employment there, than any type of employment that can be provided by Min Fhéir Teoranta, even on activities which would have to be subsidised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider consulting the directors of the company and those who have worked on the spot, to see if they agree with the conclusions of the civil servants who condemn them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>When I consulted the officials of my Department, asking who was responsible for this scheme in the first instance, I could find no one to stand over it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Was the scheme not the product of a number of people who are very competent to advise in this matter?  We should not let their scheme be condemned by civil servants without those people being heard. Many other schemes of this kind are going to be sabotaged at the behest of some civil servants.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Title>Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Bacon Prices.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MaureenOCarroll" hpid="Mrs. O'Carroll Mrs. O'Carroll">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if, in view of the fact that the price of pigs has dropped by as much as £2 per cwt. in the last three weeks, he will take steps to have the retail price of bacon reduced forthwith.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaureenOCarroll" hpid="Mrs. O'Carroll Mrs. O'Carroll">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce why a reduction in the price of pigs is not reflected in the retail price, as speedily as an increase in the price of pigs is followed by an increase in the price of bacon to the consumer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 8 together.  The Deputy will recall that in reply to a question put by her on 25th May, 1955, <Col N="1516" /> I explained the arrangements by which the retail prices of bacon are controlled. In accordance with these arrangements, bacon prices are kept under constant review in my Department. Arising from such review, reduced maximum retail prices for bacon come into operation with effect from yesterday, 20th June, 1955.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that there has been no undue delay in putting into operation a price reduction as contrasted with a price increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaureenOCarroll" hpid="Mrs. O'Carroll Mrs. O'Carroll">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that the whole point of the second question is that there is no delay at all in passing on the increase in the price of pigs to the retailers; it is when the price of pigs goes down that the delay occurs.  Furthermore, there is no justification for the delay in reducing the price.  When pigs are bought, at least four weeks elapse before they are ready for bacon.  I cannot understand why there is such a delay in passing on the reduction to the consumer, if the increase can be passed on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose this is not a question in which it is possible to satisfy everyone.  Complaints reach me from time to time that I do not make Orders sufficiently speedily to enable those who sell bacon to get increased prices.  On the other hand, the Deputy is now putting a question that suggests that the reductions do not take place as speedily as they might. We handled this whole matter with the utmost expedition.  If prices go up, that matter is examined by the Prices Advisory Body and the moment its report is received action is taken. Similarly, the Prices Branch of the Department watch the price of pigs and if prices go down, then they take action with a view to bringing the price control mechanism into operation, based on the prices enumerated by the Prices Advisory Body.  Quite frankly, this is not a thing which can be worked on a press-button principle or with precise mechanism for instantaneous operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaureenOCarroll" hpid="Mrs. O'Carroll Mrs. O'Carroll">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>What about when the price goes up?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1517" />
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>No, not when the price goes up at all.  I can produce a great deal of evidence, for the information of the Deputy, to show that grocers have complained over quite a period that we have not allowed the price to go up with the speed they think it should go up.  In any case, this is a matter which you cannot adjust to the quoted price of pigs.  Indeed, the price of the bacon the Deputy eats for breakfast tomorrow morning is not the price of the pig which was sold at yesterday's market.  That bacon is made from the pig which was sold three or four weeks ago.  Therefore, you cannot relate a particular pound of bacon to the particular price of a particular pig.  When this price control mechanism comes into operation, usually three weeks elapse before the bacon is sold on the market and you have to trace what the orignal price of the pig was&mdash;quite a complicated piece of mechanism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaureenOCarroll" hpid="Mrs. O'Carroll Mrs. O'Carroll">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister himself satisfied that there is a fair balance between the time that the price is passed on to the retailer, where it goes up or down, by the pig producer; and that the consumer gets as much fair play as the grocer gets from the bacon curer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that if there is any balance in the thing at all it is in favour of the consumer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that most retailers of bacon consider that the maintenance of price control is keeping up the price rather than allowing it to come down, that the price would fall more if price control were taken away?</P>

      <P>The G.N.R. Board was the board considered appropriate by my predecessor to ask for a report in this matter.  I think that it was a wise proceeding to ask them to report on the matter because it is possibly one which will affect their activities.  The board have not yet submitted a report to me.  The information I have from them is that they have set up a committee to examine the relative economics of diesel rail and road transport in County Donegal; I was told the committee was expected to report shortly.  So far I have not received the report, but I have made it clear to the chairman of the board that I am most anxious to get the report at the earliest possible date.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the E.S.B. that the Tracton area, County Cork, which includes Minane Bridge and Nohoval, was considered for development by the board on a number of occasions but was not selected because <Col N="1519" /> the percentage of householders willing to take supply compared unfavourably with returns for other areas.

      <P>Statistics relating to the number of trees covered by felling licences are not available prior to 1941-42 but, taking the five year period 1941-42 to 1945-46 inclusive, the number of trees for which felling licences were granted was 2,365,600.  The number of trees of commercial quality in this total is not known but it was probably about 1,500,000.</P>
      <P>Replanting obligations were attached to only some of the licences in question. Replanting conditions imposed during the period called for the replanting of a total of 20,786,000 trees.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance what is the cause of the delay in removing the weir on the River Glyde at Killanny, County Louth; whether the delay in removing it has caused operations to be suspended on the drainage of that part of the river from Ballymaskney to Monalty Lough, Carrickmacross, County Monaghan; and whether he is aware that serious flooding occurred in the area in 1954 and is likely to recur in the coming winter unless the weir is removed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>The flooding to which the Deputy refers in the last part of the question was due to the exceptionally heavy rainfall of last winter.  Conditions in the area will be improved by the removal of the rock shoal above the bridge at Ballymaskney, but the removal of this rock shoal can only be undertaken in low flow conditions which were not available last season or so far this year.  It is hoped, however, that it will be possible to have the work done before next winter.  The suspension of drainage operations between Ballymaskney bridge and Monalty Lough arose from the absence of the low flow conditions needed for the removal of the rock shoal and not from the weir at Killenny. I might add that it has not yet been decided to remove the weir; the <Col N="1525" /> alternative of sluicing it is under consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are just one or two points I wish to raise on this Estimate and I do not propose to delay the House in dealing with them.  Both are connected and I think they are of very great importance to our people generally.  It was only in recent months that one of these matters was brought to my attention very forcibly, due to the fact that people who were affected by the new Health Act pointed out very grave inconveniences caused to them as a result of the administration of certain sections of that Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first matter that I would like to draw to the Minister's attention is the system at present in operation in our <Col N="1538" /> maternity hospitals of identification of babies.  This is a matter that is of the utmost importance to every family.  I am satisfied, from evidence at my disposal, that the present system is not working to the greatest possible satisfaction of the people.  I am satisfied that, as the system works, there is room for tragic mistakes to occur and, in view of that, it is the duty of the House and, in particular, of the Minister to take whatever steps are possible to ensure that a fool-proof system of identification is put into operation throughout all our hospitals.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to give names in the House, but it is essential, in order to bring the matter home forcibly to the Minister and to this House, that I should give proof of the statement I have already made that the system in operation in our hospitals is not working in a satisfactory manner.</P>
    <P>Some time ago, in a particular hospital in the country, a young mother gave birth to a baby.  The mother and baby were in the particular hospital for a period of eight days.  When the baby was born, the mother was told that the baby was a boy.  There was a tag put on the child's wrist with the surname of the parent and the sex of the baby indicated on the tag was &ldquo;male&rdquo;.  For eight days, while the mother and baby were in the hospital, the mother fed the child every day but had nothing more to do with the child because the washing and dressing and other care of babies is carried out by the nursing staff.  For eight days the mother was under the impression, and was told by the hospital authorities, that the child was a boy.  After eight days, the mother and child were discharged from hospital.  When they arrived home, to the consternation of the mother and father, they discovered that the child was a girl.</P>
    <P>This is a very serious matter.  There is no doubt in my mind that that particular child belongs to that family but it was a terrible blow to the parents and, naturally enough, there was a doubt in their minds immediately as to whether it was their baby or not.</P>
    <P>In the particular hospital in question there were very few births at that particular <Col N="1539" /> period.  I would like to ask the Minister, if this could happen in, we will say, a small hospital, what is the position likely to be in one of our large maternity hospitals in Dublin?</P>
    <P>Certain publicity was given to the particular case that I have mentioned in the daily Press in recent weeks as a result of which I have had correspondence from parts of the country in which the people mentioned that they believed that similar mistakes had taken place in other hospitals.  I have no evidence to that effect.  I have the evidence that it did happen in one particular hospital and I am satisfied that, if it could happen in this hospital, it is quite possible that it has been happening in other hospitals in the past.</P>
    <P>I am not looking, in this debate, for heads to fall over this.  I dislike very much having to raise the matter at all but when we get a specific case like this, where proof is available, we should take all possible steps to ensure that the system of identification is changed or tightened up to such an extent that there would be very little room left for mistakes, apart from the human element.</P>
    <P>In the particular case that I have mentioned, the parents, naturally enough, felt very bad about it.  At this point I want to dovetail into this case a second matter which I wish to bring before the Minister's attention. It is in connection with certain sections of the Health Act that deal with confidential information.  The parents of this baby wrote to me and asked me, as a public representative, to make the facts known to the public, in order, in the words of the parents, to ensure that similar mistakes would not occur again.  They were told and advised at the time that the less publicity the better.  Their attitude has been that, in view of the tremendous amount of publicity in the locality where they live, it was better, at this stage, to have the matter properly clarified and, in so far as it lay within the power of the Minister, as a result of this information being given to him, to ensure that he would take the necessary steps to tighten up the identification system in our hospitals.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1540" /> In order to have the matter brought to the public attention, the parents of the baby notified their local councillor and asked him to raise the matter at the next county council meeting.  He did so and, to my amazement, the chairman of the county council, on the advice of the county manager, ruled the discussion out of order on the grounds that the matter was confidential under the health regulations.  I do not blame the county manager at all. The county manager was acting according to the legal advice given to him, but it is rather extraordinary that a matter that is of such importance as this could be kept from the knowledge of the public through the use of some health regulation.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to have that position clarified.  The minutes of the county council meeting are available to his Department.  I am sure there will be no difficulties as far as the county manager is concerned and that he will co-operate to the utmost in giving the necessary information with regard to that particular council meeting.  I think it would be a very serious matter for this House if our local authorities were not allowed to air matters of importance like this.  I believe it is a matter of the chairman and the manager being overcautious in their reading of the regulations.  That is all I have to say on that particular point at the moment; I will, of course, on another occasion refer to it.</P>
    <P>I want to make this suggestion to the Minister in connection with the identification system.  In addition to this tag or label that is put on a child's wrist after birth, the Minister should bring into operation a system whereby both the mother and the infant are marked with a similar stamp or something in the line of a code system&mdash;a number.  The same number should be put on the arm of the mother as on the infant's arm.  That stamp should not be used for any other birth.  The stamping arrangement would last for a fortnight or three weeks and would then be allowed to wear off.  After a fortnight or three weeks the danger of a mix up would not be so grave or serious.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1541" /> If the system I suggest were brought into operation, it would mean that whatever mix up took place within a ward where there were 40 or 50 babies and no matter whether the tags on the wrist got mixed up it would make no difference because a quick check of the stamp on the child's arm would identify the mother.  I think that system is one that should be adopted generally in our hospitals.  I discussed the matter with a number of medical men and other people who have a knowledge of this. They agreed that such a system would be desirable and that it would give a great feeling of encouragement and confidence to the mothers who go into our hospitals to have babies.</P>
    <P>There seems to be a feeling of worry amongst other mothers throughout the country when they go into our hospitals as to whether they will get their own babies when they are leaving the hospitals. Somebody put it to me one day when this matter was being discussed that in so far as births in some of the hospitals are concerned none of us really know who we are.  I do not think the situation is as serious as all that, but I would ask the Minister to give his very sympathetic consideration to that last suggestion of mine.  I have no doubt that if he consults the medical men in the various hospitals he will find many of them in agreement with that suggestion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickPGogan" hpid="Mr. Gogan Mr. Gogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the most welcome feature of the Minister's speech is to be found in that paragraph in which he referred to the fact that he hopes, before the end of the year, to implement the 1953 Health Act by putting into operation Sections 15, 16 and 17.  Listening to the Minister's speech on the Health Bill of 1954, I must say that one would hardly have expected that he would have arrived at that decision so early.  The Minister's statement has, on the whole, been a happy one and both himself and his predecessors.  Deputy Dr. Ryan and Dr. Browne, are to be congratulated on the position of the health services in the country to-day.  I think it would have been fitting for the Minister to have paid some tribute to the work done by those two people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1542" /> I should like to congratulate the Minister on his statement earlier in his speech that he proposes to carry on with vigour the scheme of hospital building so ably carried out during the past ten years.  I should like to congratulate him on his decision to improve the position in the mental hospitals.  As far as Grangegorman is concerned, I would advocate that quite a number of the buildings that are in existence for over 50 years should be pulled down and completely rebuilt. Speaking of Grangegorman, I should like to congratulate the staff on having got an improvement in their salary position during the past year.  I would appeal to the Minister to bring into operation for the staff a scheme in relation to the cost-of-living bonus.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickPGogan" hpid="Mr. Gogan Mr. Gogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is already there.  In dealing with medical cards the Minister said he would ask the various local bodies for an explanation of the very low percentage of applications for medical register.  In my opinion it is the means test adopted in connection with the medical register which is largely responsible for the lack of applications.  I would ask the Minister to appeal to the local authorities to treat those applications in a more generous fashion.  The same thing applies in regard to applications for maternity cash grants.  I think that a much more generous scale should be put into operation.  At the present time I think it is impossible for a man earning £5 or £6 a week to get that grant unless he has three or four children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to devote a certain amount of my time to the question of the disablement allowance.  The most recent figures I have got in connection with the City of Dublin show that Dublin Corporation received a total of 2,081 applications under these maintenance allowance regulations.  Out of that 400 were refused on medical grounds and 650 were refused on the grounds of means, means being divided into three categories&mdash;personal income, income of the family or State grants.  During the year the Minister <Col N="1543" /> was kind enough, following on questions I raised in the House, to make representations to the Dublin Corporation with consequent improvement in the investigation of these cases.  The fact still remains that large arrears of payments are still due to these disabled persons.</P>
    <P>I have during the course of my employment come to know a large number of those people who have been in receipt of home assistance for a long number of years, who have been certified as disabled by the local dispensary doctor and who on application to the Dublin Corporation have been turned down as medically fit.  Quite rightly, the Minister pointed out that it was necessary for the deciding officer employed by the Dublin Corporation to take every care in the investigation of these disablement allowances because these allowances were tantamount to a pension for life.  At the same time, by no stretch of the imagination could some of the cases that have been disallowed be described as otherwise than disabled.</P>
    <P>There was one case of this kind which came to my notice only last week, of a woman aged 24 who was certified as suffering from epilepsy.  She had been a patient in a mental hospital on three occasions and was in receipt of home assistance on the ground of her disablement. Her means are nil; she resides with her mother who has a widow's pension and is in receipt of supplementary home assistance. Another case which has come to my notice just yesterday is of a woman, aged 66, suffering from total deafness. She has been accepted by the Dublin Corporation as totally disabled but she receives only 15/- per week due to the fact that she has a railway pensioner residing with her who gives her 10/- towards a rent of 13/4.</P>
    <P>I could enumerate hundreds of such cases.  I know another case of a woman, aged 40, suffering from meningitis.  The only means in the family are the old age pension of her widowed mother and the earnings of a sister, about £4 a week, in Jacobs.  That person is in receipt of 15/- by reason of her disability <Col N="1544" /> and she has been refused the allowance &ldquo;in view of your family's present income&rdquo;.  There is another person suffering from deafness but I do not think that is the cause of her total disability.  She was refused on the grounds of her family's present income.  Her only means of existence is 15/- home assistance; she is staying with a brother-in-law.</P>
    <P>A further case which came to my personal notice is that of a man, aged 32, suffering from epilepsy since the age of 14.  He is in receipt of 17/6 home assistance and resides with a widowed mother with 24/- pension, a stepbrother in receipt of 18/- unemployment assistance and a brother earning £6 a week as a cleaner in C.I.E.  This man applied last October and when no trace of his application could be found he reapplied on the 29th March and was refused on the grounds of family income.  Another case is that of a woman, aged 55 years, suffering from nervous debility.  She resides with her mother who has an old age pension and the only other means is that she lives in a room belonging to her married sister whose husband is employed but who has three or four children to keep out of his own income.  I do know the Minister in his speech made an appeal that a more generous attitude be adopted towards those people and I would ask the Minister to press for early payment of the arrears due to such disabled persons.</P>
    <P>As regards the Minister's scheme for the employment of disabled persons, I would like to extend a hearty welcome to that scheme, for which provision was made under the 1953 Act.  I am glad to see the Minister has adopted it and is arranging that a semi-State organisation, a limited company, should be set up.  This is one scheme that deserves the support of everyone in the country.  I had a very happy experience some seven or eight years ago of providing employment for a man of 36 years of age who was a hunchback. He told me he never knew what it was to get a week's wages, to get a new suit of clothes or to get other than a secondhand pair of boots.</P>
    <P>Seeing that the State is the largest employer of labour, I think the <Col N="1545" /> Minister should see to it that preference is given to those disabled persons in such capacity as that of porter or messenger.  On one occasion I made representations for a man who had been rehabilitated following treatment in a sanatorium but he was unsuccessful due to his health.</P>
    <P>I would like to draw the Minister's attention also to the question of medical cards which should be made available to people who have occasion to go to welfare clinics.  I think that re-examination and reconsideration should be given to the cases of a large number of those people who have been refused attention at the welfare clinics by reason of the fact that they have not had these medical cards.  In conclusion, I would like to repeat that I congratulate the Minister on his decision to implement the 1953 Act as he has indicated and I sincerely hope he will be in a position to keep his promise that the date of that implementation will be 1955.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. MacCarthy Mr. MacCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as the Cork County health area is concerned, I think the greatest need at the moment is the co-ordination and assessment of requirements in conjunction with the building and reconstruction programme which is now nearing completion there. That applies not only to the sanatorium at Sarsfield's Court, which will release the chest hospital in Mallow to the health authorities in North Cork as a general hospital, but the completion of the orthopaedic hospital may in great measure relieve the overcrowding suffered by children in St. Finbarr's Hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also the question of the voluntary hospitals and the fact that it has been very difficult over a period to get beds in these institutions.  I think it is very necessary also that the regional hospitals, for which we have been waiting for so many years, would be started now that the other buildings, apart altogether from some reconstruction in St. Finbarr's and in &ldquo;Erinville&rdquo;, are nearing completion. When these units are in operation the Minister and his Department will have a better idea of the further requirements <Col N="1546" /> for hospitalisation in the Cork County area.</P>
    <P>I am inclined to think that the regional hospital as now envisaged will meet the demands of that area as far as general hospital treatment is concerned.  The mental hospitals are, of course, completely overcrowded.  I am not blaming the Minister in any way whatever because I feel that matters of health and other questions of that kind should be discussed here from the point of view of the general needs of the people rather than on any other basis.  But when Deputy Dr. Ryan introduced his Health Act way back in 1945 or 1947&mdash;whenever the year was&mdash; he made provision not only for patients in mental hospitals in so far as buildings and services were concerned, but he indicated at that time&mdash;and I think he was well ahead of modern progress in that idea&mdash;that about one-third of patients who went into mental hospitals recovered within a period of from three to six months.</P>
    <P>It was felt then that very often when people were put into these institutions neither the relatives nor anybody else wanted to take responsibility for getting them home again because they imagined that they might become troublesome or something of that kind.  When Deputy Dr. Ryan's Parliamentary Secretary, Dr. Ward, was discussing that measure in the House he stated that the idea was to have observation reception units to which patients, who would ordinarily be sent into mental hospitals, would be taken to see whether or not they were just people who had got temporary breakdowns and who could go out again and be restored to their families without ever entering the portals of a mental hospital as such!</P>
    <P>I think that in the building schemes now envisaged&mdash;and people are crying out for them everywhere because of overcrowding&mdash;this idea should be put into effect.  I should like to add the suggestion that these observation units would not necessarily be on the grounds of the mental hospitals at all &mdash;that they would be in an appropriate place where patients who get nervous breakdowns or something of that <Col N="1547" /> nature would get treatment in the way I have outlined.  Another building problem in regard to hospitals is that of accommodation for mentally defective children.  I do not know how far the Government or the Department of Health are supporting that idea but I should like to say that no praise can be too high for what the Brothers of Charity are doing at Lota for these deficient youths and children.  The care they are giving them is of the highest grade.</P>
    <P>There are still very many of these cases who cannot be taken into hospitals or similar institutions for the type of instruction and treatment that would be helpful and that would give them the change they need.  That is because there are not sufficient hospitals to cater for them.  A lot of work is being done in this respect at Lota but there are 41 patients of this type in the Cork County health district awaiting admission.  These are patients who are on the list but there are many others who have made no application because they feel there is no chance of their getting in.  Very often it takes all the care of the mother to look after mentally defective children or youths, with the result that perhaps the mother cannot attend to her other household duties.  From that point of view alone it will be seen how necessary it is that institutions for the care of these children should be provided.</P>
    <P>Another great need is the provision of homes for the aged.  Perhaps when we have the sanatorium going some house like the one at Lota might be found for use as a chest hospital.  It might, on the other hand, make a very good cancer hospital, which we lack at the moment; we need at least an institution for the treatment of superficial cancer even if all the serious cases still have to come to Dublin for operation and advanced treatment.  In the South we need a hospital for cancer diagnosis where also cases of superficial cancer could be treated.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will push ahead the matter of the orthopaedic hospital as soon as possible so that the children now suffering from overcrowded conditions can be treated in a proper atmosphere. <Col N="1548" /> At the moment there are 300 or so on the waiting lists.  They need very prompt attention because, of course, it is in their youth that the manipulation necessary can more easily be carried out.</P>
    <P>There have been references to the disability allowances, but I will not stress the case further than to say there has been a great deal of dissatisfaction throughout.  No Act is perfect, especially Acts which perhaps overlap other services and which, when the local authorities get hold of them and try to co-ordinate them with the regulations dealing with similar services, develop snags which were not anticipated and which could not have been anticipated in the matter of allowances and payments.  I think the tendency of the Minister is to treat these snags sympathetically and I hope he will continue to do that.</P>
    <P>Before departing from the question of treatment of children, I think it is correct to say that formerly children were treated in homes and so forth. There was no proper accommodation or specialised treatment in hospitals for them but the tendency now is to provide for children the same treatment as for adults and it is regrettable that the school medical services have been held up so long.  I think, however, that we are nearing the end of that dispute.  I am hopeful that in Cork County it is coming to an end and I hope the Minister will be able to let these services operate now without the additional appointments that he had in mind.</P>
    <P>There is no need to make further appointments and put additional burdens on either the rates or the State finances, if these services can be operated through the, county and voluntary hospitals in the normal way by the specialised staff available.  Even though we have gone to the first stage of appointing medical men for these services, I think we ought to try if the present medical men in the various areas and hospitals concerned are prepared to operate these services.</P>
    <P>We are all very pleased to see the new tendency since the conditions of nurses were improved.  Formerly, when these nurses qualified, and even before <Col N="1549" /> they qualified, the tendency was to go abroad for employment.  Now the tendency is the other way, and, when vacancies arise here, many of our Irish girls return to our hospitals to give service in them, a service at which they are so competent, so kind and so painstaking, instead of being lost to another country.  The improved conditions, payment and so on which they now get here at home are an inducement to them to return to their own country.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of congratulation for all that so much progress has been made in recent years in relation to the disease of diphtheria which was a plague and which took away many children before they were a year old. This is now almost a thing of the past. The treatment of T.B. is making remarkable progress and, with the goodwill of all concerned, the health programme and policy of our country will bring remarkable results to the people and will give confidence to those who are ill or who may in their declining years lose their means of support.  These health services, without taking away entirely the responsibility of a family for their parents and relatives, will operate as far as it is possible to give the people a really up-to-date health service and give them a feeling of confidence that their needs are being attended to, and consequently hope for the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1943" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I have some questions to put to the Minister, the first of which relates to the mental hospital in Enniscorthy.  It is overcrowded and the doctors have been asking the committee there for some time to get an admission unit.  I understand that we cannot get any money from the Hospitals' Trust for such a purpose and I think the Minister told us at one time that the Hospitals' Trust programme was filled for the next ten years, so far as this money is concerned.  It is very regrettable that we should have people in corridors in a mental hospital where there is no central heating and where, in winter-time, the water runs down the walls.  The prospect of getting no money from the Hospitals' Trust for the next ten years is not very hopeful <Col N="1550" /> for the ratepayers, if they have to foot the full bill.</P>
      <P>The Minister's predecessor, shortly before the general election, gave over to home assistance officers the duty of collecting cottage rents.  To my mind, that should not be so, because when a man who is a home assistance officer and who has to collect the rents of cottages goes into a house to ask for rent, he must take it from the home assistance.</P>

      <P>Deputy MacCarthy has spoken about the disability allowances and I can say that, since these allowances were brought into operation in my county, I have never got as many letters expressing dissatisfaction.  The county council are sending out from their offices a typed letter to nearly every applicant saying that he or she is not entitled to the allowance and people have been refused the allowance in areas in which a person who is probably not half as bad is drawing it. There is something wrong there.  I understand that the home assistance officer has a lot to do with the granting of the allowance, because I was told by the county manager in Wexford that he makes a report on each applicant when the claim comes in, and the Deputy who spoke from the opposite benches who is a home assistance officer should be aware of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickPGogan" hpid="Mr. Gogan Mr. Gogan">

    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1943" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the position in our county.  I have a cutting here with me of a discussion we had on the matter in Wexford, which sets out that so many people were granted the allowance and so many people disallowed. It is only right that we should put this before the Minister and give him an opportunity of having it investigated.  At the time, the county secretary told me, there were 472 applications, of which 203 were granted and 179 were to be examined.  Since then more applications have been received by the county council and the only excuse put forward in relation to them <Col N="1551" /> is that the medical officer is busy and cannot reach these things.</P>
      <P>The Deputy opposite argued that payment should be made retrospective. I put the matter to the Wexford County Manager and he told me that it is operated from the date the manager makes the order.  I would like to see people getting this back-money, if at all possible, but I believe it is a matter for the manager, who makes the order, and not the Minister.</P>
      <P>Reference was made here to the Health Act, 1953.  To my knowledge, there is very little provision in that Act for making beds available.  People are waiting for beds and people are being sent home from hospital so that another person can get in.  That is a well-known fact all over the country. Although there have been improvements in the matter of hospital accommodation, and though new hospitals have been built for the treatment of T.B. cases, very little has been done for the ordinary person who falls sick and who now has to wait until such time as he can get a bed.  It is nearly impossible to get a bed in Dublin, unless a man is well able to pay for it.</P>
      <P>With regard to maternity grants administered through the county council, no provision was made by the Minister's predecessor in this regard and the onus was thrown entirely on the county council.  In the case of our county, the county manager did not know how many would be applying for these grants during the year, but we had to give him a figure of £4,000 to cover the year.  It is very easy for the Department to put a scheme into force by pushing it on to the local authority, as is done by the 1953 Act.  The scheme is thrown completely on the shoulders of the ratepayers and no provision is made for a contribution from the Central Fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The result is that the poor people are suffering more than ever.  In my county, where people had home assistance&mdash;in some cases amounting to 10/-, 14/- and 15/&mdash;the home assistance was cut off when the £1 was granted, so <Col N="1552" /> that in some cases the people concerned were worse off because they then lost the fuel vouchers and things like them.  I know that the Minister has said that it is not Government policy that such a thing as that should happen and that it is a matter for the local authorities.  I should like, however, if the Minister, when concluding, would make some reference to that matter, because it is not right that people who are to get £1&mdash;some of them 15/&mdash;and a fuel voucher in the winter-time should be worse off with the £1 than they were before.</P>
    <P>I think we should have some assurance from the Minister that he will not allow, in certain cases, home assistance payments to be reduced, especially in a family where there are invalid boys and girls over 16 years of age who are unable to do anything for themselves.  I do not think it is right that the cost of their maintenance should have to be borne by their brothers and sisters.  I know of cases in my own locality where that has happened.  The father, say, is working with the county council and there may be an invalid son or daughter in the family getting the £1 disability.  I think the Minister should step in, in a case of that kind, and see that the full amount is granted.  Surely, a man working with a farmer or with the county council who has an invalid boy or girl who is over 16 years of age, should not be deprived of this payment by any county medical officer or any county manager.  I would ask the Minister to give me some information on this matter when he is replying.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like, first of all, to express my appreciation to the House, and particularly to the Deputies who have taken a part in the discussion on this Estimate, for the very generous manner in which they have received the matters that I dealt with in my opening statement.  We have had our fill of controversy with regard to health matters, both inside and outside this House over the past 12 years or so.  I think, however, that in the controversy that took place there was agreement as to the objects but perhaps divisions as to the means of achieving these objects and aims.  I do <Col N="1553" /> not think that since we got our freedom in 1921, freedom which was followed by the very rapid strides that were made in public health in this country and with the initiation of a very fine local public health administration, any political Party here has been concerned other than to see the establishment of better and improved health services.  Accordingly, the differences that may have arisen have only been differences as to the means of achieving what is the common object of all.</P>
      <P>I would like to make some few general observations before I go on to deal with some of the points which were raised by Deputies.  It appears to me that a proper and adequate health service in any country, and in this country, needs a number of necessary facilities.  Hospitals must be provided and properly equipped; and there must be the necessary arrangements made with the bodies and professions who are trained to provide these necessary health services.  I mention that because, when I became Minister for Health 12 months ago, I found the scheme contained in the Health Act, so far as the legal formalities were concerned, committed to go into operation. But I found a shortage of hospital beds; I found a state of cold war between the medical profession and my Department and I found a state of complete bewilderment amongst other affected bodies as to the place they would have to play in the new health scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Accordingly, in order to avoid complete chaos in this country, and particularly in order to avoid unnecessary hardship being imposed on persons and classes who up to 12 months ago were being provided with services, I found it necessary to move in this House a Bill entitling me as Minister to build a scheme out of the Health Act bit by bit, according as the necessary facilities would become available.  In doing that, I did not express any approval of the methods contained in the Health Act for the achievement of better health services in this country.  In fact, I still regard the Health Act as not being the best course for achieving even the limited aim that it sets out to achieve, <Col N="1554" /> but I did say 12 months ago that, as a contribution to ending dissension, strife and controversy on health matters in this country, I was prepared to implement the Health Act as soon as I could do it.</P>
    <P>I think it is just as well, in view of some statements made recently outside of this House by Deputies of the House, that I should recall what I said here in the debate on the Health Bill of 1954, I have here the Official Report for the 7th July, 1954, Volume 146, No. 11.  Speaking at column 1342 in reference to the Health Act, I said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I voted against that measure&mdash; the Health Act, 1953&mdash;when it was before the Dáil.  I do not think that it incorporates the best that could be obtained in this country.  I was against it and spoke against it, but I do feel that a contribution can be made in this whole turbulent controversial subject of health by accepting what has been done by those who went before me.  I propose to accept the Health Act, 1953, in so far as the services are concerned, in full.  I do not intend to change them.  I do not intend to alter them, to minimise them, to counteract them in the slightest.  I do intend to see that they are made available.  I do intend to see that the Health Act works and that is the purpose of this Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In another part of the debate, I mentioned my concern to see that the measure would be made workable and implemented as quickly as possible. During the course of the debate on that Bill, some Deputies moved amendments with the object of trying to specify a particular date on which the full Health Act would come into operation.  I resisted those amendments because I felt it was wiser to be free to act myself in accordance with my own discretion and with the information that was available to me.</P>
    <P>I mention that matter because, in the course of this debate, Deputy Dr. Ryan and, I think, some other Deputies, suggested that my announcement, that I hoped to implement the Health Act, 1953, in the latter end of this year &mdash;I should like to make a slight correction <Col N="1555" /> there, because what I intended to say was the latter end of this financial year, although I think I said the latter end of this calendar year when speaking&mdash;was some new announcement. In fact, it was not.  I made it quite clear 12 months ago that, as soon as I could, I would implement the Health Act.  It is because I think we are nearer to providing the necessary facilities that I have expressed the hope that we would be able to do it at the end of this financial year.</P>
    <P>Deputies will recollect that, in the past 12 months, a number of new hospitals have been opened.  I cannot just remember all of them but certainly it was possible to open the regional hospital in Limerick and other large hospital units have become available which were not available 12 months ago.  It was just on that precise point that I differed so considerably from my predecessor in the debates on the Health Bill of 1954.  To my mind, it was useless to say: &ldquo;We are going to provide a health service now because in three, four or five years' time there will be beds available for the people who, under our law, should benefit now.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That, I am afraid, was Deputy Dr. Ryan's approach and indeed he repeated it here in the debate on this Estimate.  I feel that that is putting the cart very much before the horse. In my view, you should not encourage people by telling them they are entitled to services if, in fact, the machinery is not there to give the services to them.  It is because, amongst other things, so many new beds have become available in the course of the past 12 months, and will become available in the course of the next eight or nine months, that I have been able to implement the Act.  I do not think there is any inconsistency about it.  In fact, I think I correctly said 12 months ago what I would do and if I am to be charged with anything it is that I am being very uninterestingly consistent.</P>
    <P>With regard to the implementation of the Health Act, I personally&mdash;and I think there is a great body of opinion in this House that would agree with me&mdash;am against providing any form of <Col N="1556" /> health services free or partially free to people who can afford to pay for them. I think that is wrong.  I think it is soul-destroying and an insult to individual integrity and independence.  In so far as, under the net of the Health Act, there may be individuals&mdash;and, indeed, perhaps there are&mdash;who are getting services for which they can afford to pay, it may be that some weeding may have to be done; I do not know; that is a point that will have to be examined later.  However, I am prepared to accept the case that the Health Act is intended to deal with the needy&mdash;those who need the services.  I do not think there can be any question that every individual, particularly married men, whose income does not exceed £600 a year cannot possibly provide these services for himself.  There can be no question about that.  In fact, the real pity is that it was not possible to provide these services a long time ago for persons within that income limit.</P>
    <P>Questions may arise with regard to the position of farmers.  The £50 valuation limit for farmers in this country is a very problematic approach to ascertain who need the services. The £50 farmer in the South might make the case, with justice, that he is in fact a farmer in the middle income group&mdash;and one could concede that point of view.  However, a £50 farmer in Mayo or Galway or Leitrim or Donegal might be a man in the upper income bracket&mdash;and there is that difficulty about it.  I hope, in examining that matter, to see if it is possible&mdash; it may be completely impossible&mdash;to devise a method of getting where we want to go, namely, to provide a service for the farmer in the middle income group because, in fact, he needs some help in providing services for himself.  As I say, it may not be possible to devise an alternative method but I hope to have the matter examined, in any event.</P>
    <P>There is one other point which I should like to deal with before I come to some of the points of detail mentioned by Deputies&mdash;and I say this without any hope of having what I say regarded with any seriousness by certain Deputies in this House.  I did <Col N="1557" /> not devise the Health Act of 1953.  I did not introduce it.  I did not work out the details.  As it goes into operation, it must be remembered that I am bringing it into operation in accordance with legislation passed in a House in which I was not the Minister for Health.</P>
    <P>It is one of the cornerstones of the Health Act of 1953 that the financial provisions for the payment of services should be a wedding, if you like, between the Central Fund and local authorities. That runs right through the whole scheme of the Health Act&mdash;that, for every £1 the health service costs the local authority, £1 will be added to it from Central Funds.  The idea behind the scheme contained in the Health Act was that local authorities should provide the facilities aimed at in the Act and should pay for them and then, at the end of the year, get a refund as to 50 per cent. of their costs.</P>
    <P>That financial proposal goes to the very root of the scheme contained in the Health Act.  That has had its effect on insured workers.  Prior to the Health Act of 1952, I think, under the additional benefits scheme which was introduced some years ago by the Minister for Social Welfare, insured workers were given something that was not covered by their stamps&mdash;a benefit that was not engaged for when the unemployment insurance stamp was paid&mdash; and that was free hospital services for themselves for six weeks provided they were in benefit.  I forget the terms of the benefit but they had to have a certain number of contributions paid. They were to get free hospital services. That provision was carried out by the Department of Social Welfare entering into an agreement with every local authority in the country and with all voluntary hospitals.  The agreement was that the Department of Social Welfare would pay every county council a sum of £5 12s. per week to cover the maintenance of any insured worker being maintained in the hospital and the same terms applied in the voluntary hospitals.</P>
    <P>When the health scheme was introduced, the previous Government, on the proposition of my predecessor, <Col N="1558" /> decided to terminate the additional benefit scheme.  That scheme cost £500,000 per year.  They decided to terminate it and to throw on to local authorities the cost of providing hospital services previously borne by the Department of Social Welfare. That decision was taken by the Government in July 1952 and became effective in the year 1954.  Accordingly, in the Estimates prepared by the previous Administration and in the Budget of 1954 no provision was made for the operation of the additional benefit scheme by the Department of Social Welfare after August 1st, 1954. Deputies will recollect that August 1st, 1954 was the date of the operation of the Health Act, 1953.  Accordingly, on and after that date, there was transferred from the Central Fund to local rates the sum of £500,000 which represented the cost of providing hospital services for insured workers.</P>
    <P>That was done before I became Minister for Health.  The facts I have mentioned are easily ascertainable and cannot be disputed.  I must say that I recent very much the suggestion made, even by my predecessor&mdash;I could understand other Deputies making it without full knowledge of the facts, but it was made even by Deputy Dr. Ryan&mdash;that it was a decision of mine that transferred to local rates the cost of providing hospitalisation for insured workers. It was not my decision and I would just like to add this footnote that, if it was my decision, I would stand by it even if it suited my political purpose to suggest that it was somebody else's. It was not mine.  It was the decision of Deputy Dr. Ryan and the Fianna Fáil Government.  Why are they ashamed of it?  If it was a good decision, why are they afraid to stand by it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I say &ldquo;if it was&rdquo;.  Why, just because from a short-term point of view it happens to suit the political exigencies of the moment, suggest something contrary to the known facts and why run away from the Health Act that was talked about so much 12 months ago?  However, I <Col N="1559" /> state that without any hope that these absurd statements will cease to be made.  I think they will continue to be made but, so far as the records of the House are concerned, I have stated ascertainable facts that cannot be denied.</P>
      <P>I shall refer now to a few of the details that were mentioned.  Deputy Briscoe and Deputy Dr. Ryan mentioned the matter I have just referred to&mdash;the position of insured persons&mdash; and I have dealt with that.</P>
      <P>A number of Deputies mentioned the need for the provision of facilities in some institution for housing aged people.  That, of course, is a very definite problem but one has to be extremely careful in an approach to this matter.  It is the primary duty of every child, not only to respect, but to care for his parents and much of the difficulty that arises in Ireland to-day with regard to aged people arises from a complete disregard for the Fourth Commandment.  There are, unfortunately, young people in this country who get married and who are only too concerned to see the aged man and woman out of the house as quickly as possible and I do not think it would be a right thing to facilitate them in that matter.</P>
      <P>I do not think it would be right to encourage people to throw off their natural obligations and to provide for them some large institution in which every old person would be forced to end his or her days.  That is one difficulty, but there is this to be said: In many of our mental hospitals where the overcrowding problem is so acute, as has been recognised by Deputies in this debate, there are old people who are senile.  They are not suffering from any curable form of mental illness. They are suffering from a mental condition which is brought about by old age and they are chronics.  They are in mental hospitals mostly although there are some in county homes.  I am having examined at the moment by a committee, to which I made reference in introducing the Estimate, the possibility of providing for those people a special form of institutional care, not of treatment because really there is no treatment that can be provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1560" /> To that extent, I think something useful can be done in dealing with the problem of the aged.  Also, of course, it may be possible to provide smaller homes or houses for particular cases of aged people, aged people who, perhaps, have no kith or kin and who have no one to look after them, who are not merely the victims of an unfortunate development in our society. That is being examined and perhaps something may be done about it.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies mentioned the question of dispensary premises and the provision of dispensary facilities.  In fact, as Deputies are aware, I went to each Health authority in the country over the past 12 months and discussed with them the state and condition of every single dispensary.  There is not a dispensary building anywhere the condition of which I have not discussed with the members of each health authority.  The drive for the replacement of faulty dispensaries is proceeding satisfactorily and I have no doubt that very shortly that drive will reach a satisfactorily conclusion.</P>
    <P>Cork Deputies referred to the opening of the orthopaedic hospital in Cork. I am as much concerned as they are to see this hospital functioning as quickly as possible and I am glad to be able to say that after some pressure, if I may put it that way, that orthopaedic hospital will open on the 2nd July next.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies referred to disability allowances and to some of the difficulties which have arisen in the implementation of that scheme.  Again, it must be appreciated that under the Health Act the responsibility for the provision of the services set out in that Act is that of each health authority.  I have no power at all to interfere with their decisions or to question them as to their administration provided I am satisfied that they are giving what the Health Act stipulates they should give.  It is for health authorities to decide who shall qualify for medical assistance under Section 14. The decision is theirs and theirs alone.</P>
    <P>Now, Section 14 is the section which makes provision for medical assistance. It is that section which, in effect, qualifies a person for maternity cash <Col N="1561" /> grants, for certain hospital services and for a variety of other services under the Health Act.  That section is widely drafted.  It provides that free medical assistance can only be given to persons who are unable by their own industry or other lawful means to provide for themselves.  Now the decision must be a decision of the health authority in relation to each particular case.  I cannot tell the health authority the way in which they should decide.  The obligation is on them.</P>
    <P>Shortly after becoming Minister I learned that in administering Section 14 health authorities were adopting a rule-of-thumb approach. They were adopting a scale of weekly income and they used that scale to decide the particular issue they had to decide under Section 14.  Some Deputies may be familiar with these scales.  They might run from, say, the single man with £4 per week to the married man who might be in receipt of £4 10s. per week; different weekly wages of that kind were incorporated into the scale, depending on whether the person was married or single and, if married, the number of children involved and the total weekly income.</P>
    <P>Now that, in my opinion, was not a correct or proper approach to the provisions of Section 14.  Accordingly, I thought I had both the power and the duty to say to health authorities that they had no right to decide individual applications by a stated set scale.  If it were intended that qualification for medical assistance should be governed by a particular scale, then either the Act or the regulations would have so provided.  I, therefore, circularised local authorities and directed them to decide each case on its merits.  One can well imagine a man whose income might be as high as £12 or £14 per week and who might have some personal tragedy or difficulty which would only become apparent if his case was examined on its merits; it could never become apparent if, in fact, the scale were adopted and rigidly enforced.  I think that position has now been cured so far as medical assistance is concerned.</P>
    <P>In relation to disability allowances, again I found there that certain health <Col N="1562" /> authorities were, in my opinion, not approaching their obligation in a proper manner.  As Deputies are aware, under the regulations which I made last October each health authority was prohibited from regarding as means the amount of home assistance an applicant might receive.  That was removed from the provision of means under the regulations which I made.  There still remains a means test and the means test for the disablement allowance is set out in Section 50, sub-sections (6) and (7) of the Health Act.</P>
    <P>Under Section 50 sub-section (6) the health authority can only make these payments to persons who are over 16 years of age, who are not able to provide for their own maintenance and whose relatives, within the meaning of this sub-section, are unable to provide for them.  The applicant must be over 16 years of age, must be unable to provide maintenance for himself and must be able to show that no relative is able to provide for him.  Now &ldquo;relative&rdquo; is defined as the spouse, son, daughter, or parent, or any brother or sister of a person normally resident with such person.  Therefore, to qualify for an allowance, disablement must be proved, no means must be proved and, in addition, it must be established that no relative within the definition of sub-section (7) of Section 50 can provide for the applicant.</P>
    <P>While I can appreciate the concern of Deputies, it is inevitable under Section 50 of the Health Act that there will be cases of unfortunate people who perhaps have some home assistance, who live with possibly a married brother or sister and who are really a cross and a burden in that household. It is unfortunate that the means going into the house must be regarded by health authorities under Section 50, but I have urged health authorities to bring to the operation of Section 50 a sense of charity and to give to the determination of the means test in that section as wide an interpretation as possible.  As you know, I found some time ago that the health authorities were using that section to save money on their home assistance accounts&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, if a person getting home assistance, say, gets 12/6 and qualifies for the £1, the 12/6 is taken off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The position was certainly as the Deputy has mentioned up to a short time ago.  I found quite a number of cases where home assistance, say, 15/- was being paid and when a disablement allowance of 15/- or £1 was given the home assistance was then terminated.  It could not be done the other way round: the home assistance could not be counted as means because that was prohibited, but when health authorities granted a disablement allowance they said to the applicant: &ldquo;Now, you have so much disablement allowance, therefore you are not in need of home assistance.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It was that particular problem that I dealt with on a number of occasions and I referred to it quite often.  Eventually, my colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare, who is the responsible Minister in relation to home assistance matters, did come to my assistance and has made an Order now prohibiting public assistance authorities from reducing beyond 10/&mdash;in other words, if I may put it this way&mdash;when a disablement allowance is granted and if it is lower than 10/- it cannot effect any reduction or cut in home assistance; if it is more than 10/- it can, to the extent of 10/-.  In other words, the effect will be that a person in those circumstances will get at least 10/- more than he had been getting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, we have directed that all health authorities <Col N="1564" /> should re-examine the decisions they have already made.</P>
      <P>Some Deputies have referred to the problem of mentally defective children. Again that is one of the great wants that we have in this country.  There is a great number of children&mdash;it is impossible to be accurate as to the number&mdash;but certainly there are numbers of children in this country who suffer from some mental deficiency and for whom it is not possible at the moment to provide any institutional care or treatment.  That is nobody's fault; it is just a problem that is there.</P>
      <P>Tremendous work is being done by the institutions that we have.  I have been through a number of them and certainly the work being done in Obelisk Park and by Lota in Cork by the brothers is work of real Christian charity and it needs a very high vocation for its doing.  But the provision of more beds has been getting attention in recent years and we hope that by the end of the present year there should be at least another 1,300 beds for both male and female mentally defective children.  In addition work should commence on another 800 or so beds this year.  Accordingly, by the end of the year while the problem will still be there it will be reduced by quite a substantial degree.</P>
      <P>The same thing arises in relation to mental hospitals.  Again, if there is a supplementary building programme, as I hope there will be, the bias in that programme will be towards the mental problem, towards the provision of better facilities in mental hospitals and also for these mentally defective children.  If there is a supplementary building programme, I can assure Deputy O'Leary we will not forget Enniscorthy.</P>
      <P>Other points have been mentioned by Deputies and I can assure each Deputy that a note has been made of them and they will be communicated with in regard to the matters raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of Deputies referred to the problem of rehabilitation.  I hope to be able to make an announcement with regard to that in the near future.  As I indicated in my statement, we are establishing a national body and this <Col N="1565" /> body will be charged with the duty of examining what facilities are needed and working out a policy for rehabilitation. It will aim at providing these unfortunate incapacitated people with some form of employment and some means of earning their daily bread in the same way as everybody else. Accordingly, a scheme of that kind and work of that kind will need co-operation from employers and employees and I want to express the hope that the trade union movement will be willing to co-operate in this worthwhile work.  It is not easy to find suitable work for a disabled man and it can only be found if a number of interested people are willing to help him find work.  In the body I hope to establish in the near future I will ask representatives of the Irish trade unions to join and to help, with employers and other interested parties, in getting the work done.</P>
    <P>I think a Deputy mentioned that the Government could do a lot.  I entirely agree with that.  I think that in the Government services there will be a possibility of absorbing many of our disabled citizens, but that will not be sufficient if the large industrial employers cannot or are not able or willing to provide employment and help in the problem of resettlement. I hope that when this body gets down to work they will get co-operation from these different people.</P>
    <P>I want to make one slight correction. I was referring to home assistance a while ago and I think I did not put the matter quite correctly.  In fact, what now happens is that the first 10/- of disablement allowance must be disregarded in fixing home assistance. The result is the same: it is just the method of doing it.</P>
    <P>I have nothing further to say, except that I appreciate the manner in which Deputies have received this Estimate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to stand very long between the Minister and his very natural desire to have this debate come to a conclusion, but there are just a few things I would like to say.</P>
      <P>The first is with reference to the position of engineers under the revised salary scales of 1953.  I notice from reading the Official Report that Deputy Bartley referred to this matter last week, but I do not think it is any harm that I also should refer to it, in the hope that the Minister will see that a fairly serious position has developed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It appears now that none of our engineering graduates are going into local authority work.  In fact, the position is so bad regarding the salary scales for young engineers in this country and for engineers generally in this country, that the final year students in college are being openly canvassed by large firms from England and elsewhere, and as a result we are educating engineers for the world market.  That is a very serious situation and it is one that we will have to look into.  It is possible that the enormous capital development throughout the world in the course of the past two years or so has pushed up the salaries outside this country for engineers, and it is possible that there may be even a scarcity of engineers and that they have a scarcity value as well as their real value.  One of the effects of the situation certainly is that none of our 1954 graduates in engineering went into local authority work in this country, in contrast to the position at the beginning of the war, say, in 1939 or 1940, when 80 per cent. of <Col N="1567" /> the new engineers went into local authority work directly after they qualified.</P>
    <P>Apart from that position, the engineers appear to have been discriminated against in the revised scales of 1953.  For instance, the assistant county engineer who previously had been on a similar scale to an accountant, received a 9 per cent. increase as compared with a 20 per cent. increase for the accountant.  The chief assistant county engineer who had previously been on the same level as the secretary and the assistant county medical officer of health, received a 7 per cent. increase as against 16½ per cent. for the other two officers.  The county medical officer of health who had previously been on the same grade as the county engineer grade II, received an increase of 14 per cent. against 11 per cent for the grade II county engineer.  The grade I county engineer received an increase of 6 per cent., as compared with an increase of 22 per cent. for the county manager.</P>
    <P>The result of the discrimination which the engineers feel has been made against them in the revised scales of 1953 has been that at the present time they are boycotting the positions that become vacant from time to time.  The County of Offaly at present has no county engineer.  There is a position for county engineer vacant in Dublin and I understand that it is quite likely that the posts which are becoming vacant in a couple of other counties in the near future will also remain vacant if discriminatory treatment is going to be meted out to them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The position of city engineer in Cork, as Deputy MacCarthy reminds me, is in the same way and I think the assistant engineer for Dublin also.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand also that the Cork Corporation in their wisdom have recommended strongly to <Col N="1568" /> the Minister that they should advertise more attractive scales and that Dublin Corporation have made a similar recommendation with regard to Dublin. I am sure that those responsible people &mdash;particularly the responsible aldermen and citizens of Cork Corporation&mdash;have not made these recommendations without having studied the matter with some care.  Whether the Minister himself has received these figures I have quoted, I do not know.  If he has received them I am sure that he will give them his earnest consideration.</P>
      <P>I notice also in the revision that the gap between the grade I and grade II county engineer has been narrowed.  I think that is a continuation of a process that has been going on for some time.  I believe that once upon a time there were three grades of county engineer&mdash;and, to be quite frank, I think there should still be three grades of county engineer in this country.  I certainly think that there is a great gap between the work that a grade I and a grade II county engineer would have to do.  If you take an easy county like&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Meath, I think&mdash; which is an easy county as against a county like Mayo, Galway or the Minister's own native Donegal.  It should be self-evident that a county engineer working in Meath&mdash;where I understand they have only perhaps 20 or 30 miles of unrolled roads, by-roads and main county roads in the whole county&mdash;is a vastly different proposition from ploughing up mountains in Donegal and going around Deputy Blaney's bends.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very beautiful, as Deputy Blaney says, and there is no county into which I like to go more than Donegal, as well for the scenery as anything else, but certainly the roads there must be a nightmare to deal with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would strongly urge on the Minister to revert to the old position, where the relative amount of work being done <Col N="1569" /> by a county engineer in these particularly difficult counties was reflected in the emoluments he got for doing that work.  I imagine, although I do not know the figures, that the county engineer in one of these counties must be responsible for the spending of something like £1,000 or £1,500 per day. That is a very great responsibility and is one for which he and his assistants should be properly paid.  The force of events over the past two or three years&mdash;the emigration of all our civil engineers&mdash;has proved that this matter demands attention.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I would willingly sit down and let the Minister in if one or two of my own pet subjects were not still unsolved.  I am glad, indeed, that legislation has now been introduced allowing for differentiation in regard to major and minor roads and giving legal force to the signs which, up to now, have not had any legal force.  I would urge upon the Minister that not only should the Act be implemented quickly but that it should be uniformly implemented throughout the country.  I make it a habit of reading certain Deputies' contributions to this House and of omitting to read certain other Deputies' contributions.  One of those whose contributions I read is Deputy Sheldon and I strongly recommend to the Minister his statements about uniformity in regard to road signs and, for that matter, his statement that these road signs should mean what they say.</P>
    <P>For the past three or four weeks there has been a sign on the road home which I take alleging that there are road works ahead.  About 100 yards beyond that sign you get on to a new road&mdash;a much better one than the one on which you had been travelling and where there was not any warning about road works.  When you have travelled about four or five miles on a beautiful new highway and see no sign alleging that there are road works ahead you say: &ldquo;That is the same thing again. I will not be bothered about it&rdquo; and you end up with two or three broken springs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is better than the sign &ldquo;Danger, Men At Work&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1570" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it is.  What you usually see is &ldquo;Danger Men.  At Work&rdquo; or &ldquo;Danger Men, At Work&rdquo; which, as Deputy Sheldon says, is humorous.  I hope we will get to the stage as soon as we possibly can where we will have uniform signs and where we will have in respect of the signs that will be put up arising out of the legislation passed recently the force of law, uniformity, and so on.</P>
      <P>One effect that these will have is that it will make it easier for people to know what they are doing when they go out and use the roads.  Another effect, I hope, will be that the relative positions in law of the people who are using the roads will be clarified with the result that there should be fewer actions for negligence in the courts and, possibly, some hope from the insurance point of view for the motorist and of course&mdash;and this is by far the most, important thing of all&mdash; that there would be fewer fatal accidents and fewer accidents involving serious injury.  That, after all, is the object of all these signs that we are using and the object of the legislation recently passed in this House.  I hope it will be the object of future legislation, although I am not now advocating that.</P>
      <P>I feel confident that the Department will implement that Act as quickly as possible and do everything in their power to see that the Act is uniformly implemented throughout the country. I would like to urge upon the Minister that the drive towards the improvement of the county roads should continue. Irrespective of the arguments from one side or other of the House, it is my opinion that it is far more important at the present time that we should provide as many of the people as possible with a reasonable road before we start building highways at the expense of the taxpayer.  At the same time, I think that we should build these highways.  I think we should look to America and other countries where they build them as toll roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that, when they built the Washington Bridge in New York, they expected it would take a very <Col N="1571" /> long time before they would redeem the cost and that they were astonished at the very short space of time it took to get in the revenue.  I have no doubt whatever that if we were to embark on such a scheme in this country it would be a success too.</P>
    <P>I do not want to particularise, but I do want to say that a lot of people to whom I have been talking feel that money is being wasted on certain aspects of main road development in this country at the present time; that too much money has been spent on the widening of roads, for instance, to what they regard as an entirely unnecessary width; and that that is going on at their expense while they are travelling on county roads which are in a hopeless condition.</P>
    <P>That is really not the point I want to make.  The point I was hoping to make was that I do not see why we should stop spending this money, but I think we should spend it in a different way and consider whether it would affect the small towns along the route if we were to establish a few turnpikes in this country.  Frankly, I do not think it would.  The small towns would suffer to a very minute extent, if at all, by the establishment of turnpikes or autobahns, as they are called in Germany.</P>
    <P>I feel that by making the person who uses the roads pay by way of a toll, while you may be extracting a tax, the money you are now expending on these main roads could be diverted to the better development of the county roads and the person who wanted to to take the main road would still have a very good road.  Although it would take him half an hour or an hour longer to get to his destination he would have a very good road.</P>
    <P>All the enormously heavy traffic which is ploughing down these main roads every day and wrecking them would obviously go on to the toll road and in that way the present main roads would be saved the very heavy traffic which involves the great cost of upkeep and considerable repairs that obtain at the present time.  I would recommend that to the Minister, perhaps not for this year, but he ought to keep it in <Col N="1572" /> mind when considering road policy in this country in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Since we opened the debate on this Estimates, very many topics of the administration of the Department of Local Government have been discussed and also very many matters of local interest in regard to which it would be impossible. for me to go into all the details but I will endeavour to cover as many of them as I possibly can.  I hope that the scope of local government affairs that will be solely the responsibility of local authorities will increase gradually and I look forward to the day when the Department of Local Government will be merely there in an advisory capacity to assist local authorities with the expert advice which undoubtedly they can give.</P>
      <P>At the moment, of course, the Department of Local Government are a conduit or a pipe-line through which the finances filter from the Department of Finance to the local authorities.  So long as we are in that position of being responsible for this filtering of the finances, then there is an onus cast upon us to see, first of all, that we can get a fair proportion of State grants from the Department for expenditure in our local authorities and then see, on behalf of the Department of Finance, that they are properly spent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Childers was the first speaker for the Opposition on this Estimate, and I would like now to thank him for the constructive suggestions which he made, and I would like to thank the House generally for the manner in which the Estimate has been received. We have received very many helpful and constructive criticisms and suggestions, all of which have been noted. Deputy Childers was anxious to know about the architectural competition for house design which was mooted in 1947. That competition was initiated in 1947 and was in existance for a period of four years, but despite that fact it made very little progress and in 1951 the competition terminated.  However, that does not mean that the Department have not continued to display interest in site plans and design of building.  Some of the finest architects in this country are being employed by <Col N="1573" /> local authorities in the improvement of the design of houses for local authorities and others, and in matters of siting and appearance my Department's advisers are always available to the local authorities; their advice is often sought and often accepted.</P>
    <P>The experts from my Department and from local authorities attend town planning conferences whenever they are conveniently held outside the country and gain very useful knowledge from their attendance at these particular functions.  Sometimes my Department are blamed for the delay in sanctioning schemes but that delay is readily understood.  We just cannot sanction them right off.  We must examine the specifications, the various, site plans, and so on, and when you are dealing with local authorities of the Twenty-Six Counties it is just a little bit difficult at times without overworking the staff you have got.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to what Deputy Flanagan said a few moments ago.  He made an appeal here on behalf of the engineers' association for increased salaries for county engineers and assistant engineers.  The Deputy may not be aware of the fact that my predecessor sanctioned an increase for these professional men immediately before he went out of office, but what did these gentlemen do?  They accepted an increase and immediately put the gun to my head and said: &ldquo;We will boycott your competitions until we get more.&rdquo;  That is the position.  The gun has been held to my head and they have boycotted the competitions; they have accepted the increase which was given by my predecessor but they still want more.</P>
    <P>One of the very first things I undertook when I became Minister was to introduce an amending Bill to the County Management Acts and I promised that under that Bill I would give the local authorities some say in the increase or decrease of the salaries of its permanent staff.  There would not be much use in my locking the stable door after the horse was stolen.  I could not turn around, increase those salaries and then come along and say to the local authority: &ldquo;There you are, <Col N="1574" /> you have some say now in the increase or decrease in the salaries of your permanent staff but I took jolly good care to increase them all before I gave it to you.&rdquo; I do not think that would be right.</P>

      <P>The 1953 increase, I understand, related to the indoor staff; the 1954 one related to the outdoor staff.  I have now explained my position, but I think it is very unfair that within a week of my taking office these gentlemen or this association should hold the gun to my head and boycott these competitions.  If they had not taken advantage of the increases which were granted to them it would not be so bad.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1575" /> Deputy Flanagan referred to road signs.  I am very glad to be able to tell the Deputy that we propose adhering to the international convention regulations on road signs as soon as we are in a position to do so.  I understand that there was an international convention which issued directions with regard to standardised road signs; and we hope to be able to adopt these recommendations as soon as possible. Of course we could not do very much pending the passage of the Local Government Act, 1955.</P>
    <P>Deputies Childers and Kennedy referred to obsolete farm houses on farms of comparatively low valuations. There may be obsolete farm houses, but I think that is due mostly to lack of initiative on the part of the farmers concerned.  Grants of £285 are available for the, rebuilding of farm houses. There is also a supplementary grant from the local authority.  If farmers want to improve their houses they should take advantage of these grants. If they do this in a very short time we will have very good farm houses all over the country.</P>
    <P>In the congested areas along the seaboards and in all the other congested areas throughout the country much more advantage has been taken of these housing scheme grants than in the Midlands and I think personally it is through lack of initiative on the part of the farmers.  I think they do it from the point of view that what was good enough for their fathers is good enough for them.  I must say that I would like to see them take advantage of the grants available.</P>

      <P>As the Minister for Defence has said, even if he did that should not stop them.  I think we are all at one on that point and perhaps these farmers generally do not realise that there is a seven years' remission. I think they do not take time to study the matter.  Deputy MacCarthy will <Col N="1576" /> agree that most advantage is taken of these grants in the southern areas and along the western seaboard.</P>

      <P>For a five-roomed house a farmer with a valuation of £12 10s. may get grants totalling £570 and a farmer with a valuation between that and £20 may get a grant of £475. Between £20 and £25 valuation the grant is £427 10s.  These are substantial grants and I would like that the farmer Deputies in the House would appeal to their constituents to take advantage of these schemes.</P>

      <P>That is just the difficulty&mdash;to put it across to the farmers. If I could get any suggestions on that matter I would be very glad to consider them.  I appreciate it is difficult to have gentlemen calling on them.  I am afraid farmers have got an abhorrence of the inspector and we do not want to have too many inspectors calling on them.</P>
      <P>Deputy Childers referred to cul-de-sac roads.  Under the Local Government Act, 1953, this is entirely a matter for the local authorities.  Deputy Flanagan did mention a few moments ago that the county engineer in Meath had very little to do.  I think Meath is one of the counties which is taking advantage of this particular Act.  They have taken over a number of cul-de-sac roads not classified as county roads and if we do continue to increase the county road grants they will be able to take over more of these roads although I would not advise local authorities to take over too many of them.  That I might result in a number of our county roads not being kept up to a fairly high standard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley referred to the differential rent system and said that it was unjust.  He said he was making a constructive suggestion to me on the subject of a rent system for the benefit of old age pensioners, disabled and blind persons and others of that kind. <Col N="1577" /> I should like to say that I think our present system of differential rents and graded rents is a very good system. What Deputy O'Malley suggests is that there should be some kind of subsidy for these individuals.  We are hoping that local authorities, in the planning and building of their housing schemes, will make some provision for newlyweds and for the old, I have seen some schemes, and I refer particularly to Naas where they have the magnificent scheme in which one may start out at one end of a terrace and find newlyweds and move along the terrace as the family increases until at the end live the old.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. MacCarthy Mr. MacCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>You have a scheme of that kind in Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that is a very good system and I would encourage local authorities to adopt it, but I would not agree at all with this hidden subsidy suggestion of Deputy O'Malley.  Deputy O'Malley also referred to the advertising signs and what a blatant eyesore they were in the country.  Unfortunately, I have no functions in this matter; all I can do is that, when a local authority sanctions or refuses to sanction the site of hoardings, the applicant may become an appellant and appeal to me, I may either refuse or sanction.  I can assure the Deputies that if any of these unsightly signs or hoardings are applied for and that I have any say in it, I will be very reluctant to afford sanction.</P>
      <P>There are certain places where these signs are very useful.  Approaching a town it is very useful to be able to learn from some sign outside the town as to what garages or hotels are there. For a stranger, particularly, it is very useful to be able to learn not only that there is a certain hotel in the town but also the type of hotel&mdash;whether it is an approved hotel.  But it is a matter in which the Minister can only use his discretion and even then only when it comes up by way of appeal from the local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley referred also to building rings and said he knew of some of those rings.  If he does he <Col N="1578" /> should communicate with the Department of Industry and Commerce, which is the appropriate Department, but I should like to say that our experience in the Department of Local.  Government is that there are no such things as building rings in so far as we know. We had a system to ensure that there should not be when we set up direct labour units in some counties.  These units compete in tendering for schemes with ordinary contractors in the areas concerned.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also referred to delays in the payments of Department of Local Government grants and suggested that a considerable amount of money was spent by local authorities on interest pending the payment of these grants.  That is not true.  I have had a special, not made on the matter and I find that the total amount of overdraft interest paid by local authorities in 1954-55 was estimated at about £176,000.  Very little of this is due to the withholding, of grants, which are estimated at £20,000,000 on revenue account.  Of this £20,000,000 £18.6 million is made up of four grants as follows: the health grant, £6,091,600: the agricultural grant of £5,178,454; the Road Fund grants of £5,700,000 approximately and the housing loan charges contributions of £1,594,999.  That makes a total of £18.6 million approximately.  The health grant, is based on local authorities' health expenditure and is paid quarterly.  Ninety-five per cent. of it is paid within the financial year, 4.5 per cent. in the following March and the balance of .5 per cent. when the certification of net health expenditure is completed.  Very little of the £20,000,000 is attributable to overdraft interest.</P>
    <P>The contributions to housing loan charges are paid in full in the financial year except for a small balance held back until the housing revenue accounts have been audited.  I think it is an unfair charge to make that there is delay in the payment of these loans.  It was also suggested that there was a delay in the payments of the loans to private builders.  Previously there was undoubtedly a delay, but I have endeavoured to remedy that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1579" /> I found that some of my inspectors had files on hand for two or three months without calling on the builders and when I made inquiries I was told that very often the inspectors had called on the builders but they would not be there at the time, so the houses could not be inspected.  I have changed that system.  From now on each applicant for a loan or grant will be notified in advance by postcard of a forthcoming visit of an inspector; he will be notified of the date on which the inspector will call.  That should ensure that the builder or applicant will be present so there should be no further difficulty or delay in that matter.</P>
    <P>Deputies Tully and Ormonde referred to rural water supplies and I must say that I am in full agreement with them. I have actually caused a circular letter to be sent out to all rural sanitary authorities asking them to expedite the progress being made in the supply of water to rural districts and offering to pay loans, particularly for the supply of water by electricity.  Now, the Minister for Agriculture has intimated that he is prepared to pay a grant of 50 per cent. up to a maximum of £100 for the installation of water pumps electrically worked.  I do not think the Minister for Agriculture encourages the hand pump.  Certain authorities disagree with them and I agree that there should be no necessity for them in future when there is such a very fine grant available.  I should like to say again that I am in agreement with Deputies Tully and Ormonde that farmers and rural dwellers generally should take advantage of these schemes.</P>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe referred to flat dwellings in the centre of the city here and to the necessity for increased density of flat dwellings.  One would imagine from what he said that my Department was holding up some scheme of the Dublin Corporation.  Not one solitary project has been put forward by the Dublin Corporation to me for sanction in connection with the erection of flats in the central city area.  I am in full agreement with him, and, when schemes are submitted to me by the new corporation, they will receive our <Col N="1580" /> careful attention and will be dealt with as expeditiously as possible.</P>
    <P>Both Deputy Briscoe and the Lord Mayor, Deputy Byrne, spoke about the compilation of the register and about notes or cards being sent to electors informing them of their number and place of voting.  This matter was debated here on the Local Government Estimate last year and at that time it was suggested that a card should be sent out immediately after the appropriate date, 15th September, asking each elector if he had ensured that he would be on the register.  That would be a most difficult thing because the relevant dates 15th September and 15th November, the last date by which they may make application&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg your pardon&mdash; 20th December.  There is very little time between 15th September and that date, and I am informed by the returning officers that they have difficulty enough in compiling the voters lists without sending out cards.  Remember that it is very difficult to arouse enthusiasm in voters, unless there is an election in the offing, and I am afraid that most of these cards would be committed to the wastepaper basket.</P>
      <P>With regard to notifying voters prior to a local election of the place at which they may vote and their number, I am afraid that would require legislation, but I am endeavouring to ensure by all the means that I possibly can that there will be brought to the notice of electors the place at which they vote and their number.  I have sent out circulars to all local authorities, particularly in Dublin and Cork, informing them that posters must be put up outside every public building, and, if they are pulled down, they must be replaced.  I have also, through the good offices of the Press, endeavoured to bring to the notice of the public their responsibilities and their duty to vote, and I have endeavoured to inform them as to where they may seek the information they request&mdash;their numbers and, their polling stations.  Further than that I cannot go without legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1581" /> Deputies Giles and Tully referred to the cul-de-sac roads.  As I have said, I have given increased grants this year for county roads.  These Deputies referred to the county roads of Meath and the position is that Meath has got £30,000 this year for county roads. Meath may take over these cul-de-sac roads and have them declared county roads, and then deal with them with their additional allocation for county roads.  As a matter of fact, that is the first thing that is done&mdash;these roads are declared county roads&mdash;but I would advise them to be very slow indeed about taking over too many of them, until they get their own county roads up to a certain standard.</P>
    <P>Deputy Giles also referred to the dangerous bridge at Enfield on the main Dublin-Galway road and spoke about the Government's failure to do anything about it.  I am very glad to inform him that a grant has been allocated for this bridge and plans have been approved.  I hope that work will go on very shortly.  The matter rests now with the Meath County Council.</P>
    <P>The same Deputies also referred to a number of bridges in Meath which were damaged in the recent floods. As I said, I think, in reply to a parliamentary question some time ago, I would have no objection to certain projects such as this being undertaken out of the allocation made under the Local Authorities (Works) Act, and if a proposition is put forward for a particular bridge, by all means, we will consider it and it certainly will not be ruled out without serious thought.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sheldon referred to the different methods of doing road maintenance. It would be a very good thing if we had a standard, but nobody will appreciate better than Deputies how difficult it would be to procure a standard for all Ireland.  One can readily realise that a standard which suits the bog roads of West Cork or West Donegal, or anywhere in the West of Ireland, would not be in any way suitable for the Midland Counties. It is impossible.  We would like to have adjoining counties agreeing on some standard, but that is a matter for themselves.  I cannot very well dictate to them nor do I wish to do so.  I hope <Col N="1582" /> that when I have finished in the office of Minister for Local Government, we will be here merely in an advisory capacity and not as dictators to local authorities.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley suggested that all the roads of the country should be made of concrete.  Expert opinion disagrees. There are certain roads in the cities where concrete might be very useful, but where you have a bog foundation, it is impossible to use concrete, except by way of a reinforced concrete raft, which is very expensive. I think the tarmacadam road is quite satisfactory.  We have, had experience in a neighbouring county, County Meath, of an experiment in cement on the road between here and Slane.  I think it was not a great success.  We saw it torn up the other day and the road redone in tarmacadam.</P>
    <P>I think I have dealt with the points raised by the various.  Deputies, with one exception&mdash;a Deputy from my own county, Deputy Blaney.  In opening my remarks, I thanked Deputy Childers, who spoke for the Opposition, and the other Deputies for the manner in which they had received the Estimate.  The only attack&mdash;and I think it was a personal attack&mdash;made on me was made by Deputy Blaney.  He referred to my policy of allocating more moneys for county roads than had been allocated in the past and he instanced three projects in Donegal which he said were major main road projects.  He instanced three particular projects in Donegal which, he said, were major projects that should not have been carried out.  He referred to them by name. One was at a place called Mullinagung. This is costing, approximately, £700. Another project was at Liscooley, on the Lifford-Ballybofey road, which is costing, approximately, £6,000, and the third was on the Milford-Letterkenny road at a cost of £4,000.</P>
    <P>Deputy Blaney said that these jobs should not have been undertaken.  May I say that one of them was actually sanctioned prior to my taking officer? The other two have been sanctioned in my time because they were based on a prior plan, and because the public transport companies refused to put on these particular routes a standard bus <Col N="1583" /> They have been putting on sub-standard buses.  The Gardaí and the bus companies have been pressing my Department for years to straighten out this road so as to give them an opportunity of putting a standard bus on it.  I make no apology to anyone for the expenditure of this money.  I think it is a very good thing, and I make no apology to the people of Milford for giving them a road which will enable them to have facilities that others enjoy as regards a standard bus transport in the locality.  I say the same in regard to the people of Liscooley and of Kilmacrennan.  I think the people have a right to these facilities.</P>
    <P>Deputy Blaney likes to make charges against me when I am not present.  He accused me, the other day, of switching a sum of £15,000 from his constituency to my own parish.  He has made that accusation from many platforms. That money was switched, but it was switched by my predecessor.  Deputy Blaney, as a member of the Donegal County Council, knew all about that switch.  He also had the opportunity of putting down a parliamentary question in this House, and of asking me who switched the money when it was switched.  He had an opportunity of raising the matter at the Donegal County Council but he did not do so. He waited until the eve of the local elections to make the accusation outside a church in his own constituency. If Deputy Blaney was fair to his own people he would have objected to that switch being made and would have raised the matter in the council chamber or in this House.  Why did he let the money go without making some protest?  That is something that I would like to know.</P>
    <P>However, I only want to put the facts before the people.  I do not want to gain any political kudos from this, but I think that, in fairness to my predecessor, I should say that the reasons why he made the switch were very good reasons.  I say that in fairness to him.  I am not saying that I would have made it, but I do want to say that the reasons which compelled him to make the switch were, in my <Col N="1584" /> opinion, very strong reasons.  I certainly am not going to take the credit or discredit for what was done.  I, naturally, am always glad to see grants. coming into my own constituency, but I had nothing whatever to do with this, and I am sure the people of East Donegal will appreciate that.</P>
    <P>I do not think I have anything further to say, except to thank the House and particularly Deputy Childers, as the spokesman of the Party opposite, for the manner in which the Estimate was received.  I appreciate very much the many constructive suggestions which were made, all of which I may say will be very carefully examined.</P>

It is agreed by everyone that a great deal of their time is involved in dealing with traffic offences, and I was anxious to know whether anything has been done to bring the present position up to date. Many anomalies have been brought to light such as the matter of serving summonses.

He finds that when election day comes round his name is not on the register although it has been on the register for perhaps ten years.  He has been living at the new address for a considerable time, but through, perhaps, some error that occurred when the register was being printed this man finds that his name is not on the register at the time when he wants it, namely, in the year when there is an election.

    <P>That a sum not exceeding £4,742,830 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1956, for the Defence Forces (including certain Grants-in-Aid) under the Defence Act, 1954 (No. 18 <Col N="1587" /> of 1954), and for certain administrative expenses in connection therewith; for certain expenses under the Offences against the State Acts, 1939 and 1940 (No. 13 of 1939 and No. 2 of 1940) and the Air-raid Precautions Acts, 1939 and 1946 (No. 21 of 1939 and No. 28 of 1946); for expenses in connection with the issue of medals, etc.; for expenses of the Bureau of Military History; and for a Grant-in-Aid of the Irish Red Cross Society (No. 32 of 1938).</P>
    <P>In introducing this Estimate I should, perhaps, remind Deputies that a token Supplementary Estimate of £10 was taken in respect of the last financial year after the Book of Estimates for 1955-56 had been issued.  That Supplementary Estimate made increased provisions for 1954-55 under certain sub-heads to which I shall refer in the course of my statement on the present Estimate.</P>
    <P>The gross Estimate for 1955-56 is £7,319,600 and the net Estimate, after deducting Appropriations-in-Aid, is £7,114,230.  This represents a decrease of £1,153,080 on the net Estimate for 1954-55, including the Supplementary Estimate to which I have referred.  In making that comparison, however, it is well to remember that the previous Minister for Finance in his Budget Statement for 1954-55 indicated that it had been decided that expenditure on defensive equipment under sub-head P last year would be reduced by £800,000.</P>
    <P>The major portion of the Estimate is accounted for by provision for the pay, allowances and maintenance of the Permanent Defence Force.  This provision is spread over a number of sub-heads and totals, in round figures, £4,000,000, or about 55 per cent. of the entire gross Estimate.  As in previous years the Estimate is framed on, the basis of the full peace establishment, which is 1,273 officers and 11,542 other ranks.  Deductions are made in the relevant sub-heads in respect of the numbers by which the actual strength is likely to be below establishments during the year.  The net effective provision caters for an average strength of 1,193 officers and 8,000 other <Col N="1588" /> ranks.  Twenty-two cadets are to be commissioned during the year; a further 39 are in training, and 46 are to be recruited.</P>
    <P>I should, perhaps, dwell a while on this matter of strengths.  The figure of 8,000 non-commissioned officers, privates and seamen for which this Estimate in effect makes provision is not an arbitrary limit set by the Government or myself but it represents, on the best estimate I can make, what the average strength is likely to be for the year.  The strength of other ranks on the 31st May last was 8,347.  Normal wastage takes a considerable toll each year which is difficult to replace. A recruiting drive was launched towards the end of February, but I am bound to say, however, that the response has not been satisfactory.  I would like to appeal through the House to our young men to come forward and offer their services.  In doing so, they will have the satisfaction of knowing that they are serving their country in the honourable profession of arms and at the same time they will enjoy remunerative employment under satisfactory conditions.  I intend to continue the effort to get an adequate flow of recruits, and further recruiting drives will be arranged during the year.</P>
    <P>Increased, provision, has been made for the Reserve Defence Force this year&mdash;£412,802, against £378,069 last year (including £43,050 taken in the Supplementary Estimate).  There is, therefore, an increase of nearly £35,000. This arises mainly on account of the F.C.A. which is showing a welcome tendency to increase its effective strength and to report in greater numbers for training.  The strength of the Reserve of Men (First Line) has also increased by almost 1,000, which is corollary to, and some compensation for, the decline in the strength of the Permanent Defence Force.  On the other hand, there is a slight reduction in the number of Reserve Officers (First Line).</P>
    <P>I may next refer to sub-head P&mdash; Defensive Equipment&mdash;which is the largest individual sub-head after Pay. This sub-head shows a nominal reduction of £1,000,000 as compared with the <Col N="1589" /> corresponding provision last year.  I say &ldquo;nominal&rdquo; because, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, last year's provision had, in effect, been reduced by £800,000 before the present Government took office, so that the real reduction is £200,000.  The sum being provided this year&mdash;£800,000&mdash; while not as large as in the past few years, is nevertheless a substantial one. In estimating for this sub-head, I had regard to the heavy outlay on defensive equipment each year since 1951-52&mdash; some £4,500,000 all told.  Substantial quantities of new weapons have been procured or are on order and much has been done towards re-equipping our Army with modern basic weapons.</P>
    <P>A stage has been reached where we cannot close our eyes to the startling progress being made by the Great Powers in the development of nuclear weapons, guided missiles and other super-scientific instruments of destruction. It is too soon to say how armies, great and small, will adjust themselves to this situation but it is evident that military technique and strategy will undergo considerable changes in the coming years.  As far as our Army is concerned, it does not seem likely that our man-power and economic and scientific resources would be adequate to sustain the employment of these enormously costly weapons even if we were willing, and it was open to us, to procure them.  Nevertheless, it would seem wise to adopt a cautious attitude towards the purchase of conventional weapons of the heavier and less mobile types.  This is a situation which is receiving the constant attention of the General Staff.</P>
    <P>It is hardly necessary for me to refer to all the sub-heads of the Estimate, but I will comment briefly on those which show appreciable variations from last year's provisions.</P>
    <P>The reduction of £99,436 in sub-head A&mdash;Pay&mdash;is due entirely to the lesser net number of non-commissioned officers and privates being provided for.  The provision for officers, however, is increased by £21,369 due mainly to incremental increases in pay. The increase of £3,000 in sub-head A (1) &mdash;Military Educational Courses Abroad &mdash;is due to increased fees and charges <Col N="1590" /> for these courses.  Sub-head B&mdash; Marriage Allowance&mdash;shows an increase of £18,000 as an increased number of personnel is expected to qualify for this allowance during the year.</P>
    <P>Allowing for the Supplementary Estimate of £69,370 last year under sub-head C&mdash;Pay of Civilians Attached to Units&mdash;this sub-head shows a reduction of £38,019.  This reduction arises mainly under engineer services&mdash;tradesmen helpers, etc. as certain fairly large works which were begun last year will be completed this year.  The Supplementary Estimate also increased sub-head G&mdash;Subsistence and Other Allowances&mdash;by £9,880 to cover the payment last year of increased allowances, with arrears from April, 1952.  There is, therefore, a reduction of £11,033 in this sub-head.</P>
    <P>The reduction of £15,520 in sub-head J&mdash;Mechanical Transport&mdash;arises almost entirely on the purchase of vehicles.  Appreciable numbers of new vehicles have been purchased in recent years and it is felt that expenditure this year can be reduced without seriously interfering with the efficiency of this service.  The saving on vehicles is partly offset, however, by an increase of £5,000 in the provision for road tax to meet anticipated expenditure. The rather substantial reduction of £111,809 in sub-head K&mdash;Provisions and Allowances in Lieu&mdash;is due to two causes; firstly, the lesser net number of men being catered for, and, secondly, a reduction in the daily cost of the Army ration and in allowances in lieu.  The reduction of £48,249 in sub-head M&mdash;Clothing and Equipment &mdash;is due partly to the lesser net number of men for which provision is made, and partly to the omission of provision for reserve stock on grounds of economy.</P>
    <P>The increase of £27,835 in sub-head O&mdash;General Stores&mdash;is due almost entirely to the purchase of aircraft and to increased provision for aircraft maintenance.  This year it is proposed to initiate purchase action in respect of three jet trainer aircraft, delivery of which will not be taken until next year. The Estimate, therefore, provides only for an advance payment on these aircraft. <Col N="1591" /> Provision is also included for the completion of purchase of four piston engined trainer aircraft, the order for which was placed last year for delivery in the present financial year.</P>
    <P>The gross Estimate for civil defence as shown in sub-head P (1) is £61,451. As it is anticipated that all the equipment to be ordered may not be delivered within the year, a deduction of £20,000 has been made, leaving the net provision at £41,451.  This is a reduction of £21,207 on the corresponding figure for last year and represents the total amount which, it is believed, can usefully be spent during the financial year, having regard to the present stage of developments.  The principal items of equipment provided for are six rescue training sets and 11 rescue vehicles.  The training sets were included in last year's Vote but were not completed during the year owing to problems of siting and technical supervision.  Most of the equipment required for the initial stages of local training and which had been provided for in previous years' Estimates has now been purchased.  This equipment will be issued to local authorities within the next couple of months, and it is hoped to make a beginning with civil defence training throughout the country towards the end of the year.</P>
    <P>Training is continuing at the Civil Defence School.  During the year, I intend to review and examine afresh the whole problem of civil defence, especially in the light of developments in nuclear weapons to which I alluded earlier.</P>
    <P>In sub-head P (2)&mdash;Naval Service&mdash; there is little change as far as the pay of the personnel is concerned.  The net provision for vessels, including maintenance, stores and equipment, however, shows a reduction of £30,860.  The main capital items are a store and training ship for the transport of stores and for general training, and two seaward defence boats required for training personnel in harbour defence duties.  These items were included in last year's Estimate, but negotiations for their purchase have been unavoidably protracted.  The full cost of these <Col N="1592" /> three vessels may be of the order of £200,000, but provision has been made only for the sum likely to be required this year; in the case of stores and equipment, there is an increase of almost £6,000, mainly for the purchase of various types of essential training equipment.</P>
    <P>The increase of £16,747 in sub-head R&mdash;Fuel, Light and Water in Kind and Fuel Oils&mdash;is due mainly to the fact that reserve stocks of coal which were drawn on during the past few years are now running out, and consequently increased quantities of fuel must be purchased this year.</P>
    <P>As regards sub-head S&mdash;Barrack Maintenance and New Works&mdash;the Supplementary Estimate increased last year's provision from £179,019 to £202,759.  Consequently, the net figure for this year shows a reduction of £2,759.  Under the heading &ldquo;Miscellaneous New Works&rdquo;, it is intended to undertake a variety of works, numbering about 90 in all, most of them fairly small.  A new item is included in the sub-head this year: Kit and Rifle Racks&mdash;£3,650.  This arises from the necessity for improving the security arrangements for rifles held in billets and stores.  The provision of £1,000 as a contribution towards public road repairs relates to the road leading to the Glen of Imaal Artillery Range in County Wicklow, which is much used by Army traffic.  The rather large deduction of £89,870 in respect of work not completed during the financial year is accounted for by the fact that, due to the variety and scope of the works proposed to be initiated during the year, the necessary administrative and technical preparations may not be completed in some cases until rather late in the year; consequently, only a part of the full cost of such projects will fall to be met in the present financial year.</P>
    <P>The provision in sub-head U&mdash;Compensation&mdash;last year was increased by the Supplementary Estimate from £5,500 to £13,300, as payments were exceptionally and unexpectedly heavy. It is difficult to estimate accurately for this sub-head, but I hope that the provision of £5,500 for the present financial year will prove adequate.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1593" /> The increase of £5,418 in sub-head V &mdash; Barrack Services &mdash; is required mainly in connection with improvements in men's billets and dining halls.  The reduction of £5,506 in sub-head W&mdash;Insurance&mdash;arises solely from the lesser number of non-commissioned officers and privates being provided for.  The full reduction under this heading is partly offset, however, by slight increases on the other services covered by the sub-head.  The reduction of £16,178 in sub-head X&mdash;Incidental Expenses &mdash; arises mainly from the reduced provision for advertisements. A recruiting drive was concluded in March last, the cost of which was borne on last year's Vote.  As I indicated earlier in my statement, the effort to obtain a satisfactory flow of recruits will be continued during the year.</P>
    <P>Sub-head X (3)&mdash;Grant-in-Aid of the Irish Red Cross Society&mdash;is increased by £8,100 to help to defray the expected expenses of the society during the year.  I think it is fitting that I should take this opportunity of expressing my warm appreciation of the society's activities and, in particular, the part it played in the relief of flood distress last winter.  I am sure the House joins me in this expression of gratitude.</P>
    <P>As regards sub-head Y (3)&mdash;the Reserve Defence Force&mdash;An Fórsa Cosanta Aitiúil and An Slua Muiri (Grants-in-Aid), there is a reduction of £1,000, when account is taken of the increased provision made by the Supplementary Estimate last year.  The system of assessing the grants in the case of the F.C.A. was changed last year from a <i>per capita</i> to a battalion basis, and the results appear to have fully justified the change.</P>
    <P>The increase of £7,697 in sub-head Y (4)&mdash;Bureau of Military History: Salaries, Wages and Allowances&mdash;is due to the employment of additional staff and increased activity in field work.  The object is to speed up the bureau's work and bring it to a conclusion as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Appropriations-in-Aid are estimated to yield an additional sum of £28,898. This is mainly due to the sale of surplus <Col N="1594" /> land necessarily acquired a few years ago in connection with the construction of concrete runways at Baldonnel Aerodrome.</P>
    <P>That concludes my survey of the Estimates for Defence.  I am well satisfied with the discipline and morale of the Defence Forces and I am happy to recall the splendid efforts made by all ranks to aid the victims of the floods last winter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration.</P>
      <P>To the uninitiated, this particular Estimate would present a certain amount of complexity by reason of what would appear to be a number of contradictory statements.  For instance, in sub-head A we have a decrease of £99,436. That amount would normally represent, I think, something like 500 men.  If we get down to examining that particular sub-head in detail, however, we find on reference to page 326 of the Book of Estimates that in fact there is an increase in the pay of officers to the extent of £21,300 and then looking further into it we find the rather startling figure of a decrease in respect to the pay of other ranks of £120,700. That is a very large decrease in expenditure in respect to men.  It probably represents a reduction of between 600 and 700 men.  That is what we appear to be estimating for.</P>
      <P>To my mind, that can suggest only one thing and that is that the policy of the Coalition Government from 1948 to 1951 is being continued.  I think that is a pity.  I think it is a pity from the point of view of the Army.  I think it is a pity from the point of view of the public.  However, we will deal with that later on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we look at sub-head B, we find there is an increase of £18,000 in relation to marriage allowances. Normally one would imagine that that increase of £18,000 was caused by increased personnel and that possibly is the point to which I was referring when I talked about the kind of paradox that exists in this Estimate. In a decreasing Estimate, such as we have here, it is had to reconcile an <Col N="1595" /> increase in the marriage allowance with the fact that we are providing for a considerable decrease in relation to the pay of N.C.O.s and men.  However, I suppose this is due in the main either to increasing families or to the fact that more of the existing personnel are being admitted to the marriage establishment.</P>
    <P>Sub-heads G and K both show a decrease; it is small in the case of sub-head G but rather large in the case of sub-head K.  The point is that that denotes preparations for what would appear to be a reduced Army.  Sub-head M, clothing and equipment, shows another decrease of nearly £50,000. That still further emphasises the point that we are in fact in this Estimate catering for a greatly reduced Army.</P>
    <P>Sub-head P, a very important sub-head, deals with defensive equipment. I think the figure there is somewhat misleading.  The Minister referred to the fact that last year the Minister for Finance in the last Government had that sum of £1,800,000 reduced by £800,000; perhaps the Minister will explain why that is being brought in again in this year's Estimate.  I think the £1,000,000 was all that it was necessary to show in this case.  It was explained in detail by the then Minister for Finance last year that the £800,000 which was taken out would have been sufficient to have cleared the issue and, therefore, it was necessary only to show the figure of £1,000,000 or the £800,000 which is being shown in this particular Book of Estimates.</P>
    <P>The only thing I would like to emphasise in relation to that particular sub-head, is that I sincerely hope that the Minister will make every effort to use that £800,000 for the purchase of the equipment which our Army authorities are always seeking.  If we place upon the Army authorities the responsibility of providing for the safety of the State it is only fair that we should give them the equipment with which they can effectively carry out that task. In relation to the reduction made by the Fianna Fáil Government last year the then Minister for Finance, Deputy MacEntee, made a statement on the <Col N="1596" /> matter and I want to quote that statement now in order to give the present Minister support in his efforts to equip the Army properly.  The then Minister for Finance at column 553 of Volume 145 of the Official Report in the course of his Budget statement said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Government have, therefore, decided that an expenditure of £1,000,000 under this head will suffice this year as against £1,800,000 for which provision was made in the Estimates.  This brings a saving of £800,000 and, on last year's precedent, we may permit ourselves some additional relief by again charging no more than £400,000 of this expenditure against current revenue.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not know in what form the Minister will get the money but he might perhaps examine what was being done then in order to bring a certain amount of relief to the people from whom the money has to be found.</P>
    <P>With regard to sub-head P (1)&mdash; Civil Defence&mdash;the Minister has made reference to that in his opening statement. There is a reduction of £21,207. Goodness knows, the sum of money made available to civil defence last year was meagre enough without reducing it still further this year.  We have one of the finest civil defence training centres.  I was present and saw some of the training carried out there by those appointed to undergo such training by the various local authorities.  I was tremendously impressed, so impressed that I was considering very seriously the question of having this training carried out in the presence of the general public with a view, first of all, to increasing the public interest in civil defence and, secondly, to showing the public what was being done on their behalf.  It is from that point of view I regret so much the meagre sum, as I have already described it, which we were making available last year being still further reduced this year.</P>
    <P>The same thing applies to sub-head P (2), which deals with the naval service. Here is a service that deserves, and should be given, all the encouragement which it is possible for the Government of this State to give.  I am not <Col N="1597" /> suggesting for a moment that the naval service could, of its own strength, defeat any attempt at invading this country but it could, at least, serve as a very useful and very necessary patrol force.  If we are serious in regard to the policy of neutrality&mdash;and I hope we are&mdash;the least that would be expected from a nation with a coastline such as we possess would be that we would be capable of patrolling that coastline and ensuring that it would not in any way be used to the detriment of other countries.  Apart from its use as a service or adjunct of the Defence Forces, it provides the means by which men can be trained to a very high degree in the work which a seaman does.</P>
    <P>If we are serious about the building up of our mercantile marine&mdash;and I believe we are&mdash;then this could be the source from which perhaps the most experienced men could be secured men not only experienced but well disciplined. From that point of view again, I say it is regrettable that this particular sub-head P (2) is showing a further decrease.  Coming near to the time when I vacated that office, I had sanctioned the purchase of some further vessels to strengthen our naval service and I would like the Minister, when he is replying, to let the House know if that was proceeded with, if the effort to secure these vessels was continued and, if so, with what success.</P>
    <P>I note here under sub-head S, an increase of £20,981, the total for that sub-head being £200,000.  Then, if we look back at sub-head C, we will find an increase of £31,351, the total for the sub-head being £713,519.  If these two totals are added together they give the formidable figure of £913,519.  Most of that large sum is being paid in wages to men who are employed in the Corps of Engineers, I take it, and then the amounts for the maintenance and repair and reconstruction of barracks would not be very much.  But I would like to refer to an extract from the Minister's speech which will be found in Volume 146, No. 3, of the Dáil Debates, in which he referred to the fact that &ldquo;most of the military barracks are old and quite unsuitable by modern standards.  Much of the accommodation <Col N="1598" /> is in the poorest condition and hopelessly uneconomic to maintain. An effort is being made to provide suitable living accommodation and amenities for personnel and to provide additional storage and other accommodation.&rdquo; I presume that that is the type of work which this sum of money covers.  I should be glad to know from the Minister if the items in the sum which he himself referred to on one occasion and which we discussed at a later period in this House, a sum of £117,000, are included in the sum which is covered by this Estimate.</P>
    <P>Sub-head Y (4) deals with the Bureau of Military History and I would be very glad to know from the Minister if the bureau is carrying on as successfully at present as it was in the past. It is carrying out very useful and very important services, providing authentic stories of the period covered by the fight for our independence, and from that point of view it is of considerable importance.  It was with regret that I learned recently that one of the members of that organisation, a man who had been with it, I think almost since its beginning, had his services dispensed with on the grounds of age.</P>
    <P>We all know the individual and we know that physically he is a man who could carry on energetically for quite a long number of years.  We also know that in regard to the particular work on which he was engaged, he was enthusiastic, and it is because of that enthusiasm that I think it was a mistake on the part of the Minister to allow this man's services to be relinquished because I think he was carrying out very useful work.  All I hope is that the work will be carried out in his absence as successfully as he was carrying it out, and that in the future where there may be other men of that type, that we might strain a point to retain their services, especially in the cases of men who are not at present or have not been in the past, civil servants.  I do not think it is asking too much of the Minister to see that the Bureau of Military History carries its work to completion as successfully as it is possible for him to ensure.</P>
    <P>Referring to the sort of contradictions we come across in the Book of <Col N="1599" /> Estimates, we see under sub-head Z, that is (16) of the Appropriations-in-Aid, we come across a figure for receipts for fuel, light, and water and barrack services which has increased over £7,400.  I move to report progress.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Before this Bill passes, I think it is right that we should consider exactly what this Bill is doing and what the position will be when it becomes law.  The rates of taxes which this Bill either directly confirms or indirectly confirms are the rates of taxes which were introduced in the Budget of 1952.  The standard rate of income-tax remains the same. The other principal rates of taxes, such as those on tobacco, on whiskey&mdash; spirits, on beer, on petrol, all remain the same and the burden of taxation imposed by these rates is by millions greater, that is, millions more are being extracted from the community than were being extracted through the Budget of 1952 or the Finance Act of 1952.  The rates are the same.  The burden so far as the extraction of money to produce revenue is concerned is greater by millions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If you take, for instance, the yield in 1952 shown at the end of the year, the yield is some £13,000,000 less than the amount that is expected to come in as the result of the taxes, the general duties, that are sanctioned by this Bill.  Yet, when these taxes were being introduced it was said that they were cruel, that they were unjust, that they were savage, that the imposition of them was butchery of the taxpayer. We were told that there was no authority and no justification for the imposition of them.  We were told that the policy that dictated them, the general Budget policy, was a policy of taking from the public money that was needed for consumption, that we envied them their happy state, that we grudged them the eating and drinking that they had and the good times that they had; that our policy at that time was dictated in a spirit of revenge, that the aim of our Government policy was to use up the money of the community, to take it up in taxation and deprive them of the power to use it otherwise, that we were taking away what would have been savings and that, by doing that, we were preventing capital development, that the aim of our policy was to maintain the existing level of external investments, that there was no justification for it, that it was not needed, that we were <Col N="1601" /> taxing to the amount of £10,000,000 more than was required.</P>
    <P>We pointed out that there was a £15,000,000 deficit between expected revenue and expected expenditure and that to fill that gap it was necessary, on the one hand, to try to reduce expenditure and, on the other hand, to bring in more revenue.</P>
    <P>The present Minister has no such excuse.  His anticipated revenue was considerably in excess of the expenditure of last year but he is looking for millions more and he is imposing the same rates of taxation.  If they were unjust, cruel, savage and all the rest of it, as described in the lurid language of the present principal members of the Government, why are they not cruel and savage and unjust and unnecessary to-day?</P>
    <P>I have asked during the progress of the debate on the Budget and since: &ldquo;What about the £10,000,000 that was supposed to be there in concealed taxation?&rdquo;  It was, of course, proved to be a myth the very moment it was first mentioned but it was too good a thing to put aside and it was persisted in, persisted in up to the very present time although it was proved to be absurd at the start, and it was proved definitely to be wrong when the accounts of the finances of the year 1952 were completed and it was found that, instead of taxing for a £10,000,000 surplus, there was an actual deficit&mdash;I think it is of some £2,000,000.</P>
    <P>Where is that £10,000,000?  Why is not it brought out now to relieve the taxpayer?  It is not there, of course, and this Bill goes further to prove that it is not there.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, in answer to some question from this side, suggested that there was increased expenditure. He did not say that there was more than increased revenue to meet it.  If there was a surplus of £10,000,000 lying about in 1952, that should be there and something to the good at the present time.  Why has it not been brought out?  Because, of course, it is not there and it is proved to be a falsehood, a damnable falsehood, because on it was based the whole campaign throughout the country <Col N="1602" /> to mislead the people.  We asked, naturally, why we should engage in this policy of revenge, as it was called, and why we should be guilty of these things?  It was said that we loved the lash of taxation and that we did not like alleviating the conditions of our people.</P>
    <P>Of course, the very mention of that should be enough to show any thinking person the nature of the whole campaign which was, unfortunately, successfully indulged in.  Why should any Government or any Party, depending on the votes of the people, set out to make themselves unpopular?  We set out to do a certain task which we knew was likely to make us unpopular but we had the courage to face that task.  Then, because we had the courage and because it was being recognised that we had the courage to do it, we were told that our policy was a mixture of courage and stupidity which was the very essence of tyranny.  We had no authority or justification.  It was tyranny to impose these taxes.</P>
    <P>If there was no justification for them then, what is the justification now? The only justification put forward is that the Budget must be balanced; that current expenditure has to be balanced by current revenue.  When we said that we were told we were reducing the Government to being menial bookkeepers.  The present Government become menial bookkeepers because they do the decent thing for once and try to balance the Budget.  We did it when we knew the doing of it was unpopular.  The present Government are doing it when there is no unpopularity to be incurred by the doing of it.  The only unpopularity is the unpopularity that will come when people who have been fooled by the pretences of the last three years wake up and learn how every weakness of the democratic system and every weakness of human nature has been skilfully worked upon.</P>
    <P>The Ministers on the other side&mdash; those who got there&mdash;can now cynically lie back and say: &ldquo;We have got where we wanted.  It does not matter about the means by which we got there.  We can afford to tell the truth now.  We can afford to be honest now.  But we <Col N="1603" /> were not telling the truth and we were not honest during the past three years when everything that it was possible to do by clever advocacy, by clever playing upon the weaknesses of democracy was done to misrepresent the Government that was doing its duty by the people in setting the finances in proper order.&rdquo;  They are, thank God, in proper order even though those people who took advantage of it knew that to put them in order was in the national interest. It is for that reason that we did not oppose the Budget.</P>
    <P>We were told, first of all, that there was no deficit, and next that there were some millions of pounds left behind to meet any possible deficit. Even in this debate recently we have that thing dragged in again&mdash;the amount that was left in the Grant Counterpart Fund account.  Of course, one is simply the product of what in all respects is an external loan and we would have been no more justified in using that money to meet current expenditure than we would be in borrowing from the people by way of a national loan and using that money for current expenditure.  That was money that should not be used to balance the Budget.  Unfortunately, a portion of it had to be used to meet the deficit of the previous year, something like £5,000,000.  A portion of it had to be used for that but the whole of the money that was left to us had to meet the ordinary capital commitments of the State.</P>
    <P>The present Government could not, for instance, let the E.S.B., Bord na Móna, the Post Office or any of these services go without the capital that was required.  Capital was required to meet that deficit.  Capital was required to meet the voted capital services. Capital was required to meet the &ldquo;below the line&rdquo; services and it was for these purposes that the money which was left behind was used.  It was used for precisely the same purposes that the first Coalition had used it.  They had used it at the rate of £1,000,000 a month for these purposes.</P>
    <P>Before we got into office over £18,000,000 of it had been so used.  We had to use it for the same purpose.  It <Col N="1604" /> is suggested that these commitments did not exist.  Of course, they did exist.  Our Minister for Finance detailed them and showed that, whereas at the time of the Budget there was some £24,000,000 in that fund, the commitments that had to be met amounted to over £26,000,000.  As I said, it was being used up at the rate of £1,000,000 a month by the Coalition. Not merely was the sum of £24,000,000 being used up&mdash;I think it was about £24,500,000&mdash;at the time of the Budget but by the time we got into office another £2,000,000 had been spent.  The sum we inherited when we came into office in June was roughly about £22,500,000 but that £22,500,000 had to meet the expenditure I indicated.</P>
    <P>In any case it has nothing to do with the balancing of the Budget.  Talking about that, and this is germane, I should like to hear from the Minister for Finance how he proposes to provide for the £34,000,000 capital expenditure that is envisaged in the coming year.</P>
    <P>We had to face that and the former Minister for Finance in the Coalition Government envisaged that not merely were we using it ourselves in accordance with the method that had been used but he envisaged the possible use of it.  It is suggested&mdash;as it is always suggested&mdash;in that connection that we should have gone for a loan.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I interrupted in answer to a question.  I said £15,000,000 <Col N="1605" /> because it was the answer to everything that was put up.  Questions were being asked why this and why that. The answer to it was that there was a gap of £15,000,000.  I say there was a conversion operation involving a sum of £21,000,000, the biggest in the history of the State.  That had to be met.  There was also the fact that there were very little savings and when the results of the year's transactions were known it was proved that the savings were nil.  We had the experience of Dublin Corporation and Cork Corporation loans.  The Minister for Finance and the Government were right in not seeking a loan at that particular time. They had this external loan to deal with.</P>
      <P>It was right and proper that they should wait until the opportunity should appear satisfactory to get a loan.  Of course, one cannot anticipate. One does not know to any great extent what changes may occur.  We are not isolated from and cannot completely shield ourselves from outside influences.  The result is that you have changes taking place, ups and downs, and you cannot anticipate them.  What you have to do is not to gamble on the future but to take the situation as you find it.  As we found it in the year 1951, we were satisfied that it was not a time to complicate matters.  It would have been extremely foolish, and the conditions of the market were such that that was not a suitable time.  However, that is a different issue.  That is on the question of capital.  As far as the balancing of the Budget was concerned, there was then £10,000,000 which that could not in any way affect.  As I have said, unfortunately we had to use £5,000,000 of it before the year was out in order to meet the deficit which was left from the previous Budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now these taxes are to be imposed. Is the aim of the policy that is imposing them to butcher the people, to butcher the taxpayer?  Is the aim of the policy to keep our sterling investments at their present level?  These were not, of course, the aims of our Government at all.  We have always believed that our external assets were of importance to the country and that <Col N="1606" /> they should not be dissipated for consumption purposes.  We believed that they were extremely valuable to us in order that, if there was a deficit in our balance of payments, they could be used to obtain for us the necessary capital goods, that if there was a question of the development of productive enterprises here they should be, if necessary, available.</P>
    <P>There was no suggestion that we regarded these assets with some sort of extraordinary reverence.  There was nothing of the &ldquo;sacred cow&rdquo; about them to which we were bowing down. That was a phrase that was used by the Taoiseach when he was in opposition, that we were sacrificing profitable Irish enterprises to the &ldquo;sacred cow of sterling&rdquo;.  We were told that the British were well able to look after their sterling themselves and that we did not have any need to be minding this.  Our interest at that time as far as that was concerned was in the balance of payments where there was some £62,000,000 of a deficit which would have exhausted these external assets in a couple of years.  We were interested in that, not in the question as to what they were doing in Britain. Of course, it was a splendid basis for a campaign of misrepresentation.  It will stand in history as one of the most successful of the campaigns that play upon people who do not either attend carefully to the meaning of these phrases, who take them at their surface value, take the twist that is put upon them by wily advocates who are out to mislead them and not to give them the truth.</P>
    <P>This Bill then puts a seal upon the policy of the present Government in maintaining the taxes that were introduced in the Budget of 1952.  The amendments that were put down here were brought in in order to make those who are responsible take immediate responsibility for maintaining those taxes at that level and for the burden of taxation deliberately imposed by the present Government.  If we were asked why it is imposed I would say it is imposed because it is necessary.  I would repeat what I have said: It is necessary in order to meet current expenditure by current revenue, and <Col N="1607" /> that is the reason why these taxes were imposed.</P>
    <P>It was said of them that they were stupid taxes, that more money would be got with lower rates of taxation. Why is that not being tried?  Have these people come along and finally admitted that the rates of taxation which are there are the rates which are going to give them the best value? If they are not, they are not doing the right thing as guardians of the public finance.  If there are ways in which they can get with lighter taxation more revenue, it is their duty to bring in those new rates.  When they were in opposition they talked glibly about how it could be done, of all the damage that was being done by having a rate which was higher and was bringing in less than a smaller rate would produce. We heard of unemployment in distilleries, breweries, the damage that was done to the publicans and the unemployment that it was causing.  We have heard very little about these things from those who are imposing the taxes to-day.  We must accept&mdash;if they deny it they will have proved themselves to be doing something which is wrong&mdash;that they think that these rates of taxation are those which are going to be the most productive, that they are the lowest rates at which they will get the revenue which is required.  I have just said these few words because I think it is only right that before this Bill is finally passed we should see what exactly is being done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>This I have learned from the ex-Taoiseach, that the passing of the present Budget sets a seal on the taxation that was imposed in 1952 by the Fianna Fáil Government in their Budget of that year.  May I suggest this to the ex-Taoiseach as an analogy, that when the liberating forces of Britain and America reached the Continent of Europe some few years ago and freed the people, a year later, one might still have accused them of carrying on the oppression that was started by the Nazi conquerors in the places they had overrun. It is the same thing.  You cannot <Col N="1608" /> get rid of catastrophies easily.  I said long ago that a fool could start a forest fire in five seconds but it might take a year to get rid of the effects of that destruction.</P>
      <P>Deputy de Valera went to some pains to explain the Budget of 1952 and the deficit in the year 1951.  For the first time I have found this accusation levelled against myself and my colleagues in the Coalition Government that we unbalanced the Budget of 1952. I thought the charge up to date was that I had left an unbalance in 1951. Let us carry on with the 1951 position. Three million pounds of the alleged deficit in 1951 was the mouldering stuff we used to describe as turf which was placed in two big avenues in the Park. Deputy Lemass had said when that matter was talked about: &ldquo;If you add that to the national debt you have got out better than any other country has during the war.&rdquo;  For propaganda purposes it was put around as being a deficit on the 1951 Budget; then it landed safely in the national debt where Deputy Lemass said it should land and where he said it was perfectly entitled to land.</P>
      <P>Another part of that was the £1,000,000 that Deputy MacEntee, the next year, tried to claw back from C.I.E.  But there was the £4,000,000 out of a sum of £5,000,000 made up of two items which did not continue the next year&mdash;the next year about which the ex-Taoiseach talks of a £15,000,000 deficit.  How was that accumulated? For what proposals?  They were not going to be able to get £3,000,000 for the turf that had mouldered in the Park because it had disappeared into the national debt.  It had been sold. The C.I.E. matter was not a recurring debt over the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>And now we come to the £15,000,000. Of course, if the ex-Taoiseach, Deputy de Valera, could only get back in history to the 2nd April, 1952, he might have written the speech of the then Minister for Finance, Deputy MacEntee, of which I am sure he approved, in different terms to those in which it was actually written.  What was said that day is reported in columns 1137 and 1138 of the Dáil Debates.  It shows the philosophy of <Col N="1609" /> The Government at that time.  At the bottom of column 1137 this phrase occurs in the speech of the Minister for Finance, Deputy MacEntee:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;At the same time it has become clear that in existing conditions the subsidies cannot achieve the purpose for which they were introduced.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And here follows the pivot phrase:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In agriculture and industry earnings have advanced since 1938 by more than the cost of living.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And in column 1138, about a quarter way down the page, is given the whole reason for the Budget of 1952:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Government have given careful thought to this problem over recent months.  They are satisfied that, as incomes generally have already advanced more than the cost of living and as essential foodstuffs are no longer scarce, there is now no economic or social justification for a policy of subsidising food for everybody.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was said and advanced by the people now in opposition.  The Government had given careful consideration to this matter prior to the 2nd April, 1952.  I presume they had because the Minister for Finance was allowed to say that they had.  Of course they had given consideration to it; this was no snap division idea.  They had given careful consideration to the idea of subsidies.  What did the Government do then?  They said that incomes generally had advanced more than the cost of living and that there was, therefore, no economic or social justification for a policy of subsidising food. They said that incomes in agriculture and industry had advanced by more than the increase in the cost of living. Does Deputy de Valera remember that as being a fact?  Had incomes advanced by more than increases in the cost of living and was that a matter that had been taken into consideration and was that the reason for wiping out the subsidies?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Incomes had advanced more than the increases in the cost of living.  Was that the reason why the Government decided they would do away with the subsidies?  I want to know if that is right.  We are told now in 1955 that Deputy MacEntee was completely wrong in that and that it was a falsehood to say the Government had given any consideration to this problem.  If in fact his figures were wrong, if increases in the earnings of industry and agriculture had not advanced more than increases in the cost of living nobody has dared to say that it was a falsehood at the time.  Was that the reason why in 1952 Deputy de Valera decided that food subsidies should only partly be replaced&mdash;because incomes generally, earnings in industry and agriculture, had increased more than increases in the cost of living?  If that is the philosophy, then the people of this country who are paid for services they render in earnings, wages or salaries, must be tied to 1938 and to the 1938 standard of living.  There is not a word about productivity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Supposing labour should say that there is bigger production because of their efforts, are they not entitled to get a bigger share out of the bigger production which their efforts brought about?  The simple phrase was: &ldquo;Earnings in industry and agriculture.&rdquo; The Minister for Finance as a <Col N="1611" /> process of adjustment said he related the incomes to the increases in the cost of living and withdrawal of the food subsidies.  There was £5,000,000 or £6,000,000 left over from subsidies for flour and bread and was Deputy MacEntee's statement then not capable of being interpreted as this: &ldquo;Let me be Minister for Finance for a year or two longer.&rdquo;  Is the phrase not the same as saying: &ldquo;We are too well off.&rdquo; Was that not what the phrase meant? That was after three years of Coalition Government.  There was an advance in wages in 1948 and another increase in wages later and was Deputy MacEntee's meaning not that wages had gone beyond what the workers were entitled to get by the measurement of the index of the cost of living, and will Deputy de Valera not agree with me that I am right when I conclude that this was the policy of his Government then&mdash;to keep wages down by legislation?</P>
    <P>Will the ex-Taoiseach not agree with me that you can have a policy by Order of stabilising wages at a certain point and that you can later excuse such a policy in the manner that was done on the 2nd April, 1947, when the Budget of that year was introduced&mdash; that wages were to be regulated by the cost-of-living index of 1938?  When we went into Government Buildings in 1948 we found draft legislation in the Department of Industry and Commerce under which it was going to be made an offence for an employer to pay any higher wages than the 1947 figure unless justified by an increase in the cost of living.  That was in the Department of Industry and Commerce files.  It was to make it an offence for an employer to pay any higher wages even under threat of strike and the peremptory suggestion of the Minister for Industry and Commerce was: &ldquo;Make the penalty severe.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Come to 1952.  We were then beyond the stage where people could be coerced by standstill Orders.  Wages were not to move beyond what the increase in the cost of living demanded, and the other way of attacking that was to say: &ldquo;Your wages have gone <Col N="1612" /> higher than the increase in the cost of living demands and we will take it out of you.  We will reduce your wages, and the way we will reduce your wages is by cutting out these subsidies on flour, bread, sugar and tea.  We will make you pay more for these and then the money you have in your pockets which you got during the Coalition Government's first period will not purchase as much and we will be back again at the stage we could have reached if we had still the power and the audacity to impose standstill Orders on wages.&rdquo;  Deputy de Valera says that was necessitated.  So far as that Order is concerned, there is no touch between that and the £15,000,000 alleged deficit.</P>

      <P>There are a few lines then at the bottom of the column and we go on eight or ten lines from the top of column 1138 and we come to the reason, and the only reason given in the Budget speech of 1952, for slashing the subsidies:&mdash;</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1616" /> What is the rest of it?  Deputy de Valera is terribly afraid of the balance of payments.  He comes into the House here with a sort of throwing his hat at the balance of payments attitude.  The disruption of the economy between this country and the neighbouring island mattered nothing to him.  The only market we had was the British market and thank God it was gone for ever. Does the Deputy remember that?</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>You do not remember me saying it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>And we might as well cry for the moon as think we could get the British market back? His mentor in economics, Deputy Childers, can go down the country and say that the country has now been preserved by the fact that the British housewife will pay big prices for our beef.  According to Deputy Childers, we have to be on our knees to the British housewife who is paying big prices for all our cattle products, all our live-stock products.  Deputy de Valera can always feel: &ldquo;This young man does not know about the things I went through&mdash;he is a newcomer to politics&rdquo;, but he cannot get out of it that way.  He said the British market was gone.</P>

I understand that the new excuse is that it was propaganda, that, because we were fighting the British, and because we were nearly on our backs, we had to say that the British market was not worth anything.  Is that the excuse?  I understand that it is the new sort of excuse, but we were told that the British market was gone and gone for ever.  We were told that we had fired the first shot in that battle, and we thanked God for it, and said that the people might as well cry for the moon to be brought down here to earth as expect the British market to be brought back to us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The British market and the thought that the economy of this country might honestly&mdash;by an honest politician&mdash;be regarded as dependent on the British market was anathema and we were not national, we were completely outside the region of the patriots that face us over there&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>What we got in was bits of paper, according to you.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come on to that, in a minute, if you like.  That was during a war period, but I am talking about the &ldquo;not war&rdquo; period, when, if we sent over enough cattle, we could have got back enough goods, because the British had goods to supply us with, and they were the goods we wanted, the goods we now want and are now looking to get from them.  The other period was a closed period, but I will deal in a minute, if you like, with these pieces of paper. That was the situation, that our economy had to depend on the British market.  The new Government came in and we had a new situation.  There was the new economic future that the British market had gone for ever. That was a great prospect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then, suddenly, the Deputy in, 1952 woke up to the fact that we had a serious problem in the balance of payments. The bankers and in particular the Central Bank, wrote about the balance of payments.  They all thought that we were in for a desperate time if we did not have our old time earnings from the old time sterling assets piled up from the time when the British were living on tick as far as we were concerned.  We were supplying them with goods on tick and we piled up enormous sterling assets.  Deputy de Valera, for many years, attached himself to the theory that, if these assets diminished to any considerable extent, we were going to ruin the community.  That was a perfect swerve from the time when the British market was not any worry to him.  But we were now piling up so much in the way of sterling securities that the income from them would help us out.  The Deputy has wavered on that point, and it is not now the sacred cow that <Col N="1618" /> it was.  It takes its place as one of the cows that we were going to stall at the time of the Republic.  The two were put into adjoining stalls and were no longer regarded as first-class stock. They were regarded as first-class stock long ago.</P>
    <P>Is not the Deputy's situation this, that he completely panicked by what the bankers, and more particularly the Central Bank, had written, that if our assets were run down we were going to have a very difficult situation?  We warned him in the autumn and winter of 1951, and in the spring of 1952, that we knew the sterling assets were going to be diminished, and that we had entered on a course of policy which meant that we were going to cash in on some of them by bringing home goods which is the only way in which you can get sterling assets home.  We said that we were doing that because the prices of these things were going to go up. We saw that these things were going to become so scarce that they could not be bought for money, and we said that we were going to buy early.  We got the representatives of the four daily newspapers to come to us, and we explained our policy to them.  We said to them that if they found that our sterling assets were diminishing, so far as their face value was concerned, that that was part of our policy and that we would keep an eye on it.  I do not think that any Government has ever been so clear in exposing its <i>bona fides</i> so well as we were at that time when we were stockpiling. That was our policy, and we told the papers about it, and that the situation was going to rectify itself as it did.</P>
    <P>In 1952 the Deputy was terribly worried about the balance of payments. Let me ask him, if he had any coherent policy in 1952, what it was other than the one that I am going to expound to him.  If you have a bad situation as regards the balance of payments, there are only two things that you can do.  One is to have physical control of the ports to stop goods coming in.  The Deputy did not do that.  The second way is to stop purchasing power in the hands of people, to stop them buying goods and cause inflation.  Did not the Deputy <Col N="1619" /> take the second of these alternatives when he decided to stop the purchasing power in the hands of people who were buying these goods and causing this terrible unbalance in the payments situation?</P>
    <P>The Deputy told me that he did not set out on a policy of austerity.  I have often suggested to him that he set out on a policy of deflation, and I do not know whether he would care to explain the difference between deflation and austerity.  If you want to stop the imports which are coming into the country from weakening our sterling resources, have you any other resort than that of physical control of the imports, a policy which we did not accept, or else not let the people buy, and the way not to let people buy is to charge them more for what they must buy, such as bread, flour, sugar and tea, and a bit more for what they will continue to buy like tobacco and beer.  After that, there was the restriction of credit which went on in 1952 as the Deputy knows.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the argument was this: &ldquo;The banks may restrict credit but we did not ask them <Col N="1620" /> to do it&rdquo;, but a nod is as good as a wink, if the whole policy of the then Government was towards collapsing the purchasing power in the hands of the populace.  We all know that at that time there was no denial of the fact that the restriction of credit was taking place.  The only denial I ever heard was that if there was the then Government did not ask them to restrict credit.  But Deputy de Valera was so afraid of the situation about the balance of payments&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Deputy to continue to answer them. You did take measures and successful measures against the disequilibrium in the balance of payments.  Let us resolve that into terms which we can all understand.  We were bringing in goods to an extent greater than we could afford to pay for, whether our payment was by the exchange of goods or by cashing in on these assets does not much matter.  Anyway, the situation was that we were importing more <Col N="1621" /> than we could pay for out of current resources by the moneys we were getting from the sale of goods to England or whatever the current payments were.  Therefore, we were drawing a bit on these sterling balances, and the successful way of dealing with that was by stopping imports.  I come back again to my two simple points.  If there is a third way of dealing with it, I should like to know of it, but I think there are only the two ways that I have mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>No one said that but yourself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to know if there is a third.  There were two ways of dealing with the surplus imports&mdash; (1) stop the imports by physical control at the ports&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>And the other is to make the imports unnecessary by providing the stuff at home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Extra home production. The second way was by restricting bank credit so that manufacturers could not get the credit which they required and the third way was by collapsing the purchasing power in the pockets of the people so that they could not command the goods.  If that is a sane policy, then I suggest the Leader of the Opposition should write it up somewhere because certainly he has something new there on the economists of the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that in that Budget speech there were three parts.  Firstly the balance of payments situation was disturbing and Deputy de Valera was under the thrall of the Central Bank and the joint stock banks and they thought that this excess of imports ought in some way to be controlled.  It was not to be controlled by physical controls and they could no longer have stand-still wages.  Therefore, the next best thing was to make wages less valuable as a purchasing power in the hands of the people.  The outlook of Fianna Fáil was that if you made the people pay more for their bread, butter, sugar and tea and if you made them pay more for beer and tobacco <Col N="1622" /> then clearly they would have less to pay for the furniture, wash-basins, carpets, hangings, and so on, coming across the frontier.</P>
    <P>The second part of the 1952 Budget was that Fianna Fáil wanted to carry out a policy of social welfare&mdash;a policy for the betterment of the people, particularly the lower income group&mdash;but had not the money to do so.  They decided that one way of getting it would be by making the people pay more by subsidising them to a lesser extent, for bread, flour, butter, sugar and tea. A sum of about £4,000,000 or £5,000,000 could be got in that way and that money could then be passed out to the poor deluded members of the lower income group by way of new health and social welfare schemes.  Fianna Fáil could then say to those unfortunate people: &ldquo;Here is a free-for-all social welfare scheme, retirement pensions, and so forth; here are new health services. Everybody will be put on the best terms with his doctor by health services that will be free for all.&rdquo; That was what the unfortunate people would hear, but Fianna Fáil's way of paying for them would be by asking people to pay more for the necessities of life and for the things that are near necessities of life.  As a policy, that could not be exposed to the people. No man with a sense of humour, let alone a sense of humanity, could say to the poor: &ldquo;We will charge you more for your bread and butter, but we will save you the doctor's fee.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I read out a document three or four years ago about people living, to a great extent, on bread and spread in this community.  As a matter of fact, it was referred to at the Trade Union Congress during the past week.  Was it Fianna Fáil's policy to make the bread and the spread dearer in order to give the people better health?  Was it?  I should like an answer to that question.  Then, whatever Fianna Fáil were taking from the unfortunate people on their bread and spread was to be devoted to finance the doctors and to get free health services.  The unfortunate people would have less good home conditions, so far as their food was concerned, but then they would have the health services.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1623" /> Fianna Fáil would charge more for the food and then when these people fell ill they would get a doctor to visit their house free and they might get medicines either free of charge or else at a lower cost.</P>
    <P>The Deputy talked about these &ldquo;pieces of paper&rdquo; I do not know if he knows about the speech Deputy Aiken made about &ldquo;these pieces of paper&rdquo;.  Is this an argument of his own or is it because of something that Deputy Aiken said?  Does he allege that I ever said anything about the sterling assets being &ldquo;pieces of paper&rdquo;?  Does he, I wonder?  I did&mdash; under certain circumstances.  That speech of mine has so impacted itself on the mind of Deputy Aiken that he cannot forget it.  When I was a young man at college in this city there was an excellent music-hall show which was put on from time to time.  A certain man always came out on the stage and wore a most lugubrious expression. There was not much scenery in the way of background to help you to realise what was on.  That man always had fly-paper stuck to his hand.  He spent about 20 minutes on the stage trying to get it off.  He would stick part of it on the scenery and try to pull his hand away from it.  The humour was that that man always came on the stage with the most lugubrious appearance as if the world were about to end the next day.  I always thought of that music-hall comedian&mdash;and he was a comedian&mdash;when I heard Deputy Aiken talk about &ldquo;scraps of paper&rdquo; in relation to sterling assets.  I used that phrase during the war period.  Was it not a good description?  I said they were &ldquo;bits of paper&rdquo; which represented an acknowledgment of a claim. They were like an I.O.U.</P>
    <P>I quoted from the Governor of the Bank of England in those days&mdash;he was no mean authority&mdash;who said that anything drawn in the way of one of these post-dated cheques&mdash;which was what our position amounted to in the Bank of England at that time&mdash;meant that the Bank of England would pay £1 sterling in its own good time.  When asked what &ldquo;£1 sterling&rdquo; meant, he replied that it meant whatever the <Col N="1624" /> Bank of England decided it meant at the time they decided to pay the money.  I objected to these bits of paper currency during the war.  I said it would be far better if we used the money to the betterment of our own people and to support some production at home.</P>

      <P>For the reply to that question I would refer Deputy de Valera to Deputy Aiken.  Does Deputy de Valera remember what Deputy Aiken said?  He said: &ldquo;Let us eat them at home.&rdquo;  That is what he said. It is not a laughing matter.  That is the statement which was made by him. He said, further, that the only result would be that we would become so fat that we would not be able to go through our own doorways.  That was a nonsensical policy.  Deputy de Valera says we are setting the seal on their programme.  We are not.  We do not agree that these taxes are necessary&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but we are not taking them off this year.  If we decided to give no reliefs to anybody this year and aimed, instead, at the reduction of taxes, the measure of that reduction of taxes would be in the neighbourhood of £4,500,000.  We decided that it would be better, instead <Col N="1625" /> of reducing the price of whiskey, for instance, to give a reduction to the whole community through keeping the butter price lower than it was when Fianna Fáil were in office, through keeping the price of tea below the market level to-day in any country and through giving subventions amounting to a couple of million pounds to those people who were hardest hit by the 1952 Budget and who never even got what were called &ldquo;compensations&rdquo; to meet the extra charges imposed upon them in that 1952 Budget.  We have decided to do that this year.  If we had the spending over five years I would say that we might not have directed our steps in that way at all but one must extemporise to meet emergency conditions.</P>
      <P>To criticise us for carrying on Fianna Fáil taxes is the same as to criticise the British, French and Americans when they stormed across the Continent in their relief of the Continent for not bringing about immediately the change which, over a number of years, their policy has brought about.  It is about the same thing.  We have taken a line here which has been of benefit to this community by an expenditure of something short of £7,000,000 in this Budget and that is without having much time to change the bad policy that was developed by the people sitting opposite to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come back again, although it may seem egotistical, to my own broadcast, which apparently caused so much disturbance to Fianna Fáil.  They did not know whether it was a Party broadcast or something of my own; in any event, it annoys them and for that reason I think it must have been a good broadcast. I come back on it to analyse it. I say that: &ldquo;The Minister for Finance who is seriously intent upon getting economies can get them to several million pounds in a particular year&rdquo;. We have got them to the extent of almost £7,000,000&mdash;and seven and several are not the same thing, but seven is an extension of several&mdash;and we have got seven this year.  I went on to say that I thought the people of this country wanted &ldquo;significant economies of an order of £20,000,000 or so&rdquo;. That, when spoken of, irritates every <Col N="1626" /> Fianna Fáil person in whose presence I happen to speak.</P>
    <P>I ask this question, as I have asked it down the country: &ldquo;Do people want an economy of a significant amount of £20,000,000?&rdquo;  Would anybody disagree when I say it would be intensely popular if it could bring about a relaxation in the costs of Government by £20,000,000?  Is it not desired by everybody that the cost of Government ought to be brought down significantly &mdash;and I put the figure of £20,000,000 as a significant sum.  I move on from that.  If we do not accept that, if it is not what is desired by the people, we must accept it that the people are content to live forever afterwards in this country with taxes at their present level.  I am not leaving out that increased productivity can give a better return and that better returns can mean that on the present level of taxes a better revenue can be got in; but do not forget that on account of the arrears of development that Fianna Fáil left us we have a big programme of development to carry out and to carry out speedily.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that over the last five of six years the programme of capital development has speeded up enormously and, of course, at a rate that just cannot continue unless we get enormously increased productivity. Supposing we say that the increased loans, the cost of the loans that will have to be got from the people for development purposes, supposing they are met out of new productivity and you balance your situation as far as these extra loans and extra charges on them are concerned, by the better yield that will be given through better productivity in giving a better return, I still say the people want a reduction in the cost of Government, that the cost of Government is far too heavy, that the cost of Government is far too oppressive.  If that is agreed&mdash;and I do not think anyone will are disagree with that statement&mdash;is there any other way of making a significant change in the cost of Government than the way I have proposed, namely, that all this extravagant unnecessary interference in the people's lives should be diminished as far as possible, that the <Col N="1627" /> impact of the Civil Service on the people in their ordinary lives should be lessened and that there is no other way really of reducing the cost of Government than by what I have proposed, namely, to reduce the impact of the Civil Service on the lives of the community?</P>
    <P>I do not see why the phrase that I used should be so objected to.  I know it can be used for propaganda purposes as if I had said that a £20,000,000 decrease may be achieved in a year. Every time I have spoken, it is in order to guard myself and guard the Party to which I belong against something I think it necessary to guard against.  I have often said that you cannot put on to a certain section of our community the hardship that would be imposed if you suddenly decided to reduce Government services and therefore to reduce the Civil Service personnel or State personnel.  I have often said that must be guarded against. People have been brought in and have been told, or at least it has been insinuated to them, that this type of life is going &ldquo;to continue for you as long as you live&rdquo; and one must think in terms of humanity on these occasions.</P>
    <P>I have always said the Civil Service should be guaranteed that there would be no redundancy and that even if it were found it would not cause dismissals or a diminution in the likelihood of people having what they at present have and having the emoluments they at present enjoy.  I have said that the only way is to drain it off by the free wastage of the Civil Service, though one may enter on a policy of increasing that wastage by earlier retirement.  It is quite clear to people who have listened to me that that type of fruit cannot be got in one year.  It may be started in a couple of years, brought to part completion in five years and would take some years more to carry out.  The reason for that is that that is a policy of a long term type.  As I said before, it is one of the first fruits which could be got fairly soon, if we start on it in a resolute manner.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera has talked about the commitments we left behind.  I notice it is the word &ldquo;commitment&rdquo;<Col N="1628" /> not &ldquo;debt&rdquo; that is used by the Deputy.  We have talked about the millions of American money his Finance Minister scattered to the winds like rain.  He says he was meeting our debts, but then Deputy Dillon, the Minister for Agriculture, pinned him to that, to know what our commitments were.  They were only commitments to people, there was nothing really that could not be stopped in mid-flight, like the way we stopped the transatlantic project, that nonsensical business about our Constellation aircraft flying from here to America and back.  There is nothing whatever that could not be stopped in mid-flight, if the Deputy were serious in Government as to what he had said when in opposition, that our projects were completely uneconomic and &ldquo;put the country in pawn.&rdquo;  There were no arrangements made by which the contractors could not have been put off by the autumn of 1951, if the Deputy in Government believed what he said in opposition&mdash; nothing at all&mdash;yet he poured out these moneys on the plans in which he apparently did not believe.  I would not mind him telling us that for the 1951 Budget or even the 1952 Budget, but we came to 1953 and we came to 1954 and there was no diminishing of expenditure on the capital programme we had inaugurated here in 1949-50, no diminution at all.  The money was spent.</P>
    <P>There are two things I want to draw from that.  One is that everybody realised that at that time the criticism of himself and his Government for the 15 years in office from 1932 was good criticism, that the resources of this country had not been used, that we were neglecting resources in material and in men and in money.  We were the first to get these three things together.  What we were doing for our three years in 1948-1951 and what his Government were doing, although reluctantly, for the three years to 1954 and what we are now doing again wholeheartedly, is trying to catch up on the arrears of development which should have been done in those years from 1932 but which were left neglected.  We are building the schools that they left neglected, we are going <Col N="1629" /> ahead with the housing programme and with the rehabilitation of land; all these things on which we challenged any criticism from 1948 to 1951.  We got a certain amount of sneers but no real criticism and we got acceptance of any plans for the use of this American money for the development plans we had inaugurated.</P>
    <P>I am not objecting to the Deputy running and spending that money. There was a really good policy of development for the use of that money. We went to the people time and again &mdash;three times in our three years&mdash; looking for money that we wanted.  We got it completely for the first year, almost completely the second year, we did not get it completely the third year.  We had that nest-egg, the American money, and we skimmed off the top the £3,000,000 or £4,000,000 as we required it here and there in order to meet our plans, our commitments as the Deputy would say, in the development of the resources of the country. That was let stand as a reserve to be drawn on from year to year and it was good financial policy to keep that as a reserve and to look to the people for the bulk of the money, and, as regards whatever we did not get, feed in or siphon in a certain amount of that American money.</P>
    <P>The Deputy and his Government came and slushed that, squandered it, without going to the people in their first year and they tell us now that in the first year there was a conversion loan.  And so there was&mdash;I had arranged for it before I left&mdash;and it was the only success Fianna Fáil had financially from 1951, the conversion loan arranged by us, and to a great extent it depended on the good credit situation that we had left.  To a great extent they had the good credit situation we had left them, but they funked going to the people for money in the year in which they should have gone; and, when they did go, they went at the outrageous percentage interest which meant that they recognised, as far as they were concerned, that under their hands the credit of this country had sunk below even the level of the credit in the ordinary South American Republic. <Col N="1630" /> We have now restored the credit position and if the Deputy sits down and makes a calculation, or gets someone to make it for him, of all the money we borrowed, and if he adds in the American money, and the way we spent that American money and their and their idea of the value of it, and then calculates the loans they got&mdash;do not forget the phrase that is still talked about even in this House in relation to the &ldquo;National Development Fund that Fianna Fáil financed&rdquo;&mdash;he will see what the credit position is.  Remember, they never financed one shilling of that fund.  That was a project for which we got the money.  Their finances were so bad they could never have filled the National Development Fund for that project in the mood in which they had gone to the lending public in 1952.</P>
    <P>We are trying now, as I say, to pick up on the arrears of development work since 1932.  We have been hampered in every hand's turn.  Our capital development was slandered and defamed. All the workmanship of the Fianna Fáil was turned to defamation of us in regard to that; and, when they crept back into office through a really dirty trick played upon the voting population, all they could do was accept our capital development programme but finance it at a most outrageous rate. Then, after all that record of negligence over 15 years and near-disaster over three they tell us that, because we cannot catch up on the arrears in one year, we are sitting still in our appreciation of what they did in those miserable years from 1951 to 1954.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Those of us who have not had the doubtful advantage of listening to the Attorney-General in the past may perhaps be impressed by his performance here this evening, as perhaps some of those who listened to him on the radio during the general election may have been persuaded that, with his academic and legal qualifications, his experience in ministerial office in the Department of Industry and Commerce, the Department of External Affairs and the Department of Finance over so many years, when he talked of possible reductions in expenditure to the extent of £20,000,000 <Col N="1631" /> he must know of what he was talking about.  I wonder what do the people one year after the Attorney-General's broadcast think to-day?</P>
      <P>They had forgotten that when the Deputy came in here as Minister for Finance in 1948 he was to carry out a policy of retrenchment.  Then, as now, the Fine Gael Party stood for lower taxes, lower expenditure and, of course, better times.  And in the first Budget of 1948 he actually mentioned retrenchment and he gave it capital letters in his Budget statement.  He pointed to the economies made in the way of cutting down on the transatlantic air services, on mineral development and on a few other things. During the following year there was no talk of retrenchment and before Deputy McGilligan left office as Minister for Finance the Fine Gael policy of retrenchment and lower taxes had become a mere memory and in its place we had a new conception that, with the assistance of new machines and better organisation, we would be able to get reductions in Civil Service costs: but, of course, no public servant was to be in any danger of losing his position.  There was to be no question of hardship, but if anything could be done by way of getting in consultants or by getting in machines, then of course reductions could be made.  I wonder how many consultants and how many machines Deputy McGilligan thought would be necessary to bring about the reduction of £20,000,000 in national expenditure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy, of course, rides away from that.  He rides away from that cardinal policy of Fine Gael: economy in the Government administration, lower expenditure, therefore, lower taxation!  Not alone have we not had lower expenditure but we have had increased expenditure during the present year; and the Deputy wound up his speech by telling us that we may have to cut down on capital expenditure; we are going too fast.  This great Party which introduced this great policy of capital investment a few years ago is now telling us, after an experience of a few years, that we are going too <Col N="1632" /> fast: we will not be able to raise the shekels and we will have to cut down. I wonder what the Labour Party and its leaders think of that.  Certainly we know what they would think of it if the pronouncement had come from a Fianna Fáil Minister or a Fianna Fáil leader.</P>
    <P>The Deputy went over the ground again and there are two things I want him to study, even though it may look rather impudent on my part to suggest to a Professor of Constitutional History, Master of Economics, former Minister for Finance, Industry and External Affairs that if a country is to get ahead in this world, or a people, it has to look forward to a regular progression, a regular improvement in the standard of living and in the country's national welfare and economic condition, it surely has to pay its current obligations.  But the Deputy is wiser than the Australian Minister&mdash;the Australians who had to cut down on imports even though they were throwing the workers of Lancashire out of employment. That country, which suffered an unexampled boom a few years ago, had to cut down on imports.  What a pity that Deputy McGilligan and the economists of the Fine Gael Party were not out in Australia then so that they might have explained to the Prime Minister there that it was unneces-to cut down on imports and unnecessary to put the Lancashire textile industry into a quandary so that the Australian balance of payments position might be restored to a proper basis.</P>
    <P>Or, if Deputy McGilligan and the economists of the Fine Gael Party had been in Holland a few years ago they could have explained to the Dutch Government that it was unnecessary in a period of inflation to cut down on consumption, to put taxes upon consumption goods.  Or they could have gone to Sweden, or almost any other European country, and told them that they, the Fine Gael Party in Ireland, had a better policy.  They had the secret.  While every Government in Europe and outside it had to take steps to correct inflation, according to Deputy McGilligan, we should let inflation go ahead because it would be <Col N="1633" /> so advantageous to attack those who were trying to curb inflation and put them in the dock as the enemies of the workers, the enemies of the poor, because they were increasing prices, increasing the cost of living and so on. What more unjust attack or what more damnable attack upon the standard of living of the people and upon the conditions of the working classes than to allow inflation to go ahead uncurbed?</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan used to tell us long ago when he was talking about these bits of paper that we could not curb inflation in this country so long as we were tied to the sterling unit, to the sterling group.  He said we could not possibly curb inflation.  The Deputy had his opportunity, and he now has it again, or his administration have it.  If they think that by cutting the link with sterling they can avoid all these inflationary difficulties, they can set up an Irish monetary standard, an Irish money market or whatever else they like in this country.  We wish them all success in so doing but I wonder how successful the Irish monetary standard or the Irish money market will be if the Irish Government is not going to pay its current obligations and meet its current expenditure out of its current revenue.</P>
    <P>There are two points that I recommend to Deputy McGilligan's attention. The first is that in the world as it stands, and with a history such as we have had, with the lack of resources, lack of tradition in industrial matters, the fact that we are almost completely dependent on a single market, the lack of raw materials and all the other disadvantages, it is more than necessary that we should keep our accounts in proper equilibrium.  What a jest it would be if the leaders of the Irish Republic in the Twenty-Six Counties had to go to-morrow, hat in hand&mdash;having failed, as Deputy McGilligan failed, as he admits here to-night he failed, to raise sufficient money in his last year of office to meet his obligations and commitments in the Government&mdash;begging in other countries for financial aid, for loans? Would there be another Marshall Loan forthcoming, I wonder?</P>
    <P>The fact is we have to depend on <Col N="1634" /> our own resources, on our own efforts &mdash;the old policy of Sinn Féin&mdash;and it is because we believe that the self-respect of this nation is bound up with financial solvency and because our standing in the world depends on it that we intend to argue this question of the Budget as long as is necessary until the people see that it is just as important if we are to maintain our financial independence to balance our Budget properly, as it was necessary to take up arms to secure our political independence.</P>

      <P>Deputy McGilligan in an effort, I presume, to throw dust into the eyes of the workers of this country and their representatives in this Dáil here last year told us that the Fianna Fáil administration had set out on a policy to make wages less valuable.  I do not think I ever heard a more shocking or a falser misrepresentation than that is.  The Deputy knows very well that at the time of the 1947 Budget even the United States of America had to take steps to curb inflation. He knows that in 1946 the Fianna Fáil Government did away with the standstill Order and that while that Order was in operation it was not an Order for a standstill in wages only; it was a standstill in regard to profits and prices as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When Deputy McGilligan was Minister for Finance he stated&mdash;I have not got the quotation here, but will he deny it?  &mdash;that in his Budget statement in 1949, I think it was, he stated categorically that the level of earnings had reached the point where workers and their unions would not be justified in looking for increases, and on more than one occasion Deputy McGilligan referred, when it suited him to do so as Minister for Finance and to depart from his characteristic attitude for many years in opposition, to the evils of inflation.  I repeat: If there is any attack upon the standard of living of the workers, if there is anything more tyrannical or more unjust or more <Col N="1635" /> reprehensible than allowing the standard of money to fall by improper financial practices and by failing to balance the Budget, I would like to know what it is.  In any case, the Governments of most of the countries of Europe have considered it was the worst type of attack on the standard of living of their people and that was the reason that they had to take even drastic steps to try to recover it.</P>
    <P>Of course, Deputy McGilligan refuses, or professes to refuse, to see that aspect of the situation because he thinks he can ride away with the convenient political phrase that Fianna Fáil wanted to reduce the workers' wages and wanted to prevent the workers from having a good time. When Deputy McGilligan was scoffing in this Dáil at the Fianna Fáil capital programme announced during the war, when we announced that millions of money were to be spent on roads and telephones, I remember Deputy McGilligan from this side of the House deriding and scornfully attacking the idea of spending millions of money on these works.  Plans were being drawn up then in order that our assets would be utilised, in order that our people should have the goods they required and in order that they might be given employment in their own country.</P>
    <P>What is of importance in connection with this question of inflation is that it was at that time when the Government of the day had borrowed over £40,000,000 in Marshall Aid money which they were spending, as Deputy de Valera has pointed out, at the rate of £1,000,000 a month, and when they were importing into this country millions of pounds' worth of feeding stuffs and consumption goods in addition to raw materials and articles properly needed for stocking, it was at that time when the Counterpart Fund was set up and when measures were supposedly being taken by his Government when they had got these Marshall Aid moneys to ensure that the acceptance of the loan would not have a detrimental effect on our economy or create inflationary conditions, it was just at that time when all these millions of dollars were being spent and exports <Col N="1636" /> being swollen to an enormous degree; it was at that time, mark you, that our balance of payments began to get seriously out of hand and at the end of the year, as is well known, we were over £62,000,000 on the wrong side.  So that we were on the wrong side in regard to our balance of payments; we were on the wrong side with regard to curbing or stemming the inflationary wave, and, of course, we were on the wrong side in regard to the balancing of our current Budget.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan is at a loss to know what was the deficit.  He does not remember, apparently, that there was an arbitration award of £3.4 millions during the first year and £3,500,000 during succeeding years to the Civil Service.  That was not eliminated in the succeeding Budget.  It was a payment which remains there, a liability which continues.  There was the liability of the loss on C.I.E. amounting to another £2,500,000 or thereabouts, apart from the interest upon C.I.E. stock of £800,000.  There was the Social Welfare Bill introduced by his Government which they failed to put into operation or even to put into law and, at the last moment, they announced, on the Second Stage of that Bill, when it was under discussion in this House, that they would give an increase to old age pensioners.  They never gave the increase, of course.  We had to give it, at a cost of £1,000,000 a year.</P>

      <P>Deputy McGilligan is annoyed that the Fianna Fáil Government should have wiped off the debt on the turf, the turf which enabled the home fires to be kept burning all during the war years.  It was not very good at times, I must admit.  Deputy McGilligan was prepared to see that debt continued, presumably indefinitely, and the Irish taxpayer paying interest upon it.  We decided that it should be cleared off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1637" /> Deputy McGilligan wanted to know what was the known deficit.  I remember that immediately we got into office in 1951 I went down and told my constituents that Deputy McGilligan, as Minister for Finance, had left very large and very serious liabilities for his successor to meet which I was quite certain could not be met without hardship being created.</P>

      <P>The pretence is that it was not known that there was a deficit. It was well known that there was a deficit but there was no opportunity given to this House or to the country to discuss or to find out what the 1951 Budget was about.  The Budget was introduced and the House was dissolved and the election was declared almost the following day.  The Minister for Finance who was responsible for that has the temerity to come into this House and to present a whole mass of verbiage and irrelevancies but he has failed to explain why he left a deficit of £6.7 million after him in the 1951 Budget and, as Deputy de Valera has pointed out, the deficit went up to £15,000,000 in the 1952-53 Budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his references to the subsidies, Deputy McGilligan has fastened on a phrase, one phrase out of an hour's speech by Deputy MacEntee as Minister for Finance.  Does Deputy McGilligan think that the Irish people are completely lacking in intelligence or understanding or that they will believe that Deputy MacEntee or any other Minister for Finance would impose severe taxation or cut subsidies if there were any alternative?  There was no alternative.  Expenditure had to be cut and could not be cut to the extent of £15,000,000 and, therefore, it was <Col N="1638" /> necessary as well as cutting expenditure, to impose taxation.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan was never faced with the unpleasant alternatives of either reducing expenditure upon services which he would rather not reduce or increasing taxation, because he left the Irish people under the impression, in 1948, that you could abolish taxation by millions and carry on and continue to expand and increase services and expenditure, give greater services on the one hand and pretend, on the other hand, at election times, that you could reduce expenditure at the same time.</P>
    <P>The 1952 Budget showed that that was impossible.  Not alone were the Government able to stabilise the position in regard to the balance of payments, to balance the current Budget, but they were able to prevent what might have been a very serious depression from developing and to see the country back into a larger level of production, a high level of consumption and a high level of employment before they left office.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan, I think I should remind him, went to the Seanad on a famous occasion when the Dublin Corporation failed to raise a loan for housing in Dublin and defended the banks.  He said that the banks knew their own business best and, whether or not he had forgotten his previous pronouncement in regard to credit, he certainly on that occasion showed the banks that he as Minister for Finance would not stand for any hanky-panky or any interference with them in their ordinary business and he stated, as far as I remember, that not alone was it better business to allow the banks to do their business in their own way but that it was much better for the country.</P>
    <P>I remember, in 1951, Deputy Morrissey, then Minister for Industry and Commerce, telling the people that we were consuming too much.  He referred to the enormous expansion in gambling.  He referred to the greatly increased expenditure on liquor and tobacco, not to speak of other things. What did that indicate but the belief of Deputy Morrissey, then Minister for <Col N="1639" /> Industry and Commerce, and his colleagues in the Government that consumption of these, perhaps, unnecessary commodities, which may be described as luxuries or as evils, whichever way you wish, was beyond our capacity and beyond the level that should be permitted in our economy and in our circumstances.</P>
    <P>That was in the spring of 1951 and in the autumn of 1951 we had the Government, through the present Minister for External Affairs, telling the House, when he was trying to explain away the increase in prices and in the cost of living that had already taken place then and the unemployment that had resulted, that it was due to the Korean war and to the stockpiling that was going on in which the Irish Government had participated.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan and his colleagues, when they take credit for the stockpile that was achieved during the latter period of their term of office, forget to explain that it took the wholesale and retail distributors very many weary months before they could rid themselves of those stocks which they had purchased at high prices and which they had to sell in a falling market and they did not get the support of the Government in enabling them to discharge that difficult duty although the Government had called them in and told them they should import these goods no matter what the price so as to build up a stockpile for this country in case of emergency.</P>

Not alone that, but they had to provide the finances in the 1952 Budget just the same as they provided for the Health Act.</P>

      <P>Deputy McGilligan referred to the health scheme and the payment of doctors.  Do we not remember the Deputy's little paragraph in the 1951 Budget telling us that he was laying aside some £600,000 for the mother and child scheme of the then Minister for Health, Dr. Browne, and that if it were necessary more money would be provided?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan talked a great deal about the wages standstill Order, the cost of living and the slashing of subsidies.  He omitted to state, like all the other untruthful gentlemen who <Col N="1641" /> have been campaigning up and down the country for the past few years, that the subsidies were not eliminated; that even after the 1952 Budget the Irish taxpayers were still providing up to £8,000,000 for subsidies&mdash;they have forgotten that&mdash;those subsidies which Deputy Norton in 1947 described as useless.  The idea, according to Deputy Norton then, of subsidising tea, bread, flour and butter was nonsensical.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish Government were simply fooling themselves, according to Deputy Norton, to pretend that the few shillings a week that this meant to the working-class families was anything; the idea of our introducing food subsidies was simply beyond the Deputy's comprehension, this gentleman who, for years past, has been going around the country attacking Fianna Fáil because in a particular budgetary emergency they had to reduce the subsidies fairly substantially.</P>
      <P>Deputy McGilligan and Deputy Norton in the Government set up a committee about 1949 to see whether the bread and flour subsidies could be eliminated altogether.  Will Deputy McGilligan deny that he made speeches here and in Seanad Eireann telling us that the bread subsidy and the flour subsidy were a very foolish form of expenditure?  &ldquo;Look at these enormous palatial edifices the flour millers are erecting,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;presumably out of their profits; look at the people in Ailesbury Road and Merrion Road that you are sending out bread to and subsidising bread for.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to these food subsidies you cannot escape the conclusion that they are an extravagant form of social expenditure because, on the one hand, you have, as Deputy McGilligan pointed out, to raise the money through a cumbersome and often very onerous system of taxation, particularly on the working-class people; and on the other hand, you are going to subsidise bread not merely for those people but for the people who have motor-cars, industries, professional work or investments.  Does anybody suggest that that is reasonable, particularly <Col N="1642" /> if the position is as Deputy McGilligan quoted and as was the case in 1952, that earnings exceeded the increase in the cost of living?</P>
    <P>I should like Deputy McGilligan, the next time he comes to this House, to come more fully fortified with facts and figures and deny, if he can, that the level of wages, the level of the workers' income and the level of earnings, whether hourly or weekly, of the working-class in this country, in so far as the statistical department has been able to get that information, improved every year that Fianna Fáil was in office.  Deputy McGilligan has spoken as if our Government had made an attack upon the standard of living of the people and upon the food they ate.</P>

      <P>It is very difficult to follow the Attorney-General because he contradicts himself so rapidly in the course of his speech that one has to listen to him with the greatest care in order to clarify the position.  But I noticed that in one portion of what he said he implied that the Government were united in their policy with regard to the balance of payments situation in 1950-51.  It reminds me of the evidence of the disruption within the Government of that time because some members of the Government were telling the people to buy and other members of the Government were telling them that they could not buy except at the current prices.</P>
      <P>We had the most extraordinary situation indicating the complete inability of the then Minister for Finance to control his Cabinet, with the Minister for Industry and Commerce giving Press interviews and encouraging stockpiling, and when prices were rising all over the world and when no one could stop them rising, Deputy Norton, the present Minister for Industry and Commerce, who had failed to prosecute all the profiteers he said he would prosecute in 1948, who had failed to see his Party policy of reducing the cost of living implemented, announced the Price Freeze Order.  He came into the Dáil, I think it was in December, 1950, and repeated all the old charges about the thousands of profiteers rolling around the country making ill-gotten gains at the expense of the people, the profiteers whom he had for two years failed to have prosecuted, the profiteers whom he failed to find profiteering in so far as the records of the Department of Industry and Commerce Prices Section was concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Norton, the present Minister <Col N="1644" /> for Industry and Commerce, then said that he was going to have these people's blood this time; he was going to put a Price Freeze Order into operation and the effect of the Price Freeze Order, if anybody had bothered to observe it at the time, would have been to stop stockpiling which his colleague, the then Minister for Industry and Commerce so earnestly desired.  Every importer in Ireland from January to March of 1951 was faced with this prospect, that he was told by one Minister to stockpile and by the other Minister that he must not pay anything more for the goods he bought because he would not be allowed to sell them at any price beyond that of December, 1950.</P>
    <P>Importers took various views on this fantastic policy, showing that there was no real concerned philosophy in regard to the balance of payments, stockpiling or increasing consumption. Some of them realised that the Price Freeze Order was ludicrous and simply evaded it, and there were so many goods that had been ordered in different periods for fear of war and various other reasons that it was impossible to check the variations in price that were taking place.  Many importers, however, with a great sense of conscience did stop giving orders.  In the meantime prices went on rising still further so that when the Price Freeze Order had been very rapidly mitigated and whole collections of articles had been removed from the list of goods that could not be sold at higher prices, they then started to buy again at even higher prices.</P>
    <P>This was a good illustration of the complete failure of the Minister for Finance at that time to have any concerted policy or any real policy.  What he was trying to do was to avoid the inevitable storm that was coming on his head from the disruptions within the Government.  Further, when he announced his last Budget, at column 1883, Volume 125, of the Official Debates of the 2nd May, 1951, speaking of the balance of payments and the fact that there had been a huge increase in imports, he did not boast of it but spoke of the difficulties of the present time:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1645" />&ldquo;The difficulties of the present time may, however, be exceptional, and as time goes on a better balance will, I hope, be achieved between our earnings from abroad and our necessary external outlay.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Whenever the Attorney-General speaks on economic matters one can always go back to his own last Budget speech. We always wondered in Fianna Fáil whether the Budget speech was prepared in its details without the consent of the Government, as were a good number of other measures announced at that time that may be remembered, which never had the collective consent of the whole Government of the day, or whether he prepared his script which has been also developed for him by the officers of the Department of Finance, and read something out during the course of the Budget which his colleagues had not really examined.</P>
    <P>He never since has attempted to account for the difference between the speeches after his own Budget and what he said at that time.  At column 1884 of the same volume of the Official Debates he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Making all allowance for the exceptional conditions now obtaining it is to be feared that we are not producing and earning enough to pay our way.  The implication is obvious. We cannot have both consumption and capital development on the present scale unless we save more and produce more.  Additional saving would ease the congestion that now exists and causes consumer demand to seek an outlet in imports.  It would relieve the pressure on the balance of payments and help to confine external disinvestment&mdash;or surplus imports&mdash;to what is needed for home development....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He made a number of other references of the same kind, and Deputy McGilligan's speech in 1951 was nothing but a very moderate repetition or&mdash;shall we say?&mdash;a very moderate recapitulation of warnings of the Central Bank. His speech in 1951 was a perfectly typical Central Bank speech, slightly modified, without, perhaps, the same emphasis.</P>
    <P>We have always wondered what the <Col N="1646" /> difference is between the Minister for Finance, as he then was, making that speech just before he left office and literally prefacing the Central Bank reports, and all the speeches he has made since in order to defame our side of the House.  I do not suppose we shall ever have a proper explanation. This evening he again referred to the balance of payments and has already indicated that the Government itself were not in agreement about the balance of payments.  In actual fact the position was much more serious than he suggested.  At the end of 1951 the position was that there was a deficit in the balance of payments which left the total not reserve of assets, after allowing for liabilities, at something not very much greater than a year's imports.</P>
    <P>One of the interesting points about that year was that in spite of all the Coalition Deputies' talk about how wonderful it was to disinvest external assets, only about 9 per cent. of all the imports into this country consisted of capital machinery&mdash;machinery which would help production.  The figure was just about 9 per cent. and when we were told time and time again that the external assets were being sold to bring us a measure of prosperity and to build up production we always felt that the position had to be corrected.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Finance will not confuse me.  We have had enough confusion from the Attorney-General without any more confusing interruptions in which statements are contradicted.  However, one can come back ultimately to the question of what was going to be the end of it all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Derrig has already indicated that absolutely no proof has been published by the present Government since they took office either that the Irish people suffered through being crushed by taxation or that they bought less to any appreciable degree or that they consumed less.  We gathered from some Deputies on the <Col N="1647" /> Government side that the conditions in 1954, for which they surely can hardly accept responsibility, were even better than in 1953.  There was not one single indication that the lives of the people had been sorely damaged or hurt by the action taken by our Government in putting the finances of the nation in order and in fact if the comparison is made with almost any other country in Europe, all of which went through the Korean inflation period and all of which faced difficulties in their balances of payments through increases in the cost of living, through increased prices for import materials, through difficulties of paying debts to America and the need for receiving Marshall Aid, it will be found that the results in our case were among the least serious.  It will be found that there was a very small adverse effect, something like a 3½ per cent. reduction in consumption between 1952 and 1951. This was very quickly expunged and 1953 showed a really satisfactory result.</P>
    <P>The Government has had to admit that in 1953 our exports were at a record level, that agricultural production had increased.  They have had to admit by their own published figures that industrial production at the end of 1953 was above any previous figure. They have had to admit that the cost of living has been outstepped by wages, they have had to admit that the increases in wage packets had exceeded the increase in the cost of living.  They have had to admit that despite the savage and brutal treatment supposed to have been meted out to them, the people in 1953 saved about four times more of their personal incomes than in the last two years of the Coalition Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The people of the country; the whole people of the whole country in every shape and form.  They have had to admit all that.  They have had to admit that capital investment was showing a normal upward trend in 1953 and that the proportion of imports of capital machinery had slightly increased despite the terrible treatment the people were supposed to have <Col N="1648" /> received.  Those facts cannot be denied. They are in this <i>Irish Statistical Survey.</i>  We have not had it yet for 1954 and I have a suspicion that the Government will be greatly embarrassed when it is received, because I have a suspicion that it will show, in spite of the appalling harvest of 1954, still better results.  The Government will have to admit that they accepted our Budget in 1954&mdash;they took office only in June of that year and any economies they might have been able to make could not materially alter the general economic conditions for the whole year.</P>
      <P>They themselves, when they came into office, said they had to study the situation, that there was nothing they could do for the time being and that, in fact, 1954 as well as 1953 was going to be a Fianna Fáil year.  Those facts which the Government themselves published make nonsense of three quarters of what the Attorney-General said in regard to the defects in our correcting of the national finances.</P>
      <P>The Attorney-General spoke about credit restrictions.  We have often said we gave no orders to the banks to restrict credit.  I have not got any figures here but, if I remember rightly, bank advances reached their maximum as late as March, 1952, and thereafter they diminished slightly; but roughly speaking the amount would be due to the ending of stockpiling and they started to go up again, as the Attorney-General remarks, in January, 1953, and moved slowly upwards through the whole of that year.  That, however, did not stop the members of the Coalition Parties going around the country and saying that the Government was still restricting credit in the banks, although the actual bank advances were slightly increasing in the same way as they increased in other countries.</P>

    <P>The Attorney-General also spoke about high rates of interest and referred to the first loan asked for by the Fianna Fáil Government at that time.  I should like to ask him to produce any reputable economist who would deny that, apart from certain countries whose currency was as strong as the American dollar&mdash;countries like <Col N="1649" /> Belgium, Switzerland and the United States itself&mdash;during the Korean inflation period interest rates went up.  For certain purposes in one country or another the rates of interest may have been restrained due to difficulties in their economy, but generally speaking rates of interest went up except, as I have said, in that group of countries where the currency was as strong as the dollar.  It could not have happened here only through a complete and fundamental change in the whole economic situation of the country.</P>
    <P>Without such a change it would have been impossible for us to escape the trend of the increasing rates of interest which could have been seen in countries like Sweden, Denmark, Holland, Great Britain and here.  Our rates of interest followed the same trend and we all recall that when, during our term of office, the rates of interest began to come down again, it was said that we were responsible for the increase in the rates of interest. But we were given no credit when the rates of interest came down.</P>
    <P>Not so long after the Korean inflation they tried to say that Deputy de Valera was responsible for world conditions which were, for the time being, unfavourable to this country.  When the rates of interest started to come down during our term of office, no credit was given to our Government, although in both cases, the trend was the result of world changes.  As I have said, the Minister for Finance knows that he cannot deny these facts and he cannot deny what I have said about the trends of the rates of interest and cannot deny that it would be impossible to prevent some increases taking place here during that period.</P>
    <P>The same thing applies to the prices situation.  We have dealt with that many times here.  We have dealt with the fact that the prices increases were universal during the period of the Korean inflation and universal for exactly the same reasons in other countries as here.  There was a period of an armaments drive, when there was a tremendous demand for materials, a period when the agricultural communities all over the world were having a political influence in securing <Col N="1650" /> price support mechanisms and in gaining increases in farm produce prices, and, from California to Peru, the position was exactly the same.</P>
    <P>It was due to the increases in wages that were taking place, first, as a result of the growing strength. of the trade unionists throughout the world, the growth of trade unionism in a great many countries from which we imported goods and in which it had never asserted itself before.  Some of the increases in wages were the normal result of better conditions and some due to increasing prices, wages chasing prices and prices chasing wages in the normal way.  The price levels rose as much in the general period of the inflation in other well-run countries as they did here, but of course when they rose here we were made entirely responsible for it and when they finally stabilised here&mdash;Deputies may remember that prices were stabilised in this country about May, 1953, and barely moved from that time onward&mdash;we were given no credit for the stabilisation.</P>
    <P>We were blamed for the increase, but Deputy McGilligan, the Attorney-General, would never give us credit for the stabilisation, although if we got the blame for one, we should get the credit for the other.  We never did, because that was just the result of the dishonest thinking on the part of the people on the Coalition side.</P>
    <P>Over and above that, however, none of these world statements by the Attorney-General really matters in this debate, because it was the hysterical effect created among the people of the country during the last general election that really mattered.  You could lecture on economics for three hours on end in this Chamber and it would not really matter, because it was the hysterical effect that was created that really mattered in the general election.  It was not what the Taoiseach said from important platforms in front of the Press; it was the hysterical propaganda created among the ordinary people to whom it is so much easier to say that the Government is responsible for the increase in the cost of living, that the Government is strangling the people and destroying their happiness, than it is to give <Col N="1651" /> patiently the answers that have been given.</P>
    <P>One of the main charges made against us in the election was that we were squandermaniacs, that there was lunatic spending, that we were spending money at a rate which knew no bounds.  That was the main atmosphere created and that was the criticism we had to face in the general election.  I am very glad that it did not affect the great majority of the constituencies and that the great majority of them resisted that kind of propaganda, to the enormous credit of all the hard-pressed housewives who have to face these increases in prices and all these difficulties.  When we have asked, ever since this debate started, the Government to show us the squandermania, the people are told that we were squandermaniacs and that costs could be cut and cut immediately.</P>
    <P>The other charge made against us was that, even squandermaniacs though we were, far too much was being collected in taxes.  I remember hearing people speaking in Athlone and canvassers going around explaining to the people the old law of diminishing returns.  We had it all over Westmeath-Longford&mdash;the Government had lost its sense of decency towards the people; if they decreased the print by 2d. they would get money back because the people would start to drink more, that they did not know what they were doing, but just appeared to want to bleed the people white.</P>
    <P>That was the talk.  It was nothing to do with Deputy McGilligan's extraordinarily tortuous economic thinking: it was simply the atmosphere, the fact that the election was fought in an atmosphere of hysteria and the purpose of this debate is to show that up and to say to the Government: &ldquo;Now we know that none of these charges made against us was true.&rdquo;  That is what lies behind all this talk of the balance of payments.  It means absolutely nothing fundamentally because the farther Deputies of the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party got from the staid official platform speeches from the Taoiseach during the election, the wilder the propaganda became until the <Col N="1652" /> point was reached at which the Fine Gael canvassers got into the Fine Gael public-house and started banging the bottles of stout on the counter and saying: &ldquo;Boys, you know what to do next Thursday&rdquo;, and that was the election.</P>

      <P>The past two and a half hours have been noticeable for the fact, in the first place, that Deputies in the Opposition said very little in reference to this year's Finance Bill and in the second place, succeeded&mdash; the three Deputies who spoke&mdash;in contradicting each other as fast as they could.  We had at one stage from Deputy de Valera one point of view; Deputy Derrig gave us a different viewpoint; and now Deputy Childers has given us a viewpoint which could be paraphrased by saying that he believes that taxation is not high enough.  That would be a fair enough paraphrase of the speech we have just heard from him.</P>
      <P>However, let me first deal with some of the points raised by the Leader of the Opposition.  The Leader of the Opposition suggested that everything stemmed from the £15,000,000, and I twitted him the other night by telling him I thought he was taking it rather like a gramophone machine.  His speech to-night was intended to be a somewhat similar repetition, though in longer words.  The Budget of 1952 about which he was speaking followed the end of the financial year 1951-52. The Attorney-General has dealt with some of the items which had been included for the sole purpose of giving the impression to the country that the Budget introduced by the Attorney-General in May, 1951, was an unbalanced one.  The manner in which the out-turn of that financial year was bolstered deliberately by the inclusion of the fuel losses over earlier years has been stressed often and often in this House.  Deputy McGilligan gave some figures in reference to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were other things that were included in 1951-52 and there were other, things that were not included, though an honest Government would <Col N="1653" /> have included them.  In the latter category, I particularly want to refer to one method&mdash;quite dishonestly politically, in my view&mdash;by which they omitted to return in that year £400,000 of revenue that should have been returned.  When one is speaking from the point of view of balancing a Budget, and particularly when it is the Budget of one's predecessor, one should certainly compare like with like. When Deputy McGilligan was Minister for Finance, in 1951, on 31st March of that year, the balance carried by the revenue was £1,953,000.  Deputy McGilligan has, in fact, in an earlier debate put on record that he proposed to use some of that carry-over, that he thought at the time it was too large and that a smaller carry-over would be sufficient.  He proposed to use some of it for budgetary purposes, if necessary, at the end of the year.</P>
    <P>Be that as it may, there can undoubtedly be a case made for the previous Government that they were not desirous of carrying out that intention.  There can undoubtedly be a case made that they would wish to adopt a different policy, but there can be no case whatever made for a Government that was trying to suggest that its predecessor had failed to balance the Budget refusing to carry into the finance accounts of that year moneys to the amount of £400,000 which had been collected by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>As I have said, at the end of 31st March, 1951, the balance was £1,593,000; at the end of the 31st March, 1952, it was £2,355,000 in addition to the £402,000, which I want to say quite categorically, was omitted deliberately by the previous Government for the purpose of unbalancing, by the addition of that amount, the Budget made by their predecessor.  It was a politically dishonest trick.  So far as the figures of the actual turn out for 1951-52 are concerned they have been discussed.  The allegation made by my predecessor of a deficit was covered by the fact that there was included in it the amount for the fuel subsidies, the amount for C.I.E. stockpiling and certain other items that had been deliberately included by the Fianna Fáil <Col N="1654" /> Government.  I propose to be very generous to them, and so I will take all these at the figure of £4,000,000.  I could very well make a case for a very much larger sum, but as I want to be generous to them, I will take it at £4,000,000.</P>
    <P>If we turn to the actual expenditure for 1951-52, the supply services and the non-capital expenditure, we will find that it was £80,581,000.  By taking off the £4,000,000, to which I have referred, we will see, therefore, that the expenditure was in the region of some £76,500,000.  If we turn to the payments table explanatory of the Budget which showed the £15,000,000 deficit to which Deputy de Valera referred, and if we deduct from that the amount that is included for capital services, we will find that supply services were estimated to total, including the £3,000,000 for social welfare, £88,866,000.  It seems perfectly clear that the £15,000,000 to which Deputy de Valera referred consisted&mdash; taking the Central Fund into account&mdash; of a sum of £14.2 million which the Fianna Fáil Party themselves deliberately created in their estimate.  It was their estimate and it was because of the manner in which they allowed expenditure to rise from 1951-52 to 1952-53 by this sum of £14,000,000 that was responsible entirely for that gap and for that figure.</P>
    <P>If Deputy de Valera thinks it is good policy for him to continue to advertise the fact that a Government which failed to make any effort to keep the Estimates of expenditure within bounds, then so far as I am concerned I am quite happy to allow him to continue to do that.  But he, unfortunately, having built these things into the permanent financial structure of the nation it is a very difficult task for anyone to be able to remove them thereafter.  They were built in by him, and I am afraid that on that account many of them will have to remain.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to go over many of the other things which were mentioned by the three Deputies opposite who spoke to-night.  I do not want to say this: they told us at one stage to-night that they had adopted a policy that was going to deal&mdash;they claimed it did deal successfully&mdash;with the disequilibrium <Col N="1655" /> in the balance of payments.  What was the effect of this policy of theirs?  The effect of this policy, comparing like to like, was that after three years of their Government, from June, 1951, to June, 1954, there were 19,000 more people registered as unemployed.  If they think that is a record of which they should boast, then equally they are welcome to that boast.</P>
    <P>We also had the suggestion from them this evening that they had succeeded in creating industrial production. Again, what are the figures and the facts?  The facts are that in 1951 there were 226,000 people employed in industrial production, and that in 1952 that figure had fallen to 221,000, a reduction of 5,000 people.  That figure did not get back above the 1951 figure until 1954.  It was only in 1954 that we exceeded the 1951 figure of 226,000 people by the number of 228,000.</P>
    <P>Deputy Childers suggested that the present Government could have done nothing over the period of last year to effect any change in the national economy or to bring about any improvement in the results so far as our economy is concerned.  The Deputy overlooks one fundamental thing, and that is that the first essential for the success of any policy of production, or the policy of any Government, is that the people should have confidence in that Government.  It is common knowledge throughout the country that during the three years in which Fianna Fáil were in power, from 1951 to 1954, the people had not got that confidence: that the people were anxious and jittering all the time because of the fact that they had no confidence in the then Government.  But the position to-day and since this Government was elected has been exactly the reverse. Ever since the election of this Government, with its stable majority obtained last year, there has been an air of confidence and calm throughout the country which is the first prerequisite to any kind of economic or business activity.  It is that confidence which commenced the revival of which I have spoken on other occasions.</P>
    <P>Deputy Childers came back to the question of interest rates, to the loan <Col N="1656" /> of 1952 and the use of the Marshall Aid moneys was mentioned in that regard also.  So far as the expenditure of the Marshall Aid Counterpart Fund. by the previous Government on certain items is concerned, I am not quarrelling with it.  What I am quarrelling with is that the time that was chosen for that spending was wrong.  The time was wrong because they missed the boat and failed completely to judge the market for the issue of a public loan. The position that existed under the previous Administration was clear.  The Marshall Aid Funds were being utilised as a margin for manoeuvre, as a reserve to throw in and overcome temporary difficulties, and to fill up the deficit, if there might be such a deficit, in regard to capital programmes. But, instead of using it that way, the Fianna Fáil Government deliberately threw all that away and decided that they would utilise it entirely rather than go to the people for a loan in 1951.  The effect of doing that was that they had to go to the market and to the public in the autumn of 1952, at the worst time that they could possibly have chosen from the date they came into office until they went out of office.  It was their bad choice of timing that led to the most unfortunate results that flowed from that high interest policy of that time.</P>
    <P>In the course of my work during the past year I have had to consult people on various matters such as loans, and so forth&mdash;people who are well qualified to speak.  Every one of them with whom I spoke told me the same thing &mdash;that the time chosen in the autumn of 1952 was the worst possible time.  It was chosen because, for political Party purposes, the previous Government wished to create a spirit and a propaganda about the Marshall Aid moneys.  Deputy Childers referred to changes in rates throughout the world. Of course there were changes in rates throughout the world.  I would concede at once that it would be wrong to consider rates of interest here and prices of Government stocks here at one time with independent rates at another time.  What we can do easily enough, however, because of our currency position here, is to take our rates of interest on any one date and <Col N="1657" /> compare them with British rates of interest for comparable securities on the same date.</P>
    <P>What is the record of the previous Government there?  In June, 1951, 3 per cent.  Exchequer Bonds yielded a return of £3 10s. 10d.  British 3 per cent.  Savings Bonds in June, 1951, yielded a return of £3 10s. 5d.  There is no difference there, to all intents and purposes&mdash;a mere 5d. between the interest rates of the two.  We come to the 1st June, 1954.  Irish 3 per cent. Exchequer Bonds yielded a return of £4 6s. 6d.  British 3 per cent.  Savings Bonds yielded a return of £3 11s. 5d. What does that mean?  It means that, compared with an equivalent British security, the record of three years of Fianna Fáil Government meant that ours had gone down to such an extent that there was a difference of 15/-, or 3/4 per cent., in interest rate comparison. If Deputy Childers or the Leader of the Opposition thinks it is wise to boast about that surrender then he is welcome to the advertisement.</P>
    <P>I might add to that, in passing, that the position the last time I got the figures&mdash;last month&mdash;was that the comparison now is £4 8s. against £4 5s. 4d. In other words, the 15/- margin that Deputy de Valera left us with, because of the manner in which he sapped the confidence of the community, has now been narrowed to a mere 2/8.  Those are the facts.  It is far better that facts should be allowed to speak rather than that people should try and invent cases to suit themselves <i>ex post facto.</i></P>
    <P>We did have from Deputy de Valera this evening one <i>ex post facto</i> excuse for the Budget of 1952 and for the policy they brought in at that time in their period of office.  We had a different explanation from Deputy Derrig and, again, a different explanation from Deputy Childers.  None of these explanations was the explanation given by Deputy MacEntee when he was Minister for Finance at the time.  In view of all the interpretations which are now attempted to be given <i>ex post facto</i>, is it not far better to look at the results&mdash;and the results, as I have given them this evening, are pretty sorry ones for the previous Government?</P>

      <P>Deputy de Valera knows perfectly well the loans which were floated in that period and he knows the rate of capital expenditure. He knows that the reason he accelerated that, and did not keep it as a marginal reserve, was because his Government decided to cancel the decision of Deputy McGilligan and not to go for a loan in the early autumn of 1951 but to postpone that to 1952. When he took that decision, the inevitable concomitant of it was that he would utilise the Marshall Aid Funds in their entirety and would not keep them as a cushion of reserve.  I think his decision postponing a loan issue until the autumn of 1952 was the worst possible decision that could have been taken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>Having dealt with various sub-heads, I would like now to say a few words on what appears to be Government policy in regard to the Army.  I think personally that it is grossly unfair to the Army that every <Col N="1660" /> time there is a change of Government there is also a change of policy in regard to the Army.  Members of the Army themselves are precluded from any participation in politics, and quite rightly so, but it is an extraordinary thing that, despite that, they find themselves the victims of politics.  I remember making statements about this in the period of the former Minister of the Coalition Government, mentioning the facts I am mentioning now, expressing the same regret.</P>
      <P>When I reassumed office in 1951, one of the first tasks I imposed upon myself was to go around the various barrack posts in the different commands and examine the situation that existed there.  I found there were very large barracks capable of holding thousands of men and occupied only by hundreds. I found large dormitories or barrack rooms, that would hold anything up to 30 or 40 men, occupied by three or four men.  I met that all over the place. I do not have to impress on Deputies how depressing that must have been to those who found themselves isolated in these large dormitories.</P>
      <P>I was told that the reason why this was happening was for the purpose of keeping those rooms in condition and always ready for occupation if the necessity should arise.  That meant additional fatigues for men who were already suffering from the effects of excessive guard duty and so on, as a result of the smaller numbers.  That is not going to raise the morale of an Army and an Army must possess the highest possible standard of morale if it is to carry out the work for which it was established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The securing of the freedom of this country took centuries.  There were centuries of suffering and sacrifice before the measure of freedom which we enjoy to-day was eventually secured. I feel it is the duty of any Government elected and given the responsibility of carrying out the affairs of the State, to see that as far as lies within their power the largest possible Army, commensurate with what the State can afford, should be made available for the protection of that freedom.  It should not be easily lost and it can be safeguarded only by having an Army <Col N="1661" /> of the peace-time strength, which was the minimum recommended by the Army authorities, namely, 12,500 men.</P>
    <P>It is a peculiar thing that in every Book of Estimates since 1946 or 1947, that 12,000 has appeared regularly.  We all know what happened in the previous 3½ years of Coalition Government, we all know that the Army was allowed to be reduced to an alarmingly small number.  We know that the Minister at that time gave voice to the views that, as far as he was concerned, there was no necessity for a large Army.  I hope nobody here thinks that 12,500 is a large Army&mdash;it would not represent a division in a normal ordinary Army. That was his view, that the Army was required here only for the purpose of ceremony or to give aid to the civil power in time of stress and danger. My colleagues and I have no objection to that; it is the natural procedure in every country in the world to use the Army for ceremonial purposes and to aid the civil power in time of stress and danger and there is no objection to it.  I do not think we utilise it to the fullest extent for ceremonial purposes. I believe the more it is used in that way the closer it will be brought to the people and the more the people will have regard for it.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of the necessity for having a reasonably strong Defence Force, and that is that it serves as a reservoir for filling up the Reserve.  A force of 12,500 is small, but it provides a Reserve at least, when it is established at that rate.  It is very difficult to keep it static at that rate.  I know from my own experience it was almost impossible, even though we raised the largest number of men in normal times that ever was raised in this State, though the medium of a recruiting campaign.  I feel, nevertheless, that it provides that reservoir to the a Reserve and if we can get anything from 2,000 to 3,000 regularly flowing from the Army into the Reserve, in the course of time you are bound to have in reserve an Army of highly-trained, well disciplined men who can be called out in an emergency at very short notice.</P>
    <P>It is due to the Army, if responsibility is placed on the Army for preserving <Col N="1662" /> the peace of this nation so far as it is humanly possible to preserve it and prevent anything in the nature of invasion, that it should be properly equipped and manned and it is up to this House to ensure that the Army is provided with all the manpower and equipment that the State can make available.</P>
    <P>What is happening at the present? time?  As far as I can see the policy of letting things drift is operating once more.  When I left the Department the strength of the Army was something over 10,000 men; to-day it is in the region of 8,000 and I believe it will decrease very rapidly in the near future because of the fact that the 4,000-odd recruited in 1952 will be due for release unless they sign on for additional service.  They are due for release any time from now on.  In fact I believe that that exodus is now taking place.</P>
    <P>A recruiting campaign was initiated by the Minister early this year but it was a half-hearted effort and it petered out, as the Minister himself admitted in the course of his speech.  It was more or less a failure and it could not have been otherwise because there was no enthusiasm behind the effort and, if one wants to succeed in a matter of that kind, one must have enthusiasm. Now I am quite satisfied that the enthusiasm was there in the Army; it must have been there because the Army is always pressing for strength, for equipment and for the means of ensuring that they can carry out their responsibility.  I can only assume therefore that the enthusiasm was not there at the head; those responsible were not earnest in their desire to keep the Army at the strength at which it should be kept.  If it was possible to secure 4,000 odd men by recruiting in 1951-52, I cannot see any reason why it should not be possible to do the same thing again now provided the same enthusiasm is behind the effort.</P>

      <P>There are other reasons why we should have a strong Army.  I <Col N="1663" /> do not like using the word &ldquo;strong&rdquo; because it seems to me to be somewhat inapt.  Outsiders might be inclined to think it rather humorous to refer to an Army of 12,500 as a strong Army. Apart from the fact that such an Army will supply the Reserve necessary, there is the other aspect that, if we are really serious about preserving the neutrality of this State, then we ought at least provide the means by which we can protect that neutrality.  No nation will take our statements that we are a neutral nation seriously if we do not ourselves make an effort to show that we can protect that neutrality; and the only way we can prove that is by keeping the Army at the highest possible strength and keeping the Reserve continually supplied with ever-increasing numbers.</P>
      <P>We have, of course, the voluntary service.  I am glad to hear from the Minister that that service appears to be increasing in numbers.  That is very desirable but this country will always have to depend in the main on the highly trained, highly skilled and highly disciplined regular soldiers and the Reserve, the men who have taken on the task of soldiering professionally and who have equipped themselves with the ability to carry out that task effectively.  Everyone remembers that it was from the somewhat limited sources of regular soldiers, augmented to some extent by the officers of the volunteers, that the splendid emergency Army was trained and disciplined.  The possibility is that we shall not get the time that we had in those years to do the same thing again, and, if the time were shortened, the building up of an Army would have to be done by the most efficient possible men we could obtain.  Naturally those men would be the highly trained effectives who went through Army training proper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is then another aspect and I think it is one which deserves some consideration.  I refer to the possible effect of a strong Army in relation to the question of Partition.  We have had members of this House&mdash;Deputies of the Coalition Parties and of the <Col N="1664" /> Fianna Fáil Party and Ministers&mdash; representing this State abroad at Strasbourg and elsewhere.  On every, occasion on which our representatives have spoken on the question of Partition they have done their utmost to influence opinion abroad in relation to the Partition problem, always in the hope that they would gain sympathy, a sympathy which might be effective at some later date in solving this problem of Partition.</P>
    <P>Most of those they addressed must have been fully aware that, while we were a neutral nation, we might not be in a position to effectively protect our neutrality and, for that reason, they may not have been as interested in Partition as we would hope they would be.  I am pretty certain that what obsesses these people is always the possibility of the danger of attack on themselves.  They would not be too concerned really as to whether we were or were not neutral: what they would be concerned about is the danger of this territory falling into the hands of someone who would use it effectively against themselves.  They might be more sympathetic about the Partition question if they could be assured that such an eventuality was not likely to arise and that we could at least hold our territory until such time possibly as we would receive the necessary help to ensure the expulsion of invading forces.  I think that is a matter deserving of serious consideration from the Government.</P>
    <P>Some short time ago I read an article in an English newspaper purporting to represent the official view. I do not know who was representing that official view but the article was alleged to have been written by an Irish correspondent.  It stated that the introduction of the A and H bombs had changed the whole outlook of the authorities in this nation with regard to defence; that the weapons with which the Army was equipped were now obsolete.  I do not know who the official was or, in fact, if there was an official view&mdash;it may have been one of these articles written by someone who just simply wanted to write that type of article and wanted to show what he knew&mdash;but whoever the official was I <Col N="1665" /> can say this much that I am certain the view did not represent the view of any member of the Army.  At least, I hope it did not, because the use of these bombs, either the atom bomb or the hydrogen bomb, on this nation would just as effectively deter the enemy from using our territory as it would affect the population of the nation and if such a weapon were used on this nation I can only assume it would be used as an act of vengeance.</P>
    <P>That brings us to the only other possible means by which the nation could be attacked.  It could be attacked from the land, it could be attacked from the sea, or it could be attacked from the air and in my opinion the Army of the present day and which has been so well equipped, and which I hope will be better equipped, could resist for a considerable time such an invasion.  In any case, we have to assume always that such an invasion would be carried out by one of the warring elements involved in some world strife, and again, it would be a question, as it was in the past, of retaining our territory for the longest possible time until such time as we could receive help from one of the other interested parties in such a world strife.</P>
    <P>That is the reason why I think that the Government should ensure the continuation of the Army at the highest possible strength that it is possible to secure and I am prepared to admit that it is difficult to secure that high strength, and I am prepared to admit that even with the strenuous efforts which I made and which I pushed to the uttermost limits, that we did not even reach the maximum figure, but it was not for want of effort.  Therefore, I say to the Minister, there should be no let-up in the effort to secure recruits and they will not be secured through the medium of half-hearted efforts such as the effort that was made in the recent recruiting campaign.  That is all I can describe the effort as&mdash;a half-hearted effort.</P>
    <P>As far as this State is concerned, the Army of the State is purely a defence force; it has no aim of securing territory outside the four shores of Ireland <Col N="1666" /> and I do not think&mdash;although the Minister made some allusions to it in the course of his statement&mdash;that we need be interested in securing any of these nuclear weapons.  I do not see to what use we could put them if we had them, and, therefore, I think it is safe to say that any money that would be likely to be expended ought to be expended on weapons that the Army authorities themselves are recommending. They are still seeking weapons of a particular type.  These, I understand, are available and when I was leaving the Department we had actually carried out tests with the particular type of weapon in which they were interested.</P>
    <P>I would be anxious to know if the Minister or the Department, through the Minister, has secured any of these weapons or secured them even to the extent to which I had got the authority of the Government.  I would be glad to think that we were securing additional equipment and it was for that reason I made the appeal to the Minister to-day that the £800,000 which exists under sub-head P of the Estimate should be utilised to the uttermost limits in securing this equipment which is now available.  Nobody can say that the reason why the money was spent was because the equipment was not available.  It is fully available at the present time and I think the Minister could make a special effort to secure as much as possible of that equipment.</P>
    <P>That, I think, is as much as I desire to say on this Estimate.  I would conclude by again making this appeal; the freedom which obtains in this country to-day was dearly-bought freedom and it ought to be protected in the fullest possible way, and I am perfectly satisfied that, as far as the Army itself is concerned, if the necessity should ever arise to put the training, the discipline and the weapons which they have been given into effect, that that will be done and done in a courageous and splendid manner.  I have no doubt whatever about that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to intrude very long on this debate, but there are certain facts of Army training to which I would like to draw <Col N="1667" /> the Minister's attention.  There is quite a wide range of new weapons available to the Army on which a good deal of training has been done by Army personnel themselves.  I think it would be very wise for the Minister for the purpose of encouraging and making interesting the training of the F.C.A. to have these weapons made available to them for instruction purposes as early as possible.  I do not altogether subscribe to some of the views expressed by the former Minister and I feel that we have to face the reality of the situation and realise that in the future much of our main Reserve strength is going to be in the F.C.A. and that if we are to maintain the growing expansion of the F.C.A. we can only do it by a diversion of interests and by making available to them as quickly as possible the variety of new weapons now available to the Army.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister will have to explain to the Dáil, and through the Dáil to the country, what the real difficulties are with regard to the First Line Reserve.  We have had a good deal of discussion over the years and some of us have been very insistent, both during the former tenancy of office of the Ministers of the inter-Party group and during the tenure of office of Deputy Traynor that something should be done to ameliorate the general conditions of the Reserve. There were tremendous difficulties created&mdash;I am saying this deliberately &mdash;by slowness of progress and practical stagnation of promotion in the Reserve.  If the regulations are to be continued to be interpreted in the manner that the civil branch of the Army interpret them, interest in the Reserve will become even less.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other difficulties with which the Minister must come to grips as rapidly as possible in the peace time situation.  There is a good deal of discontent in relation to the housing of married personnel.  There has been a good deal of difficulty over the years in relation to the making of some kind of an arrangement with local authorities as to the practicabilty of supplying houses for personnel leaving the Army.  These are problems <Col N="1668" /> that are vital in the general question of morale as referred to by the former Minister.</P>
    <P>Is it true that there will be such an extraordinary wastage of men at the end of this period of service?  Is there any real fear on the Minister's part that there will not be a substantial take-on for new periods by those who are now arriving at the end of their first period of service?  If there is to be such wastage as mentioned by Deputy Traynor, there must be something radically wrong somewhere within the Army and there is no good in coming here to talk about building an Army up to a strength of 12,500 if the situation is as indicated by the former Minister that the 4,000 recruits built up from 1951 to 1952 are likely, in the main, not to elect to take on for a further period of service.</P>
    <P>I do not believe for a moment that there is any validity in the argument that there is some extraordinary difference as between 10,000 or 12,000 men when we are dealing with the question of neutrality or the protection of the neutrality of this island.  I have said repeatedly, and I say again, that whenever the situation arrives in this country that people are required to rally to the defence of the nation there has never been any shortage of men forthcoming.  If the Minister can nurture that impetus which is now in the F.C.A. by fostering it with training in a variety of weapons and breaking down the monotony of their training by a constructive, cohesive, advanced type of training for them and a stimulation of an advanced type of competition within that body, he will be building a reservoir of the type of Irishman who has always been in the vanguard of the defence of any cause which the nation found itself fighting for, the volunteer type of soldier who is learning the art so that he can perfect himself for any eventuality.</P>
    <P>I shall not delay the House.  I do not want to traverse the question of Army policy.  I feel the Minister should be slightly guarded about any ill-judged haste in buying equipment merely because it is now freely available. We must be realists and adapt <Col N="1669" /> ourselves to the time and the situation.</P>
    <P>I would support one facet of Deputy Traynor's argument, that the Minister should be directing more and more attention to civil defence.  In the course of the last week we have read of immense air raid precautions against atomic raids that are being carried out in other countries.  I am not for a moment suggesting that we might indulge in that elaborate type of temporary evacuation or trial evacuation but I do nor think the time has come for some dissemination of information and for training of the people in the technique of civil defence that might be needed in the event of the world being stricken by another catastrophe of war.</P>
    <P>I shall not for a moment subscribe to the suggestion made by Deputy Traynor that there was only one basis on which the nation might be attacked. He suggested that if somebody used nuclear weapons against this country they might make it impracticable for themselves to use the country subsequently as a base.  I do not think there is any reality in that argument. I should hope that such a catastrophe would not befall the nation, as I am sure Deputy Traynor also hopes, but I do feel that the Minister will have to direct the people's minds by a course of training that will attune them to the civil defensive measures that would be practicable in the event of such an occurrence.</P>
    <P>The whole trend of equipment is changing so rapidly that I do not think it is wise for the Government or the Minister to rush into purchases at the moment.  I understand from examination of the situation and from discussions that the Army is reasonably equipped in the type of weapons we might call traditional.  Any purchases should be designed towards introducing more modern technique and more modern weapons.  Above all, the Minister must get to grips as quickly as possible with the task of making available the basis of civil defence in the event of an attack by nuclear weapons.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>One point mentioned by Deputy Collins is, in my opinion, of grave importance, that is, the question of housing.  Year after year, Deputies have mentioned the problem in relation to the housing of married members of the Army and we understand that the situation is grave in Dublin.  The same difficulty arises in the case of men who are retiring.  It is vitally important that the men of the Army should be housed.  Deputy Traynor knows that we had to mention on previous occasions the position in regard to men stationed in the South. It is appalling that men in such a service should be deprived of the right of decent homes.  The number of married quarters available in the South of Ireland is anything but satisfactory. The right of a soldier to decent living accommodation to rear his young family is vitally important. I remember raising this matter before in this House and pointing out that, were it not for the fact that local authorities were so willing to cooperate in the allocation of local authority houses, the Department of Defence would have to face this problem much sooner than they intend to do.</P>
      <P>As regards the other matters mentioned by Deputy Collins and Deputy Traynor, it is quite obvious that we are inclined to take different views as regards the strength of the Army.  I have said before and I say again that, even before the period of 1948, the so-called strength of the Army was only paper strength and Deputy Traynor must know that the reports which were submitted to him as Minister in that period showed that a recruiting campaign could not be successful and was not successful owing to the conditions under which many of the men had to serve during the emergency period.  I move to report progress.</P>
      <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>

      <P>The book value referred to is presumably a written-down value allowing for depreciation. This figure, which is not required for Vote accounting purposes, is not available. The purchase cost of the engineering plant and machinery held by the Commissioners of Public Works on the 31st March, 1955, for drainage purposes, excluding minor items such as lighting sets, drilling equipment, tools, etc., was approximately £1,100,000.</P>
