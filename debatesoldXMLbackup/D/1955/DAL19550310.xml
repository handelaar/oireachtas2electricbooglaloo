      <P>Would the Minister inform us whether he has made any study of the cost of tea at the rate of 3/- a lb. on the taxpayers down here, subsidising the Six County consumers? I am sure the Minister at least has been looking at the outgoings of tea month by month or week by week. Could he give us a calculation as to how much the Twenty-Six County taxpayer is paying by way of subsidy to the Northern tea consumer?</P>

      <P>This is a repetition of the question the Deputy asked the other day.  At the risk of repetition on my side, I repeat what I said to him then, that unfortunately those gentlemen who indulge in smuggling operations do not fill in returns showing what they have dealt with but it is our belief that there has been comparatively little smuggling of tea, that in fact the position has been that anything in that respect has been to date infinitesimal.  If we did not get the powers for which we ask in this Bill, however, the situation might be created in which there would be difficulties of the kind visualised by Deputy Aiken.  I am not in a position to give him any figures and all I can say to him is that in the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners the amount involved is not of any grave consequence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasOHara" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>I was saying last night <Col N="330" /> that the fact that the present Government found it possible to reduce the Estimates by £2.77 million has caused a lot of anxiety and worry to the Fianna Fáil Party.  That was very noticeable from the debate and from the speeches of the Deputies on the Fianna Fáil side of the House.  When it is taken into consideration that the present Government reduced butter by 5d. per lb. by the device known as subsidy, I think that is an achievement.</P>
      <P>We learn now from the Fianna Fáil Benches, from the ex-Taoiseach and other Deputies, what we might have expected if Fianna Fáil were in office. In regard to the cost of living, it is generally appreciated that butter is one of the most important, if not the most important, item of human food. When it is taken into consideration that that important item of human food is put beyond the reach of the ordinary working man it is a very serious thing, particularly when you consider that the working people in our towns and cities did not get increases in wages to make it possible for them to buy butter.</P>
      <P>Is it not a better policy to subsidise butter and make it available for the poor of our cities and towns than to put a price on it which is beyond the reach of those people?  We all know that under-fed people are in danger of losing their health, and, ultimately, many of these people find their way to sanatoria or to our other institutions. I think it is a far better policy that this or any other Government would use the means at their disposal to subsidise such an important article of food as butter and make it available to these people than to pay for their maintenance and treatment in institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same applies to tea.  We all know what we might have expected in that regard also if the Fianna Fáil Party were now in office.  They have clearly indicated that they did not believe in the devices used by the present Government to keep down the cost of living.  I have in mind the plight of many workers in towns like Ballina, Castlebar and the City of Dublin. What would happen if these prices had been allowed to soar, as was suggested <Col N="331" /> by the Fianna Fáil Party, particularly if increases in wages were not granted to these workers?  We can appreciate also that in many of these industries which are private industries it is rather difficult to compel those in control to increase workers' wages to compensate for these increases.</P>
    <P>I know many workers in the town of Ballina and elsewhere who are on wages ranging from £3 to £6.  People who are in receipt of wages of £7, £8, £9, £10, £11 and £12&mdash;they are few&mdash; I am not so much concerned about, but I do know that many of these workers would be obliged to go without the necessities of life if Fianna Fáil were in office to-day, on their own declared policy.</P>
    <P>The principle of subsidy is something that I am not too keen on, but at the same time it must be appreciated that, when it is absolutely necessary to pay subsidies on certain foodstuffs, it is really a good thing that the subsidy system exists.  It has been practised in the case of industrial and other concerns which have been subsidised for a period of years, but I think that in a matter of this kind it is really a good thing that the subsidy system is in existence and that this Government has put it into practice.  The Fianna Fáil Party were amazed that it was possible for the present Government to reduce the Estimates by £2.77 million odd and at the same time to reduce the price of butter by 5d. per lb. and keep tea prices at their present level.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Party professes to have a monopoly of patriotism.  In that regard I do not deny that there are good men in the Fianna Fáil Party, men who have shown themselves to be good in the past, but at the same time I think they should show appreciation for the achievements of the present Government for the short time they are in office.  I think it is a heartening thing to think that men of the Fine Gael Party, Labour Party, Clann na Poblachta Party and our own Party come together and are prepared to work together in this House in the national good.  It is a regrettable state of affairs that the Fianna Fáil Party would set themselves to the task <Col N="332" /> of trying to drive a wedge between the various Parties forming the inter-Party groups.  These tactics are to be deplored.</P>
    <P>After all, they had a long term of office, something like 19 years in all, and one would expect them to appreciate the fact that there are people in this country who are able to run the country a lot better than they were.  They enjoyed a long term of office and they had plenty of opportunities of doing the things they now say this Government should have done in the past eight months, but they did not do them.</P>
    <P>I was a young man when I listened to the speeches of the Fianna Fáil Party on various platforms.  The promise they made then was that if they were returned to office they would industrialise the country.  I will concede that certain little industries have been started in different parts of the country, but I think that where the Fianna Fáil Party really slipped up was that in doing all the shouting and promising&mdash;and we have not seen any great achievements or results&mdash; they forgot the main industry, agriculture.</P>
    <P>That accounts in great measure for their failure as a Government.  They failed to appreciate the importance of agriculture and we had over a long period of years a gentleman as Minister for Agriculture who, in my opinion, was unsuited for that position&mdash;Deputy Dr. Ryan.  I have no doubt that he is an exceptionally good medical man, but, as Minister for Agriculture, he made the greatest hash of things that could possibly be made.  If Fianna Fáil in their time had realised and appreciated the importance of agriculture and had started schemes of arterial drainage, land reclamation and so on, our country would be in a far better and happier position to-day.</P>
    <P>The former Taoiseach thought fit to criticise the Minister for Lands with regard to his Estimate and the Minister in his speech last night pointed out that there was a carry-over of something like £75,000 in his Department which made it possible for him to reduce his Estimate to a certain extent. That sum will come in useful for the <Col N="333" /> acquisition of land and the extension of forestry.  The former Taoiseach talked a lot about cheek and audacity, but I wonder what the Fianna Fáil Party did about forestry.  Certainly they did very little about it in Mayo and precious little about it in any other part of the country.  The figures are there, and as Deputy MacBride pointed out, there was, in 1948, a sum of only £8,000 voted for the forestry section.  These figures speak for themselves. I am confident, having had experience of Deputy Blowick in that Department, that he is most enthusiastic and really determined that the money now available to him will be spent.</P>
    <P>The Forestry Section is one of the most important sections.  It has a great potential from the point of view of employment and also from the point of view that thousands of acres of poor quality land which are unsuitable for agricultural purposes can be acquired and planted.  In areas in my part of the country such as Bangor-Erris, Ballycroy and Achill, the people are obliged to emigrate to England in their thousands and they have been doing that for quite a long time under a native Government and in these areas forestry is one of the best means we have of giving productive and long-term employment.  It is regrettable that Fianna Fáil in their time did not do something about planting these waste lands.</P>
    <P>Consider the plight of the small landholder of £2, £3 or £4 valuation.  We can appreciate how hard it is for that man and his wife to bring up a big family and it is regrettable that where there are seven, eight and nine children in a house, as the father and mother grow older, there is not a prospect in the world of one member of that family staying at home with them in their old age.  These schemes of afforestation are the type of schemes I should like to recommend and have recommended for the short time I have been in the House and I am glad to see from the Estimate and from the report of the Forestry Department that the Minister has sufficient money at his disposal to extend forestry.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="334" /> The question of country roads is a burning problem for our Government and they have shown their sympathy in this regard with the people concerned. We have a very great mileage of roads in this country and particularly in the country from which I come. We find organised groups in many parts of the country protesting about conditions which prevail in this matter and we find cases of farmers, who, in many instances, put in their crops, work hard all year to save these crops and then find that they are unable to get them home.</P>
    <P>That is a sad state of affairs, but it has been allowed to continue for a long number of years, and it is one of the contributing factors to emigration. Young boys and girls and old people as well, living in remote parts of the country, when they find they have not got a decent road to travel on, naturally become disgusted and lose all faith and confidence in native Government. They have been promised that all these things would be done if certain Governments were elected to office, but these promises have been broken and I am glad to see that, in this Book of Estimates, additional financial provision is made for country roads.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>I sincerely hope that at a later date it will be possible, with the passage of time, to make further increased grants for these worthwhile projects.  They give a lot of employment to the small landholder and members of his family.  They mean a cash income for at least one or two members of the family in these poorer areas and help these individuals to provide the ready cash for the purchase of the necessaries of life for the household.  It is encouraging, therefore, in view of the many difficulties with which this Government was faced when it took office, to see that even a small increase is being made available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter to which I should like to refer is our fishing industry, and the neglect of our piers, slips and harbours. When Deputy Bartley was appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture, his responsibility was then&mdash;as it is the responsibility <Col N="335" /> of the present Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;to look after our piers and slips.  I am afraid this is one place where our native Governments have failed the people completely.  I do not know what the present Government intend to do: I do not know whether it is proposed to put fishing in its proper place as the national industry.  Coming, as I do, from a sea-fishing area, I feel it is a shame that a foreign Government provided piers and slips at various points along our coast and that our native Governments could so neglect that matter.  After all, we were very loud in our criticism of the methods employed by the British Government when they were here.</P>
    <P>We heard speeches about what would be done if we had a native Government. Our fishing industry, we were told, would be developed, and a thousand and one other things would be done.  The sad fact remains that, above all others, our fishing industry seems to be the most neglected of our industries. That is a tragic state of affairs and it will continue so long as our piers and slips are neglected.  It will continue so long as our native Governments do not afford any protection or help to those fishermen who are engaged in a hazardous occupation along our western and other coasts.  The boats in use at the present time are completely out of date.  They are unsuitable, having regard to present-day standards and present-day requirements. I strongly urge on the Government the importance of developing that industry.</P>
    <P>In recent times, I have had an experience in making representations to the Fisheries Branch of the Department of Agriculture here in Dublin.  I was told that it was the Mayo County Council who were holding up the repairs to a certain pier in my constituency, namely, Porturlan pier.  When I directed an inquiry to the Mayo County Council in connection with this matter I was told that the delay was with the Department.  I am now in the position that I do not know who to believe.  It seems to me that there is a lack of co-operation between the Department of Agriculture and the <Col N="336" /> various county councils throughout the country.  I would strongly urge upon the Government the necessity for tackling these problems at the earliest possible date.  We are an island country and we have every possible facility from the point of view of exporting goods from our country.  We are in a very happy position from the point of view of exporting fish from this country&mdash;if only we had the fish available.  While successive native Governments have treated this important industry as they have treated it, I can see no future for it.</P>
    <P>From time to time we discuss industry in this house and we direct questions to the Minister for Industry and Commerce in regard to various aspects of industry.  We are told about the difficulties of securing raw materials or that we have not minerals here or there, and so forth.  If a Party or a Deputy pleads for the establishment of an industry in the West of Ireland the answer will be that the cost of transporting the raw materials over long distances and back again is a very big handicap.  To a certain extent, I can appreciate that fact but when, right outside our doorstep, we have the raw materials there if only we would make use of them, surely it is a regrettable state of affairs that the fishing industry should be in the depressed condition in which it is.</P>
    <P>Another matter which I should like to mention is the plight of some of our small ports.  I have in mind at the moment the port of Ballina.  I see that Deputy Calleary is in the House at the moment.  He will recall that on a recent occasion he, Deputy Lindsay and myself were called to a meeting of the Ballina Chamber of Commerce.  It was a non-political meeting.  The deplorable condition of the Moy harbour, and Ballina port, was brought to our notice.  I think it is a reasonable request to make that the present Government should seriously take up the question of improving the facilities at these various western ports.  I think it was last Saturday week that we received a deputation from Westport Urban Council in connection with the difficulties they have at their port. The Mayo County Council made a <Col N="337" /> certain sum of money available&mdash;just a temporary thing, if you like&mdash;in order to try and keep the port open.  These ports are most important to the life of the country and should get greater consideration from native Governments.</P>
    <P>I have been an exporter in rather a small way for a long number of years. I am quite accustomed to going along to the North Wall with goods two or three days a week.  Quite frequently, you find yourself in a queue with 200 or 300 lorries, particularly during the manure season.  I submit that quite a lot of the goods imported and exported via the North Wall could be dealt with directly from the nearest port which suits the convenience of the persons involved in the transaction. The position at the North Wall is such that a person would require to be there at 12 o'clock at night in order to be sure of getting loaded in the morning&mdash;and even at that a person is not certain of being there early enough. A lot of that traffic should be diverted to our western and other ports.  We hear a lot of talk to the effect that the Government are worrying because Dublin is getting bigger and bigger. Is it any wonder that we should have that state of affairs when the importation and the exportation of goods is handled practically exclusively at the North Wall?  People who live in towns such as Ballina and Westport are entitled to have goods imported and exported via their port.  I appeal to this Government to look into these matters in a serious way.</P>
    <P>I do not believe in getting up in this House and attacking past Administrations for their failures.  Nothing is easier than to stand up and criticise anybody and everybody connected in the past with Government and to point to their failures.  In the light of the knowledge we have now, we can see where the mistakes were made.  We all know that nothing is easier than to criticise.  I am suggesting certain remedies which, if put into effect by the Government, will yield results which will improve the present trend of affairs so far as the migration of our <Col N="338" /> young people from the rural areas to the cities is concerned.  Such action by the present Government would show a desire to keep our rural population, so far as it is humanly possible to do so, in their own neighbourhood and their own environment.  We must make a start somewhere and some time.  In my view, it is of paramount importance to the national economy and to the general well-being of our people that the Government should show an interest in the rural areas by initiating, among other things, schemes of improvement of our ports.</P>
    <P>I remember when the Undeveloped Areas Bill was being discussed in this House.  We were told at that time of the wonderful blessings and benefits that the enactment of that Bill would be likely to bring to our people and I, for one, wished that Bill the very best of good luck.  I regarded it as an important measure as it could have had the effect of improving conditions in what was then described and can now be described as under-developed areas. Despite the fact that that Bill became law, despite all the hopes that were held out to the people in these areas, very little has been done since.  You find in many cases that capital for industry is not forthcoming due to the fact that a big percentage of our people are not wealthy enough and the few that are, are not people who will sink their money in industry here.  I would strongly urge on the Government in that regard, in the light of the experience and knowledge gained by the previous Government&mdash;all their findings are available to the present Minister&mdash;to tackle these problems seriously now.  If they do that I think there is a goodwill abroad towards the present Government.  As proof of that in the present year we had a national loan floated and there was no difficulty whatsoever in having the money subscribed.</P>
    <P>That is a good indication that there is as I say goodwill abroad for our present Government.  But for that goodwill the people expect certain achievements. They expect that the Government will focus its attention on the many problems that still exist.  I <Col N="339" /> think it is a good and healthy thing that on this Vote I should refer to these things.  I have been loud in my criticism of the last Government here on certain matters of this kind, and I pointed out to them on various occasions that through their failure to do something for the people in those poor areas&mdash;many of which are Irish speaking and in which the cream of the country still lives&mdash;many of them were compelled to go to foreign countries to earn a livelihood.  I feel confident the present Government will go its full term despite any tricks that may be played by the other side of the House to try to divide our forces.  That will not happen.  We went before the people and told them that we were seeking authority to represent them in inter-Party Government.  We have got that authority from the people, and having got it, I think it is our duty to realise our responsibilities.</P>
    <P>A good start has been made in the present year.  It is very heartening indeed to our people that at last an inter-Party Government has cried &ldquo;halt&rdquo; to increased taxation.  The proof has been given that our present Government is sincere in its desire to control the increased cost of living, that in the face of these difficulties it has been found possible not alone to hold taxation at the present level but to reduce it by £2.77 million.  It is a clear indication of Government policy, I think, to the people outside, taking into account the amount of money involved in the cost of subsidies, that the cost of living has been kept at what it is. It is an encouraging sign.  I think the people will be fairly well pleased taking them by and large on the results shown in such a short time having regard to the deplorable condition in which we took over this country and the main industry of this country.</P>
    <P>The signs are good when you see the present Minister for Agriculture with his increased Estimate prepared to spend much more money on land projects, when you see the freeze imposed on the land project by the previous Government being thawed out and when you see much more money being sunk in the main industry of this country.  I think these are good signs <Col N="340" /> of the times.  It will all tend towards one very important thing, increasing, first of all, the standard of living of our people and it will also make it possible for us to increase exports from our agricultural land, making it possible, again, to buy more modern machinery from those countries to which we export, thereby reducing the cost of production of necessary foodstuffs. I was never one of those who believed in producing agricultural produce inefficiently and imposing that inefficiency on consumers in our towns and cities.  I would much prefer to think we would increase output on every acre of agricultural land and by that means be able to supply to the people in our cities and towns much more foodstuffs without increasing prices.  By that method the farmers' income could be increased and at the same time our people in the towns and cities could be better fed.</P>
    <P>I think that is a desirable state of affairs and I think that the present Government is moving along those lines.  Having regard, as I said already, to the many obstacles in the way of the present Government, we in the Clann na Talmhan Party feel very proud of the achievements that have been made by the present Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The first Book of Estimates produced by a new Government is usually studied with exceptional care by Deputies and the public. These Estimates give the first reliable indication of the general trend of Government policy and its intentions in regard to administration, a far more reliable indication than speeches made by Ministers at Party rallies.  That interest in the first Estimates of a new Government is naturally enhanced when the Government is one which has made a number of promises, given a number of pledges, to effect changes of a kind which the ordinary man in the street would desire.</P>

    <P>We have now before us the first Book of Estimates of the present Government and I think most Deputies would agree that its outstanding characteristic is that it contemplates very few changes indeed.  There are some changes proposed but they are in <Col N="341" /> the main trivial and few in number. In so far, therefore, as the Estimates reveal the mind of the Government they suggest that no very great changes are intended.  There has been some hoofling with the figures.  There is in the book an indication of what we believe to be the mentality of the Government, an excessive concern with the political appearance of their activities rather than with their practical effect on the life of the country. We know, however, that the Book of Estimates is only one part of the picture. It is still possible for the Government, when presenting its Budget to the House, to make substantial additions to these Estimates or to make substantial deductions from them. Perhaps it is only when we have the Budget before us that we will understand the extent to which the Government regards it as possible to attempt to fulfil the very many pledges and promises which they made when seeking election.  Perhaps we will not know it even then but we certainly have had no indication yet of what the Government regards as practicable in these matters.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said yesterday that the Government had made no promises. That childish pretence deceives nobody.  This Government came into office festooned with promises.  Not every member of the Government has the hardihood to pretend that no pledges were given, no promises made. It is only the Taoiseach who, in his hard-faced way, relies on the notorious brevity of the public memory and displays that contempt for the public intelligence which his speech revealed yesterday.</P>
    <P>This Government came in pledged in as definite a way as any Government could be pledged to cut the cost of Government administration, to reduce taxation by several million pounds, to reduce the burden of local rates, to lower the cost of living and to increase social welfare payments.  In words as definite as a legal document, these pledges were given by members of the Government and these words are on record.  They cannot be repudiated as easily now as the Taoiseach tried to <Col N="342" /> do yesterday.  The public memory may be short but there are some who will exercise themselves to help it.  We have already in this Dáil quoted to Deputies the words they used, reminded them of the pledges they made.  They can be certain they will be constantly reminded of those pledges and they can be sure the public will not be allowed to forget them either.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera when speaking in this debate refered to the undertaking given by the Taoiseach when he was Leader of the Opposition, that if there was a change of Government the cost of Government services would be reduced immediately, within ten minutes, by not less than £10,000,000 a year, possibly by £15,000,000 a year. The Taoiseach said that promise was made in 1952 and, therefore, does not count.  He apparently believes there is some statute of limitations applying to political promises, that after a period of time no claim against them can be made.  The statute of limitations applies apparently only to promises made by members of Fine Gael.  On the last occasion on which I spoke in this House, a pledge which I made in 1929 was quoted and apparently the statute of limitations did not apply to that.</P>

      <P>If the Taoiseach thinks it is unfair to quote against the Government a speech made by members of it in 1952, we can of course give him numerous quotations from speeches made much more recently.  In the course of the election campaign which preceded the change of Government, a number of speeches were broadcast from Radio Éireann.  One of those speeches was made by the financial <Col N="343" /> expert of the Fine Gael Party, Deputy McGilligan.  In effect the Taoiseach yesterday repudiated that speech.  I do not believe that the speech was delivered by Deputy McGilligan without the knowledge of his colleagues in the Fine Gael Party.  Everybody here, I am sure, assumed that when Deputy McGilligan went down to Radio Éireann with the script in his pocket it was a script which had been considered by the committee of the Fine Gael Party, including the present Taoiseach, and approved by them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is precisely the point I am trying to get the House and the public to appreciate, how this confidence trick against them was planned. Deputy McGilligan was sent down to tell the public in an official radio broadcast on behalf of his Party that economies in administration were easily achieved, that there was little doubt as he said that savings in the cost of Government amounting to several million pounds per year could be made without much effort.  The present Taoiseach did not think it necessary then to stand up and say what he said yesterday, that economies would be hard to achieve, and achievement would be slow and arduous.  Is there any Deputy opposite trying to reconcile that pre-election broadcast by Deputy McGilligan with that statement <Col N="344" /> made by the Taoiseach yesterday? Is any one of them thinking of meeting his obligation to the public, to the people whose votes he got, of trying to explain away that sharp difference between what was said before they became a Government, and what was said afterwards.</P>
      <P>The votes which Deputies got and put them into this House in a majority, which made it possible for them to put this Government into office, were secured by reason of the statement made by Deputy McGilligan, that savings in the cost of Government amounting to several millions a year could be made without much effort. But having got these votes, and having put themselves into office, they now change their tune, and tell us that economies will be hard to achieve. They tell us that, instead of making them without much effort, their achievement will be slow and arduous. Deputies can laugh cynically to themselves. They fooled the people, and they are reaping the fruits of their success in fooling them, but there is something far more important at stake than the amusement of members of the Government.  We have a democratic system of government, and its preservation will depend upon public confidence in its operation, public belief in the integrity of public men.  When we have this cynical repudiation of pledges, this hard-faced denial that any pledges were given, then there has been undermined not merely confidence in the integrity of the Deputies opposite, but in the whole system of government which put them here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Leader of the Fine Gael Party, Deputy Mulcahy, also went to Radio Éireann before the election with a prepared script in his pocket.  The script may or may not have been approved by the committee of Fine Gael, but it was assumed by the public to contain the considered views of that Party as to what was possible in regard to the cost of Government, and the reduction of taxation.  Deputy Mulcahy asked the people to replace the Government then in office by another dominated by Fine Gael which would set itself vigorously to reduce the cost of living and taxation.  Right through <Col N="345" /> the whole election campaign this idea was drummed into the public mind, that the cost of administration was unnecessarily high, but it could easily be reduced, and the benefits of that reduction passed on to the public in the form of lower tax rates.  Now we are told that no such promises were made. Within a month of the voting the present Minister for Finance was asserting that no such promises were made.</P>
    <P>The public memory may be short, but it is not all that short.  Every member of the Government, in a most definite way, expressed his conviction that very substantial reductions in the cost of Government were possible, while at the same time various Government services could be expanded.  The Minister for External Affairs, in his election address to the electors of the constituency of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;As a result of the present Government policy you are burdened with higher taxes, higher rates, higher prices, higher cost of living than ever before.  We believe that the policy of Fine Gael can lighten these burdens&mdash;taxes, rates, prices, and the cost of living.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I do not know whether it is necessary to repeat here the specific pledge given by the Government in regard to food prices.  Already I have quoted some of their speeches and some of their election leaflets.  I can do so again.  Everybody in the country knows that the Deputies opposite pledged themselves to reduce food prices in a most definite way.  On behalf of the Labour Party there was an undertaking given that they would not join in a Coalition Government unless they had in advance an undertaking that the price of bread, tea, sugar and butter would be reduced.  I will admit that the promises in relation to prices were far more numerous and far more specific from the Labour Party candidates than from the Fine Gael candidates who relied upon the tactics of suggestion.  They published by the hundreds of thousands a leaflet which appeared to convey an intention of bringing back prices to the 1952 level.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There may well be opportunities of using it before that time.  Also the Labour Party speakers gave specific pledges and undertakings with regard to social welfare services. The leader of that Party, the present Tánaiste, said in the course of a speech in his constituency: &ldquo;If the Labour Party participates in an inter-Party Government it will be a guarantee to the people that the policy of that Government will be directed to the reduction of prices&rdquo;.  He also mentioned certain other advantages and added &ldquo;better old age pensions, better widows' and orphans' pensions, better sickness and unemployment benefits&rdquo;. We have had the Book of Estimates <Col N="350" /> before us and it makes no provision for the dramatic reduction in the cost of administration which Fine Gael spokesmen said before the election were capable of being achieved without much effort as in the words of Deputy McGilligan's election broadcast.</P>
      <P>It makes no provision for the reduction of the burden of local rates by increased subventions from the Central Fund or for the lowering of the cost of living which is now higher than it was when these pledges were being given.  The Book of Estimates makes no provision for increased social welfare services.  I have said already that the Book of Estimates is only one part of the picture.  We shall have the whole picture when the Minister for Finance comes to make his Budget statement.  Perhaps we shall then get some more definite indication of the Government's intentions with regard to the redemption of these pledges.  At the moment we are merely faced with the situation that to date we have the Book of Estimates before us and that there is no provision there for the fulfilment of any of those pledges.  I said here in the course of the discussion on the Supplies and Services Bill that no serious attempt at economies was being made and I asked if any economies had been made.  I said, as I am quoted at column 197 of Volume 148 of the Official Report:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Not in a single Department of the Government&mdash;from the Department of the Taoiseach down to the Department of Lands&mdash;has a single real economy been recorded.  I say on the contrary that the costs of administration in almost every Department have gone up.  I say that, in a few weeks' time, each one of these Departments will come with a bill for administration for 1955 higher than that which they presented for 1954.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Book of Estimates is now before us and I will admit there has been some skill shown in conveying the suggestions that the cost of administration had gone down.  But it is deceptive. The total estimated cost of services chargeable against revenue has been reduced by £1.1 million.  In the <Col N="351" /> main that reduction has been suggested by the device of bringing in as an Appropriation-in-Aid instead of an Exchequer receipt moneys anticipated from the Grant Counterpart Account.  It is a clever device I will admit.  There are certain constitutional and other statutory obligations on the Minister for Finance for handling public revenue but I cannot say it is either unconstitutional or illegal to bring in these Exchequer receipts from the Grant Counterpart Account as Appropriations-in-Aid.  The normal practice would have been to bring them in as Exchequer receipts and deal with them, as Exchequer receipts would be dealt with, in the Budget.</P>
    <P>By bringing them in as an Appropriation-in-Aid the public are being misled into thinking that the cost of Government has been reduced by an equivalent amount.  That is not true. As I have said the Government is far more concerned with the political aspect of its work than with the consequences for the people of this country.  It is desirable that the people of this country should know exactly what the cost of Government administration is and that they should not be deluded into thinking that it is less than it really is by this device of writing down particular Estimates by bringing in Exchequer receipts as Appropriations-in-Aid.  The normal practice has been to put all Exchequer receipts into the Central Fund and to make appropriations from that fund to specific purposes in accordance with Estimates submitted to the Dáil.  That practice has been departed from in the handling here of this Grant Counterpart Account.</P>
    <P>However, by that device and by the speeches which have been made by Ministers during the past couple of days, the public have been led to expect substantial reductions in taxation in the coming year.  Deputy O'Hara, who preceded me, anticipates that the reduction in taxation will amount to £2.7 million.  He is a Government Deputy and he, no doubt, has information as to the Government's intentions in that regard.  Maybe he was just misled by the tactics of the <Col N="352" /> Government, but that is the limit of his expectations.  Other Deputies opposite, and certainly many members of the public, are expecting that reductions in taxation of not less than that amount will be forthcoming; and I see no reason, if this is an honest Book of Estimates, why they should not be forthcoming.  The revenue is good.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of any inconsistency but I am not very much concerned even if there is.  Let the chips fall where they may.  My interpretation of the Exchequer returns is that Deputy MacEntee's Budget of 1954 will work out very much as forecast in the Budget statement.  It was possible for him, because of the improved economic conditions in the country, to propose reductions in taxation last year, modest reductions it is true, but nevertheless an indication of what the future prospects were.  Irrespective of what Government was in office, if the trend continued in 1954, as we anticipated when preparing the Budget of that year, further tax reductions in this year would be practicable. Notwithstanding the tax reductions of last year, notwithstanding the increased provision for flour and bread subsidy, the indications are that the Budget would have worked out as anticipated by Deputy MacEntee but for the fact that this Government brought in a number of Supplementary Estimates, some at least of which were not foreseen, or anticipated, by Deputy MacEntee when, as Minister for Finance, he was preparing that Budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the suggestion in the Book of Estimates that the cost of Government has gone down, if that is an honest suggestion, plus the good <Col N="353" /> revenue position, substantial reliefs in taxes this year should be practicable unless the Government either intends to undertake expenditures not provided for in the Book of Estimates or unless they have reason to think that economic conditions will deteriorate and recent revenue trends be reversed. That is a problem which the Government is now facing, or will be facing in the next few weeks when they sit around the Cabinet Table there in Merrion Street to consider the form of the Budget they will produce to the Dáil.  How they will reconcile all their pledges is a puzzle.  They will have some money to dispose of; that is clear.  They can use that money either to fulfil their pledge to reduce taxation, or to fulfil their pledge to improve the social services, or to fulfil their pledge to increase food subsidies, or to fulfil their pledge to increase the subventions to local authorities in relief of rates.  Which will they do?  We have no information yet.  We will have no information until Budget day.</P>
    <P>We know from the Book of Estimates that up to the date on which that book was prepared the Government did not contemplate proposing to the Dáil either increased food subsidies, as promised by the Labour Deputies; or higher old age pensions, as promised by the Minister for Local Government; or higher widows' and orphans' pensions, better sickness and unemployment benefit, as promised by the Minister for Industry and Commerce; or to make good the loss now being incurred by Tea Importers, Limited, in respect of tea, if the Government's gamble on a fall in the price of tea in the Indian market does not come off.  As I have said, we have got to wait for the Budget to know to what extent the Government will deal with these matters, if at all.  The Government has had plenty of time to decide what it is possible to do.</P>
    <P>In the experience of this State, every Government does its best work in its first year of office.  If it does not do in that year what it pledged itself to do in the preceding election, it will never do it at all: and, unless these pledges given by the spokesmen of the Fine Gael and Labour Parties are redeemed <Col N="354" /> in the Budget of 1955, they will never be redeemed; and that is another prophecy which I am prepared to quote to the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not care if the Minister for Lands goes up three octaves, I am not going to follow him. However, far more serious than the present pathetic attempts of the members of the Government to dodge their election pledges is their attitude or indifference to the serious problems that exist in this country.  I was shocked, and I am sure every supporter of the Labour Party was shocked at the complacent note in every recent speech of the Minister for Industry and Commerce in relation to the unemployment position.  Unemployment is continuing at a very high level and emigration is continuing at an equally high level; and the only concern of the Government in relation to these <Col N="355" /> national problems, as revealed by the speeches of Ministers, is to keep up the pretence that they are going to do something about them when the fact is they are doing nothing.  It is surely misleading to quote the total number on the live register in this year as compared with the corresponding date last year as giving the whole picture in relation to unemployment.</P>
      <P>Everybody knows that the unemployment situation can be considered in about three categories: there are the men who are normally at work dependent upon their wages for their livelihood, who occasionally in bad times lose employment for a spell and in good times will be continuously employed; there are people who are not regularly employed for wages, who are available for work on public works schemes or for county council employment; and in the third category there are people who are owners of land in not sufficient quantity to give them a livelihood, who must occasionally get work for wages to supplement the income that their land provides them with.  If one wants to consider the trend of unemployment one has to concentrate one's attention upon the figures relating to those who normally work for wages and who are dependent upon their wages for their livelihood: and the recent figure for people in that category shows that unemployment is not less than 10 per cent. higher than it was this time last year.</P>
      <P>That very substantial increase in unemployment amongst workers who are dependent upon wages for their livelihood, workers who, when unemployed, are entitled to unemployment insurance benefit, indicates a serious situation that should be having the concern of the Government; and, instead of getting evidence of that concern, we get these complacent speeches of the Minister for Industry and Commerce. We get this suggestion that because the total number on the register is reduced&mdash;that could be reduced for a number of causes&mdash;there is no reason for the Government to worry; everything is going all right.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It was so even at times when we knew the country was passing through production and employment crises.  I have never in this House expressed confidence in the reliability of our unemployment statistics.  We know that on the unemployment register there are thousands of men who are not available for work in the ordinary meaning of that term.  We know that there are men over 65 years of age registered as unemployed, who are allowed to register as unemployed and to qualify for unemployment assistance because there is no other provision for them but who are never sent out by the employment exchanges to take jobs.  We know that an investigation which was carried out some seven or eight years ago suggested that not more than one-third of those upon the register were capable of undertaking ordinary manual labour. That is why the total figure of workers on the live register is not and never has been an indication of the extent of unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before the first Fianna Fáil Government came into office the live register as an indication of the degree of unemployment was farcical.  It showed something about 25,000 workers unemployed <Col N="357" /> although to public knowledge the number was several times that.  We introduced in 1932, for the first time, the scheme of public works undertaken in different parts of the country as a direct measure to relieve unemployment. Both for the purpose of determining in a fair way the proper distribution of the funds available for the financing of these works and to get a more reliable picture of the unemployment position, we announced that these funds would be distributed in proportion to the number of workers registered in each county and, within a month, the number on the live register jumped from 25,000 to 125,000 and still it was not an indication of the position because we then found that the bright boys in every county were going around canvassing workers to put their names on the register so that the local grant would be increased.</P>
    <P>I think there is a job of work to be done in relation to our unemployment statistics and that, apart from anything else, it is desirable that the unemployment register should be divided up into the three categories I mentioned: those who are dependent on wages for a livelihood, who are normally at work but who may be temporarily unemployed because of trade slackness; those who are in need of work to supplement other incomes; those who are incapable of work and who are on the register as a means of providing them with some subsistence.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am quite prepared to admit&mdash;this relates to some remarks by Deputy O'Hara&mdash;that the Fianna Fáil Government did not eliminate the root causes of abnormal unemployment or abnormal emigration.  I think we tried. <Col N="358" /> I am prepared to admit that when we first came into office we believed that, through the policy of industrial development, through the policy of extending tillage and agriculture, through the policy of housing development and large-scale projects involving public works of one kind or another, we would be able to eliminate the problem of unemployment as it then existed.  I know that our belief was proved to be inaccurate.  We made tremendous progress in all these spheres.  We created new jobs to a number of more than 100,000, but still the figures showed that abnormal unemployment and an abnormal emigration position.  Because that was our experience, because we found that the plans which we made initially did not work out as satisfactorily as we anticipated, we are now subjecting every plan and every part of our programme to examination and they will be revised if revision appears to be justified and likely to be more productive of results.</P>

      <P>I do not know, and I presume nobody will know until the Budget is presented to the House, whether the combined totals of the funds to be made available this year for public works and other employment-giving activities from the Estimates, the Road Fund, the National Development Fund and other such sources will be greater or less than what was provided last year.  Deputy O'Hara said that this Book of Estimates shows that the Government is going to spend more money on county roads.  The Government may intend to do that but this book does not show it. The only item in this book which has any relation to county roads is the disappearance of £400,000 for roads in the Gaeltacht areas.  Last year we transferred that charge to the National Development Fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>To the National Development Fund.  Will the Minister read the reply he gave to me on a parliamentary question which I submitted to him?  This year it has been transferred to the Road Fund and thereby operates to increase the amount available from the Road Fund for normal expenditure.  It is true that the Road Fund is expanding very rapidly.  The income from it is increasing every day. We are responsible very largely for that increase.  We increased the tax on motor vehicles and Deputies opposite opposed that increase very vigorously. It is now their intention to revive the proposals relating to motor taxation which the previous Government supported and which they opposed?  I do not think it is.  I think that they will leave the taxation rates as they were fixed by us and take all the credit they can for the improved expenditure on the roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister even now or later at Budget time could give an indication as to whether the total amount to be available this year from all sources for public works schemes which will give employment will exceed or fall below last year's expenditure.  I <Col N="360" /> think there is on me and on every responsible Deputy in this House an obligation to make clear his attitude on this question of Government expenditure. I do not think it would be good policy to reduce Government expenditure if the effect of that reduction is to increase unemployment and emigration.  I disagree strongly with the sentiments expressed in the leading articles of the <i>Irish Independent</i> in favour of reducing expenditure regardless of the consequences.  I think that useful expenditure which will bring down the numbers of unemployed and reduce emigration is good expenditure.</P>

      <P>True economy is the spending of whatever is necessary to get the best results.  I would not deem it to be good economy or policy to cut Government expenditure if the result is to create bad or further unemployment or emigration.  We are not trying to force the Government to cut down expenditure merely because of election promises.  These promises were stupid and impractical, but it would be twice as stupid to try now to fulfil them.  The Minister can be sure of this&mdash;that any proposals he brings in here for intelligent expenditure to give benefit to the people of this country will be accepted so far as the Opposition is concerned and we will further accept the obligation of supporting the proposals he may make for the financing of that expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter I want briefly to refer to and to which Deputy MacEntee referred in his speech yesterday.  Ministers have been making speeches around the country claiming that the Irish commercial banks did not increase their lending rates because of pressure put on them by the Government.  They have been intimating that if left to themselves the banks would have increased lending charges but that they were prevented from doing that by some action of the Government.  That is the trend of these speeches.  That claim, whether they like it or not, has created a new situation from which they can never again escape.  The public now believe <Col N="361" /> that it is in the power of the Government to control the policy of the commercial banks and they will naturally expect that power to be used on every possible occasion.  Whether the Government likes it or not they now have moral responsibility for the bank lending rates, deposit rates, salaries profits and all other charges and every change which the commercial banks may propose in these matters will be put at the door of the Government because of the speeches Ministers have been making.</P>
    <P>If the Government is going to have that power it should be defined in legislation.  It is entirely bad that the Government should have that power or claim to exercise that power without it being limited or defined by the Dáil. We have had this situation created for us and the Government has now to consider whether it will come to the Dáil with proposals in relation to these commercial banks which will provide it, with the authority of this House, with the legislative authority to exercise the powers it is claiming to exercise.</P>

      <P>There is one other matter to which I wish to refer.  There is a proposal in this Book of Estimates to put the whole cost of subsidising the rural electrification scheme upon the urban electricity consumers.  As the author of the rural electrification, I came to this House and justified to it the subsidisation of the electricity supply to rural dwellers on the ground of the national advantage which would accrue if that amenity was brought to them.  On that ground of national advantage, I proposed that the taxpayers should make their contribution to the cost of doing so, so that the electricity would reach the rural dwellers at rates not higher than those at which it is supplied to urban dwellers.  Now that policy is being reversed and it is being reversed retrospectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance did not explain that the provision in the Book of Estimates represented the repayment out of voted moneys, of advances made to the E.S.B. for subsidising the rural electrification scheme in previous years.  The E.S.B., we are told, has a revenue surplus.  It should not have a revenue surplus.  The statutory obligations of the E.S.B. are clear and if in the last financial year they produced a revenue surplus there is an obligation on them to use that surplus to reduce the rate of charges for electricity. Instead of allowing that normal reduction in charges to proceed under the Electricity Acts, the Government <Col N="365" /> is raiding that surplus for the purpose of meeting the cost of rural electrification subsidy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one further <Col N="366" /> matter to which I wish to refer.  I do not know the significance of the reduction, shown in the Estimate for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, in the number of workers to be employed in the installation of telephones. There is a reduction from 588 to 402, a very substantial reduction in the number of workers employed in this business of installing telephones. Everybody knows that the rate of telephone installation is very poor. Whether it is due to inefficiency in the organisation or to some difficulty in obtaining supplies&mdash;which I can hardly credit&mdash;nobody can get a new telephone installed except after a very protracted delay.</P>
      <P>If my interpretation of that figure is correct, that delay is going to be still further increased, the rate of telephone installation is going to be cut down to two-thirds of what it was, by reason of this one-third reduction in the number of workers employed upon that work.</P>
      <P>That is a method of economy I disapprove of.  That is what I regard as a wrong type of economy&mdash;cutting down expenditure regardless of the result.  There should be in this country, as in most other countries, such provision for telephone installation as will enable any citizen to get a telephone installed without undue delay. The attitude of the Government in that regard is, I think, open to grave criticism.</P>
      <P>I would like to get sometime&mdash;I have a parliamentary question down to-day which may give me some part of the answer&mdash;information as to the Government's intentions regarding the Avoca mineral deposits and the grass meal project in Bangor Erris.  I know that when the previous Coalition Government was in office all work upon development at Avoca was stopped for 18 months, although the workers employed in that development were not disemployed.  They were kept on the pay roll, compelled to report for duty, paid their wages but under orders to do no work.  I am told that something similar is happening at the present time, that all capital advances for development in Avoca have been stopped.  In the case of the grass meal project&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking for information.  It is true that the exploration work had proceeded to the stage at which commercial development was clearly possible.  As a result of that scheme started by the Fianna Fáil Government, the existence in Avoca of a volume of ore amounting to no less than 12,000,000 tons was established. That volume of ore, containing 1 per cent. or more of copper, permits of commercial working.  The only question which was unsettled at the time I left office was whether the commercial working of that ore would be undertaken by an Irish State company, financed as other Irish State companies are financed, or whether we would seek to secure its development by private enterprise.  The board of Mianraí Teoranta were asked to submit their recommendations and proposals <Col N="368" /> in that regard without delay to the Government.  I am quite certain they have reached the Government, though what action the Government has taken on them I do not know.</P>
      <P>In the case of the grass meal project at Bangor-Erris, my information is that all the capital development work there ceased long ago; that for the first time in the history of Irish State enterprises the cost of that capital work did not exceed 75 per cent. of the original Estimate; that the workers are being employed upon unnecessary additions to the capital work, increasing the capital burden on the undertaking and adding nothing to its productive capacity; that no authority to proceed to production, to seed the land which has been reclaimed has been obtained and that there is being built up on the undertaking an unnecessary burden of capital charges which is probably designed to discredit it and justify its closing down at some future date.</P>
      <P>I do not know what the attitude of the Government is to these various projects of national development.  It may be that they are just against those Fianna Fáil started and not against them in principle.  It may be that they are against them in principle but some indication of the Government's attitude has got to be given and some statement as to their intention in regard to these specific undertakings and as to their intentions in regard to national development projects of that kind in general.</P>
      <P>No doubt these specific matters can be raised in more detail upon the various Estimates when they are submitted to the Dáil.  Now is the first time that we have what appears to be a definite indication of the Government's intentions in relation to matters of public taxes.  Consequently, it is appropriate that the occasion should be availed of by some authoritative spokesman of the Government to state precisely what their point of view is in regard to all these matters I have mentioned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Attorney-General (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been said that great thoughts come from some people very late in life.  The Deputy who has just spoken <Col N="369" /> brought that phrase home to me. There is a description by James Stephens in one of his books of the lady who sells newspapers in a kiosk in Paris.  She occupied her leisure time in looking back over her past sins with pleasure, but Deputy Lemass looks back over his past political sins with no great pleasure.  He tells us that democracy here and in other countries depends upon the honesty and integrity of its public men.  That is not a very original thought. Apparently, it came to him during the particular period, not too extended, he has been in opposition.  Deputy Lemass is there because democracy is alive in this country and it tests its public men by their honesty and integrity.</P>
      <P>Prices and the cost of living were under discussion for many days and weeks.  An attempt was made to befuddle the minds of the people.  People recognise when prices are affected by outside economic conditions and sometimes they accept those with complacency. People recognise when prices are deliberately raised against them and they recognise that economic forces outside the country would raise prices only for the intervention of a friendly-disposed Government.  People also recognise when men put themselves forward and make promises which they flagrantly and deliberately break almost before the people have time to understand them.  People have a still better understanding when high prices, despite previous promises, are raised still higher, and when they note the mentality of the people who made the promises and the methods adopted by them to worsen their lives.</P>
      <P>In the 1951 election, food prices and subsidies were definitely under consideration. At the final rally in O'Connell Street in that election, the then Taoiseach, now Deputy de Valera, praised food subsidies and point 15 of the 17-point programme issued on the 5th June, 1951, said this:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To maintain subsidies to control the price of essential foodstuffs and the operation of an efficient system of price regulation.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was talk about additional <Col N="370" /> taxes.  Deputy Lemass rolled into the fray on that, as reported in the <i>Sunday Press</i> of the 13th May:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A Coalition Minister has said that Fianna Fáil, if elected, would increase the taxes on beer and tobacco.  Why should such taxes be necessary?  There is no reason why we should reimpose those taxes.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I hope the gentleman who was so interested in honesty and integrity in public life is listening.  Deputy MacEntee, as reported in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of the 15th May, 1951, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A number of persons were spreading a rumour that Fianna Fáil, if returned to power, would reimpose the tax on drink which was imposed by the Supplementary Budget of 1947.  There is no truth in such a rumour.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What about honesty and integrity after that definite promise to maintain food subsidies and the denial that the taxes on beer, tobacco and drink were going to be reimposed?  These taxes were reimposed and the subsidies cut in complete disregard of the promises. What was the reason given?  The people were too well off.  The Government had given careful consideration to the matter of subsidies over recent months and had come to the conclusion that as salaries had increased more than the cost of living there was no reason for the maintenance of these subsidies.  Therefore, the subsidies went.  That is what the present Opposition are struggling against.  Democracy is alive in this country and expects from the people who are going to be its parliamentary representatives that there will be honesty and integrity and that an attempt will be made to carry out their promises.  But the people were told they were too well off.</P>
    <P>All those comments were made at the close of 1951.  The people were told that these aids were required and that they would be retained.  The inter-Party Government believed that the cost of Government should be brought down and that it can be brought down. The Opposition believe it cannot.  They have nailed themselves to that particular issue.  They are tied fast to it. <Col N="371" /> There is no way of reducing the cost of Government to the community except the way Deputy Lemass spoke of in June last.  At the Fianna Fáil Árd Fheis, a motion was proposed asking that the Opposition should remind the Government of their promises made during the election and should insist on these promises being fulfilled. Deputy Lemass intervened, according to the cutting I have of 13th October, 1954, and said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There would be nothing wrong with the resolution, if the portion relating to the pressing the Government for a fulfilment of their promises was deleted.  Fianna Fáil would not press for the fulfilment of promises which they considered to be impractical and incapable of fulfilment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was the attitude the Deputy took up to-day.  There is no possibility of reducing costs&mdash;no possibility.  The Deputy did say that there was one possibility when he spoke here after the Government had been elected.  He said, on 23rd June, 1954, at column 492 of the Dáil Debates of that date, when speaking of the small matter of the subsidy on butter which he said was going to cost about £1,000,000:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Savings will have to be at the rate of £2,000,000 per year, which is the estimated cost of the butter subsidy over a full year.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then, he turned to disclose the only way in which that could be found:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Ninety-five per cent. of the Government expenditure goes on wages and salaries.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Does the Deputy remember saying that?  He went on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Is there any Minister who would deny that?  Ninety-five per cent. of all the money spent by every Government Department is spent in the form of wages or salaries to somebody and you cannot save £2,000,000 a year without depriving a whole lot of people of their employment.  If you assume the average public servant, a civil servant or Government employee gets £10 per week, then you cannot save £2,000,000 per annum without depriving 4,000 people of their jobs.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="372" /> The 95 per cent. calculation was just the sort of emphatic statement the Deputy would make on completely unreliable information.  He continued later:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Whatever the overestimate was, you yourself are promising to do that, plus £2,000,000 more.  You are telling us it can be done&mdash;that plus £2,000,000.  Four thousand people will have to be disemployed if you achieve those economies.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then, at column 494, he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If you are now going to economise to the extent of £2,000,000 per annum and cut 4,000 people off the Government pay-roll, do not think that is going to pass without comment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then he turned to Deputy O'Leary and asked:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;How would Deputy O'Leary relate that to his promise about employment for everybody?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Finally, in column 495, he repeats it:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Are you going to put the whole of that burden on one narrow section of the community, on the 4,000 civil servants whose livelihood will be ended, to finance the subsidy through so-called economies?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Do I misquote the Deputy&mdash;no possible reduction in the cost of Government except by sacking civil servants?  I intervened to ask him about the £4,000,000 economies which his colleague in Government was going to make.  I asked:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;How were you going to save £4,000,000.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The answer was:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The £4,000,000 was not savings. The £4,000,000 was made up on the normal assumption that the various Departments of State in estimating the cost of services tend to overestimate and that many would be unable to complete within the financial year the expenditure they planned.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>So that there is some metaphysical distinction which the Deputy makes between the fact that Government Departments overestimate their <Col N="373" /> capacity to spend and what he calls economies; but, outside that matter of overestimation of expenditure, according to the Deputy's Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis speech, there is no way of fulfilling the promise about economies, or, according to the statement he made, there is only one way, that is, sack so many civil servants.  Taking them as having a rate of £500 a year, you can always calculate your economies and weigh in the balance the number of people who will have to be sacrificed.</P>
    <P>A great deal of play has been made here with a statement I made, that a Finance Minister appointed at a particular time could save £10,000,000, that, in a speech of 10 minutes, he could throw off the burden of taxation at the rate of £1,000,000 per minute. I did make that speech in May of 1952 and the special quotation is:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If they could get the present Government out before July 1st a new Minister for Finance could in a 10 minutes speech save £1,000,000 a minute and thus wipe out the £10,000,000 that was being asked for.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I continued:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I do not even despair of being able to save the other £5,000,000 as well.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Note the contingency&mdash;if we could get a new Minister for Finance in by 1st July, 1952, because one could and did foresee from these benches that the Government's main effort during the year 1952, after their scandalous Budget had been introduced, would be to increase, to swell up in every way possible, all expenditure on the Government side, so that they need not in the end show that the calculation of £10,000,000 was a correct one.  It is not surely outside the memory of Deputies that in that year Supplementary Estimates to the extent of £9,000,000 odd were introduced and were financed out of the original Budget proposal.  I made that calculation with regard to £10,000,000&mdash;it was not I made it first, but I accepted it&mdash; being saved in a ten-minute speech in 1952, but it now appears that I was <Col N="374" /> five years late in making that calculation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass spoke recently, in the Dáil Reports of 10th February of this year at column 199, about my having got a spurious reputation for efficiency in the Department of Finance by remitting certain taxes before the Budget of the year 1948.  He said I had got my reputation because I brought in these remissions before the Budget was due, and he continued:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is true that the Fianna Fáil Budget for 1947 produced a surplus of £6,000,000.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Deputy did at one time I know recall that statement about the 95 per cent. of Government expenditure being for civil servants' salaries.  Has he thought fit to correct that phrase yet, or does he still abide by it?  I take it he abides by it?  The Deputy then went on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That was because the recovery in trade from the post-war depression proceeded more rapidly in that year than we thought likely when the Budget was being prepared.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then, at column 200 he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If it was imposed unnecessarily in 1947, it was because we had not got the ability to foresee what direction the trend of events would take that year.  We budgeted conservatively, as was our duty in the circumstances then prevailing.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I suggest that there is not much difference between saying: &ldquo;We budgeted conservatively in 1947&rdquo; and saying in 1952: &ldquo;We budgeted for £10,000,000 more than we required,&rdquo; in the changed conditions as between 1947 and 1952.</P>
    <P>Deputies who were not in the House in 1947 may not appreciate the significance of what the Deputy said here on 10th February last.  We were called together on 15th and 16th October and we heard speeches from the then Taoiseach, the then Minister for Finance and Deputy Lemass, as Minister for Industry and Commerce.  We were brought together in October and we had a couple of mournful statements by the Taoiseach of those days and by the Minister for Finance, <Col N="375" /> Deputy Aiken as he is now.  They all turned on inflation&mdash;the country was going to the dogs with inflation; and more particularly what was feared was that trade unionists might get out of control and industrial pressure might be used before the Labour Court and other places, with the result that wages and salaries might go on a swirl.</P>
    <P>The Government came in here with proposals that they were going to regularise wages and salaries as they were on the 15th October.  We found, when we went into Government, that the Deputy over there had his legislation prepared.  He says it was because of preparing for discussions with trade unions.  The file shows he had his discussions with the trade unions, and, while some of them may have been easier to deal with than others, there was one group of trade unions who definitely would not take the Government proposals.  The Minister ordered his officials to prepare this legislation. As I said in my broadcast he ended in a dictatorial fashion about making the penalties severe.  Great preparation was made for the 1947 October speech and proposals.  The old cost-of-living index figure was abandoned and the new figure was made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>A cost-of-living index figure operated in those days and it was the boast of the then Minister for Finance in the Seanad, Deputy Aiken, that it was a much more realistic figure than the British one. Somebody in the Seanad called attention to the fact that our figure seemed to be out of proportion altogether with the British one.  The answer was that our figure was much more realistic and included such things as spirits and tobacco, whereas the British had these cut out.  The first step, therefore, had to be a new index figure&mdash;it was provisional but it was in process of being made in October, 1947&mdash;that was going <Col N="376" /> to leave out such commodities as beer, spirits and tobacco.  If the price of these commodities rose, the cost-of-living index figure would not rise and no claim upon the cost-of-living index figure could be substantiated.  Then the Government came into this House with their proposals.  They said that, in order to prevent the cost of living from rising&mdash;I think it was to reduce it by about 13 points&mdash;they had certain proposals.  They were going to give additional subsidies for food and fertilisers. I quote now from columns 393-4 of the Official Report of the 15th October, 1947:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The total extra cost of the subsidies on flour, bread, tea, sugar and fertilisers over and above the £4.636 million estimated in May last&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>&mdash;that is the Budget proposals of that year&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;will be £5.765 million...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Deputy Aiken, who was then the Minister for Finance, said that his Budget was showing a likely increase of £1,000,000 but if he was going to give subsidies amounting to £5.5 million in the remnant of that year we had to find £4,750,000.  He imposed a surtax and he put a tax on spirits, wine, beer and tobacco, furs and cosmetics, entertainment, cinemas, dogs and boxing.  He increased the road tax and there was a stamp duty tax.  All these taxes got him in £4.8 million in the period of the year that was still left.  I want that figure thought of and that date thought of as against Deputy Lemass's contention that the Fianna Fáil Budget showed a surplus of £6,000,000.  It was then mid-October and the taxes were to start as soon as possible&mdash;immediately, if it could be so arranged.  There were five and a half months to go and there were increased taxes in order to bring in, in the last five and a half months of that year, something short of £5,000,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have multiplied all this out and it shows that the Fianna Fáil Government were imposing extra taxation at the rate of £10,750,000 in the year. If I had been as alert in October, 1947, when I criticised these taxes as I am now I could have said what I said in <Col N="377" /> May, 1952, namely, that a new Minister for Finance coming in could, in a seven minute speech, wipe out £7,000,000.  If I took Deputy Lemass's figure, I could say that, in six minutes, £6,000,000 could be wiped out.  If I had said that at that time there would have been an attempt&mdash;as there is an attempt now&mdash;to hold me up to the odium of public scorn.</P>
    <P>On Deputy Lemass's figures, the facts prove that in October, 1947&mdash;five and a half months from the end of the financial year&mdash;the then Government, who are now in opposition, increased the taxes on the goods I have mentioned so as to bring in nearly £5,000,000. That was done at a time when, according to themselves, their Budget was going to run out with a surplus.  It simply establishes again that they were taxing for the sake of taxation.  Looking back, with my memory revived, and being more alert now on certain points, I have no doubt that the same things were operating in 1947 as were operating in 1952.  I looked back to see what was the view of the Central Bank Report of that year.  It was produced for the year ended 31st March, 1947, and was published in July, 1947.  There was a most serious warning.  Paragraph 19 of that report states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The general impression created by the available information is that the tendency towards an unhealthy inflation, against which the board has given warning in previous reports, has in recent times shown marked evidence of becoming worse and consequently now demands vigorous measures to check it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Amongst the various items picked out for comment was the strong upward movement in wage rates as between the civil servants, agricultural workers and those engaged in industry.  If one &mdash;with the background of the Central Bank Report for 1947 in mind&mdash;looks through what the then Taoiseach, Deputy de Valera, and the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Aiken, said he will find the same mentality bred in these people as was bred in the Central Bank Report for 1951, which produced the 1952 Budget.</P>
    <P>There is no necessity to go through all the matters spoken of here but I <Col N="378" /> should just like to quote this extract from what the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Aiken, said on the 15th October, 1947.  I am quoting now from columns 399 and 400 of the Official Report for that day.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Some other factors regarding our economy which must be noted are: (1)  Our imports in the first six months of this year were £52.7 million and our exports £15.9 million, showing what used to be called an unfavourable visible trade balance of £36.8 million but representing to our people, who suffered severely from shortages of all sorts of goods and equipment for nearly eight years, a very welcome supply of the things they were eager to buy...</P>
    <P>(2)  During the period from September, 1946, to March, 1947, industrial wages increased....</P>
    <P>(3)  Between July, 1946, and July, 1947, internal bank deposits increased by £15.2 and internal advances and investments increased by £22.8....</P>
    <P>(4)  During the past year savings as a whole were probably much below previous levels....</P>
    <P>(5)  Since September, 1946, State debt increased by almost £7,000,000 but this increase is offset as to £4,000,000 by the increase in unspent balances in State funds such as the Transitional Development Fund...</P>
    <P>(6)  The value of land and houses increased greatly in the last year, in some cases by as much as 70 per cent. or 80 per cent.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the present Opposition may certainly not look back with any favour or complacency on those who wrote the Central Bank Report for the various years and misled them into the wrong policies which they adopted.  They adopted a wrong policy in 1947.  The outcome of events showed that they could have given all the subsidies in 1947 without putting on a penny piece extra taxation.  If Deputy Lemass was speaking accurately and truthfully when he said the Fianna Fáil Budget showed a surplus, <Col N="379" /> then there was not the slightest necessity to impose these taxes of 1947.</P>
    <P>The picture was fairly gloomy on the 15th October when the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance spoke.  Deputy Lemass was thrown in on the following day.  As reported at column 558 of the Official Report of the 16th October, he gave this warning to trade unions:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I want, however, to make it clear that the Government regards it as an essential safeguard to the interests of the general community at the present time that some check upon the upward movement of wages should operate.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There are columns of that and, later, at page 578 he says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We have at present a difficult situation which will persist in an acute form for at least a year and in some form for at least four years.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Can anybody trust either the economic sense or the ability to forecast events that is shown by the two examples we have had, in 1947 when we were told by three members of the Government that these taxes were necessary to give certain subsidies for the aid of the people.  Incidentally, I should remark that the aid that was being given to the consumers was this: at column 396 on the 15th October we are told that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The cost-of-living index which stood at 288 points in August, 1946, rose to 305 points in May, 1947, and in August last&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>that is 1947</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;&ldquo;to 319 points&mdash;an increase of 10.8 per cent. over the year.  Without subsidies the index would now stand at 344 points.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And the effect of these subsidies was to reduce the cost of living by 13 points, that is, by bringing it down to 330 points.  It did rise between August, 1946, and, say, September, 1947, from 288 to 330 points, that is, 32 points.</P>
    <P>That was all the relief that could be given.  That relief was given by those subsidies and those subsidies were financed by the taxes I have mentioned. The event shows those taxes were completely and entirely unnecessary. When they were being put on we were <Col N="380" /> told we were in the midst of unparalleled difficulties and I can give the quotation which I have here, if anybody wants it.  Deputy Lemass told us we were in the middle of unparalleled troubles and that economic collapse threatened on every side.  He said here in Dáil Éireann that that situation was going to persist in an acute form for at least a year and in some form for at least four years. Now in one of his attacks to-day he mentioned that what was wrong was that we were conservative and we did not understand and take into account the development in trade that happened.  But we must remember that development happened from October, 1947, to the end of the financial year on the 31st March, 1948, and that is given as the background to the 1952 Budget.  One would have imagined that unless there was some deliberate policy&mdash;and when I was criticising those matters in opposition I did say that unless there was some deliberate policy&mdash;one could not imagine the Government failing in the same way twice with that lesson behind them.  They had apparently discovered that then.</P>
    <P>That Government in 1948 had a surplus of £6,000,000 from the taxes they imposed in 1947 which showed that these taxes were unnecessary.  I think it would be right to say that these taxes cost them the position of Government.  One would have thought that would have brought some sense of economics to the politicians.  The people, at any rate, in the year 1952 realised that they must make a discrimination in respect of these prices. I believe they have made it and that they know when prices rise by operation of outside forces and they may accept that complacently, but they know and resent it when prices are raised unnecessarily and raised as a matter of policy deliberately formed. They can appreciate the situation&mdash; and to our benefit at the moment&mdash; when action is taken to prevent prices rising through economic forces elsewhere being cushioned to their aid even at the expense of the general taxpayers here.  They have definitely understood over the years the results <Col N="381" /> that are given by the particular policy which was adopted in 1952.</P>
    <P>This policy of 1952 which, I think, has put the then Government where it now is, in opposition, proved for the second time that it was not brought into this House as something necessary. There could be no such plea.  It was an economic problem which they said they would solve in a particular way.  What were the aspects of that economic problem as the then Government saw them?  First, there were subsidies and subsidies were costing the taxpayers a lot of money. Secondly, those subsidies&mdash;I take it this is the implication of the statements made&mdash;might be a necessary evil if wages and salaries were kept at a low point and if they could be compared only adversely with the increased cost of living.  That argument was not accepted.  The argument as used was that over the years those who get remuneration for services to the community, the people with wages and salaries, had got those wages and salaries increased beyond the point, so to speak, that would be recognised as just by adverting simply to the cost-of-living index figure.</P>
    <P>That was the argument that was used. We phrased that&mdash;I have often asked does anybody object to it&mdash;that the people were told that they were too well off.  If one took the standard of pre-war years, say, 1938, and accepted it would be the standard for ever and compared it by measuring that standard by the cost-of-living index figure&mdash;and it is not a true measure, but measuring it that way and only in that way could a Government come to the conclusion that wages and salaries were too high and for that reason decide there was no social and economic justification for the continuance of the subsidies.  Therefore the subsidies were reduced and in addition to that taxes were put on.  Again it is worth while reviving memories of those days.  On the expenditure side of this Budget statement, in the table explanatory to the Budget of 1952, there was one provision for the Social Welfare Bill, 1951, and other current services of £3,000,000.  The expenditure <Col N="382" /> on the Social Welfare Insurance Bill did not take £2,000,000 of that £3,000,000, but they took £3,000,000 here for that, that is to say that there was £1,000,000 in hands for something else, possibly expanded health services. Deducting savings on food subsidies&mdash;the figure is a shock even to this day&mdash;of £6,668,000, and from this there had to be deducted compensatory social welfare benefits of £2,700,000, leaving a saving on the food subsidies&mdash; even if those compensatory benefits did compensate those to whom they were applied&mdash;of £3,918,000, almost £4,000,000.</P>
    <P>The services they were going to finance out of that in fact cost £2,000,000 so that there was a sum of £2,000,000 to finance other services as well as the £1,000,000 kept in reserve. In addition we had taxes on tobacco, beer and spirits, petrol and oils, etc., making a grand total of £11,290,000. Part of that was because people were too well off and we took away from them some of the benefits they had got over the previous years.  Then they were going to finance social services. I do not know that that particular lesson has been learnt but it is the second useful one that arises from the Budget of 1952&mdash;social services are not free to anybody.  When people talk of free for all services everybody recognises that somebody has got to pay for them but it is not so often recognised that it is the very people who are supposed to be the beneficiaries of those social services who pay to a large extent for what they are getting. Proposals were put forward to increase or better the health of the people or to preserve whatever health the people had by giving them some sort of health service and then they were asked to pay more for bread, butter, flour, sugar and tea.  I would not have thought that the taking away from people of the amount of foodstuffs they could buy was exactly the proper approach to setting up a community with a good standard of life in the country.  That aspect of the proposals of the 1952 Budget were mainly hidden in the conflict that arose over the complete taking away of the subsidies and these shockingly heavy taxes that were put on.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="383" /> I have already read to the House what I said with regard to the £10,000,000, that is, that there could be a reduction of £10,000,000 made by a person who became Minister for Finance in July, 1952.  I would not tie myself to that period.  I think if anybody getting in before the new trend towards greater expenditure had been decided upon by the then Government, could stop the trend which was then setting in about May&mdash;and of course it was later to progress through the year &mdash;the £10,000,000 could easily have been saved.</P>
    <P>Further in regard to the Budget of 1952, I do not know where the Government of the day got their idea that people were better off than they should be.  I do not think it is right to take the cost-of-living figure as a complete measure of the standard of life that people should expect to enjoy in this country.  We all agree that the index figure does not measure everything.  It does not at all mean that even if everything was brought up to the new cost-of-living figure, the people would find themselves as well off as they were in a previous period in which the figures were lower.</P>
    <P>There was no foundation for the argument that wages and salaries had advanced beyond the increase in the cost of living.  Apart altogether from that, unless this House is going to accept as a standard that nobody is to be allowed to increase his standard beyond what it was at the measuring date, 1938, or whatever other standard is taken, then the arguments are completely fallacious.  Of course that was only thrown in by the Minister for Finance; it was one way of excusing to himself his brutality in the hacking off of the subsidies; but running through the whole of the Budget speech of 1952 there was the Central Bank Report, as there had been, as I now realise looking back on it, running through the Budget proposals of 1947.  I have no doubt that the people who are now in opposition must often revile those who produced these reports and must still more strongly revile themselves for paying the slightest attention to these reports.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="384" /> These reports are written, and it should have been accepted that they were written, purely and entirely from the bankers' and financiers' standpoint.  They were handed over to the politicians whose duty it was, if politicians have any duty in a community, to mould a certain situation as well as they could, so that people will not suffer if suffering can be to any degree prevented or diminished. But the Government of the day did accept apparently in 1947 and they certainly did in 1952, the bank report. These reports are written from the materialistic angle of the banker, the man who is looking after his own particular duties, his own particular type of work, and who will explain to you he does not expect the politicians will take completely literally all that is written.  They merely give, as they say, warnings about certain things and the politicians can then take over the responsibility and mould the situation as best they can.</P>
    <P>It is the politician's duty to do that. He takes those facts, has regard to the dangers referred to, considers what efforts can be made to prevent those dangers and whether the results would be as catastrophic as the bankers make them out to be.  He cannot pass the responsibility back to those who wrote the reports.  It is not their duty to do this moulding.  It has always been accepted up to 1952 but the 1952 Budget was based entirely on the mood of the bankers but more particularly of the Central Bank.  I say that because I think in these recent weeks we have got to a definite point of grips with the banks and, as Deputy Lemass said, if that grip is not sustained we will find ourselves, after these tentative efforts, even in a worse position than if it had not been made.</P>
    <P>The 1952 Budget had its course.  The people appreciate what was done.  They were shocked by the brutality of the proposals.  As the months went on they began to feel these proposals were unnecessary, and when 1953 and 1954 came along that feeling must have deepened.  The suffering that was caused by the 1952 Budget was unnecessary, and unless every item of expenditure which increased since 1952 could be justified the people were entitled <Col N="385" /> to say that this was a bankers' Budget and that it was definitely aimed at taking purchasing power out of the hands of the people.  That was done without any appreciation of the suffering that was caused and the resultant economic conditions which touched off the new round of wages including increases to civil servants.  In this connection I am happy to say that we met the Civil Service bonus award.  It must be said there was very little saving in spite of the suffering that was inflicted upon the people.  In the wider field of industry it also became necessary to meet wage demands to cope with the new increase in the cost of living.  The Budget of 1952 must be condemned as a greater fallacy than Deputy Lemass admits the proposals of 1947 were.</P>
    <P>The public, I think, have confidence in what we are saying, that we believe that economies could be made, and that we would search to find them, that we would if necessary change the form of Government financing to do that, that we would if necessary look into administrative costs and while guarding against any hardship to people, where redundancy might be found we would see if there was really redundancy and see that in future there would not be so much in the way of occupation in the ranks of the personnel of the State.  The people, I think, trust us in that, and I do not think they will have to bring against us that same criticism in regard to honesty and integrity of public representatives, as they can and did during the last election bring against people who promised to maintain subsidies and control the price of essential foodstuffs and gave specific pledges that the taxes on beer and tobacco would not be introduced.  In fact, the suggestion that they were going to reintroduce the tax on drink was described as a rumour.</P>
    <P>Last night, I understand, Deputy MacEntee said that I had promised a £20,000,000 reduction in Government taxation, and that that was a promise for this year's Budget.  I understand he said the promise of a reduction made by me in a broadcast was tied to this year's Budget.  I have got a copy of that broadcast.  I want to read part <Col N="386" /> of it.  But let me first explain that very rarely do I write these things, but I had to write this down for Radio Éireann.  They said here to-day that it was probably done in consultation with my colleagues.  I did not see any colleagues of mine before I had written it, because I was occupied in the morning in getting the broadcast right.  I experience great difficulty in writing these things.  I do not think anybody repudiates what I said.  I spoke as representing one element of the Government, and I believe what was said would be accepted by most people.  If it were not, I would not understand why anybody would object to it.</P>
    <P>I opened my broadcast by talking of the war, of the national emergency, and how Government control was then necessary.  I said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It still remains and the habit of mind acquired under emergency conditions&mdash;the desire to control and boss and regiment people&mdash;still persists....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I talked of the Government attitude towards wages and salaries, and I intended to make this the pivot point in my broadcast.  I talked of standstill orders.  Deputy MacEntee just could not break down wages and salaries which was so easy to do when the standstill orders were in fashion.  We can almost hear him speak aloud: &ldquo;People must buy food; if the prices of foodstuffs were raised the effect would be the same as if wages were cut.  People will still buy beer and tobacco; if heavy taxes are put on these it is the same in the end as if wages were further reduced.&rdquo;  I said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Against his policy and its results the people are now in revolt.  There is everywhere a feeling of oppression and the community are in no mood to regard their suffering as inescapable. They feel that improved conditions are possible and, anyway, they demand relief.  One party alone, the authors of the community's misfortunes denies that relief is possible. All other Parties agree to the contrary and agree that relief must be given.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I spoke of how Deputy Lemass in the winter of 1947 told us that there stretched ahead four years of the most <Col N="387" /> acute difficulty and wailed that &ldquo;economic disasters threatened on every side.&rdquo;  Deputy Lemass raged through the country proclaiming: &ldquo;If you remove the Fianna Fáil taxes you cannot maintain the subsidies,&rdquo; or, putting it the other way: &ldquo;If you want to maintain the subsidies you must keep Fianna Fáil taxes.&rdquo;  Now he confesses that is all wrong.</P>
    <P>Then I come to this part which has been so much commented upon.  Here, I think, I will read at some length:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In these days, despite the assurance of Mr. Lemass to the contrary, even Mr. MacEntee finds it possible to promise economies though he raises doubts as to his sincerity in many minds when he joins his programme of economies with proposals to save money and to get money from C.I.E.  When State expenditure has risen to its present heights there must be economies ready to hand for a Minister who is serious in his quest of them and knows how to go after them, but when Mr. MacEntee, in emphasising his attitude towards such economies proclaims that every Government Department has been instructed to `review its personnel to this end' he not only shows that he has the wrong approach to this matter but he must arouse in the minds of civil servants the fear that they, with C.I.E. employees, are marked out as brands for the economies bonfire.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Every Department had been instructed to review its personnel with a view to bringing down Government expenditure. It possibly meant nothing else than that civil servants were going to be sacked.  I take up my broadcast again:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;While, however, there can be little doubt that savings in the cost of Government amounting to several millions a year can be secured without much effort for the relief of the community a distinct change of policy is required and a new outlook on the part of Ministers demanded if the reduction in Government expenditure <Col N="388" /> of £20,000,000 and upwards, desirable in everybody's interest, is to be achieved.  Mr. Lemass has an easy going view that `if extra Government services are to be provided we have got to persuade people that instead of giving 5/4 to the Government out of every £ they should give 6/- or 6/6 or 7/-, persuade them that it is better for themselves that they should spend less at their own discretion and let the Government do the spending for them'.  This is, of course, a completely wrong approach.  It becomes all the more unsound as a view when it is remembered that the only attempt at persuasion made by him in respect of the extra shillings in the £ taken by his Government from the people's earnings was whatever secret persuasion he worked on four Independent Deputies who were elected to Dáil Éireann on proposals for bigger and better subsidies and reliefs instead of greater taxes.  We are entitled to take the philosophy of Fianna Fáil from Mr. Childers who put a halo round bureaucracy and has as yet not been repudiated by his superiors in Government.  Mr. Childers explained his attitude to a Cork audience in these words: `The paternalistic care of a community by a Civil Service acting on instructions from a Government elected by the people can alone preserve the fundamental freedoms and the sanctity of human existence.'  Mr. Lemass's view that it is proper under any circumstances to take 7/- for the Government from every £ earned by the community and Mr. Childers's scheme of Civil Service foster parents selected for the community by a political Party involves the establishment and maintenance of the Government Departments we now have, interfering without necessity and without invitation and in an inefficient and extravagantly costly way with the business activities and even the lives of citizens.  In any event apart altogether from a matter of cost it is the responsibility and duty of each citizen as a free man developing his free personality, to attend to most of these matters by himself or through some small and <Col N="389" /> subsidiary group in which he will be a controlling influence and not a mere payer of bills.  It is said that the present Government have in some way accepted the idea of decentralisation. When their only proposals towards this end are examined it emerges that their idea of decentralisation is a mere matter of scattering some sections of central Government Departments through the country.</P>
    <P>The decentralisation of Government which is urgently required is an entirely different thing, it is a scheme to break up and distribute the powers of central Government and to encourage and develop instead local and individual responsibility and initiative.  It must be accepted that the State should see that no citizen lacks the necessities for a decent human life through the adversity of circumstances outside his control. But there is a wide gap between that and the conception of the paternalistic care of the community by the Civil Service acting on Government instructions.  Extensive and extravagant powers were of necessity taken over by Government during the war years, but it is the right of citizens to demand that these powers should be abandoned now that wartime necessity has gone.  Even if Government must find the money for many services it is not essential that there should be retained expensive Government machinery for the distribution of these aids.  It is no longer right for the Government to do the spending for the people; the proper objective is to enable citizens to earn more for the service they give to the community and to leave the spending of these earnings to themselves.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a typescript of my broadcast. It may be said that it contains more than I said in the actual broadcast because the time at my disposal was shorter than would allow me to get through that script.  But I have not been able to get a corrected copy of the typescript.  Does anybody who heard me reading that, and using that £20,000,000 phrase, believe that it is possible to make the deduction that I <Col N="390" /> promised then there would be a £20,000,000 reduction in this year's Budget?  That £20,000,000 was promised on a completely new policy.  Does it not appear from that that I thought Government Departments had too great powers and that they were interfering unnecessarily and extravagantly with decisions of the citizens, and that this state of affairs should be stopped? Would anybody hearing me speak in that broadcast believe that I thought Government Departments could be broken up in nine months and that any significant powers could be abstracted from the Government Departments in nine months?</P>
    <P>I believe the Minister for Local Government has taken a step towards handing back to the local authorities certain of their powers which had been taken from them.  I have taken that Department as an example because I want to refer to the Estimate for that Department which is for the sum of something like £4,500,000.  Whatever it is all but £500,000 are grants.  There are 400 civil servants employed by the Department of Local Government to distribute £4,000,000 worth of grants to the local authorities.  The latest return for local taxation&mdash;up to the 31st March, 1950&mdash;on page 5 gives a statement in regard to local authorities.  It is not easy to get a proper calculation made because you have got 27 county councils, four county boroughs, 51 urban district councils, town commissioners for 26 towns and so forth. Altogether there are 125 groups or units of elected representatives, and I have made a calculation that in the elections about to take place in a short time there will be over 1,700 elected to the different county councils, borough councils, and so on.  I said 1,700.  The Dáil here is about one-tenth of that. The Local Government Department has a vote which looks like £4,500,000, but £4,000,000 of that is almost entirely grants, and there is £500,000 left over for the administration of the Department which employs 400 civil servants to deal with these grants which are payable to councils representing a personnel of 1,700 people.  I believe that employees of local authorities number over 5,000 if one leaves out the people <Col N="391" /> who work on the road who would add a further 22,000.</P>
    <P>Does anybody believe it is essential that a community of less than 3,000,000 people who have 1,700 people elected to local authorities to represent them, who have under them 5,000 employees, leaving out this 22,000 road men, should be administered by a Department with less than 400 civil servants? I have quite a considerable experience of travelling through the country, mainly during holiday periods and very often I have got into contact with local officials, with administrative officers and engineers and other such people employed by local authorities, and the one sense I find stronger than any other in all of these people is one of frustration and disappointment at the delays and holds-up in schemes which they have sent to the Custom House for approval.  Of course, people who want to parade their worries are always inclined to exaggerate, but even after considering that, one must realise that there is a good lot of ground for their worries.  Quite frequently, schemes which have come up from local authorities for sanction have gone back after very long delays with very few alterations.  Schemes have gone back almost in the same form as they were sent up.</P>
    <P>I do not suppose that anyone would agree with me that this Department staffed by 400 civil servants could be dwindled down.  I have made proposals in the House over and over again in which I said that I believed the present system could be changed.  I must point out that this is only a belief, but I did subject it to a considerable amount of investigation when in the administrative side of the Government as Minister for Finance.  I believe there are considerable redundancies in the Civil Service.  I believe these redundancies have existed over the years but I also believe that a considerable change could be made and a considerable number of the redundancies removed without imposing a very great hardship on civil servants who have been working in their particular spheres over a number of years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="392" /> Neither do I consider that the present system of accounting for public moneys is the best that could be devised or that it is the best or the most proper one for this country.  I do not believe that it gives the safeguards to the people that it should give.  I believe a change could be made in regard to co-operation between the Comptroller and Auditor-General and the various Departments and I believe that change should be made in the interests of the community because I do not think this country can afford to bear the expenditure it has to shoulder at the moment.</P>
    <P>When I speak of economies in the Civil Service I do not mean that any immediate cuts should be made in the personnel.  There is an easier way for doing it, because each year there is a wastage&mdash;people go out on pensions, people die, people go to other occupations, people get vocations and people just leave.  But as I have said there is a considerable wastage over the years and that could be used to relieve redundancies without imposing the hardship of immediate curtailment of staff. There is no doubt that if redundancies could be got rid of it would be most beneficial to the State.  I would impress on the House that my point is that any redundancies should be eliminated over the years&mdash;over a considerable time.  I think the present Government ought to set about that task of finding out where these redundancies occur and securing a change in that position for the benefit of the community in general.</P>
    <P>I think, too, that the present Government would probably get a better response from the personnel of the Civil Service than would any previous Government; I cannot prophesy about any future Government.  I say that for the reason that the two inter-Party Governments played fair, and very fair, with Civil Service personnel.  We were responsible for setting up a type of arbitration that had been denied to them by the previous Fianna Fáil Government. We gave that to them, and we abided by the findings of such arbitration; and, even more recently, when the Government that the present Government succeeded decided to pay, but without paying the arrears, the increases recommended on arbitration <Col N="393" /> findings, we said then that if we got the chance to handle the finances of the State once more we would pay the arrears, and we did pay the arrears.</P>
    <P>I think State personnel ought to be very well disposed towards the present Government, the successor of the first inter-Party Government, and I say that one would get better results now, I think, from an approach to the civil servants, always making them realise and appreciate that, no matter what redundancy is discovered, there will be no question of dismissals or no question of imposing hardship on people who have come to get their livelihood in posts that were thrown open to them and to which they succeeded in the ordinary way.</P>
    <P>I still believe in what I said in my broadcast.  I think Government Departments are far too large.  I think there is unnecessary interference with people's businesses and people's lives. If that mood could be generated in the minds of Deputies, and more particularly in those who, becoming members of Government from time to time, control Departments we would have a more satisfactory position here.  If policy was moulded in such manner as to give more and more responsibility to local groups, or even to the individual himself, we could over a period of years dislodge these mammoth Departments and get to a better type of living.  I think that policy is capable of implementation but I think, too, that it will have to be done easily and slowly over a period of years because if one were to rush at this there would be hardships.  That is not necessary.</P>
    <P>Now, if anyone takes from that speech of mine that there is a promised reduction of £20,000,000, which was the phrase used by Deputy MacEntee last night, then that person is clearly incapable of understanding the full and clear implications of my statement, or else he is wilfully ignoring them in a decision to make that statement a mere debating point here.  Even if we are in the position, as I have said earlier, in which one person says: &ldquo;You cannot make economies; we do not believe you can make economies and you are not going to make economies,&rdquo; I think we <Col N="394" /> have given the people at least some hope.  We have given an indication in four different ways of what a particular attitude of mind can bring about.</P>
    <P>An editorial in the papers the other day about disappointment was referred to.  Now Fianna Fáil have suffered four major disappointments in the last eight months.  They have been disappointed in relation to the reduction in the price of butter; they have been grievously disappointed in relation to our cushioning the people against an increase in the price of tea&mdash;an increase we did not think would last and in relation to which we thought it better politics for the economy of the country to cushion the people against for the time being.</P>
    <P>The third disappointment was the Book of Estimates and the figure on the cover of it, although one must remember&mdash;I say this in the absence of the Minister for Finance, but he will give his own explanation subsequently &mdash;producing the Book of Estimates is only one part of the account.  One knows that that book has to be examined still further to see what can be regarded as proper to be met out of taxation in a particular year.  One has to find out, as Deputy Lemass said, if there is constant overestimation of expenditure by Departments and, if so, what does it amount to and what can be deducted.  It is a matter, also, to be examined before the Budget is presented; this is only one side of the account and it is taken without any advertence at all to the new view, so to speak, that may be taken of that as forecasting expenditure along certain lines.</P>
    <P>The fourth great disappointment is this matter of the bank rate, about which Fianna Fáil have not yet made up their minds.  I think these things are significant.  Further, I think it is quite clear to the public who either listen in or read the debates that if Fianna Fáil were still in Government there would have been no reduction in the price of butter.  Tea would be selling at 3/- per lb. more than it is at the moment.  The Book of Estimates would certainly not show even a reduction of £2,750,000 on its cover. <Col N="395" /> If we are to judge them not merely by their past performance but by their peculiar arguments here in the last couple of days the bank rate here would have moved in accordance with the bank rate in England.  These four things are clear and mark the great distinction between the people who are opposite to me now and the people who sit beside me on these benches.</P>
    <P>Coming to the butter subsidy, I do not recollect now if there was any consistency in the argument used against that except possibly that the Fianna Fáil Government must have expected that, since 1952, subsidies would never be attempted again.  They must remember that we agreed with our colleagues in Government on a programme and in that programme it was the aim in particular to keep the price of foodstuffs down.  We certainly did not disavow the possible or probable use of subsidies.  I want now to put a point to anyone who may feel inclined to argue about that: Supposing it was possible to get the cost of Government down by £5,000,000 or £6,000,000, is there any better use to which that money could be put than in subsidising the price of essential foodstuffs? I do not know in what other way one could benefit the general income of the community at large.  A reduction in taxation may only apply to certain sections.  One can think of meeting the industrialists, for instance, in relation to depreciation at the moment. I do not want to be taken as agreeing to that, but I want to point out that that would benefit only a limited group. If one has £5,000,000 or £6,000,000 to spend, what better way is there in present circumstances of making that beneficial to the whole community other than by some process of subsidisation?</P>
    <P>I come now to tea.  We are told now that this is more than subsidisation: it is borrowing.  I do not think it is. Certainly we have not come to that point yet.  It may be that, looking back on it a year hence, something will have to be found to meet the overdraft, and that will have to be taken out of borrowed moneys.  But we have not come to that yet.  I cannot understand <Col N="396" /> the mistake in its application to tea. Possibly it was a mistake also in its application to turf.  One of the complaints made against me in 1951 was that I had made no provision with regard to the overdraft of Fuel Importers.  That is tucked into the Book of Estimates as a Supplementary Estimate brought in in that year; it amounted to £3,079,000.  It is possible apparently, therefore, without hurting the economic sensitivity of certain people in Fianna Fáil to borrow for turf, but at no time apparently is it possible or economically sound to borrow in order to cushion the price of tea, even under present circumstances, in which it is quite clear that the increase with which we were faced, had the ordinary price been allowed to have its play, was a completely artificial one.  Since then tea has been reduced twice in England.</P>
    <P>In regard to the third matter, namely this Book of Estimates, we are told: &ldquo;Oh, you may have got £2,750,000, but look at what it is; first of all, part of it is in capital services and on the Supply Services in the year there are certain windfalls.&rdquo; One must offset in the Estimates of any year the things that are windfalls and the things that are extraordinary expenditure that have to come in increased payment during another year. This is supposed to come from American money.  It is quite proper to take advantage of that.  If that is not so, for instance, Fianna Fáil would have in some way applied that to the reduction of the national debt, to be regarded as not to be part of the year's costs.  They would be showing a Book of Estimates far increased on last year instead of being at least this healthy reversal of the old trend that was observable.</P>
    <P>Last of all these matters is the banks.  Here, of course, it is quite impossible to find out what Fianna Fáil mean about the bank matter.  I heard Deputy Lemass speak to-day and, of course, he was ready to go on one road until he was held up by quotations and then, adept as he is in changing his feet, he did not get very much round towards a new point of view.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="397" /> Deputy MacEntee made a speech which can and must be taken as a speech entirely in favour of the banks, a speech whose tendency would be, and I think it was intended, to cause a certain amount of panic amongst people who are depositors.  He gets back to that shocking advertisement that was issued during the election. Deputies talk here about promises. They have not been identified as such.</P>
    <P>That appalling advertisement was published by the <i>Irish Times</i> and the <i>Irish Press</i> but I do not think the <i>Irish Independent</i> published it.  Does the Deputy remember the &ldquo;Bill Sikes&rdquo; advertisement, in which Deputy Norton was shown?  There was a second person depicted, by some identified as myself and by others as another colleague of the then Government, Deputy MacBride, but either he or I with Deputy Norton and some third person.  We were there in the coloured jerseys and all the gross appearance of the safe-crackers and with the jemmy in our hands and the line underneath was &ldquo;It is your money they are after&rdquo;.  That was arising out of a complete misquotation of a statement I made asking here that something should be done earlier which is now being done in England, brought in by a Liberal Government and kept on by a Conservative Government, to drive out money secretly hidden in the banks, without being taxed, so that the tax would be levied.  I think the same mischievous attempt was made here last night to stampede depositors. Following the lines of an editorial, the man who was talking last night found fault with the Minister for Finance's approach to the banks.  Whether he wagged the big stick at them at all, if he made representations to them, if he argued with them, the fact that he got a result is what pains Fianna Fáil.  According to Deputy MacEntee last night, that was getting near towards the socialisation, the nationalisation and the Sovietisation of the banking system and then, of course, his imagination went wild and he asked would this be applied to Jacobs and Guinness's&mdash;the usual sort of mess that Deputy MacEntee is so experienced in creating.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="398" /> Deputy MacEntee was quoted by the present Minister for Health, Mr. O'Higgins, when he was a Deputy of Dáil Éireann.  I have both the quotation and the original from which it was taken.  I think the quotation puts it very well.  At column 341 of the Dáil debates of the 12th March, 1953, Deputy O'Higgins, as he then was, referred to Mr. MacEntee, speaking about credit facilities and quoted what he had said in 1927, as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;You have seen what France did, as this British observer says, by her own resources.  She had not to borrow abroad.  The money, credit and capital, as well as the labour to do this was provided by France. How has that been accomplished? The Government controlled the credit and retained control of that credit, notwithstanding the inducements made to it by foreign financiers to surrender it.  The Government was not under the control of the credit manufacturer, as the present Government in Ireland has been since the day the Provisional Government accepted their first loan from the Bank of Ireland early in 1922.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He is criticising Mr. Cosgrave, then President of the Executive Council.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Controlling that credit power, the Government of France compelled it to the service of the State. It never allowed it to restrict itself so as to cripple industry, but forced it to expand, when such expansion was necessary to carry through the great schemes of national reconstruction that the State had framed. Compare the blessings that the policy of that enlightened and patriotic Government brought to its people with the misery and suffering we have endured under Mr. Cosgrave, who has kept us all the time tied up in a strait-waistcoat of Threadneedle Street.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins went on, in column 342 of the same debate, 12th March, to give a quotation from the 23rd September, 1931, when the then Fianna Fáil Minister for Finance said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Even before the Fianna Fáil Party went into the Dáil, its members <Col N="399" /> had directed public attention to the dangers to which our people were exposed by reason not only of our attachment to sterling but of the shortsighted policy of the Anglo-Irish bankers in investing their depositors' funds in British securities.  The Free State Government, under President Cosgrave, has been on the side of Britain.  The Anglo-Irish banks have been on the side of Britain.  The Currency Commission has been on the side of Britain.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the speech of a man who wanted credit control and credit control by a Government.  I suggest that is the only interpretation to be taken from that and the condemnation is, surely, that people here were in a strait-waistcoat with Threadneedle Street and that the Free State Government and the banks&mdash;the Anglo-Irish banks&mdash;he was not so friendly disposed to them&mdash;and the Currency Commission were all on the side of Britain.  What has happened in the last two or three days to annoy Fianna Fáil is that a step was taken which they would not have taken, of course.  Therefore, they have to deride it and try to cause panic and disorder.</P>
    <P>What do Fianna Fáil want us to do? It is quite clear that what called for this particular movement in Britain did not operate here.  There are many articles on this subject.  I have one here from the <i>Sunday Times</i> of February 27th.  A paragraph that occurs in it is this:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The main signal of trouble was the trade returns.  The terms of international trade have been moving against us for some months; the excess of imports over exports has been growing; sterling has been weak&mdash;a sterling-area matter.  At the same time the volume of money in circulation has been rising, with accompanying pressure towards higher prices. The classical instrument for correcting both those sets of symptoms is a rise in bank rate.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The two sets of symptoms are that the excess of imports over exports has been growing&mdash;with us it is the reverse; there is still an excess but it has been <Col N="400" /> lessening&mdash;secondly, the volume of money in circulation, whatever it is, has caused pressure towards higher prices.  There has been no such pressure here.  These are the two matters for which the classical remedy is a rise in the bank rate.  Would the Minister for Finance here have been doing his duty if he had heard that bankers here, although the reasons for this classical remedy were not present, were going to apply the remedy&mdash;would he have been doing his duty if he failed to point out that it was the economic position in England that called for what happened there and that there was no economic reason here calling for what had happened in England?  For that, the fuss has now been made, that this is Sovietisation of the banks; the big stick has been wielded, representation has been made.  Deputy Lemass says he does not know what happened; he wants to know.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>He says he does not know if there is a <i>quid pro quo</i> but he wants to know what it was. All this effort to spread suspicion is indicative of the old policy adopted here at the time we had decided on the programme of capital development. At that time the city was flooded with disgraceful posters with replicas of the three balls of the pawnbroker's trade and then we were asked about putting the country in pawn.  That was done by people who, when they succeeded us a couple of years later, kept on the same schemes as being proper for capital development that we had thought of in our time.  A newspaper, in a recent editorial, talked about partitioning the banks.  They had told us that for 35 years, since the country was partitioned, Irish banks preserved their uniformity of overdraft and deposit rates on both sides of the Border.  The whole article was a lamentation that we had not moved in the same way as the British.  Of course, the article is laughable.  One can imagine some group of people, with a background of fervent nationalism, parading themselves as people who are against Partition but I have <Col N="401" /> not heard yet as weak an excuse or comment with regard to the Partition problem as people telling us, so to speak: &ldquo;You are causing partition amongst the banks.  We should all be together on the same overdraft rate. That is in the interest of Caitlin Ni Houlihan.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Particularly when it goes up.  It reminds me of the old pantomime comic: &ldquo;Will you hit me with the child in my arms?&rdquo;  This group of banks, not terribly outstanding in national history, now says: &ldquo;Are you going to hit us in our efforts against Partition when we have the unity of the country through overdraft rates in our arms?&rdquo;  That is the binding force here.</P>
      <P>They ask who is responsible for creating this dividing line.  I would like that question to be answered.  I wonder who is responsible?  I would like the people who inspired these editorials to answer that themselves &mdash;who is responsible for creating this dividing line?  And, if they want to pursue that, will they go on and say further was there any other time in which, without any force or representation or big stick being used against them, they kept rates, say, rates on deposit, lower than what such rates on deposits are in England and, if so, what was the reason for it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They compare rates on deposits here with what rates on deposits are in England.  We are told that one of the results in the difference in the bank rates between the two countries will be a drift of liquid assets to the North and all that for a difference of ½ per cent. on small deposits.  A ½ per cent. per year is £5,000 on £1,000,000 and a ½ per cent. for a year on £20,000,000 would amount to about £100,000.  No one has told us how long the bank rate increase in England is going to last but I have read forecasts in newspapers that it will last four, five or six months and three months was the lowest forecast that was given. If you divide ½ per cent. over the year by that length of time you will see <Col N="402" /> how much it really amounts to and then we are told that the small depositor is not getting as much as he would get if the bank rate had been increased here.</P>
    <P>Strabane and Lifford have been mentioned and the newspaper is all out in sympathy with the small farmer who would get a lower rate here in Lifford and you get an imaginative picture painted of the small farmer living in Lifford who has to cross the road or cross the bridge to Strabane to put his money there in order to get the high rate.  Of course there is no necessity at all for him to cross the Border to do it.  There are different ways in which he could do it and he can do it quite easily by post.  I have always held that the owners of small farms and corresponding members of the community have never been investors in the true sense of the word. If we could only get those persons to get the mentality of the investor and to go looking for the ½ per cent. interest we would have completely transformed the whole banking position as it is now.</P>
    <P>In any case there are other funds in which the small investor can put his money without going to the North at all and at the same time get more than the ½ per cent.  The Post Office Savings Bank is one.  All he has to do to place his money in the Post Office Savings Bank is to cross the street.</P>
    <P>Has there been any great drift of money from the deposits in the bank caused by this ½ per cent?  Yet we are told that this is what is going to happen.  Finally, I do not know if the banking system in this country cannot find from its own reserves enough money to meet even that ½ per cent. for a period of three months.  If the banks cannot do that for a period of three or even six months, then it is about time that we had a complete reconstruction or at least an investigation of our banking system.  How many banks have we?  A multitude. Do they do any good as far as competitive basis is concerned?  The whole of the banking business in this country is ruled by the Irish Banks' Standing Committee and they do not operate as <Col N="403" /> one against the other.  The whole question is ruled by the banks themselves and I do not know whether this community can support for very much longer seven, or eight, or nine banking institutions with all their overheads and heavy staffs.  If we find the banks so reduced that out of reserves they cannot meet the ½ per cent. for small depositors over a period of three or six months, then surely the time is opportune for an investigation in the interests of this community.  Surely that matter is one that should be adverted to.</P>
    <P>Referring to that matter, I should like to make it clear that if there had to be an amalgamation of bank control I do not think that it ought to be taken out of the staff.  I have the same attitude to the staff of the banks as I have to the personnel of the State.  If there is to be any redundancy over this matter it should not be visited on the staffs.</P>
    <P>I want to know what the members of the late Government think we should have done under the circumstances. Why should the bank rate be raised here simply because this country had to follow England more particularly when the emergency which caused the raising of the rate in England was not an emergency here?  The conditions which operate in England are completely absent.  What would you have done?  I think that what should have been done was what was done and that an approach should have been made to the banks.  That approach was made to the banks.  I was not in at the conference and I do not know what happened, but the results were good and they will endure for years to come.</P>
    <P>I think that this is a real landmark. The banks did agree to do what was asked of them and they found it possible to raise the rate and to pay it to the large depositors.  That argues that the banks have some reserves.  We have debated here for many years the habit of the banks of locating a vast amount of their money in England. How is that money lodged in England? Does it get the benefit of what the Chancellor has done in England?  Will <Col N="404" /> that inure to the credit of the banks here?  I think the whole thing is fantastic. People here are not so sensitive to bank rate changes.  The small depositor of this country is not the one to endeavour to make money through money and I think that we can be complacent that there is going to be no such drift of this type of money out of the country.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance had to meet the banks with what I think is a very happy result and we have now got the banks to admit that they do not voluntarily have to follow what is done in England.  We have got them to admit that emergency circumstances in England do not warrant emergency circumstances here.  There have been two or three such landmarks in the last four or five years.  The first of these was the question of the extravagant interest on very short-term borrowing.  The second was the question of the taking up of Dublin Corporation stock.  At first they said that it could not be done but then when they were asked to meet some officials of the Department of Finance, they told us that they could do what we asked all right and that it was only a bookkeeping entry.  The third landmark was reached the other day.  We have got the admission from the banks that we have got to treat the bank rate as a matter of economics and that it ought not be raised because of circumstances in another country but unless there is something wrong in the economy of this country.  They are not going to apply a remedy for a disease when the disease is not present here. They cannot now get back from that.</P>
    <P>The banks should meet the people who are elected by the community.  A most important matter is the control of credit here.  The banks ought to meet us on that point and change the practice they have carried on for many years contrary to the good of this country.</P>
    <P>In a lecture in which Deputy Lemass said that he was going to change the Fianna Fáil policy and which he said was a formidable task and referred to the magnitude of the work he referred to two or three things which meant that he was turning his back on previous <Col N="405" /> Fianna Fáil policy.  In that lecture he wanted to know if it was right to continue the Control of Manufactures Acts as it was at the moment. He spoke about banks and he said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The attitude of the Irish investors is still negative in the main. They have to be induced and attracted to invest in Irish projects instead of being on the look-out for projects to support.</P>
    <P>An explanation of that attitude lies, I think, in the situation that allows investment by Irish citizens in Britain to be as free&mdash;and often easier and less risky&mdash;as it is in Ireland.  New Irish industries are in competition for Irish savings with the old-established and often very profitable enterprises of Britain.  The much greater strength of the British capital market, the absence of restrictions on the transfer of funds, the links between the Irish banks and stock exchanges with Britain, the advice offered by bank officials and stockbrokers, all tend to encourage Irish investment in Britain as against investment in Ireland.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This account is taken from the Press of the 18th January 1955.  Deputy Lemass was not so strong in his appreciation of the Irish banking situation then as he was to-day.  Having dealt with the links between the Irish banks and the stock exchanges in Britain and the advice of bank officials and stockbrokers, he went to Waterford to address a group there.  He was asked some questions and said that &ldquo;the soundness of any system of taxation depended on its effect on the citizens in relation to their ability to work, save and invest&rdquo;.  He spoke of the year 1953, the year in which his Minister for Finance had failed to get a complete response from the public to a loan that was being sought. Deputy Lemass pointed out:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In 1953 the external investments of the Irish commercial banks increased by £7,400,000.  Private Irish persons invested £5,100,000 abroad in the same year, and the external holdings of the Central Bank increased by £5,200,000.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="406" /> That is in a year in which his colleague in the Government did not get the loan he wanted, and the general suggestion in business and financial circles was that that was the case because the money was not there.  The money will not be here if you get a situation in which the Irish commercial banks increase their foreign investments by £7,500,000, private citizens by £5,000,000 and the Central Bank by £5,200,000.  It is a small thing, but it shows a tendency and certainly does not lead anyone to think that Deputy Lemass's enthusiasm for the Irish banking system was at all genuine to-day.</P>
    <P>I would like finally to come to one thing here that I made out from the Estimates last night.  Deputy Lemass &mdash;and he was a Minister with many years' experience&mdash;told us, in the quotation I gave, that 95 per cent. of all Government expenditure was in salaries and wages.  That is nonsense. He knew it was nonsense and he corrected himself afterwards.  One has to wait for the correction.  I would like if he would admit the correction to himself first and then give us the speech without the gloss, instead of making the speech and letting us wait to deal with the gloss on it.  I would like to mention a couple of items I took from the Book of Estimates.  There are superannuation and kindred items found under five different headings in the Book of Estimates&mdash;Superannuation and Retired Allowances, Superannuation for the Garda, Army Pensions, Posts and Telegraphs Superannuation, and Primary Teachers.  The tot of the whole is £4,617,000.  If I take Social Insurance and Social Assistance, Vote 61, and take one item, the surplus of expenditure over income in the Social Insurance Fund, it is £2,750,000; Social Assistance, which includes old age pensions, is £71,000,000, and if I take the Health Vote, the grants to health authorities, that is, after being recouped the £500,000 or 90 per cent. of the £500,000, costing the State £6,600,000; and the amount of the Hospitals Trust Grant-in-Aid to make up the deficiency in Hospitals Trust money in relation to certain hospital grants, £2,250,000; this Social Insurance, Assistance and Health amounted to £29,000,000.  If I <Col N="407" /> add on to that the £4,600,000&mdash;and I do not believe I have extracted from the Estimates all that is for superannuation&mdash;between Assistance, Insurance, Health and Superannuation there is £33,750,000.  In those not merely could there be no reduction but those probably are going to rise over the years.</P>
    <P>If you take that in a Book of Estimates for £92,000,000&mdash;taking the Supply part only&mdash;that represents 36 per cent.  That I regard as rigid and fast, unless there can be some improvement. For instance, if it is possible to get some part of the Health left off the taxpayer and put on to the people, letting them insure, with a State contribution, it might break up some part of Health.  It might be the same with some of the Social Insurance items, though they are less open to any sort of change.  Superannuation cannot be changed.  There is £33,000,000, 36 per cent. of the Book for this year, rigid, in which there can be no change. There is State personnel in a good deal of the rest.  I am cutting out the State personnel charge; I have not taken the salaries of these Departments.  The &ldquo;95 per cent.&rdquo; is just nonsense&mdash;but that was Deputy Lemass's loud-voiced statement on the unreliable information which he used.  If there is to be any attack made upon the expenditure of the State, it is to be got through cutting down Departments.  You cannot touch any part of that; you have only the other 63 per cent. left.  Some part of that is State personnel and I believe the State personnel problem can be attacked best in the way I spoke of, namely, by an examination of redundancy and, to preserve the people from the impact of that redundancy, by cutting down the recruitment in the future.</P>
    <P>I believe the Opposition have not recovered really from the election result.  The election result, as I say, was due entirely to the fact that the people recognised what Deputy Lemass recognised only late in the day that there is expected from public representatives honesty and integrity and that honesty and integrity are not met by making promises and then flagrantly <Col N="408" /> voting for changes in them within a year of their being made.</P>
    <P>There are two other things I would like to deal with to-day.  There was talk by Deputy Lemass to-day about 100,000 jobs being found for people. Did he mean that that was the net improvement in employment?  There was no net improvement in employment in the country.  I have only the figures that relate to the period 1938 to 1953, so this is not a complete picture. In 1938 farm employment was over 500,000&mdash;537,000.  By 1953 that had gone down to 421,000, a decrease of 116,000.  In other occupations the figures for 1938 showed a tot of 166,000; that increased to 226,000, so it was up by 60,000, but the farm employment was down by 116,000.  There was no net increase in employment over the Fianna Fáil period&mdash;none.  It may be that here and there was an odd thousand, but there was no significant increase.</P>
    <P>Of course, this is one of these matters that people have to get used to&mdash;these statements of Deputy Lemass about 100,000 jobs.  He does not think of the impact of his particular high-cost production through the factories and the reaction of that upon the farm population.</P>
    <P>Finally, Deputy Lemass came to the E.S.B. business.  I do not want to say too much about that.  It must be an amazing grievance to Fianna Fáil to find that the two things that they can boast about over the years are, first of all, the whole electrification of the country, the &ldquo;white elephant,&rdquo; so to speak, which appears in the returns now to show no extravagance and no cost; and the second is the condition of our trade returns&mdash;and we have seen that good trade returns nearly all depend upon cattle, the cattle trade which the Fianna Fáil Party set out to destroy.  That was the cattle trade going to the English market, which they said &ldquo;Thank God, is gone and gone forever.&rdquo;  The only two points of happiness, so to speak, in the eyes of the community, is that the cattle trade is flourishing and the E.S.B.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass complains that the E.S.B. are asking the Shannon to bear <Col N="409" /> the whole cost of rural electrification. It is a bit of a bagatelle, a mere £5,000. It used to be £800,000.  Fianna Fáil in their day had the idea with regard to the subvention of rural electrification that it had to be borne in one year from the taxpayer and so they entered up this figure from £500,000 to £800,000.  We discovered that the E.S.B. bears half and that we pay half of whatever subvention there is in regard to rural electrification.  The E.S.B. funded that over 30 years.  The E.S.B. is ruled by a public auditor and he has the duty of calling the attention of the House to anything that is not in accordance with good accountancy practice.  He passed for years past the system which the E.S.B. had of spreading these costs over 30 years.</P>
    <P>The attitude here was: &ldquo;Pay in one year&rdquo;.  We did not take that view. We funded it and adopted the E.S.B. system.  Then in the first period after Fianna Fáil returned in 1951 Deputy Lemass persuaded Deputy MacEntee to go back to the old system and we got the whole money put in each year until last year they made a discovery, and then suddenly they decide to adopt the practice we have followed over a number of years.  Now they object because we say the E.S.B. made £250,000 last year and can easily meet this subvention for rural electrification. What is wrong with that?  It is another of these matters which show what the situation would be if Fianna Fáil were still in power.  That £85,000 would be put on the shoulders of the taxpayer and would not have to be borne by the E.S.B.  The E.S.B. last year made £250,000 and we ask them to dispose as to one-third of their profits in this way.  Deputy Lemass said they could not make a profit, that they never have profits, but they have surplus revenue. Well, we asked them to put one-third of this surplus into rural electrification.</P>
    <P>I think that is good policy.  I certainly do not think there is anything economically wrong with it.  It is a policy we have adopted and will stand over and take responsibility for.  The big change, however, which the public must recognise is the attitude we have taken towards the control of credit and <Col N="410" /> of the banking system in this country which was never thought of before, or else it was thought unwise, and people were tentative about adopting it.  We have adopted that particular policy and I will be very disappointed personally in years to come if what was done by the Minister for Finance in connection with the bank rate in the last few weeks does not lead on to better progress with the banks for the benefit of the community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I notice the Attorney-General in referring to efforts made by Deputy Lemass to indicate possible lines of approach to this new policy seemed to think that that was extraordinary, but I can point to the fact that the major part of the Fine Gael policy which showed any noticeable changes up to 1948 was simply a halfhearted adoption of most of the plans put forward by Fianna Fáil in the previous 15 years, as an illustration of how another Party can also make changes in its policy.</P>
      <P>The Attorney-General had a good deal to say about the possibility of eliminating the control or most of the control exercised by the Department of Local Government in regard to the local authorities.  That is a point on which there has been very little discussion in this House.  I think the Attorney-General will realise that, with the consent of various Governments, the Minister for Local Government has controlled with tremendous force all the activities of the local authorities and that no change was made during the inter-Party Government and no change has been made in the recent Local Government Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The changes made in the Local Government Bill are purely of a marginal character and to suggest that we in Fianna Fáil were in any way responsible for making these controls or for establishing them is ridiculous.  Many of them were created in the time of the British Government and have never since been altered and they are all based on one general principle, that if the Government provides finance for local authorities, and in the interests of the ratepayers, they must have control in regard to uniformity of conditions, <Col N="411" /> uniformity of pay of officials, uniformity of pensions of officials, uniformity of method by which rates are collected and assessed, uniformity in performance of activities by the councils, uniformity in the method by which construction work is effected, by which sites are purchased, uniformity with the object of achieving a high standard.  We could have a very interesting debate here&mdash;which has very little to do with the Estimates&mdash;on whether in our present stage of development it would be possible to reduce those controls, whether local authorities should be allowed to carry out variations in administrative procedure or in respect of building, methods by which sites are acquired, payments of their staffs and so on.</P>
    <P>I think the Attorney-General raised a very interesting point in regard to that but I do not think it bears much relation to the present Estimates and certainly the Minister for Finance has not made any alteration in the staff of the Department of Local Government with a view to altering the nature of the control of local authorities.  My own belief is that the Minister for Finance, so long as he has to provide the £4,000,000 worth of grants and so long as he has to be responsible for the issue of moneys from the Central Fund for the roads, would be reluctant to alter the system which gives him power to insist on some sort of uniformity and some sort of minimum standard of performance.  I may be wrong, but I doubt if during the term of the present Government he will be willing to allow any moneys to be spent without very considerable control of the manner in which they are spent.  I think that all this talk was just flying a kite to see what effect it would have on the mind of the public.</P>
    <P>The Attorney-General had a good deal to say about the banks and their practices.  That reminds me again that when the inter-Party Government took office in 1948 one of the minor reasons perhaps why they secured a few more votes than they had the year before was the elaborate policy put forward largely by Clann na Poblachta for a complete change in the whole financial system, implying there would be a <Col N="412" /> difference between the banking system of this country and that of England and the promise that there would be drastic currency changes.  When Deputy MacBride joined the inter-Party Government not only was he unable to have any of those principles adopted but he was not even able to do something which might perhaps have been done either by the inter-Party Government or by the Fianna Fáil Government. That would be to have some sort of an inquiry to see whether the general conclusions of the banking report from 1935 to 1938 were still valid and to see whether there should not be an inquiry into a number of aspects relating to economic and credit policy.</P>
    <P>It is very easy for the Attorney-General to talk about all the banks may or may not do, but the inter-Party Government made no effort when in office to investigate the position. Perhaps they would institute an inquiry now seeing that they have a very substantial majority and have every opportunity so far as one can see, unless they disagree amongst themselves, of being able to take time to go into those things.  If they so wish they can investigate all these matters.  As the Minister for Finance knows very well, it is very easy to talk vaguely about credit and interest rates and it is very easy to pretend that we can divorce ourselves from the sterling area in regard to these matters.  But I suppose the Minister for Finance would agree that unless we decide to abandon our position as a sterling country there are always some upward limits beyond which we cannot go in making changes, that is, between this country and the rest of the sterling area, that so long as we have 86 per cent. of our total trade with Great Britain that it would be unwise to make the changes which while they might have some advantages in one direction, would have great disadvantages in another direction and that therefore all these matters require very careful study.</P>
    <P>I suppose one of the most important elements of the whole situation is one to which the Attorney-General adverted.  He asked how it was possible for the banks not to raise the bank rate when we have a banking <Col N="413" /> system in which as much as £40,000,000 at a time can be withdrawn or invested from deposit over a short-term period causing the need for short-term British investment.</P>
    <P>All we ask in connection with the recent decision by the banks not to raise the rate of interest&mdash;I do not think I need repeat what Deputy Lemass said in detail&mdash;is that we should know the machinery by which the action took place, whether the Central Bank was acting as a liaison between the Government and the banks.  We would like to know what arrangements took place because we think changes of that kind or changes in policy of that kind should be made in an orderly manner.  Nothing more was said.  We did not suggest the bank rate should be raised.  We simply asked for more information from the Government in regard to the manner in which the negotiations took place.</P>
    <P>As the House probably knows, bank rates have shown changes for the last few years for which this country was largely not responsible.  The rate of interest in the banks in the sterling area was raised all over the world during the period of inflation and slowly fell thereafter but of course it was common practice at that time to accuse the Fianna Fáil Government of being responsible for the rate of interest when it went up not only in London but in every country in the sterling area.  We got no credit for the fact that the rate of interest went down towards the end of our period of Government. We were supposed to be responsible for the increase but we were not given any credit for the reduction that took place and the general argument applied during the election was that the Government somehow or other ought to be able to control the general rate of interest in the world.  There was not a country except those with currencies as strong as the dollar currency countries&mdash;such as Belgium and Switzerland&mdash;where rates of interest did not go up but of course when the rate of interest went down we were given no credit for that.</P>
    <P>The Attorney-General referred to a speech in which I spoke of the paternalistic functions of the State.  It is <Col N="414" /> very easy&mdash;I suppose we have it on both sides&mdash;to quote speeches out of their context but what I was referring to when I spoke of the paternalistic functions of the State was in the course of the value of the social services, social services of the kind which are now accepted by the present Government and an integral part of our society.  I was describing the difference between what could be termed a materialistic State as supported by Communists and the paternalistic State as agreed to by Christian society and the effort made by the Attorney-General to suggest I was investing the State with some divine responsibility is ludicrous.</P>
    <P>I was trying to counter the attacks made against the social services by Deputies such as the Attorney-General and such as the Taoiseach who whenever they thought it was to their advantage criticised the social services which they know are finally approved and finally enshrined in the Statute Book about which they will do nothing.  They will make no alteration. I was talking about the habit of Fine Gael Deputies in describing social services as medicines taken down from the shelves when required and that they should not be really a part of the fabric of the social economy.  I was saying that we in Fianna Fáil believed that the social services as we then established them were necessary, that they are essential and that they are voluntarily contributed to by the whole of the people and that the State acts as a friendly agent in collecting moneys and dispersing them.  Of course it is very easy to take one sentence out of that statement and to make me look as if I was some kind of Communist dictator preaching the idea of the materialistic State.</P>
    <P>Having dealt with some of the minor observations of the Attorney-General I want to say something about the Estimates.  I think we must repeat again that speeches made by members of the Government during the election gave the people the expectation that there would be a wholesale slashing of expenditure.  There was no talk at the time of the election about not reducing expenditure that involved the dismissal of civil servants.  I quite <Col N="415" /> agree with the Attorney-General that the wholesale dismissal of civil servants in order to effect economy would be entirely unjustified.  If there are to be economies of that kind they can only be through retirement and the normal wastage.  But there was no talk of that during the general election.  There was no indication that the slashing of expenditure would involve the dismissal of civil servants. We are told there was a completely fantastic conception of how to spend Government money in the minds of the Fianna Fáil Ministers, that there was a wild inflation of expenditure that could be easily corrected by a few strokes of a few pens.</P>
    <P>That was the talk we heard down the countryside and the further the Fine Gael Ministers got from places where they were being reported by the Press the more insistent and clamant they were that expenditure could be drastically reduced.  I remember sitting and listening to my colleague in Westmeath-Longford, Deputy General MacEoin, making lengthy speeches in which he announced what appeared to be a new philosophy, the philosophy that the people of the country must spend money and not the Government. He went on to say at great length that if the inter-Party Government was elected to office the people would be allowed to spend their own money.  The whole implication behind Deputy General MacEoin's speech was not that they would be able to spend a little more money by paying taxes and paying for a subsidy on butter.  It was not a question of a marginal change; it was not anything related to 1d. on the pint of stout or 1d. for 20 cigarettes. It was to be a completely different outlook towards expenditure.  He said that during the three years of Fianna Fáil Government in office something had happened to cause all Fianna Fáil Ministers to go crazy, that they increased all the Estimates without measure, without due consideration and that there would be a complete and drastic change if the Fine Gael Party were returned to office or if an inter-Party Government was formed, and the phrases used were as I have described: &ldquo;You people, if we are returned <Col N="416" /> to office will be able to spend your own money in your own way.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As I have said, there was no suggestions merely that they would be able to spend another 6d. in every £ in their own way or another 3d. or another 1d. in every £.  It was a question of being able to spend shillings, many shillings in every £.  There was to be a complete financial explosion, so to speak, and at the end of it expenditure would have collapsed.  I want to be fair to the Attorney-General with his explanation of his broadcast which I think to some extent was reasonable.  I think when he said that a &ldquo;distinct change of policy is required and a new outlook on the part of the Ministers is demanded if the reduction in Government expenditure of £20,000,000 and upwards, desirable in everybody's interests, is to be achieved.&rdquo;  That statement by itself if one examines it carefully does not promise to reduce expenditure by £20,000,000.  But it must be read in the context of what was said down the country in back lanes or other remote places and in public houses by canvassers.  They were banging their bottles of beer on the counter and talking about what would happen if the Fine Gael Party was elected, and saying that the price of beer could be reduced to what it was in the good old days.  People were prepared to interpret the Attorney-General as saying that £20,000,000 could be taken off the expenditure.</P>
    <P>Then we had Deputy MacEoin, who was reported in the <i>Sligo Champion</i> of the 20th March, 1954, making a more extravagant statement.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If Fine Gael are returned to office they will take steps to see to it that the Central Fund would undertake responsibility for all future expenditure, and for some of the existing expenditure which was at present being met by the local rates.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was an astonishing statement to make because we know that Fine Gael Deputies are going around the country blaming the Fianna Fáil Party for the increased rates occasioned by the Health Act for which they have admitted full responsibility.  Deputy General MacEoin was saying that that <Col N="417" /> would remove some of the burdens off local authorities.  I presume that it is too late now for us to expect that reductions are being considered, and that the Government will proceed to honour that promise.  We can assume that if that particular promise was to be honoured it would be made when the rates were being struck and before the advent of the local government elections.  Those were the kind of things which were being said.  When the Attorney-General spoke he referred to the hair-shirt policy of Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>I think that if we look round at the people of this country both in 1952 and subsequent years we will see no sign of a hair-shirt policy resulting from the Fianna Fáil Government which provided most of the social services and most of the better conditions of living. When we hear Government members talk of a hair-shirt policy I think we should contradict that every time we hear it.  Deputy McGilligan, the Attorney-General, went back over the history of the inflation period in 1951 and said that we had taken the advice of the Central Bank in connection with our financial policy.  We rejected most of the advice of the Central Bank. They made all sorts of proposals few of which were in fact adopted by the Government.  But the interesting point about it is this: It was the present Attorney-General who gave the first warning to the country of the kind that was given in more stringent and conservative terms by the Central Bank. When Deputy McGilligan gets up in this House and talks about our hair-shirt policy in 1951, so long as he speaks on that matter we should remind him of his own speech at the time of the Budget in May, 1951.  He solemnly warned the country that the policy could not continue, that the rate of public expenditure had grown too high, that something would have to be done to control inflation, and that something would have to be done to control the level of consumption, involving the cutting of exports. Unless something was done he said he could not foresee a period of economic stability.</P>
    <P>There was no word of this when the Minister for Finance was speaking <Col N="418" /> very soon afterwards.  In his more flowery speeches he speculated on various changes that could take place in the financial system.  When he made his speech it was very definitely a warning.  In fact one of the few mistakes that we made was that we did not realise how serious his speech was. We should have taken his observations more seriously.  We should have listened to a Minister who was unable to balance his own Budget and who left us a bill which was impossible for us to pay except by increased taxation. I must say I am quite proud to be a member of a Party which was compelled to do unpopular things in order to preserve the national credit and the national economy.  Another very important point is that in 1953 we managed to have an as-you-were Budget.  In 1954 we managed to have another as-you-were Budget with some slight concessions which proved that the policy succeeded, that things were under control and that with expanding trade, expanding exports, with expanding economy some further hope of relief could be promised.  I want to repeat what I said before in my last speech on the Supplies and Services Bill that if the level of trade continues to expand as it did during the past two years either this year or next year some surplus in the Budget might be possible, even if expenditure was not violently slashed in the way that was promised by the inter-Party Government and which would as Deputy McGilligan, the Attorney-General said, result in an inevitable reduction in the social services or in the wholesale dismissal of civil servants.</P>
    <P>As I have said, there were three Budgets each one of them telling the tale that finances in the country were improving.  I hope that it will be possible for the present Minister for Finance to make reliefs either in the present year or in the Budget.  So long as the Minister does not halt the general pattern of the country's economy, so long as the Government continues the reconstructional policy left to it by the Fianna Fáil Government and so long as England remains in the state of tremendous boom that it is <Col N="419" /> enjoying at the moment&mdash;and that is not the responsibility of the present Minister for Finance&mdash;it should be possible to give reliefs.  It is useless to speak in a manner that would divorce this country from the general economic position all over the world.</P>
    <P>In the course of the debate yesterday the Taoiseach gave the impression to the House and to the people of this country that we were the master spenders of money and that the inter-Party Government alone had a sense of economy and a sense of knowing how to reduce expenditure.  I was amazed when I heard that and I thought it was just as well for the people to know how money was spent in the last few years and which Governments were responsible for increases in expenditure.  So I looked back at the audited figures of expenditure for the Supply Services as published by successive Governments and I found that on both sides of the House we have had the habit of increasing expenditure over the years, and that neither of us can claim to be economisers.  Take the expenditure for each three-year period from 1943 ending at the 31st March of each period.  From 1943 to 1946 expenditure increased by £11,000,000.  From 1946 to 1949&mdash;and I think the present Government will take responsibility for the Budget with which they found themselves saddled, they have always said they would take over our expenditure &mdash;the increase was £17,000,000.  From 1949 to 1952 the increase in expenditure was £25,500,000 and from 1952 to 1955 the increase was £23,000,000.</P>
    <P>That does not suggest that Fianna Fáil have a monopoly in regard to increasing State expenditure.  Have not we all been doing it and for reasons that are well known?  When a great war ends the people always have wanted a better type of life, reconstruction is required, social services must be improved and the results of inflation must be compensated for by increased expenditure due to the decline in the value of money.  The Taoiseach spoke about the Book of Estimates for 1949 as though that was the first time in which there was no <Col N="420" /> increase.  But by March, 1950, he had spent £7,000,000 more than in the previous year so that the figure shown on the Book of Estimates does not seem to have had much effect on the final result.  Although the figures I quoted are of some significance, I do not pretend there is any great difference between £25,500,000 and £23,000,000 though we would claim the £23,000,000 included £6,000,000 for which there was no budgetary provision.</P>
    <P>We all know there has been an increase in the expenditure of public money and it would be hypocritical for us to suggest otherwise because we know the State expenditure carries far greater investments from social services and from many other things and that money must be found from taxation. There is no evidence that these increases in expenditure have been exclusive to one side or the other nor that there has been any great tendency towards economy on the part of the present Government.  If you examine the Estimates prepared during the last few years of the present Government's office&mdash;particularly the Estimates prepared for 1951-52&mdash;you will find there have been decreases and increases in the various Votes and that there were plenty of increases.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance if he reads the Estimates for that particular year will not find any proof that there was some tremendous desire to economise. For the last full year of the inter-Party Government's office he will find that the Estimates show that there was a greater proportion of increases than at the present time.  One can make other comparisons to prove there is nothing revolutionary about this present Book of Estimates.  There is in it what we would expect at a period when State expenditure had increased under both Governments, when it had reached not the ordinary upper limit, which is the fond saying of every Minister for Finance in every country in the world at budget time but an even greater maximum limit.</P>
    <P>You can take the increases that occurred in our time and during the first year of the inter-Party Government and you can examine the Book <Col N="421" /> of Estimates for 1954-1955 and compare this with the present one and you will notice the variations and the number of decreases and increases in the different Votes.  You will find in the Book of Estimates for the year ending March 31st, 1955, that there were 13 Votes virtually unchanged.  You will find also there were 25 Votes where there were decreases and 26 where there were increases and that the decreases amount to about £3.8 million and that the increases reached the total of £4,500,000.  Now take the present Book of Estimates and you will find that there are 18 Votes unchanged, that there are 28 where there were decreases and 18 in which there were increases so that there was a form of parallelism showing that there was no fundamental difference in the matter of State expenditure.</P>
    <P>The main change in the present Book of Estimates has been due to four or five important reductions and if those had not taken place the Estimates would have been virtually the same&mdash; there would have been no substantial difference.  Other Deputies on this side of the House have referred to these reductions and I shall not repeat what they have said.  There was the reduction in the Vote for the Department of Defence and in the wheat subsidy. There was a purely fortuitous reduction in the Local Government Estimate due to the fact that the Transitional Development Fund payments were ceasing.  That amounted to nearly £250,000, a figure which is very convenient when making up the total reduction of £1,400,000 in the Supply Services. There was also a reduction for Primary Education of £113,000 due to reductions in the payment of pensions to teachers.  These are the things we are really discussing.  These are the changes and we want to make quite sure that the public have a full appreciation of the very small changes that were made in the lists of Estimates.</P>
    <P>I should like to give a few more figures so that the man in the street can know where he is.  Take those Estimates where there were increases in the financial year ending in 1955 and where there were decreases this year&mdash;in other words, where a change <Col N="422" /> in the trend has been made, where there was an increase during our term and where now there are decreases. These are defence, wheat, local government, public works, primary teachers' pensions.</P>
    <P>I move to report progress.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the E.S.B. that these townlands are included in the Carrigart area, County Donegal, which has been developed under the rural electrification scheme but that the extension of supply to residents of these townlands involves consideration of special service charges.

Will the Minister also bring to the notice of the board the position that we find generally in that district and other districts in the county that have recently been wired by the board, that they are making extra charges where it does not seem reasonable that they should do so and that they are not consistent in the manner in which they are laying out the line?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidJohnMadden" hpid="Mr. Madden Mr. Madden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Madden</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands if he will consider introducing proposals for legislation to enable him to arbitrate between land owners and the Land Commission in fixing an equitable price for land acquired, and thus obviate the litigation costs involved in bringing such cases before the Land Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not intended to introduce proposals for amending legislation which would substitute a process of arbitration for the present statutory hearing before the Appeal Tribunal of an appeal against the price for land fixed by the Land Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prior to the passing of the Land Act, 1950, there was some occasion, as the Deputy will remember, to call in question the law relating to the price to be paid by the Land Commission for untenanted land acquired by them, and it <Col N="432" /> was not surprising that owners in general were dissatisfied with the offers of price then made and felt compelled to resort to appeal.  Section 5 of that Act, however, has changed the position radically, by ensuring that the price fixed by the Land Commission must now be an amount equal to the market value of the land.</P>
    <P>I can understand that market value in any particular case is open to a variety of opinions, even between expert valuers, but where reason prevails the range of estimates need not be so wide as to exclude the possibility of eventual agreement.  I am satisfied that every opportunity is afforded the owner whose land is being acquired to reach agreement with the Land Commission on the price question.  It is only when it is obvious that wide differences exist, between what the owner expects and what the Land Commission deems to be the amount equal to the market value, that resort must be had to fixation of the price by the Appeal Tribunal. In such cases it is customary for the Appeal Tribunal to make an award of costs to the owner.</P>
    <P>It would be contrary to the principles enshrined in the Land Act, 1950, for the Minister for Lands to interfere in the fixing of prices for particular lands and I consider it would be undesirable to adopt such innovation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidJohnMadden" hpid="Mr. Madden Mr. Madden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Madden</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware of the growing dissatisfaction, for which there is justification, that the price paid for land acquired since the passing of the Act in 1950 is not comparable to the market value?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I must say that I am not aware of a serious number of complaints, that is, complaints of such number as would convince me that either the Land Commission or the Appeal Tribunal are evading the provisions of the appropriate section of the Land Act, 1950.  In individual cases, no doubt, there may be disagreement on prices, but this House has by law stated that the Land Commission and the Appeal Tribunal must give the market value for land and no evidence has reached me to convince me that they are evading that statutory provision.</P>

The most any employer would get would be one or two, but where there are 1,000 boys together in one building there would be a danger.  Not all, but boys convicted of certain offences are excluded. I cannot take the responsibility, nor can the Army authorities, who also refuse to take responsibility, of bringing in boys who may on the face of things have a damaging influence on the other youths there.  We want to get the best types of young fellows in the Army and we hope to get them and there is a danger that if we open the door too wide the parents of boys coming in would feel very loath to let them come in and, in fact, would rather that they went somewhere else.</P>

      <P>On the 26th February, 1955, the latest date for which figures are available, the number of persons claiming unemployment benefit was 1.1 per <Col N="440" /> cent. higher than on the corresponding date in 1954.  As the Deputy is aware, the number of claimants for unemployment benefit is only one of the components of the weekly live register figures.  On the date mentioned the number of persons applying for unemployment assistance was 12.7 per cent. lower and the total live register was 5.3 per cent. lower than on the corresponding date in 1954.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>While the local officers of my Department have no legal <Col N="441" /> responsibility in regard to the conditions of the employment as notified by an employer, they do, in fact, in the course of their day-to-day work, accumulate fairly extensive information about the employers in their area, and they do not send persons forward to employment that is known to be undesirable. Where examination of a complaint from a worker placed in employment reveals that the conditions are objectionable, he may leave it without penalty by way of disallowance of benefit or assistance and no other workers are submitted for the vacancy.  Special care is taken in the submission of young women and juveniles for employment.</P>
      <P>There is no legislative provision under which steps could be taken to ensure that prospective employers are of good character.  If an employer knowingly makes any false statement to an officer of an exchange for the purpose of engaging workpeople he commits an offence for which he is liable to a fine.</P>

      <P>Routine health examination of pupils of national schools in Cork County Borough and County is being carried out by medical officers of the corporation and county council.</P>
      <P>I am advised that in the case of Cork County Borough all children referred under the school medical service up to 28th ultimo for hospital treatment for defects of the eyes, ear, nose and throat have received it.  I understand that since that date only two children have not obtained treatment under the service.</P>
      <P>In so far as Cork County is concerned, 759 children recommended for hospital treatment for defects of the eyes, nose and throat have not, as yet, received it under the service.  No information is available as to whether any of these patients have actually received treatment otherwise than under the school medical service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>When progress was reported I was dealing in some detail with the character of the Book of Estimates, and saying that, with the exception of some five or six items, the changes made were only marginal. There was no evidence of a new outlook on Government expenditure, no evidence of their determination to slash expenditure in the same manner in which it was promised at the time of the general election.  I was dealing with various Votes in different categories. I took Votes where there was an increase in expenditure in the Book of Estimates for last year, and a <Col N="447" /> decrease for this year.  I pointed out that most of the large decreases were related to the reduction in the wheat subsidy by a purely fortuitous reduction in the Local Government Estimate, to a windfall, and the ending of contributions to the Primary Teachers' Fund, a reduction of £750,000 for public works.  This formed the major part of the Votes where there were increases in the previous year and decreases this year.</P>
      <P>There were some 14 other Votes in which the total reduction amounted to some £200,000.  There were 16 Votes in which there was a decrease both last year and this year.  They include the Vote for Health Services, £1,000,000 less, and while the present Government has, I think, unwisely reduced the amount available for the Hospitals Fund, the cause was due to reasons which they have given, that the actual physical building was not being undertaken sufficiently to cover the whole expenditure.  There was a reduction in the Estimate for Transport and Marine Services of £384,000. Apart from those there were 15 Votes on which there were reductions totalling under £150,000.  If you take the Votes where there were increases in both years in 1954-55 and in the present year they amount to no less than 15.  The amount of the increase, £750,000, is not very much, but if you examine the Estimates you will find that there are a number of Votes where increases were unavoidable, and have continued this year as in last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us examine the increase in that particular group.  For agriculture the increase was £500,000 last year and in the present year it is £1,100,000.  After allowing for certain deductions and certain increases being met by the purely fortuitous arrival of part of the Marshall Aid Counterpart Fund there is a net increase of some £154,000.  The present Government in spite of their efforts to prove that they were being economical managed to increase eight Votes which had been decreased by us in the previous year.  The total comes out at about under £500,000.  The more you examine these Estimates the further you get from finding any <Col N="448" /> evidence that promises made in the general election were going to be kept.</P>
    <P>Having shown that this saving of £1,500,000 in current Supplies and Services is of no great measure, and arrived at by a change in some four out of 63 Votes, I would like to deal, in conclusion, with the statement made by the Taoiseach when he said that the Fianna Fáil Government had done irreparable damage to this country through the 1953 Budget.  We deny that, and I would ask the Minister for Finance, when he closes this debate, to give the House the main facts.  I would like to see the Minister for Finance prove the Taoiseach's contention from that <i>Statistical Abstract</i>, that yellow volume which has been authorised by the present Government. Let him tell the House what the position is and compare it in comparison with other years, how much we have produced, exported or imported, how much the people were able to spend on amusements and reasonable enjoyment. Let him quote the figures.  Let him take his own volume passed and approved by his own Government and give the House proof of the serious irreparable damage which was supposed to have been done to this State. In every one of those figures he will find that the story is good, that the people do spend money freely, that they exported more than ever before and imported more than ever before, that their personal savings were four times greater &mdash; not bank savings, not commercial savings.  Let him prove the contention of the Taoiseach. Let him prove that we have discouraged people from spending money on the necessities of life and on the ordinary pleasures of life.  I will be interested to hear him prove that.</P>
    <P>I prophesy, moreover, that the year 1954, for which the present Government cannot take responsibility, will show still further progress in the development of the national income. The figures for exports have already been published, and the figures for national expenditure and personal expenditure.  When the Government will be forced to authorise publication of these facts prepared by the <Col N="449" /> Statistics Office, and which show in a general way how the people of this country live, they will be forced to admit once more that there was no evidence of irreparable damage that was part of the propaganda in the last election.  It was this upon which the present Government managed to secure election by the people in the city districts, who believed that everything could be blown up, that Government expenditure could be slashed, that prices could be reduced, not marginally in five penny units, but in such a way as to make a great and material difference in prices.  An examination of the present Book of Estimates proves that it is most unlikely that the Government can fulfil the extravagant promises they made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have sat through this debate nearly as much as the Minister for Finance has done and I rise now to make only one or two comments on certain aspects of the discussion.  First of all I should like to say that the Opposition did not seem to know on which foot they were going to operate.  They said that there were no economies, or that any economies there were had been produced, as Deputy Aiken said, by tricks. Deputy Lemass this morning referred to hoofling.  All I can say to that is that a great deal of hard work went into the production of this £2,750,000 reduction as compared with last year. Of course, the new Government did not expect anything else.  But the new Government believes, as Deputy McGilligan said this morning, that this trend will be continued and that it will be continued in relation to the people's incomes as the Taoiseach and myself promised in our election addresses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What did this side of the House say during the two years from 1952 to 1954 following the Budget which was represented as a clear-cut one, but which, in fact, we felt was altogether too much of an instrument for bludgeoning the people?  The Party opposite said they wanted to bring about a reorientation of the State's finances, in Deputy MacEntee's words. <Col N="450" /> First of all we said there was no necessity for that policy.  It was said that the intention behind that Budget was to save £11,000,000 on food subsidies. In actual fact, as it turned out, the saving in the subsidies eventually was only £6,000,000.  Now one reason why the intention to save so much did not operate as fully as the Party opposite had hoped it would was the manner in which the price of wheat was increased.  When the hoped-for economy of £11,000,000 turned out to be only £6,000,000 in 1952 Deputy MacEntee attempted to show that the reduced economy was due to increases in costs.  The point is that for every £ they saved by this method of finance they put £3 in extra costs into the economy as a whole.</P>
    <P>I know Deputy Lemass does not mind about costs and I should like to say that that is where we differ.  He saw no difficulty whatever in signing Orders as they came in to him.  I would have found great difficulty in signing them; in fact, I would only have signed the more urgent of them.  We are being criticised here for the fact that we are continuing the system that the Party opposite started.  But how are we to take these extra costs out of the country's economy?  Are we to reduce wages?  That would be a good thing for the Opposition because it might get them back in office quite soon.  Another way of looking at the problem is to remember that the Estimates Volume has gone up from £85,000,000 to £105,000,000 in the past number of years.  That is partly due to influences to which I have referred and it is partly due to increases in import prices.  Take the amount of money we have in circulation in this country to-day &mdash; the amount of legal tender.  It comes to about £70,000,000 it the moment.  In 1951 it was £55,000,000 and in 1952 it was £60,000,000.  Does that very fact not explain where the extra taxation which was imposed in 1952 went? When that year ended it was suggested that there was no surplus. There was no surplus because Supplementary Estimates to the tune of £9,000,000 were introduced.</P>
    <P>I believe that the 1952 Budget, as the Party opposite had been prepared <Col N="451" /> to operate it directly, had nothing to recommend it.  I think I read it much more frequently than I read any other Budget ever presented, and the more often I read it the more appalling it appeared to me.  Did not the events justify our view of it?  In order to deal with the particular form of cycle which that Budget set up the Party opposite had to increase expenditure enormously at the end of that year.  In fact those steps should have been taken in the spring of 1952 if they were to prevent the large amount of unemployment which hit the country at the time.  Now we in this Party have set out systematically and slowly to try and improve conditions here in the country. Of course, we are grateful to the people not alone for expressing their confidence in us in advance but for the manner in which they have shown that they believe we can direct them in the way of improving conditions and particularly that we can bring down unemployment. It is no use bandying figures and comparing the autumn of one year with the spring of another. That has been tried by Deputies on the opposite side but there can be nothing at all to it.</P>
    <P>If we take the figures as presented here to-day the obvious fact is that we were able to take £2,750,000 off the Estimates Volume although £2,000,000 was spent on the butter subsidy which would make the reduction £5,000,000. I do not believe we will have any more Supplementary Estimates during the coming year than we had in the last 12 months: in fact we may have less. Taking all these things into consideration the figure of expenditure for the coming year shows a reduction of 5 per cent.  One of the daily newspapers which dealt with this question on Saturday morning last &mdash; the morning the figures were published &mdash; said it regarded this saving with grave disappointment. I do not know what they expected us to do.  I cannot see the Party opposite being able to go as far as we went.</P>
    <P>I want to let the Minister make his reply, but there is one other point to which I might refer before I finish.  It is a very important matter which <Col N="452" /> would take a great deal longer than a few minutes were the time available. It refers to the very important steps which the Minister has made to keep the rate of interest on overdrafts at the level of 5½ per cent.  When it has gone up in Britain.  In an interruption Deputy Allen said: &ldquo;What good is it going to do in the future?&rdquo;  Deputy Childers said it was very easy to talk vaguely about interest rates.  The fact is the Minister did not talk vaguely about interest rates, and let me emphasise this lest there should be any doubt about it.</P>
    <P>I believe that the people who direct the banks here, to give them their due, have made no serious difficulties about keeping the rate of interest at 5½ per cent.  Does anybody really believe that in modern monetary conditions 5½ per cent. is not high enough?  It is 1 per cent. above the British bank rate, a rate intended to cure a certain condition in Britain at the moment.  But is it not high enough?  Is it seriously suggested here that the Government should have looked on with equanimity while the rate went up to 6½ per cent.? Had the Government believed that it would create serious difficulties for the banks in their finances, the Government, of course, would have had to think long and seriously about keeping the rate at its present level.  Our banks will get 1 per cent. extra now on the short-term money they have in London.  The general results last year of the banking system here show an exceptionally good run.</P>
    <P>Whatever difficulties might possibly arise in relation to the transfer of deposits &mdash; difficulties which I believe are not likely to arise &mdash; is it not obvious that the Government here would have been lacking in a sense of duty if they had not taken the step they did in view of the many firms here which depend for their working capital on bank advances, a condition which was aggravated because the former Minister for Finance in the last Government paid 5 per cent. for money?  He pushed a large number of firms, which would otherwise have had public issues, into the banks for overdraft accommodation.  Does it <Col N="453" /> not make a difference to a company running an overdraft for £100,000 whether it pays 5½ per cent. or 6½ per cent. for its money?  Of course it does.</P>

      <P>This debate over the last three days has run on different lines at different times.  Before I deal with any matters arising out of the debate itself, I would like to make one personal observation.  This is the first debate in which my predecessor has felt himself sufficiently physically recovered to take part since the change of Government last June.  No matter whether we may disagree with the views he expresses, or even at times perhaps with his manner of expressing them, on behalf of this side of the House I want to welcome him back again in his full physical health.  I think it is a good thing that he should come back even for the purpose of expressing views with which I do not agree.  I do not want in any way to detract from that welcome when I say that some of the statements he made will be extremely useful to us on this side of the House.</P>
      <P>Many of the matters raised here were raised on individual Estimates, following the pattern set by Deputy Aiken in the beginning.  Perhaps I should deal, first of all, with some of these individual items before coming to the question of general principles. Deputy Aiken, and other speakers as well, referred to the fact that on this occasion there was a reduction in the Book of Estimates, 1955-56, in the amount being provided for grain storage loans.</P>
      <P>In referring to these detailed comments on reductions by Deputies opposite, I want to stress how inconsistent they were because at one time they were saying that there was no reduction at all and, the next minute, not indeed just another Deputy but actually the same speaker, referring to a particular reduction that had been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Aiken, however, referred to the grain storage loans.  He said the reduction was brought about because we on this side of the House, and the present Minister for Agriculture in particular, were antagonistic to grain storage.  The facts are, and I am quite <Col N="454" /> sure Deputy Aiken is well aware of them, that this arrangement and the heads of the Bill which ultimately became the Grain Storage (Loans) Act were submitted and thought out, not by the Fianna Fáil Minister for Agriculture, but by Deputy Dillon when he was Minister for Agriculture in the first inter-Party Government.  It was suggested that the same provision should have been made as was made under the Act of 1951, by virtue of which guarantees were given to ensure that the very grave deficiency in our grain storage would be made good.  Deputies on both sides of the House can remember the discussions over the past years in respect to that deficiency.  Likewise, they will remember that the first effort really made to cure that deficiency was made by Deputy Dillon in the first inter-Party Government.  The Bill was his child, so to speak, but the general election of that year prevented him finally putting it on the Statute Book.</P>
    <P>In connection with the Department of Agriculture also, Deputy MacEntee last night, and Deputy Aiken the previous day, commented on the method of accounting in relation to the Marshall Aid Grant Counterpart Fund. In case there might be any misunderstanding or misinterpretation because of Deputy MacEntee's comments last night, let me say that we on this side of the House, not merely now but on many occasions in the past, indeed right from the beginning, have expressed the appreciation of the Government and the people of the unparalleled generosity of the American Government and the American people in the Marshall Aid arrangements.  No suggestion should be made here by anyone that the method of accounting adopted in respect of the Grant Counterpart Fund is in any way a diminution of our appreciation of the generous gesture, of the generosity of the American people.  It is, of course, in fact the normal and proper accounting procedure.</P>
    <P>There are plenty of parallels. Deputies, for example, can take up the present Book of Estimates and they will see there, in relation to Appropriations-in-Aid <Col N="455" /> under the Vote for the Department of Agriculture at page 130, similar appropriations in respect of the Local Taxation Grant and the Church Temporalities Fund.  They are dealt with in exactly the same way and have always been dealt with in exactly the same way.  They are dealt with like that, not for the purpose as was suggested, of hiding anything, but for the purpose of ensuring that there would not be double accounting or a double entry in the accounts.  That is the normal accounting procedure and the moneys referred to by Deputy MacEntee have been dealt with purely in accordance with that procedure.  The differences in relation to this Volume of Estimates on foot of the receipt of Grant Counterpart Funds during the coming year, funds which we hope will come to hand, are differences arising partly in relation to items which have already appeared in the Estimates on previous occasions and partly in respect of new items, offset by the Appropriations-in-Aid, of which the main ones are the provision for the eradication of bovine T.B. and the pasteurisation of milk supplies.</P>

      <P>It is about time you did.  Deputy Lemass, when speaking this morning, almost at the end of his speech, referred to the minerals development work at Avoca.  Reference also had been made by Deputy Aiken to that matter, suggesting that in the Vote for Industry and Commerce we were providing less for minerals development than last year, with the implication, if not the stated fact, that the amount was less than the Fianna Fáil Government would have provided if they had been in our position. What are the facts in respect of that?  The facts are perfectly clear and are on record for every member of the previous Government to know, not merely Deputy Lemass, who was the Minister in charge of the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>
      <P>This time last year, Deputy Lemass, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, brought to the Government of the day a memorandum dealing with minerals development at Avoca &mdash; brought to the Government a proposition by virtue of which the exploratory work at Avoca would terminate at the end of February, 1955, and that all the men who were employed on that development work would be let go at the end of last month, with the exception of some 22 men who would be kept on a maintenance basis.  That was the proposal that was brought by the then Minister for Industry and Commerce to the Government of the day and that was the proposal that was accepted by the Government of that time 12 months ago.  On that proposal there was not going to be any figure whatsoever for minerals development in the Book of Estimates for 1955-56.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy Aiken will contain himself a little bit he will discover where he is.  The position was that, in respect of the development that was proposed for Avoca, the then Government made up their mind that <Col N="457" /> they would not go on with any exploratory work after the end of February, 1955.  They provided for that exploratory work for the current year the sum of £74,000.  In fact, we have, as the Tanaiste said in answer to a question to-day, decided to expand somewhat that development work.  We have decided on that expansion, on the necessity for that expansion and the necessity to finance it, to provide an additional sum of £15,000 for the current year and, in addition, to provide a sum of £40,000 for next year, part of which will be for further development work, part of which will be for maintenance work. That is the exact position in respect of Avoca.  The previous Government had intended to end the development at the end of last month but we are carrying it on at the same time as we have entered into discussions, to which the Tánaiste referred to-day, with a view to its permanent commercial exploitation.</P>
      <P>Deputy Aiken asks me now, what about other development?  I mentioned, and it is mentioned in the memorandum to the Government on January, 1954, that the sum of £74,000 was the amount proposed by that Government to provide for development work at Avoca.  It seems an extraordinary thing that, if there was any minerals development work that would be undertaken other than that at Avoca, the previous Government provided nothing in their Estimates other than the £74,000 for Avoca.</P>

      <P>The difficulty is that Deputy Aiken disclosed prematurely on Tuesday the line that Deputy Lemass was likely to take to-day and, as a result, I was able to turn up the facts before replying.  Deputy Aiken probably got his hands smacked for letting Deputy Lemass's alleged argument out of the bag before he should have done.</P>
      <P>In respect of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs the suggestion was made that there would be less development on telephone installations next year than this year.  Deputy Aiken was one of the people who made that suggestion and Deputy Lemass referred to it also to-day.  There has not been, as was suggested, a reduction of £22,000 in the salaries and wages of the Post Office Engineering Branch.  In fact, there has been an increase of £14,000 in the gross total. The Deputy may have been misled perhaps in taking the wrong total. The staff will be employed to a greater extent than last year on work chargeable to telephone capital funds and, appropriately, a smaller proportion of the gross total is being borne from voted moneys.  I think that possibly may have misled him.</P>
      <P>Similarly, in respect of installers, the remarks that were made on the other side of the House took that one grade out of its context with the remainder of the labour force.  There are considerable increases in the numbers of grades above installer and in the number of labourers.  There is an increase, in fact, in wages and the actual reduction in the number of installers is due partly to regrading, partly to reorganisation of work and partly to variation in the works programme. The Deputy and the House can rest absolutely assured that there will be no diminution in the volume of work to be undertaken in the Engineer-Branch.</P>
      <P>I agree at once with Deputies on the other side of the House that it would be a retrograde step not to continue to install as many telephones as possible so that those who are without telephones and who require the telephone service will be able to get them as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="459" /> When we came to the lands group we got an even more diffuse pattern of criticism.  In the provision for Gaeltacht Services, Deputy Aiken suggested that there was £40,000 less actually being provided in this Book of Estimates.  The Deputy is wrong. There has, in fact, been provided in this Vote an increased sum.  The effect of the estimated provision for next year is that there is an increased sum available and, if the Deputy would refer to the Vote itself, he will see that he took his deduction off the net total, after Appropriations-in-Aid had already been made.  In other words, he made his deduction twice.  In fact, the position is that next year the gross total of the Vote is some £61,000 more than the gross total for the current year and that, therefore, far from there being less provision for that service there is a gross increased provision of over £60,000.  Workers' wages for example, if I may mention one item, will be £131,300 next year compared with £112,000 this year, an increase of £19,300.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood from the Deputy and his Party that there was no stockpiling in 1951.  That was the whole argument when they introduced the White Paper of that date.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Even allowing for a difference of approximately £42,000, there is a sum of £19,300 more to be paid out in workers' wages in the service next year as compared with the Deputy's provision this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to forestry we also heard <Col N="460" /> a very large variation of criticism, most of which appeared to be based on a misunderstanding of the position. The amounts that have been spent on forestry, going back over a number of years, have been showing a rise from the post-war period &mdash; during the war we accept that there was, of course, difficulty in obtaining netting wire and so on and it was not possible to work &mdash; but I must say I think it is rather peculiar for Deputies on the other side of the house to suggest now that they are entitled to take forestry to their bosom as one of the developments for which they can rightly claim credit.  If we go back over the years, we will find that the provisions prior to the advent of the inter-Party Government in 1948 were very meagre indeed.  It is not, however, the provision in this year which is the real question for us to consider now.  As I indicated originally in my speech introducing this Estimate we regard forestry as a service that has two advantages &mdash; it builds up a capital asset for the future, and in addition to building up that asset it gives substantial employment.  The total Vote this year for forestry shows a substantial increase and it was increased by us specificially for that reason.</P>
    <P>I mentioned before, and I will repeat now, that we approached these Estimates from the point of view of cutting down expenditure where it was not going to show any results.  At the same time we were not prepared to cut expenditure merely for the sake of cutting and we were prepared to consider items on their merits.  Where it was desirable to produce more money to get better services we were not afraid to take that course and carry it through.</P>
    <P>The criticism that was made in respect of the Forestry Department in particular &mdash; that the provision we had made in this Estimate did not permit the purchase of sufficient land &mdash; is without foundation.  The amount that is provided in the Estimate is a realistic provision; it is a provision that will permit us to buy next year at existing prices at least as much as was bought this year, even somewhat more.  It is a realistic provision.  It is not going <Col N="461" /> to be a provision such as was made by our predecessors merely for the purpose of show without using the Grant-in-Aid.  There was for that subhead in the Vote an accumulation, and the effect of the accumulation with the amount to be voted now in this Book of Estimates, will mean that there will be available about £20,000 more for the purchase of land in the coming year than will be spent in the present year.  The amounts that have been spent on land acquisition for forestry over the years have grown partly because of the increased prices but more because of the expansion of the forestry services, an expansion that will in the years ahead produce, we hope, some really positive results.  It is on services like this that we think it is desirable there should be increased spending.  I did not, for example, hear in the course of this debate any criticism in regard to the arterial drainage programme.  The fact is that we estimate expenditure under the principal headings in that regard for next year at a total of £734,000 compared with the revised estimate of what is to be spent this year of £576,000.  That is partly in respect of increased construction works and partly maintenance work which is coming in now.  Again, that is the type of service upon which we think it is worth while that public moneys should be spent and which will produce within a reasonable time an improvement in our economy and will, in addition to doing that, remove much hardship with which our people have had to contend.</P>
    <P>I was also told during this debate that the provision we are making for schools was less than last year's and, by implication, less than what a Fianna Fáil Government would have provided.  Again, the facts do not bear out that criticism.  New schools are things that are vitally necessary in many parts of the country.  In the year ended 31st March, 1954, the total grants that were sanctioned for the provision of new schools, for enlargement of existing schools, for major improvements to existing schools and for minor improvements were £1,130,000. The sanctions this year are some £350,000 higher at £1,480,00 and, of <Col N="462" /> course, Deputies can appreciate that it is on the rate of sanctions in a year that the building programme for the following year will be based.  The position in respect of this also is that it is not the amount that is voted that is really the operative figure but the amount that is spent.  We are in the position that in the year ending 31st March, 1954, the amount that was spent on the provision of new schools and the reconstruction in the manner I have mentioned, was £1,071,000, and that in the nine months to the end of 1954 the amount was £859,000.  Taking it very roughly that that was for nine months of the year, it would appear that the figure for the full financial year is likely to run at somewhere about £1,150,000.  That was pushing on that work as fast as we could push it since June.  The figure we have provided for next year &mdash; the realistic figure &mdash; is £1,398,000, which is £250,000 more than is going to be spent on work in the present year.</P>
    <P>We had also discussions in respect of the figures that were included for health.  Certain Deputies endeavoured to suggest that we had by deliberate design cut down the programme of hospitalisation.  I do not think one Deputy who made that suggestion yesterday or the day before, in his calmer moments would repeat it; I was referring to Deputy Lynch.  I think that was just something he said in the heat of the debate and that otherwise it would not be a suggestion he would make.</P>
    <P>The position is that we believe that in the current year the expenditure that will be required as a subvention to the Hospitals Trust Fund for the building of hospitals will be in or around the region of £2,000,000. Physical difficulties in respect of that building programme are all that is holding it up.  Far from there being any deliberate intention to restrict in the way that was suggested, our activity was to ensure that good value would be obtained for the money and that the work would be pushed on as hard as possible.  However, physical difficulties have prevented more than £2,000,000 of voted moneys being spent this year.  Next year we are providing <Col N="463" /> not £2,000,000 but £2,250,000 because we hope we will be able to get over those physical difficulties and step up that capital expenditure.</P>
    <P>We were told also that it was by the deliberate action of this Government that expenditure heretofore met out of the Central Fund had now been put on the ratepayers.  Deputy Briscoe was particularly vehement on this point when he was speaking here on Tuesday.  Deputies who look at the Health Act of 1953 and, in particular, who look at Section 15 of that Act &mdash; that Act which was not passed when we were the Government &mdash; will find that in Section 15 (1) there is provided:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A health authority shall, in accordance with regulations, make available institutional and specialist services for the persons specified in sub-section (2) of this section.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Sub-section (2) of that section states:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The persons referred to in subsection (1) of this section are the following persons and their dependents:</P>
    <P>(a) persons insured under the Social Welfare Act, 1952.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a statutory, mandatory direction to the local authorities, to the Dublin Corporation, to the county councils throughout the country.</P>

      <P>I know all about that and I know also the difficulties in which the present Minister for Health found himself when he came into office thanks to the mess that had been left behind by the previous Minister, because I happened to be at the conference getting information to see what the position was.  Deputy Briscoe is not going to be able to divert me from the facts in that respect any more than he was able to do so in respect of the special works programme last year.</P>
      <P>There was also a suggestion by the Deputy that there was a new provision in respect of existing hospitals, existing treatment, peculiar and particular to Dublin Corporation.  There again the position is that that was created by Section 10 of the Health Act, 1953, that it was Section 10 of that Act which transferred the liability from the two public assistance authorities which there were in the Dublin area to the Dublin Corporatión and that it was that transfer which changed the basis of maintenance previously existing, to the arrangements already existing in respect of every local authority outside Dublin. The arrangement that was in respect of local authorities outside Dublin by which patients were paid for at the rate of £5 12s. a week was not prior to the 1953 Act operative for the City of Dublin, but Section 10 of that Act had the effect of bringing it into force for Dublin and it was only under Section 10 that that was done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Briscoe knows exactly the situation and he is trying to avoid the consequences of his own Government's actions.  We had a discussion also on these Estimates in respect of the employment position. When he was speaking to-day Deputy Lemass, in one of his usual positive statements, said that every year since the establishment of the records there has been an increase in industrial employment &mdash; of course, I am not going to make any point about the war years, that is understandable &mdash; but I challenged him at the time and having got the figures I find I am correct. There was one year in which there was not such an increase, in which there was an actual decrease and it is a rather peculiar fact that the year in which that took place was the year 1952 when Fianna Fáil had come in and introduced a new plan and a new policy.  In 1951, there were 226,000 people in industrial employment.  In 1952 as a result of their policy that number dropped by 5,000 to 221,000 and it took the year 1953 to get back again to the position in which they found it.</P>
      <P>I want also to make it clear that the position in that respect has been over the years far from satisfactory because contemporaneously and concurrently with that increase in industrial employment there has been a decrease in agricultural employment more than offsetting the increase that we have got in industrial employment.  In that position no Government could possibly be complacent as was suggested by Deputy Lemass.  We are not in the least complacent about the position, but we are satisfied that we have by our quiet methods improved the situation and will improve it still more as the months go on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been play made here by Deputy Aiken and Deputy Lemass on the increase that there was in certain weeks in respect of claims for unemployment <Col N="466" /> benefit.  As the Minister for Social Welfare mentioned to-day the total claims for unemployment benefit for the 26th February was 1.1 per cent. more than last year; three weeks before that they were down by between 2 and 4 per cent.  The phenomenon there is one that arose for two reasons.</P>
    <P>First of all, I give full credit to the Deputies on the other side of the House.  Under the Social Welfare Act of 1952, there are provisions by virtue of which it is easier to get benefit than before and in consequence there is an increased incentive to register.  Quite apart from that the provisions now provide that a person is able to come into benefit after a period in casual work far more easily than he was able to do before.  It follows, therefore, that the more the unemployment assistance cases contract, that is, the greater decrease there is in unemployment assistance, the more liability there may be, in a sudden period such as the appalling weather there was for county council workers the week before last, for people to have an unemployment benefit claim which they would never have had before.</P>
    <P>I do not accept the contention that was put forward by Deputy Aiken and by Deputy Lemass that it is not desirable to look at the total level of the unemployment register and, in fact, I do not think they accept it either.  Certainly, they were in a panic condition when it rose to almost 90,000 in 1953. The position so far as we are concerned is that we wanted to improve the position and to ensure that the increase in industrial employment that occurred in the third quarter of last year will be increased still further this year and that we will be enabled by the methods and by the means we adopt to ensure that as many as possible of our people will be put into permanent employment and that as many as possible of our people will also be utilised for productive employment by the State.</P>
    <P>We had some references by both Deputy MacEntee last night and Deputy Lemass to-day to the question of banks and bank interest.  I have very little to add to what I have already said.  I made it clear last week that I had discussions with the <Col N="467" /> banks, that I made it clear in those discussions that I considered that the appropriate thing to take into account was the national over-all position, that so far as I could see there was at the moment nothing in our economy of an equivalent nature to those signs of danger that the British Chancellor had seen in respect of the British economy.</P>
    <P>In all the discussions I had and in all the discussion we had in this House nobody has challenged that fact.  The most striking thing about the whole matter is that everybody is agreed that there are not factors here operative such as operated on the other side of the water.  If there are not such factors operating here then surely it was right in our discussions that we should consider whether it was not better for us to take a different line to the remedy that was taken on the other side.  Deputy MacEntee last night here took the direct line that interest rates did not matter at all, that it does not matter in the very slightest to a concern or to an individual whether he is paying 5 per cent., 6 per cent. or 7 per cent.  As I interjected then, I would repeat now, if the fact is that interest rates do not matter at all why is it that the British Chancellor in the circumstances in which he finds himself has been at such pains to raise interest rates there to correct a tendency that exists there.  Of course we all know that in fact they do have an effect, direct in one respect and psychologically in another.  Perhaps the psychological effect might have been more operative then the direct effect.</P>
    <P>I have nothing more to add to the statement I have made last week.  I put to the banks that it was our national over-all position which should be uppermost in our minds in dealing with a problem such as this.  It was not to be determined by the immediate benefits that there might be to any sectional interest.  As I said, I am glad and appreciative of the fact that they accepted that that was my view and the view of the Government.</P>
    <P>I will not hold the House up any longer except to say this: this Book of Estimates is a reduction of £2.77 million on the Book of Estimates <Col N="468" /> brought in this time last year.  It is not merely in that context that it should be considered but in the context of the picture painted by Deputy Lemass when he said that he could not see how the Book of Estimates would not be £10,000,000 or so up.  We must think of the Book of Estimates not merely in terms of comparison of the figure on its face with that on the face of the Estimates brought in last year by Deputy MacEntee.  We must remember what it would have meant to our people if the authors of a Book of Estimates in the line of prophecy made by Deputy Lemass a fortnight ago had not been moved by the people to the other side of the House.</P>

One of the <Col N="470" /> things to which I want once more to call the attention of the House is that, in relation to one sum &mdash; and I shall take only the one sum &mdash; the Book of Estimates is completely false to the tune of £933,000.

      <P>To put a sum got from the American Government directly into a Department in order to decrease this figure is crooked accountancy.  It is without precedent and the Minister tried to cover it up by saying, when I and other speakers from this side raised this matter, that we were showing a lack of appreciation of American generosity.  I shall not go further, but if the Minister wants to be proud of that fact, at least he might have put this amount of money into the Budget, into the Exchequer Funds, and paid it out and not have slipped it into the Department of Agriculture simply with the object of reducing this figure dishonestly by a sum of £933,000.</P>
      <P>I was very interested in some of the things I heard Deputy McGilligan speaking about to-day.  He obviously is running away as hard as he can from the promises he made to the people about what this Government would do if they got into office again.  Instead of this million-a-minute within a few minutes after taking over Government, it is now put on the long finger.

Instead of <Col N="472" /> being accounted for as an ordinary Exchequer receipt, it is being slipped in, as if the Minister were ashamed of it, as an Appropriation-in-Aid.
