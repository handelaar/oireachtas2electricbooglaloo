    <Speaker pid="SeanCasey" hpid="Mr. Casey Mr. Casey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>When the debate was adjourned last night, I was outlining the serious unemployment condition in my own constituency, Cork City, and I was endeavouring to relate the present unhappy and hopeless position to the programme which had been put before the electors of Cork, prior to the last general election.  On that occasion, we were favoured with a personal message from Deputy Galvin, a special invitation to the electors of the City of Cork to support his programme. He pointed out on that occasion that Fianna Fáil had set a state of full employment as their goal and he went on to say that they were working out the details of a dynamic programme of investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was suggesting last night, and I am suggesting now, that it is high time Deputy Galvin, or somebody on his behalf, would let the electors of Cork City and the country generally know exactly what these details are, or at least have the courtesy to point out what misfired between the days prior <Col N="504" /> to the last general election and now, when things are in such a sorry plight. It might be said that the Government cannot accept full responsibility for every statement made at election time by every one of their candidates, but in this same news sheet there was a general statement from the Party which no doubt was duly and conscientiously vetted at the time and for which the Party now in power, the Party in general, will have to accept responsibility.  They stated: &ldquo;We have unused resources, physical, human and financial which can be organised and be made productive. Fianna Fáil is planning to use them.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>What is really before the House on the Order Paper is money in respect of urban employment schemes, development works in bogs used by landholders and other private producers and rural improvement schemes.  That is all that is really before the House.  What the Deputy may allege to be the general policy in respect of unemployment and what was said at a general election is not relevant on these Estimates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCasey" hpid="Mr. Casey Mr. Casey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit that a good deal of latitude has been allowed.  It is rather unfortunate that the axe should be brought down on me at this stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">

    <Speaker pid="SeanCasey" hpid="Mr. Casey Mr. Casey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am submitting, with respect, that other speakers sailed very much closer to the wind than I am doing.  I am simply endeavouring to relate the unemployment position in my constituency to the position that was put before the people at the last general election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>What Deputy Galvin said is surely not pertinent or relevant to the items on this White Paper.  I allowed the Deputy a good deal of latitude last night; I have allowed him some latitude this morning, but I cannot allow the debate on this Estimate to expand into a debate on Government policy or what the Deputy alleges is Government policy. He should confine himself more closely to what is on the White Paper.</P>

    <Col N="505" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanCasey" hpid="Mr. Casey Mr. Casey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it cannot be denied that a serious unemployment position exists generally throughout the country&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That really does not arise, but I have allowed Deputies to refer to it to some extent in speaking and I have allowed Deputy Casey to do so.  I am now asking him to confine himself more closely to what is on the paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCasey" hpid="Mr. Casey Mr. Casey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it may be said that the policy&mdash;if it could be so described&mdash;that was put before the electors and supported by the people who returned the Government Party to power has not been carried out and we are entitled to ask is there any hope at all, because, as I remarked last night, not alone is there concern with the unemployment situation as it exists, but there is a general feeling of hopelessness and frustration throughout the whole community.  Up and down the country, we see houses being locked up, men taking their families away, men who have never been unemployed before, people who up to recently regarded themselves as in good sound and solid employment, people who were regarded even two years ago as sufficiently creditworthy to get loans from local authorities to build their own houses.  In addition to the ordinary casual unemployed persons, we now have these people forming a new category of unemployed.  I suggest to the Minister and the Government that the people deserve better treatment, that they expect and should get a statement of policy now.</P>
      <P>Very many Deputies supporting the Government have not spoken on this matter, but I am sure it has not passed unnoticed that, in their own local authorities, they have spoken quite effectively.  Quite recently, I remember reading a statement by Deputy O'Malley made, I think, at Limerick Corporation meeting, when he said that in his experience things were never worse.  He referred generally to the unemployment situation and he also appeared to have despaired of a solution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to repeat anything that has been said here before, but, in <Col N="506" /> all sincerity, I say to the Minister that even now he could do much to restore confidence if he would even indicate that the situation is not without hope. If he could put some definite policy before the people, some definite programme, he may, even at this late stage, be able to restore the people's confidence.  As I said, frustration is rampant and very many public people have not been helpful in that regard. They have been saying that the country is sunk, that there is no hope for it. When we have people in high places saying that, the ordinary unemployed person cannot but feel frustrated.</P>
    <P>I believe the Government has a duty to take action quickly and to show the people that what they said prior to the last election was not said entirely to dupe the people into false confidence. I hope that in winding up this debate the Minister will make some such statement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy" hpid="Mr. J. Murphy Mr. J. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be very brief. I should like to know if this is the extent of the great Fianna Fáil &ldquo;Get cracking&rdquo; policy which they so loudly proclaimed before the last general election.  It seems that the people now have the measure of the sincerity of the Fianna Fáil Party.  Last year, we heard much discussion about £100,000,000, but, in my opinion, £224,000 is very far removed from the £100,000,000 which Fianna Fáil promised would bring about full employment.</P>
      <P>I have repeatedly asked the Taoiseach if he would give some indication of his policy in regard to full employment, but to date I have got no satisfaction, and I should like to ask the Taoiseach and the Fianna Fáil Party now if they would declare a state of emergency to deal with the whole question of unemployment. I would ask them to get down seriously to the planning of a long-term proposal for full employment and to take immediate steps to reduce the unemployment figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been much debate on the whole question of unemployment.  It has been debated for the past 35 years <Col N="507" /> by all the Party politicians.  It is time to put an end to all the talk about what we will do to relieve unemployment and, instead, to do something about it.  If the Government do not do something about unemployment, I warn them, for the last time, that the unemployed will focus world-wide attention on their shameful situation.  There is little use in talking about democratic institutions when 86,000 families are on the border of starvation.  I say to the Government: get cracking; stop talking about unemployment but, rather, do something about it.  Let us have some action now from the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>It is generally recognised that the unemployment problem is serious.  In considering this question, it is well that we should reflect on the circumstances of the past two years.  During the greater part of 1956, the previous Government had to deal with a very difficult problem in correcting the adverse balance of payments. Later in that year, the problem was further aggravated by the Suez crisis.  When we applied remedies to deal with the balance of payments difficulties, those remedies were criticised by the then Opposition, and it was made clear that Fianna Fáil would have a different approach.  We made it quite clear that, in applying the remedies which were put into operation, some dislocation and possibly even hardship would occur, but that, recognising the problem that had to be faced, we believed&mdash;on the information available and on the basis of the best advice that could be given to the Government&mdash;that, whatever temporary dislocation, and even temporary unemployment, might be caused by the application of the remedies then adopted, they would prevent large-scale mass unemployment.  Whether or not that policy secured public support does not greatly matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was generally accepted by those in a position to know that the balance of payments position had to be corrected. We regarded the remedies applied as the best in the circumstances. The then Opposition&mdash;Fianna Fáil&mdash;said they would apply a different <Col N="508" /> remedy to the situation.  Allowing for the difficulties that were created by the steps taken and allowing also for the problems resulting from the Suez crisis, Fianna Fáil secured a majority at the election last March, more through dissatisfaction with what had been done by the previous Government than through any confidence that they themselves could achieve a more satisfactory result.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy is doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that on the expressed statements of the present Government the people were led to believe that Fianna Fáil had a policy to deal with unemployment. That policy, as it was adumbrated, was to be implemented in the course of a five-year plan.  Almost one year has elapsed and the extent of the application of that policy is hardly to be judged by the amount of money in this Supplementary Estimate.  There is a total in this Estimate for this year of £287,000 for urban employment schemes.  I do not accept the view that the Government can, by themselves, solve the unemployment problem. Government policy can direct the national economy but it cannot do everything.  Full employment is undoubtedly a desirable objective but it is difficult to achieve.  Where I join issue with the Government is not on the amount or otherwise of this Estimate&mdash;because it is only a comparatively trivial sum in the total national expenditure&mdash;but on the fact that people were led to believe that if Fianna Fáil were elected they had a plan to solve unemployment.</P>
      <P>Even allowing for the fact that large numbers of persons have emigrated and that on this register of unemployed a proportion are undoubtedly unemployable or that even a proportion are only temporarily unemployed, there is still a hard core of people looking for work.  What I feel is wrong in the Government's approach to this problem is that the accent is in the wrong direction. We believe that, in order to stimulate development in the country, the Government should endeavour to create conditions in which private economic development, through private enterprise, would be stimulated and encouraged.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's statements may be relevant on a main Estimate or on a motion, but they are irrelevant now on this Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The position, therefore, is that the proposals enshrined in this Supplementary Estimate, can hardly even be described as an instalment of a plan to deal with unemployment. The Local Authorities (Works) Act provided not merely employment, but, in addition, a scheme which was productive in itself in so far as it enabled drainage and other work to be carried out.  At the same time, we believed it was only part of the whole problem.  This provision in the Estimate makes some contribution in respect of accommodation roads, drains and so on, for the joint benefit of groups of farmers.  It also provides a limited sum for drainage and other work to facilitate the production of turf by landholders, and so on.  If the work which was being carried out under the Local Authorities (Works) Act had been allowed to continue, it would have brought about a number of works schemes which, by themselves, might even obviate the necessity for specific payments such as are contemplated under this Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the present time, the Government appear to be concentrating on less than essentials.  I do not doubt that a number of schemes may be worth while &mdash;may not only be desirable but even justified in different circumstances. However, at the present time, more money is being taken in taxation and more money is being extracted from the people than ever before and the <Col N="511" /> small contribution included in this Supplementary Estimate cannot in any sense solve&mdash;if, in fact, even alleviate &mdash;the serious unemployment position.</P>
    <P>I do not accept the view that a Government can solve the unemployment problem.  I do not think it is right to induce people to think that Government action alone can end it.  But this Government now in office secured public support on the basis that they could, if elected, solve this problem.  If this is the first instalment of that plan, then it is obvious that it is going to be inadequate.  I agree that it will take not merely the combined effort of Government but the united efforts of all sections of the community to deal with some of these problems.</P>
    <P>A great many references have recently been made to the spirit of cynicism that is abroad, to the disillusionment that comes from the fact that although Governments change, the situation remains the same.  I have no doubt that a material contributing factor to that was the expressed view, not merely in speeches but in posters and publicity of all sorts, that if this Government were elected, they could deal with the problem.  If this Supplementary Estimate proves the fallacy of that type of propaganda, then it is worth while.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>This Estimate is obviously a stop-gap sop towards the provision of a very limited measure of employment.  The Minister himself says that the purpose of this Supplementary Estimate is to allow greater flexibility in arranging for the short-term relief of unemployment.  That makes me pose this question: What is the need for this short-term relief of unemployment?  Is it not because the present Fianna Fáil Government failed in their promise, the promise they held out last year when they said: &ldquo;Wives, get your husbands to work&rdquo;?  Here, they offer a small sum of money towards the short-term relief of unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Coupled with that, there is a greater measure of destitution amongst the unemployed than ever before resulting from the heavy increases in bread and <Col N="512" /> butter prices, in addition to tea.  When all we do to relieve this matter is to deal with the short-term relief of unemployment, we must remember that at present there are 85,000 registered unemployed.  The Fianna Fáil Government appears to be complacent about it when they offer such a small sum towards this short-term relief, as they describe it themselves.  The complacency probably arises from the fact that at one stage the Fianna Fáil Party were able to boast of having 145,000 persons on the unemployment register. The figure is now 85,000 persons.  In addition, 50,000 persons have emigrated during the past 12 months.  It is admitted that during 1957 emigration was a record.</P>

      <P>I am talking of 1957 and the present time.  Deputy N. Egan said there was a reduction of 10,000 unemployed since last year, but they have gone across the water.  There now remain 85,000 unemployed persons because Fianna Fáil have failed to provide the work which wives were led to believe would be provided for their husbands who were unemployed this time last year.  On that matter, I should like to mention that this short-term relief of the unemployment problem is designed to absorb the number of people who lost their jobs in industry during 1957.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am indebted to the <i>Irish Independent</i> for the following figures.  The <Col N="513" /> average number of persons employed in industry in 1957 was 140,352.  The average number of persons employed in industry in 1956, when the Costello Government was in power, was 142,910. In other words, the employment position in industry was better in 1956 under the Costello Government than in 1957 under the Government of the promised land which offered so much to the people last year.</P>

      <P>Under sub-head F, Urban Employment Schemes, there is mention of the original Estimate of £140,000, which is being brought up now to a total allocation of £287,000.  That brings me to Dublin City.  It has been stated recently&mdash; and properly&mdash;that the position in Dublin City at the moment is almost as bad as it was in 1913, that there is a great measure of destitution.  There is that great <Col N="514" /> measure of destitution and the number of unemployed persons in Dublin City was never greater.  I shall challenge the Minister for Finance on that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you.  I am satisfied that unemployment this year is greater than last year in Dublin City. Not alone that, but there is destitution amongst those unemployed people as a result of the increases in the bread and butter prices.  There is a greater measure of destitution amongst the unemployed people of Dublin City than ever before, because the 1/6 a week which they were allowed does not go far enough to meet the extra cost of the staple food of the people, which was increased in price last year.  On that point, I should like to say that the unemployment position in Dublin City at the moment was caused mainly by Deputy Briscoe, who used his position as Lord Mayor in 1956 to kill the building industry&mdash;and it never got on its feet since.  Many of those people were engaged in the essential work of building houses at that time. A scare was created for the purpose of upsetting the Government at the time and it was successful.</P>

      <P>Week after week and day after day, he had motions down and had vigorous debates which caused a considerable measure of confusion, a stoppage in the flow of money and a standstill in building operations.  Now we have a £140,000 sop offered to those people, who have the choice of seeking work by which they can earn this small sum, or of emigrating.  On that point, I should like to mention that the Fianna Fáil Party got their answer last November, when their vote dropped from 8,000 to 3,000.</P>

      <P>The Deputy may not discuss elections or by-elections, but what is on the paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, Sir.  They dropped that vote owing to the fact that there was not enough money available under emergency employment schemes to provide people with a week's work.  In less than a year the Fianna Fáil Party dropped that heavy vote.  It is an indication that public confidence in the Fianna Fáil Party has been undermined&mdash;and has been undermined mainly because of the fantastic promises which were made by them prior to the election and not fulfilled.</P>
      <P>It was mentioned last night&mdash;and I presume I am entitled to mention it here&mdash;that a £100,000,000 scheme was put before the people at that time. The people were asked to vote on the understanding that £100,000,000 would be pumped into industrial activity, which would absorb the unemployed. We have seen none of that, but we see here to-day a very small allowance under this particular scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="516" /> I am sorry I do not know very much about the bog development schemes but I understand that there has been a fall also in the employment content of this aspect of our economy.  When we consider the money which is being made available, we must remember that if the Local Authorities (Works) Act had not been abandoned by the Government it might have been possible to absorb a greater number of persons in urban employment schemes under the money that would be available through that Act than for the sum of £140,000 herein.  It is more marked in the rural areas, because the Local Authorities (Works) Act, as it was operated in the rural areas, provided a large volume of public employment on useful schemes.</P>
    <P>A sum of £65,000 is sought under sub-head J for rural improvement schemes.  That money, if spread over 10,000 weeks, would be very little among the huge number of unemployed at the moment.  Calculated in that way, it would give little or no employment. But we have not got even £65,000 because, when introducing the Supplementary Estimate, the Minister said it is not anticipated that the actual expenditure at the end of March would have exceeded £50,000, that the balance would be expendable next year.  Why was the Minister not honest?  Why did he not seek sanction for £50,000 when that was the figure he had in mind?  The remaining £15,000 does not mean anything now because it is not anticipated that it will be spent in this financial year.</P>
    <P>When the Minister is replying I hope we shall get from him some explanation of the Government's attitude towards the unemployed people.  Very little was done by the Government in connection with the dock strike which has been causing considerable unemployment in the various industries which depend on the free flow of goods. The position has been allowed to grow worse.  The only action taken by the Government on the dock strike&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <P>In the Minister's own words, this Supplementary Estimate is to arrange for the short-term relief of unemployment.  What I am saying is that a certain amount of unemployment resulted from the dock strike because the Government did not take the action necessary to have the strike settled earlier.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to give £140,000 for urban improvement schemes.  It is no exaggeration when I say that the people are suffering from dejection of spirit as well as destitution. There are many people now destitute, roaming the roads wondering where next they will go.  It does not suit many of them to emigrate.  It has been said that the people who can emigrate are lucky.  Yet last year emigration was deplored by the Fianna Fáil Party.  They have certainly done nothing to remedy it.</P>
      <P>I feel this is only a stop-gap gesture; I feel it is not the kind of plan that people expected when they heard the promises which were made to them last year by the Fianna Fáil Party. They have been let down in every respect.  They were assured last year, for instance, that the price of bread would not be increased.  All the promises made during the election and all the assurances given have not been fulfilled.  There will be further destitution among unemployed people because investigations are being carried out at the moment by social welfare officers with a view to reducing widows' pensions and various other pensions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carew</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite understand that the scope of this debate is limited and for that reason I shall confine my remarks to my own constituency.  The unemployment problem has been dealt with by every speaker and each has judged it from his own point of view or perhaps from the national point of view, but that there is an acute unemployment problem is evident to all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No doubt one Government can point to causes why unemployment rose during its term of office.  Deputy Cosgrave this morning did briefly refer to the causes which led to much of the unemployment from which we are still <Col N="519" /> suffering.  It occurred in 1956 during the inter-Party term of office.  The cause then was dear money, what was known as the &ldquo;bank squeeze&rdquo;.  Then there were the restrictions due to the Suez trouble.  It cannot be denied that these factors were outside the control of any Government.  Remedies have to be found for them.  The remedies which were necessary had to be severe and they caused considerable unemployment. Much of the damage done because of the Suez crisis and money restrictions is still unrepaired and it is now for the Government of the day to find a solution and to steer our people through that course.</P>
    <P>It is a sad thing to see unemployment particularly when one is in public life, whether one be a member of a local authority or a T.D. representing a constituency.  I am a member of Limerick Corporation and I am well acquainted with the many difficulties with which we have to contend in that body.  In the past we have been given many grants from Government sources and I can boast that we spent those moneys usefully.  We spent them largely on housing development work and that was undoubtedly economic spending.  Some people may say that it is rather wasteful to tear up roads and paths and lay new roads but when we are serving the community by developing sites for housing schemes and other such work, such expenditure is money well spent.</P>
    <P>I understand that £140,000 of this grant is being given to urban authorities.  I would make a special plea for Limerick because many of our industries are going through a rather serious stage.  There are many causes for unemployment and perhaps national policy is responsible for some of it.  Shipping at Limerick Port has been very much curtailed in recent years due to the development of the wheat policy of the Government.  In addition it is evident that due to the development of electricity our port is suffering from the reduced importation of coal. I do not want to go through all the causes but there are many of them.</P>
    <P>It is understandable that the Minister should receive demands from perhaps <Col N="520" /> every town in the country but I would say that Limerick deserves special consideration.  I would join in the statement of my colleague, Deputy Russell, who yesterday described the unemployment position in Limerick as being the worst in living memory.  It is certainly very bad.  In the past 12 years we have extended the borough in Limerick and taken in additional areas.  We lived up to our obligations in that respect, developed housing, and so on, and brought amenities to all these housing schemes.  As a result, a severe strain has been placed on the ratepayers of Limerick City and we are carrying a heavy financial burden.</P>
    <P>My constituency also embraces part of County Limerick, the rural area.  I am glad to see that money is being allocated for bog schemes.  A great deal of drainage is needed there and we all deplore the cessation of operations under the Local Authorities (Works) Act under which money was very usefully spent.  I would appeal to the Minister to treat the rural areas in a very special way because that work has provided employment for men in the rural areas during the lean months of the year.</P>
    <P>Again in relation to Limerick City, our claim can be said to be more prominent than any other because we have not got any new industries there. We have people being forced to emigrate and it is especially sad for married men with families.  It is not so difficult for a young single man who would perhaps like to take a fling at seeing the world, but it is very different when we see married men with young children going away because there is no employment at home.  There are many old-established industries in Limerick.  Being an industrialist myself, I have a very good knowledge of many of these industries.</P>
    <P>I hope and trust that the moneys the Minister is allocating now will be an encouragement to our people to stay at home and to work at home.  We are going through a critical period, the aftermath of the financial crisis that occurred in 1956 as a result of the money restrictions which then existed. The fact that money was made dear, the fact that house building is not <Col N="521" /> practicable for many people who would otherwise be building, makes the Government's responsibility all the greater and I sincerely trust that the Minister will give due consideration to my constituency in the allocation of this money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel there was a lot of uninformed criticism on this Vote.  If Deputies had read the late Parliamentary Secretary's introduction of the main Vote last year, I feel they would have found a great deal of the information they were looking for here and would not have made many of the statements which they did make.  They would also have seen that a number of the matters which were raised could not be raised and could not be dealt with on this Vote.  It is too much to expect Deputies to do that sort of thing&mdash;to read up a debate before they come in here&mdash;and consequently we had a lot of uninformed statements made.</P>
      <P>It is a peculiar thing that those who spoke for the cities all said that the unemployment position was never as bad, that they had not got as much money under this Vote.  Both statements were wrong.  In every single case where Deputies spoke for cities &mdash;Dublin, Cork, Limerick&mdash;and some towns as well, the fact is that the unemployment position is not as bad as this time last year.  I quite admit it is far too bad.  The fact is also that there was more money allocated to these three cities than they could spend on these schemes.  It would have suited Deputy Larkin from Dublin, and perhaps Deputy Casey from Cork, to have inquired in their own cities about this money and to have tried to suggest workable schemes.  If they had done that, there would have been more work given under this scheme.  That applies also, to some extent, to Limerick.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could not find any fault with the criticism suggested by Deputy Russell and Deputy Carew because it was reasonable.  It is a fact, all the same, that, in Limerick, the unemployment position is not as bad and that there is there unspent money under this Vote.  Lest my statement be taken as being too sweeping, I shall quote figures available for the most recent <Col N="522" /> date, given by the Taoiseach in reply to a question here last week.  The figures showed that there were 18,574 unemployed in Dublin as against 20,881 for the previous year.  In Cork, the figures were 3,892 this year as against 6,181 last year.  In Limerick, there were 3,037 unemployed as against 3,213 last year.</P>
    <P>I do not blame Deputy Carew and Deputy Russell for having the impression that the unemployment position was never as bad.  It is a most depressing thing to see people unemployed. On the other hand, it is not fair that they should make statements, without investigation, that the unemployment position was never as bad as it is at the present time.  I would like to see a great improvement in the position, if it could be brought about.  As I said, in Cork and Dublin, there is a fair amount of the money voted under these urban schemes still unexpended. The reason why the money is still unspent is that schemes which could be dealt with under this Vote were not put up, and it would be very much more to the point if Deputy Larkin in Dublin and Deputy Casey in Cork would go into their local offices and try to get something done.  As a matter of fact, it would have been very much more to the profit of the Cork people if Deputy Casey would do that rather than carry Deputy Galvin's speech in his pocket and quote from it.</P>

      <P>Some of them were sanctioned, especially where people were diligent about the thing.  Take my own home town of Wexford. Schemes were sent up from there, and some were sent back but others were sanctioned.  All the money has been spent there because you have people looking after their business.  Deputy Murphy in West Cork&mdash;to take a rural area&mdash;also spoke of the great unemployment, which is not as bad as it <Col N="523" /> was last year, and spoke of the inadequacy of the amount quoted for these schemes in that area.  There was more money voted than there was last year.  When we have Deputies getting up here, without consulting any authoritative source or any figures whatever and making the same speech as they make to their groups down the country in their halls&mdash;where there are no Press representatives present or, if they are present, it does not matter&mdash; that unemployment was never as bad before and that there is less money than before, they are all wrong.</P>
      <P>If we want to solve this problem, and I am quite sure that the Labour Party want to solve it and that the Fine Gael Party want to solve it, the very first essential is to get the facts. There is no use in trying to solve the problem by making accusations against other Parties.  We must know where the people are unemployed and we must know what money we have available, and then see what can be done, but the problem can be solved only by sticking to the facts.</P>
      <P>This Supplementary Estimate is not, and never was, meant to solve the whole unemployment position.  We had Deputies coming in here saying that we had promised £100,000,000 and that now we were coming to look for only £250,000.  This £250,000 was mentioned in the Budget.  I have come across correspondence between the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Sweetman, and his Parliamentary Secretary. The Parliamentary Secretary was looking for more money for schemes and the Minister for Finance had turned down his request.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thought that the Parliamentary Secretary made a good case and I asked my own Parliamentary Secretary what he thought.  He agreed and thought that we should get in more money, and the £250,000 was decided upon.  That was done in the Budget. Even so, we have Deputies getting up and giving the impression, which I think they believe themselves, that at this late stage, after being in office for almost 12 months, we found that we could not solve the unemployment position and brought in this paltry figure. <Col N="524" /> This figure is brought in only to fulfil, first of all, a promise and a provision in the Budget for extra money which is practically all spent.  We are asking Dáil Éireann to vote this money; otherwise, I will be in a bit of trouble over it because I will have to pay it myself. I do not know where I would get it.</P>

      <P>The money spent on these schemes does not do an awful lot for the relief of unemployment.  Under them, the maximum employment is given just before Christmas because many local authorities try to hold on to £1,000 or a couple of thousand pounds, to try to give work to as many as possible just before Christmas.  The actual number employed under these schemes before Christmas last was 5,635, and I suppose that was the peak. The figure goes down practically to nothing in summer and the total amount of employment given under these schemes is not very big.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Vote always was, and has been for the past 30 years, to pay out money for schemes that were otherwise uneconomic, to give a grant for such schemes, to abolish unemployment where it was felt to be worse, as a rule.  Under these schemes, so much money was allotted to each city or town, according to the measure of its unemployment problem.  There are also the bog schemes which not alone provide employment but give benefit to the people getting turf from the bogs, by draining the bogs and making better roads.  They give some passing benefit to the unemployed in the respective districts, but such schemes were never meant to be a solution of the unemployment problem.  Relief schemes are a palliative measure; they have no curative effect whatever on unemployment. They pass, and people go back on the unemployment register again. They cannot be regarded as a remedy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are three items mentioned here and I do not want to go into them in any great detail.  There is the bog scheme which is a very praiseworthy scheme and makes it easier for people to get their turf out.  Then, there is the urban employment scheme <Col N="525" /> which usually means the making of a new path or the developing of a building site where unskilled labour can be employed.  In addition to that, there is the rural improvements scheme which I have always regarded as a very good one for the effect which it has. Where there are two or three people living alone in a bad lane in the countryside, they can join together, contribute a certain amount, and get a large grant from this source in order to make that lane into a passable road linking their homes with the main road.  It is a very praiseworthy scheme for the effects which it has on country population.</P>
    <P>A good lot was said about the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  Everybody in the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party appeared to be unanimous that it was a great scheme.  I know there were some very bad things done under it&mdash;most scandalous works and most scandalous waste of money.  When my colleague became Minister for Local Government, he did not think it could be continued in the form in which it was.  As far as I know, the whole scheme was never removed.  It was cut down and cut down very drastically. Whether the present Minister for Local Government thinks he could have such a scheme under other safeguards, I do not know, but it is a matter for him to make the first recommendation. I want to say very emphatically that a lot of the works carried out under that Act could not be countenanced by any responsible Government.</P>

      <P>I know that.  As I said at the beginning, this Vote is merely dealing with an alleviation of the unemployment position in certain very well-defined areas.  It is not an occasion on which we could discuss unemployment in general or what remedies the Government could suggest.  It is easy for a member of the Opposition to shoot a question of that kind&mdash;what does the Government propose to do? &mdash;and he may be in order in doing so. I am quite sure, however, if I set out <Col N="526" /> now to discuss for half or three-quarters of an hour the Government's programme for unemployment the Ceann Comhairle would have to rule me out of order.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corish said we had cut down on all forms of employment, not only items of relief, but also of housing and roads.  That is a very unjust accusation from Deputy Corish and Deputy Corish can hardly plead that he does not know the facts.  I am quite sure he was a diligent Minister and knew what was going on, why it was going on, and would not agree to anything being done by another Minister in that Government without knowing about it.  He, therefore, knows the things which were done by the previous Government and he knows that when I came to produce my Budget I provided an extra £2,000,000 for housing over and above what the previous Government provided in 1956-57.  How can Deputy Corish have the hard neck to stand up here and say we are not doing enough for housing?  The same applies to roads.  In their last year in office, they took £500,000 out of the Road Fund.  We did not take £500,000 out; we paid in £900,000 to make up for the raid of our predecessors in 1956-57.</P>
      <P>We cannot be accused of being unsympathetic to housebuilding and the making of roads.  There are occasions, however, when the local authorities meet difficulties on their own.  I do not think any Government can be expected to surmount all the difficulties that local authorities deal with.  I take it they are real difficulties, if the local authorities cannot get over them.</P>
      <P>A good many Deputies on the other side of the House said that more should be spent on this Vote.  The Government which represented the Parties on the other side of the House had a certain sum in their Book of Estimates for these relief schemes.  In the Budget, I added £250,000.  It is to be presumed that if the other Government had returned to office, we would not be discussing this £250,000 and there would be no opportunity of saying to the Coalition: Why do you only give £250,000 for relief schemes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="527" /> Deputy Murphy said that if I had gone to West Cork during the last general election campaign and if instead of saying we were going to solve the unemployment question&mdash;my memory may be bad, but I do not remember saying that&mdash;I said to the people of West Cork that I would be giving this £250,000 for the relief of distress, we would never have won the election.  As a matter of fact, we had only come back and taken over Government when I said I would give £250,000 for distress.  Neither Deputy Murphy nor any other Labour or Fine Gael Deputy objected.  They all thought it would be a good thing to give a little more money for the relief of distress. However successful this or any other Government will be in the solution of unemployment, for years to come there will be room for certain expenditure on distress.</P>
    <P>I was also asked by Deputy Murphy how I could justify getting the beneficaries under the rural improvements scheme to make bigger contributions from their own pockets.  I think the last Parliamentary Secretary was unjustified in lowering the contribution. It meant less work could be done.  If we can give £200,000 out of the Vote for the rural improvements scheme and if we say to the people: &ldquo;You will benefit.  We will take 33? per cent. from you,&rdquo; then £260,000 can be spent. The last Parliamentary Secretary did not agree with that.  If we get £200,000 and only take 10 per cent., then only £220,000 will be spent.  The increased contribution is a good thing and goes further in getting the work done.</P>
    <P>A few Deputies raised a question in regard to the amount spent under this rural improvements scheme.  An additional £65,000 was allocated.  Only £50,000 was spent and the other £15,000 is to be spent after 31st March.  We are asking for only £50,000.  In the urban employment schemes, £140,000 was allocated out of the extra Vote. Actually, we are asking for £7,000 more so there will be £147,000 to spend before 31st March.</P>

      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £10,000 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1958, for certain Miscellaneous Expenses, including certain Grants-in-Aid, Compensation and Other Payments in connection with Injuries to Property (No. 24 of 1941) and payments of Compensation for Death or Personal Injuries.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Supplementary Estimate is to enable a special non-recurrent grant-in-aid of £10,000 to be made to the National Theatre Society Limited, who run the Abbey Theatre, towards meeting losses incurred in the working of the Abbey during the past few years.  For over 30 years, the society have been in receipt of annual grants-in-aid from the Exchequer.  At present they amount to £8,000 per annum, including £5,000 to meet extra running expenses due to transfer to the Queen's Theatre after the fire in 1951.  Some time ago, the society asked that their grants-in-aid be doubled by reason of the big increase in their working losses during recent years. Following discussion and correspondence with the society, it has been estimated that by 31st March, 1958, the amount of their bank overdraft and of outstanding accounts will be approximately £10,000, representing in effect losses which it has not been possible for the society to meet from (a) ordinary revenue supplemented by the existing recurrent Exchequer assistance and (b) the sale of about £11,000 of securities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the importance of the Abbey Theatre in the cultural life of the country, it is felt that the Exchequer should come to its rescue. While it is not feasible in present circumstances to double the existing grants-in-aid as requested by the Abbey directors, it is considered that a special non-recurrent grant-in-aid of £10,000 should be paid towards wiping out the debts estimated to be due by <Col N="529" /> 31st March, 1958.  The approval of the Dáil to this course is sought accordingly.</P>

    <P>The purpose of this Supplementary Estimate is to inform the Dáil of the present financial position of Mianraí Teoranta and to obtain authority to write off certain undischarged liabilities to the Government which the company has no funds to meet.  The House will recollect that this company was set up in 1947.  It took over the assets and liabilities of two other companies which had been established under earlier legislation, the Slieveardagh Coalfield Development Company and the Minerals Exploration and Development Company.  It resumed the exploration and development work at the Slieveardagh Coalfield and it began the exploration work on the copper deposits at Avoca.  It also carried out some smaller scale exploration work for minerals in other parts of the country.</P>
    <P>For the work on Slieveardagh, the company was financed by means of repayable advances from the Exchequer. These amounted to £104,614. Perhaps I should mention that the limit, fixed in the statute which set up the company, to finances for that purpose was £88,000; but by a Supplementary Estimate, which was passed in the Dáil in July, 1952, extra statutory advances amounting to £21,000 were authorised, of which £16,614 were drawn.  It was intended then to regularise the position by the introduction of an amending Act, but that was not done because of doubts concerning the future of Mianraí Teoranta.</P>
    <P>In 1953, as Deputies may recollect, Mianraí Teoranta, on my instructions, sold its interest in the Slieveardagh Coalfield and the Ballingarry Colliery to private interests for £50,000.  It had liabilities amounting to £29,250, mainly for workmen's compensation.  These were discharged out of the receipts on the sale of the property and the balance was surrendered to the Exchequer.  Repayable advances made prior to 1947 amounted to £74,288 and that sum, when added to the advances of £104,614 made since the company <Col N="531" /> came into existence, bring the total liability of the company to the Exchequer to £196,320, after allowing for the repayments which it made and for the interest due upon these advances.</P>
    <P>Mianraí Teoranta also spent approximately £543,000 on exploration work at Avoca.  That work was financed by means of non-repayable grants.  The moneys so advanced were, therefore, not brought to account in the Estimate, but, of course, the Dáil is aware that, under the provisions of the lease to St. Patrick's Copper Mines, the sum of £542,996 is repayable and is a first charge upon the profits of the St. Patrick's Copper Mines Limited.  As a result of those activities, therefore, Mianraí Teoranta were not only directly responsible for initiating the development of two important mines which are now exploiting or which will in future exploit our national assets in a quite substantial way, but are also indirectly responsible for giving a considerable fillip to mineral exploration by private interests in general.</P>
    <P>My predecessor decided in 1956 that the activities of Mianraí Teoranta should be terminated.  Its assets were disposed of and its office closed down. The financial position of the company now is that, taking into account assets and liabilities which it took over when it was set up, the advances which were made to it subsequently and the amount realised by the disposal of the assets, the company owe the Exchequer a net total of £196,320, which includes a sum of £52,203 in respect of accrued interest.  The company is out of business now and has no funds to meet the liability and the purpose of this Estimate is to secure Dáil sanction to write off this sum.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The Government have decided that the <Col N="532" /> stage has now been reached in industrial development at which it is necessary to consider the policy enshrined in the Control of Manufactures Acts.  These Acts were devised at a time when the primary aim of industrial policy was to secure the establishment of a factory capacity to supply home market needs of goods which were previously imported.</P>
      <P>It was considered then to be necessary in order to encourage investment in industrial enterprises for that purpose to give an assurance, through legislation, to potential investors in such enterprises that they would not be required to meet, in the early and difficult period of their development, competition from branch factories etsablished by powerful external companies. Generally, the development of home market possibilities by externally controlled branch factories was not deemed to be desirable&mdash;certainly not the most desirable of all the available possibilities.</P>
      <P>It was considered that branch factories of that kind, if forced reluctantly into being by the policy of protection&mdash;a tariff policy which was then being implemented&mdash;would not be a very healthy or very progressive type of development and that the ultimate growth of industrial activity would be better fostered under the aegis of independent and, if possible, Irish-controlled firms.</P>
      <P>I think it can be said that the policy of the Control of Manufactures Act, taking into account the problems of industrial development at the time it was enacted, has justified itself.  If we were still mainly concerned with expanding industrial production to meet home market needs only, there would be little case for making any fundamental change in that policy now. There is, however, I think, still a moral obligation upon us to maintain the protection of these Acts for the firms which came into existence because of the assurance which it gave them, at least in relation to activities which are limited to the home market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far, therefore, as further development of industry in this country for the purpose of supplying home market <Col N="533" /> needs is concerned, where there is for any reason no possibility or no intention of export, the policy of the Government will remain as heretofore, that is to say, we will give preference to developments sponsored by Irish companies and we will operate the licence provisions of the Control of Manufactures Act where circumstances justify any other course.</P>
    <P>As I have been making clear during recent months the aim of industrial policy now is to encourage development for export trade and for that aim the Control of Manufactures Act is unsuitable and could be a serious impediment. That is why we have decided the time has come to change it.  As we see the national need of the present time, there is justification for encouraging and facilitating external participation in the development of Irish industrial possibilities where these possibilities offer a prospect of securing development of export trade.  That justification arises from the existing shortage of capital for the development of industry, perhaps because of technical difficulties and inexperience in the problems associated with the operation of the larger type of undertaking required for success in export markets and also because of the urgency of the present need to expand industrial development in order to widen employment opportunities, to reduce unemployment and check emigration.</P>
    <P>The Bill which has been circulated was prepared against the background of that pressing need to expand industrial exports and its main objective is to facilitate external capital investments in industrial projects related to exports.  Lest there should be any misunderstanding, I should like to pay a tribute, which I think is well deserved, to the many existing Irish concerns which have tackled the problems involved in the expansion of the export trade in an energetic and effective manner and who have achieved not inconsiderable success in that enterprise.</P>
    <P>The indications are that the number of existing Irish firms entering into the export business is likely to rise because there is now a fairly general acceptance that, with the help and guidance <Col N="534" /> supplied by Coras Tráchtála and the financial incentives available for exports, the special efforts required for export developments are rewarded by increased turnover, lower unit cost of production and increased earnings. Nevertheless, we need a number of new concerns and externally-promoted undertakings geared for export could make a very substantial contribution to the development of our trade, a contribution which, as I said, is so essential to our economic wellbeing.</P>
    <P>It is necessary now to make it clear that development of that type and in that manner is welcome, and indeed, one of the main reasons for preparing and introducing a Bill to amend the Control of Manufactures Act is to advertise as widely as possible that foreign investment in industrial development involving export trade is welcomed and will be facilitated. Accordingly, when preparing this Bill, we have not only tried to remove actual impediments to external capital participation of the type which we are anxious to encourage but we have endeavoured to emphasise that external participation in export projects would be welcomed.</P>
    <P>The House is, of course, aware that under the Acts as they stand, there is power to issue what are described as new manufacture licences to companies which are externally-owned and that power could be used in the future, as it has been used in the past, to facilitate desirable projects of that kind.  The new manufacture licence procedure, however, does not seem to meet the requirements of the situation in which we now find ourselves, nor is it likely to give us the rate of export trade development of which we are in such pressing need.  It seems likely that if a company abroad planning some new industrial project had a choice of location between this country and another country where they were free to commence an export business without having to secure a licence, they might, all other things being equal, choose the other country.  They might feel that because a licence is required, our policy must be a restrictive one more especially as the existing legislation provides for the <Col N="535" /> attachment of conditions to licences.</P>
    <P>The existing Acts provide that the licences granted under them cannot be revoked, but that fact may not be generally appreciated abroad and indeed there has been some evidence of misunderstanding of the requirements of the Acts in that regard.  Finally, it is possible that external promoters of new industrial ventures may, for their own very good reasons, be reluctant to disclose their business affairs to what to them is the Government of a foreign country.</P>
    <P>What I have said summarises, I think, the reasons why it is desirable to amend these Acts now.  In the case of a concern which is planned and organised to carry on business solely for export, there is obviously no reason why the promoters should have to operate the new manufacture licence procedure at all.  Accordingly, one of the provisions of this Bill is framed to take outside these Acts completely the companies engaging solely in export trade.</P>
    <P>Again, where promoters of industrial projects of which export business is a principal objective afford to investors in this country a reasonable opportunity of investment in the ordinary share capital, it would be unreasonable to insist that such concerns should be forced to comply with the existing provisions of the Acts and seek a licence under the Acts merely because Irish investors failed to avail themselves of the opportunity offered to them.  Accordingly, other provisions of this Bill are designed to exclude from the scope of the Control of Manufactures Acts companies incorporated here, managed and controlled here, which have export business as a principal object and the memoranda of association of which state that export business is a principal object, which offer not less than 50 per cent. of their voting shares <i>bona fide</i> to the Irish investing public.</P>

Provided companies comply with that requirement, that is to say, companies of the character which I have mentioned, which obtain their finance by issuing shares for public subscription and give a fair opportunity to subscribe for those shares to Irish investors, then they will be free to transact business as though the Control of Manufactures Acts did not exist and will not be under any obligation to approach any Government Department for approval or for authority of any kind before commencing business.</P>
      <P>I must, however, point out that that cannot in present circumstances be regarded as an important modification of the position, because, as Deputies are aware, there are not very many companies now being organised in this country which contemplate obtaining capital for their purposes by means of the issue of shares for public subscription. It is, however, I think, a provision which will alter the existing impression of the restrictions in the Control of Manufactures Acts as they stand.</P>
      <P>May I say that one of the reasons for the delay in the circulation of this Bill after its introduction was the fact that problems arose in devising that provision of the Bill, that is, to make it clear what is intended and to make the purpose effective?  When the parliamentary draftsman first produced a draft of the Bill, he indicated that he thought it necessary to put, in the draft, provisions to make sure that an offer of shares in that way would be a <i>bona fide</i> offer and these provisions mounted up to a rather intimidating list of restrictions which I thought would have the effect of defeating the main purpose of the Bill by creating the possibility of misunderstanding of the reasons for these restrictions.  It was only when that problem was faced that the alternative solution for it now indicated in the Bill was found.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill provides that when either the Dublin or Cork Stock Exchange grants a quotation for its shares, a company will be regarded as having complied with the requirements in respect of the shares.  That, I think, is an important provision.  It gives the safeguards required without excessive regulation.  It is an arrangement which <Col N="537" /> is likely to appeal to external interests, particularly the larger concerns which are familiar with stock exchange procedures.</P>
    <P>I should like in that connection to express very deep appreciation of the willing co-operation which was displayed by the committees of the Dublin and Cork Stock Exchanges.  When the matter was raised with them, their co-operation was freely extended and they undertook to meet the requirements of the Bill without any hesitation whatever and, indeed, had suggestions to make for the improvement of the procedure which were important.</P>
    <P>There is, of course, a possibility that a new company, freed from the requirements of the Control of Manufactures Acts under the procedures which I have mentioned, might not in fact develop export trade to the extent originally visualised or at all, or might indeed be obliged, because of trade conditions, to sell its products in the home market in greater volume than originally contemplated. I do not know that it is necessary, however, to have absolute safeguards against that contingency. Certainly, I would not wish to erect safeguards which would seriously lessen the prospects of large-scale concerns being established here for the purposes of doing export trade.  If the Irish public are given an opportunity of investing in such undertakings, I think the risk to which I referred can be disregarded.  In any event, it is extremely unlikely that concerns of the size and character that can successfully promote a public issue of shares for which a market quotation can be secured will issue a prospectus proclaiming export trade to be a main object of their enterprise if they do not intend that it should be so.</P>
    <P>These proposals which I have mentioned so far are designed primarily to meet the needs of large concerns, concerns which would normally, as I said, have recourse to public issues for securing capital.  We have to recognise, however, that by far the great majority of Irish undertakings at present in existence and of those that are likely to come into existence in the future are not financed in that way.</P>
    <P>These provisions would not be applicable <Col N="538" /> to undertakings which would be financed in some manner other than through the issue of shares for public subscription.  Neither do these provisions meet the case of a company which intends to promote a public issue of its shares, but desires to postpone the issue until a later stage of its development when it would be in a position to reveal to prospective investors the profit-earning capacity of the undertaking.  As Deputies will understand, it is not unusual for industrial undertakings to be started in that way with money procured from various sources intended to be recovered by a public issue when successful development can be shown.</P>
    <P>These proposals I have made would not, either, meet the case of a concern, the promoters of which prefer to operate solely on their own capital. It is proposed to deal with these cases by providing for the issue of irrevocable certificates of exemption from the Control of Manufactures Act, where the Minister for Industry and Commerce is satisfied that export trade is a main objective.  A certificate of that character would, as its very name implies, exempt such a company from the requirements of the Act in regard to the activities covered by it.  Once a certificate is granted and the business had commenced, it could not be revoked.</P>
    <P>It is necessary, however, in view of the general structure and purpose of the legislation, to provide that there shall be stated in the certificate of exemption the processes which the company is authorised by it to carry on and also to provide a time limit within which these processes must be begun.  There would be a danger to our industrial development if powerful companies were given authorisation in the form of one of these certificates to undertake some industrial process here and did not, in fact, do so with reasonable promptitude because the knowledge that such a company had the right to undertake that process in this country might deter others from embarking on it also.  Therefore, the requirement that the certificate of exemption is valid only subject to the process authorised by it being begun <Col N="539" /> within a reasonable time is a necessary safeguard.</P>
    <P>Apart from facilitating external investment in new concerns, it is desirable that established Irish companies should be facilitated also in securing external capital when they need it for developing export trade. I have had discussions with representatives of a number of companies which contemplate the possibility of extending into export trade, subject to their being able to procure the capital they require and associate with their development external companies with which they have made contacts. These companies were debarred from that course by the existing law, unless they were prepared to adopt the course of applying for a Control of Manufactures Act licence, which most of them were reluctant to do.</P>
    <P>The Bill accordingly proposes that where the shares of an Irish company have been quoted on the Stock Exchange for a period of five years, there should be power to issue certificates of exemption to that company when the Minister for Industry and Commerce is of opinion that it intends to engage in an export business, or that its export business will be facilitated thereby.  An effect of that proposal would be to create a freer market in the shares of established Irish companies proposing to engage in export trade.</P>
    <P>As a further means of facilitating export development, the Bill provides that, where the Minister for Industry and Commerce is of opinion that a particular commodity is either not being manufactured or not being manufactured to a substantial extent, he may, by Order, declare it to be an excepted commodity, in which event the Control of Manufactures Acts would not apply at all to its manufacture. I do not want to exaggerate the importance of that provision.  I contemplate that there will be difficulties of definition in the operation of a provision of that kind.  I am not sure it will prove to be of very great significance in the future.  However, there may be cases where it would be helpful and that provision, accordingly, <Col N="540" /> has been included in the Bill on that basis.</P>
    <P>Deputies are no doubt aware that over the years there have been growing criticisms of the Control of Manufactures Acts.  It was stated that they indicated an attitude towards external participation in Irish industrial development, but contained too many loopholes to be effective.  While this Bill was designed and is introduced primarily to facilitate external investment in export projects, it also contains some provisions to remedy defects in the existing Acts in so far as they relate to concerns which are not engaged in export.</P>
    <P>I think the most likely used method of evading the requirements of the original Acts was the formation of a company with a small share capital held in such a way as to secure nominal compliance with the Act, while the effective finance was provided by loans or credits by outside parties who, through these arrangements, effectively controlled the company concerned. To prevent that evasion and to remedy that defect in the Acts, it is proposed that companies, to comply with the requirements of the Acts, will be required to have a minimum paid-up share capital equal to at least half the value of the fixed assets used in the business.</P>
    <P>In determining the value of the fixed assets, allowance must, of course, be made for genuine reserves reinvested in such assets, hire purchase liabilities or loans obtained from Irish sources, from persons who themselves would be entitled to be regarded as Irish citizens for the purpose of this legislation, and other similar items.  To avoid hardship, it is provided that that obligation will not come into force for a year ahead; and, indeed, power is being taken to relieve companies of their obligations in that respect for a further period, should the Minister for Industry and Commerce in any particular case think it necessary or desirable to do so.</P>
    <P>Another minor defect in the Acts is that one section in the Control of Manufactures Act, 1934&mdash;that is the second of the two Acts passed at that time&mdash;which was intended to permit <Col N="541" /> manufacturing companies which operated prior to the 2nd June, 1932, to extend the range of their manufacture, has been in practice held to enable firms who were on that date merely engaged in distribution to undertake manufacturing operations. It is proposed to remedy that position and to give effect to the intention of the legislation by providing that the benefits of the section will apply only to firms actually engaged in manufacturing business.  That provision will not, of course, affect any firm which has already commenced manufacturing.</P>
    <P>It never has been possible to prove in law that shares are not held in the beneficial ownership of qualified persons in the proportion required by the Acts and that has very seriously weakened the administration of the Acts.  This Bill proposes to remedy that position by placing the onus on a company of showing that it complies with the Acts, and letting the courts decide.  The opportunity is also being availed of to make a number of changes to simplify the administration of the Acts.  It is proposed that the Acts should no longer apply to businesses owned by private individuals or by partnerships.  Neither will it apply to businesses which do not use mechanical power.  Another change means that repairing will no longer be regarded as manufacturing and, therefore, no longer covered by these Acts. In addition, the Acts will no longer apply to companies where the value of the fixed assets in the business is less than £5,000.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains a number of miscellaneous provisions.  It formally confers on all Irish citizens the same rights in regard to the holding of shares under the Control of Manufactures Acts as were held by the classes of persons mentioned in the existing Acts.  The Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act of 1956 dealt with that point in a general way, but it is felt desirable in the interests of clarity to make a suitable provision in this Bill also.</P>
    <P>The Bill also terminates the power to invoke the reserve commodity licence procedure of the 1934 Act. That procedure has, in fact, been used <Col N="542" /> only on one occasion.  It was the first attempt made here to devise a policy to encourage industrial development in the west of Ireland.  The main obstacle to that development visualised then was the competitive disadvantages of the western location and the danger consequently of a company establishing itself in the west of Ireland having to meet at a later stage competition from another company in the same business, established in Dublin or some other eastern location. In order to meet that problem as it was then visualised this reserve commodity licence procedure was devised under which manufacture of a particular commodity stated in the licence could be undertaken only in the location stipulated in the licence.</P>
    <P>As Deputies know, policy in that regard has extended very much since then and the Undeveloped Areas Act gives a far more powerful&mdash;and, may I say, a far more successful&mdash;implement to carry that aspect of national policy into operation.  Consequently, the reserve commodity licence procedure, which is more or less a dead letter anyway, is now being formally repealed.</P>
    <P>Provision is also being inserted to clarify the position under the Control of Manufactures Acts of shares held by a Minister in his capacity as Minister. There is some question as to whether the Minister holding shares in his official capacity could be described as in the beneficial ownership of the shares.  It is desirable that that position should be clarified.  A provision is also being included to remove some doubts about the form of new manufacture licences.</P>
    <P>When the intention of the Government to introduce this Bill was discussed in the Dáil towards the end of last year, speeches were made from both the main Opposition Parties which indicated a view that it might be better to repeal the Control of Manufactures Acts altogether, rather than seek to amend or to liberalise them.  I have given reasons why I think that would be undesirable.  I feel that in this matter we should move somewhat cautiously, doing the things which it appears necesary to do <Col N="543" /> and not going further than that at the present stage.</P>
    <P>In connection with the negotiations now proceeding for the establishment of a Free Trade Area in Europe, there is a proposal regarding the right of establishment, that is to say, the right of a firm domiciled in one country accepting that agreement to establish itself, to create branch or agency organisations, in another country party to the agreement.  It is not possible to say at this stage whether that proposal will be accepted or in what form, if accepted, it may appear in the agreement, but I think that it is possible that the agreement will contain some provision regarding that right of establishment.  If that should happen and if, when the negotiations are concluded and the agreement is presented to us for consideration, we should decide to become a party to it, then it might be necessary to have another look at this legislation also&mdash;although I do not think it is likely that the obligation under the agreement to make changes in that regard will be of immediate effect.</P>
    <P>I mention that because I am not presenting this Bill as the last word in the view of the Government on the changes which may be required in this matter.  I think the changes proposed here will achieve the aims we now have in mind, making it known that we are liberalising our policy in this respect, removing misunderstandings in regard to our policy on the investment of external capital in industries entering the export trade, and generally dealing with the objections and difficulties which have been encountered in the course of the years.</P>
    <P>While I do not want to present this Bill as comprehensive in every detail, nevertheless I think on the whole it does present a summary of the views of those who have been giving a great deal of thought to this matter and who are in a position to estimate with some accuracy what are our requirements. I am quite certain the Bill cannot please everybody; indeed some of the manufacturers who were established under the protection of the <Col N="544" /> original Acts have shown signs of opposing any change whatever.  Nevertheless, I do think it is worthy to be recommended to the House for acceptance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I must confess to a feeling of both confusion and astonishment at the performance we have just had from the Minister for Industry and Commerce in this matter.  One point of his speech stressed the urgency of this matter, that we required industrial expansion on a big scale and at once.  I thought there might be some attempt to deal with the present large unemployment figures and the terrific drift from this country by way of emigration.  However, at the end he told us that this is a cautious approach and that while it may not represent the last view of the Government in this matter, it is the furthest he could go at the moment.</P>
      <P>How far that is I am at a loss to understand.  He said he was introducing in this Bill changes of the previous Acts, that these changes are to be regarded as an advertisement abroad that foreign investors will accept and appreciate.  If the Minister parcels off copies of this Bill and represents them abroad as advertisements for foreign investments, he will very quickly find how little their advertisement value is, unless there is some clause of a more liberal nature than I understand the Bill to contain.  If anybody seeks in the Bill any great advertisement to foreign investors, they will find more confusion than clarification.</P>
      <P>I have read this Bill a couple of times.  I find there is a great deal of sham in it and an amazing amount of repetition of the provisions of the 1932 and 1934 Control of Manufactures Acts. In fact, I could not make up my mind how much sham and face-saving there was in the whole matter, and until we have got through the Committee Stage and the Report Stage, it will not be possible for anybody to form a judgment as to how far this Bill is real or is merely face-saving or, to a great extent, a sham.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The old practices under the Control of Manufactures Acts of 1932 and 1934 were futile in their main effects, but they were not obstructive of development <Col N="545" /> in certain important ways.  The briefest commentary one could make on this measure reflects the views expressed on February 18, 1953, by Deputy John A. Costello when he said this:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The importance of attracting foreign capital, particularly of the risk bearing character, has not been sufficiently recognised.  The Statutes which hamper the flow of valuable funds should be suitably amended, with due regard to the maintenance intact of our Irish way of life.  The sole consequence of the present Statutes is that the best type of foreign enterprise is kept out, while any slick merchant who wishes to do so can adopt any one of 100 legal devices of overcoming the Statutes. We should make the economy attractive ground for the employment of capital, no matter who subscribes it. Long overdue changes in our law dealing with companies would provide far better protections than those at present existing.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a quotation from a booklet entitled &ldquo;Blueprint for Prosperity.&rdquo;  The speech from which I have culled was made by Deputy John A. Costello at the Fine Gael Árd Fheis in Dublin on February 18, 1953.  That was the situation under the 1932 and 1934 Control of Manufactures Acts. Under those pieces of legislation, any slick merchant could certainly find ways and means of getting over the Acts.  I do not say that I know 100 ways, but I know sufficient to get on with.  I doubt if there is any member of the law courts engaged in practice or associated in any way with industry who could not have provided innumerable ways out of the two Acts. We are told this Bill will get over the main evasions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened to what were called the main evasions and I do not rank them highly in the many legal ways of getting over the 1932 and the 1934 Control of Manufactures Acts.  As far as the Bill itself is concerned, on my reading of it, Section 7 and onwards deal with <Col N="546" /> the original Acts of 1932 and 1934.  The early part of the Bill probably does represent new ground.  I suppose Sections 2, 3, 4 and 6 represent the main items of novelty in this piece of legislation.  Section 2 depends on the Minister.  He may except commodities entirely from the scope of this legislation. Section 6 also depends on the Minister.  Under that section, he may grant a certificate of exemption in respect of a particular manufacturing process in respect of a particular Irish company.</P>
    <P>In the old days, there was tremendous objection to the ability of the monarch to suspend legislation in respect of certain people and to dispense with certain legislation.  There was great objection and agitation against the view that the king should attract or arrogate to himself any such powers. That power was eventually taken away from the king and put into the hands of the people.  In this new piece of legislation, we have two sections which are entirely at the Minister's mercy. A whole range of commodities might find themselves excepted entirely from the scope of legislation, not merely this Bill but from the scope of the 1932 and 1934 Control of Manufactures Acts as well.</P>
    <P>In respect of a particular commodity or particular manufacturing process which an Irish company has as its main object of development, the Minister may grant an exemption from the scope of the legislation.  One knows so well that one need not stress the dangers of these things.  When elections were occurring, we got used to the letters being issued to protected firms asking for Party subscriptions. In future elections are we to have this practice extended to companies abroad or to companies here who were exempted so that there would be a small supply of foreign capital?</P>
    <P>Sections 3 and 4 go together, but in so far as there is any indication of liberalisation of Government policy, it depends upon Section 3.  Section 4 makes it an offence for people to carry on a manufacturing process &ldquo;unless&rdquo;, and then are given the exceptions. The first exception is that the company carries on business solely for export. <Col N="547" /> The second is that such company is an excluded company, which brings one back to Section 3.  Does the first exception mean that if 1 per cent. of whatever is the output of the business carried on by a company is not exported, that company fails to get exclusion, that it is caught by the Act? If it does, we are back again at Shylock's pound of flesh.  If anything is added in that is not completely an export&mdash;I am dealing with the use of the word &ldquo;solely&rdquo;&mdash;that will take away the exemption and the company will then be controlled by the Act unless they can get out as being an excluded company.</P>
    <P>What is to be an excluded company? It complies with the following conditions: if it is a public company limited by shares and is an Irish company.  An Irish company means that it is registered in the State under the Companies Act.  That is very easy of accomplishment.  The second clause is that it be managed and controlled in the State.  I understand from previous speeches the Minister has made at other gatherings that that means that those who manage the company must be resident here.  What the control means I do not know.  It used to mean control of the voting capacity as indicated by shares but that apparently is gone from this Act under this clause.</P>
    <P>The third sub-section in this section which enables a company to become an excluded company under the Act is that its memorandum of association must provide that the carrying on of a manufacturing process in relation to a commodity intended for export is a principal object.  When the Minister was speaking he slipped easily over that term &ldquo;a principal object&rdquo;.  This means that for the future any person drawing up a memorandum of association for a company will be warned that he must put in amongst the object clauses one which will relate to the carrying on of a process in relation to a commodity and that one of the objects is to export it.  It must be a principal object.</P>
    <P>The ordinary memorandum of association usually runs to no less than <Col N="548" /> 30 clauses; sometimes in big concerns it might extend to double that.  The earlier clauses are always described as the object clauses.  The principal objects are set out there.  It seems to me that any company which hereafter inserts in its memorandum of association between clauses 1 and 6, a clause referring to exports, that company is qualified for exclusion.  It may be that that is not meant but I want to know what is meant, and then we shall know whether this is really a liberalising piece of legislation or merely face-saving.</P>
    <P>The fourth of these clauses&mdash;and the Minister made a very peculiar observation about it&mdash;deals with shares carrying voting rights.  The Minister told us that it was this clause and the drafting of this clause that caused all the delay between the introduction of this piece of legislation and its Second Reading.  Yet he told us that he did not think it would make much difference. The clause reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(d)  That, of each class of shares carrying voting rights issued by it, not less than 50 per cent. have been made available primarily to Irish citizens or Irish companies which are managed and controlled in the State&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&mdash;how are they to be made available?&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;through being <i>bona fide</i> issued for public subscription in the State,&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>What does that mean?  The control of this is not left with the Minister. The shares must get Stock Exchange quotation.  If a company has asked the Stock Exchange for a quotation and claims that it has complied with paragraph (d) it must state so and then the Stock Exchange may require evidence enabling it to determine whether such claim is or is not well founded.  What is the claim?  The claim is that not less than 50 per cent. of the shares have been made available primarily to Irish citizens or Irish companies which are managed and controlled in the State through being <i>bona fide</i> issued for public subscription in the State.</P>
    <P>There is no limitation about time. The shares are to be left open for subscription. I have known lists to have <Col N="549" /> been opened at 10 a.m. and closed at 10.5 a.m.  It is not unusual for a subscription list to be opened and nobody subscribing.  As far as I can make out a company can claim that it has carried out the provisions of the Act in this regard and can show that no fewer than 50 per cent. of the shares have been made available through being issued for public subscription in the State.  Until we get an explanation from the Minister as to what is meant by this clause or what will be written in by way of amendment to it, it is impossible to come to a conclusion as to whether this is a liberalising measure or whether it is the carrying forward of a few vague phrases from the old Acts of 1932 and 1934.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the earlier Acts are to apply, as far as I can gather from the Minister's speech, to those who are still going to cater for home needs.  This legislation is for those who are going to export but what &ldquo;going to export&rdquo; means is not easily discoverable from the Bill.  If they intend to export, if they have that as a principal object and if they open their share list for subscription, apparently that qualifies a company under this Act for exclusion, which means that many of the companies at the moment are tied by the 1932 and 1934 Acts. Those who comply with the new provisions may swing over in a <i>bona fide</i> way by having as a principal object the idea of export.  They can thus apparently qualify and become excluded companies.</P>
    <P>I am one of those who did feel at the beginning that it would have been far better to have done repentance with regard to the old Acts and to have indicated that there was a new mood and a new approach to this matter of getting funds for investment in this country.  I felt that we should have admitted that there were defects in the old Act even though these defects could be got over, as Deputy Costello said, by the slick merchant who wished to do so.  But even with that the best advertisement surely is not to have foreign investors landed with a whole lot of indigestible matter contained in a technical piece of proposed legislation like this but to have a complete <Col N="550" /> repeal of the 1932 and the 1934 Acts as long as there is what Deputy Costello called &ldquo;regard to the maintenance intact of the Irish way of life&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In that connection I would have thought that the best way of achieving all that would have been to maintain the reserve commodity proposals in the old legislation and to have those apply to the companies already established here.  We are aware of the dangers that might develop if some group coming in with bigger capital resources could swamp a company already established here in years gone by, as long as our view was that that company was doing good business, giving employment and producing Irish manufactured goods.  The maintenance of our Irish way of life is a matter that will have to be looked to.  After all the money that has been spent by way of increased costs and in protecting industry in order to give a better return, it would be desperate if, after 25 years, we were to abandon these people because of the new move.</P>
    <P>With regard to gearing ourselves for the export business there has been, over the past 25 years, a record.  In the case of many of the industries it has not been too good and not too curiously inquired into although the Tánaiste on occasion during the last seven or eight years spoke not exactly in those wheedling terms in which he is trying to present his new move. The continuous inefficiency of the Government and their persistence in a wrong approach to a great many problems do not put the Minister in a good position to lecture industrialists on inefficiency or bad practice.</P>
    <P>The summer 1957 issue of <i>Studies</i> contained an essay by Professor Carter of Queen's University, Belfast, on &ldquo;The Irish Economy Viewed from Without&rdquo; and to it was added the commentaries of three or four people.  Looking on this country from across the Border, Professor Carter was asked his views. There are certain views expressed there which I think anybody could contradict, for while his eyes are on this country, he cannot forget that his feet are planted in the Six Counties side. Nevertheless, there is this view which <Col N="551" /> is one to be presented in contradistinction to the views given by the Minister for Lands and the Minister for Education, aided by the Tánaiste, in speeches throughout the country.  On page 139 of <i>Studies</i> Professor Carter says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;But it is not in fact true that saving and investment are the fundamental things; the fundamental things are hard work, technical skill and good management, and they can often achieve a great deal without large capital expenditure.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He continues:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I doubt if Irish workers are naturally particularly idle;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I want to stress that because all the emphasis in after-dinner speeches for months past has been on the necessity for hard work, generally making out that our people are not producing enough and that what we require is to have working hours increased, or to work the present number of hours for smaller wages.  Professor Carter's view is one I think with which we should agree.  Our people are not noted for idleness or wasting time when they go abroad.  Does this happen only when people who are born here remain here?</P>
    <P>In any event, the professor continues:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I think that their work is often managed so that they waste their time.  Bad management and technical backwardness seem to be the essential trouble.  The first shows itself in working time wasted because materials are not there, in failure to do market research and find out just what the customer wants, in poor costing, bad layout of plant, absence of work study and many other things. Technical backwardness is seen in agriculture in such things as the shockingly low use of fertilisers, and in industry in the absence of staff trained to appreciate new technical knowledge (which must of necessity mostly come from abroad); in both agriculture and industry there seems to me to be a lack of research on special Irish problems, and of liaison men with the task of taking the results of research to the small producer.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="552" /> He sums up thus:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Let us therefore put down in order the basic needs of a prosperous economy:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  Improvement of management,</P>
    <P>(b)  The discovery, adaptation and spreading of new technical knowledge,</P>
    <P>(c)  Capital investment of a productive kind to back these up.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He then asks: &ldquo;How is the process of recovery to begin?&rdquo;  and goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is tempting to say that the answer is better education and more saving, which amounts to saying that nothing can happen for a long time. But Ireland is an exporter of brains, although she is sorely in need of them; an improvement in education will not of itself stop this export.  By far the most hopeful means of getting good management, technical knowledge and capital all at once is from subsidiaries of large foreign companies; and it would be worth very large inducements indeed, including complete exemption from taxes for a period, to get more of them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is an ideal of course and cannot be realised.  He continues:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Unfortunately the execution of such a policy runs against a whole lot of favourite illusions.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>They are the illusions from which the Tánaiste suffered during the past 25 years and I do not know if he has yet got rid of them.  Professor Carter goes on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;One is that a locally-owned business is better than a foreign one; the opposite is the truth, for advanced technical knowledge flows readily from a great firm to its subsidiaries, and a plant which is paid for by foreign capital is a great deal better than one which has to be paid for from the scanty savings of the Republic.  Another illusion is that there is a virtue in small business; so there is, for certain purposes, and given intelligent management, but it is quite clear that in many branches of industry (and those among the most rapidly <Col N="553" /> progressive) large firms have immense advantages.  They can support massive research and develop programmes which benefit their subsidiaries; they can buy the best in skill and technical knowledge and good management and diffuse its benefits throughout their empire; they can raise money more easily and on better terms; they can be more adventurous because they can spread their risks.  The spread of good practices is much more difficult in industries, such as farming and building, which are necessarily organised in small units.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Professor Carter goes on to the third point and says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The last illusion, common to most underdeveloped countries, is that foreign enterprises link you in bondage to the foreigner; in this case, to England.  I suspect that this belief owes more to emotion than to reason, but the relations between the Republic and Britain do require little more thought, for at present they make the worst of both worlds.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Professor Carter then goes on to speak of monetary matters which bear no relation to the present legislation.  At a later point, the Professor put in a note on the preference for locally-owned business which he says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;apparently arises partly from a laudable patriotism, partly from a fear of foreign domination, partly from a belief that a foreign-owned business will not be conducted in accordance with Irish interests for instance that it will close down first in a slump.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He continues:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The patriotism is ill-founded until Ireland can show that she has enough good industrial managers of her own; the fear of foreign domination seems to me of little substance; the third belief is contrary to common sense and experience&mdash;it is the efficiency of a business which determines whether it will continue in a slump, not the site of its head office.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a sane view.</P>
    <P>What is the view promulgated here? I shall give some quotations from <Col N="554" /> speeches made by the Minister for Lands&mdash;who appears to be the Government's mouthpiece in regard to policy &mdash;the Minister for Education and the Tánaiste.  On the 23rd January of this year, the Minister for Lands told us that one of the necessities was to get capital from every source to invest in new industries and agriculture.  He then spoke of taxation.  Taxation was so high that anything which might increase it was to be deplored, such as, for example, granting new wages to the employees of Government, State personnel or local authority employees. The public would have to accept lower export prices for other commodities besides wheat.  Costs would have to come down and profits at a lower rate be accepted for commodities where only competitive drives for sales would succeed.  For many products greater sales at lower profits would add to the seller's income.</P>
    <P>Four days later, speaking at Mullingar, the Minister for Lands said that the country had to face a stern competitive struggle for export markets. Costs must be brought down, and, in the case of some commodities, sales increased to make a lower profit margin more remunerative.  The wages and salaries of all the community must be related to competitive selling. Extra costs of production had to be met and after a bit we might get our living standards increased, thus enabling production to be increased by modern methods.  That was to come later, he emphasised in the following month.  He also said in Mullingar that the success of the agricultural export drive depended on making marginal profits where necessary, on reducing costs and increasing yields.  On the whole, he contended that we have to sell more goods at lower prices.</P>
    <P>On 6th of February, speaking at Castledaly, County Westmeath, the Minister for Lands said it was impossible to make any declaration of policy on the amount of capital that could be raised until the whole financial position could be examined. As far as putting a date upon the period of modest living, as his colleague called it, he said about ten years were needed to ensure real <Col N="555" /> progress in expanding output.  It took time to build up confidence, find capital and secure new export markets. That is what the Minister now says is of extreme urgency to deal with the problem of unemployment.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education, speaking in Cork as reported on 18th February, 1958, said it had been contended that the wage increases recently given to many workers had not fully kept pace with the rise in the cost of living since the fifth round.  There was a necessity to offset the increases in wages by increased productivity.  The whole theme has been based on the increase in wages, whereas what has been sought through the Labour Court recently is to bring wages back to the level of what they were before they were cut by the taking away of subsidies by the last Government.  The Minister added with regard to the wages of local authorities that any increase would place extra demands on the ratepayers and that was going to bring down the whole country.  While everybody looked for a reduction in taxation, there seems to be no prospect of lowering taxation.  The prospects of holding it at its present level were not bright.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Lands said&mdash;and I am taking it out of chronological order because it seems to be the aim of all these speeches to build pressure up to this&mdash;at the annual meeting of the Wicklow Chamber of Commerce, that we would have to accept a more modest standard of living until production increased and laid down for that period a term of 20 years.  He said that Scotland was doing very badly with regard to emigration.  Apparently he was there recently because he wished to tell us about Scotland.  He added that capital was beginning to flow back into the undeveloped areas of the world because industrialists looked for more loyal and hardworking operators, and more reasonable costs of production.  The towns of Ireland offered suitable facilities for industries seeking exports to the British Commonwealth, Britain and Europe.  He went on to say that the best production might have to be reserved for export and that profits <Col N="556" /> on many exported commodities might yet have to come down in the new world.</P>
    <P>I take that as the climax of all the speeches which these two Ministers made, speaking for the Government, since last autumn.  They painted this as an undeveloped country because industrialists would look for more loyal and hardworking operatives here.  What does that mean?  In other well-developed industrial countries, the industrial organisations of the workers have kept pace with the development of business and when they see it advance to such a point where they can make demands on business, they do so successfully.  Here, having cut wages in accordance with the national agreement, the workers have to accept those lower wages and a more modest standard of living for the next 20 years, according to the Minister for Lands.  Both Ministers have emphasised the danger of increasing wages.  Right through their speeches, the emphasis is on the employee having to work harder and there is very little about the deficiency on the management side in all of its branches.</P>
    <P>I take it that Professor Carter represents a more humane view in these days than one would get from the speeches of these Ministers, who are apparently those who promote Government policy.  Speaking at a dinner of the Insurance Institute of Ireland, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, as reported in the Bulletin of the Department of External Affairs, stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We think that, with the European Free Trade area negotiations reaching their final stages, it is probable that United States industrialists are now giving consideration to the advisability of servicing the European market from plants located in European countries.  We aim to convince them that Ireland is the best possible location for such plants.  We have many and very weighty arguments to advance in support of that contention.  These include not merely the geographical advantages of this country, its attitude to private enterprise and the stability of its political <Col N="557" /> situation, but also the availability of intelligent and highly adaptable labour which has been shown capable, after training, of achieving productivity levels as high as in any other country.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If the Minister, mainly in touch with labour through his Department, thinks that we have achieved productivity levels as high as in any other country, why all this pleading about the necessity for higher work output from the employees and no emphasis on the necessity for better over-management?</P>
    <P>Elsewhere in his speech he went on to say that misunderstanding of the policy behind the Control of Manufactures Act, and of the general attitude to external investment in Ireland, had been fairly widespread.  It was now very important that this misunderstanding should be removed.  That was why proposals to amend that Act had been announced.  He added:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There was equal misunderstanding with perhaps even more seriously deterring effect, arising out of the retention of war-time price control and from some much publicised statements it was assumed that the official attitude was hostile to profits. Nobody will invest in Irish industrial development unless there is a prospect of profits commensurate with the risk involved.  We have dismantled that war-time price controlling mechanism completely and substituted on a permanent basis a very modified power of supervision, and we want it to be known generally that we regard the successful industry as the profitable one.  Protected industries supplying the home market only must expect that the way they meet their obligations, in return for protection, will still continue to be examined, but in the case of firms which go into export the more successful they are, and the more profits they make, the better we will like it. In the case of new export trade developments we have legislated to exempt these profits from taxation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Where is the truth?  Where is Government policy?  Is it this clamour for harder work?  Does harder work mean a longer working week?  Does it mean the same working week at less <Col N="558" /> wages?  There is an emphasis laid on productivity.  Is it now accepted that the only way one can get extra production is by having people develop more physical labour, either through longer hours or else through working overtime in order to bring their wages back to the old standard?  Is that it, or is the Tánaiste speaking the truth when he says our people have achieved productivity levels as high as any other country?</P>
    <P>The Minister for Lands tells us we shall have to look forward to 20 years of a more moderate living, that prices will have to come down, that profits will have to come down, and that dividends will have to be looked into and controlled.  Is that in line with the policy that boasted to the insurance companies that we had dismantled our war-time price control mechanism completely and substituted for it on a permanent basis a very modified power of supervision?  Is it to go out to the Americans that they are to come here with the inducement: &ldquo;You can make whatever profits you like and they will not be examined into curiously and you will get labour as good as anywhere else&rdquo;?  Or are they going to get the impression from these speeches, which represent in the main Government policy, that labour here is either idle or inefficient, that higher work for lower rates of pay is what is required in order to put this country on its feet?</P>
    <P>Last night, Deputy Booth could quote here what he thought a great tribute paid to this country.  It was a comment by O.E.E.C. that we had contracted purchasing power and a stern budgetary policy.  I am sure that would appeal to Deputy Booth as a businessman.  By a stern budgetary policy is meant, in effect, a cutting of wages.  That may be one way&mdash;it may be the only way&mdash;in which the business of this country will survive, but it is certainly not in the trend of modern development.  The idea of constricted purchasing power is completely out of the ordinary run of countries trying to develop themselves and trying to use either resources they have or can get from abroad.</P>
    <P>In another speech which the Tánaiste made at the Wexford Chamber of Commerce, <Col N="559" /> he said that capital generated within the country is not sufficient to finance the industrial expansion called for by the country's economic position. That note crept into the Tánaiste's speech to-day, that home capital is not adequate, that there is a shortage of capital at home.</P>
    <P>Let us get a declaration with regard to the £100,000,000 plan.  The <i>Irish Press</i> produced a supplement on the 12th October, 1955.  It was taken up by the other papers who spoke of this as the new plan for employment.  The <i>Irish Times</i> phrase about it was that it was a new Fianna Fáil five-year plan for full employment that would undertake a positive spending programme to be financed on a scale which would utilise the whole of the labour available and that the national income would have to be increased by £100,000,000 to bring full employment in five years.</P>
    <P>The <i>Irish Press</i> headlined it: &ldquo;Fianna Fáil's Aim Is Full Employment&rdquo; and in lower grades of headlines &ldquo;An increase of 100,000 jobs in five years&mdash;or an average rate of 20,000 jobs a year&mdash;would result in full employment here as normally understood and would mean the end of abnormal emigration.  This is the proposition on which Fianna Fáil bases its draft proposals for full employment.  The proposals were outlined last night by Mr. Seán Lemass when he addressed Comh-Chomhairle Atha Cliath.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Lands said on the 5th December that it was not a plan, that it was notes for discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Only a blueprint for discussion, not a plan.  It was promulgated as a plan on that occasion and the Tánaiste himself talked about it as a plan.  There were to be 100,000 jobs in five years, an average of 20,000 a year.  We have 86,000 people signing on at the moment.  We had better speed up that plan.  Are these 86,000 to remain while so many more come from school looking for gainful occupation year after year?  What is the tot going <Col N="560" /> to be if we cannot do anything except have a Vote of £220,000 to try to make some impression on unemployment, even after we have reduced wages, after we have had the peak period of emigration and after we have adopted what Deputy Booth thought so good&mdash; the firm budgetary policy which resulted in a contraction of purchasing power.  Will the Tánaiste tell us whether it is a plan that has gone awry or whether it is merely a blueprint, as the Minister for Lands called it?  What the distinction is I have not yet got him to explain.</P>
      <P>There is a receding, a back-pedalling, from the so-called plan.  Whether the plan was soundly conceived or not, there was one thing certain&mdash;the money was there and the capital was there. After giving all details about this five-year plan, how much the State investment had to be and how much private investment would be added to take the production of the State investment which could be ploughed back into getting further investment for further employment, the Tánaiste continued:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;There is no doubt that there is available to finance the proposed capital investment programme resources which are well in excess of the £100,000,000 which may be needed and which at present are being employed in a way which yields the minimum of national advantage. There is no need to entertain the idea of negotiating foreign loans to finance it or to anticipate difficulty in completing arrangements for the transfer of these resources as required. It must be emphasised, however, that it is an essential feature of these proposals that the whole of the additional investment expenditure to be undertaken by the Government must be financed without drawing on current savings.  The higher volume of savings which is anticipated must be forced to seek investment in private business.  The main purpose of these proposals is to bring about a continuing increase in investment activity in the private sector. Unless this is accomplished, the whole of the State investment programme proposed will have only a temporary effect.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="561" /> There it was, October, 1955.  More than the £100,000,000 that was required, and that could be got without drawing on current savings.  At an earlier stage the Tánaiste said that it was not to be achieved through taxation. There would be no extra taxation for capital and no drawing on current savings.  The whole plan meant the marching together into employment of the 100,000 men who were to get employment through State investment and another 10,000 or some fraction of the 100,000 who were to get jobs through private investment. The ordinary current savings had to be invested in the private sector and unless that was done the State investment programme would have only temporary effect.</P>
    <P>That is not so far away that the Tánaiste will not be able to recapture his imaginings of that period, or that he will not be able to tell us what his studies of that period were.  Let him admit that either his studies were badly balanced or that some factor in the plan has gone wrong.  Why has he passed the excuse to the Minister for Lands to say that there never was a plan, that there was only a blueprint?</P>
    <P>Many things in this plan could have been queried at the time.  There was guardianship against some of the difficulties but the aim was clear.  They wanted 20,000 new jobs a year.  If they had that for five years and got 100,000, which would have prevented abnormal emigration and heavy unemployment, then with all the private savings, we would have such a state of humming development here that there would no longer be any question about unemployment or emigration.  There would be no anxiety about the matter. The whole thing was to be done in five years.  The resources were there &mdash;more than enough to meet the situation.</P>
    <P>There is at the end of the programme a number of statements.  There was going to be a big difficulty for instance, if the full employment plan became a reality and people were fully employed. The trade union leaders would have to be attended to and made moderate any demands they might <Col N="562" /> make because of the conditions of full employment.  That danger was apprehended at the end of the document. There is always a fear that if the worker asked for further wages, it might mean that he would disemploy his colleagues.  We got into the acceptance of that about 1955 or 1956.  There was too much being paid to the workers; they were being over-paid.  It is the old slogan of the 1952 Budget that they were too well off and an arbitrary decision was taken to cut out the subsidies and reduce wages.</P>
    <P>You then stand at the point that any attempt by the worker to get back to his old position is regarded as an increase in wages, instead of his merely getting back to the position from which he was dislodged by the savagery of the two attempts to collapse his wages by the reduction of the subsidies in 1952 and the abolition of the subsidies altogether last year.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the Government policy is.  It is certainly not revealed in this proposed piece of legislation.  I do not know how far that is a real liberalising measure or how far it represents to the Irish people that what was done in 1932 was right. There is a special section dealing with those who come into this country. They are going to get all the advantages of freedom from the Control of Manufactures Acts and exemption from taxation by coming into this country at this late stage to relieve the situation brought about mainly by the ill-conceived policies operated for the past 25 years.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the brochure which the Minister said he is going to issue to see what explanation is given in relation to Section 3.  I want to find out if it is as liberal as I think it can be interpreted to be.  When the Minister brings in his brochure and is explaining Section 3 to the foreigners, will he be able to tell us if he furnished to those foreigners a copy of the Office Premises Act and the new prices legislation and point out to the foreigners that if an inspector asks any question in respect of their office premises, they are not bound to make any answer which will incriminate them and if any inspector goes in in relation <Col N="563" /> to the new modified structure of price control and inquires as to prices, at least there is no preclusion in the legislation of any questions that might tend to incriminate them?</P>
    <P>I shall be glad to see how far the Minister agrees with his colleague, the Minister for External Affairs, who, when questioned about his speech at U.N.O., said the Americans liked a man who talked to them in a straightforward fashion and indicated a strong policy and that they disliked sycophants, the sycophancy being, in the view of the Minister for External Affairs, the criticism directed from here to his speech.</P>

The Minister knows very well that the speech of the Minister for External Affairs lost us more support in America than anything since the Taoiseach tramped America in the 1920s and that is saying something because the comparison is a very odious one between them.  The performance of these two people was very bad and it was detrimental to this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>After the earlier pronouncements by the Minister for Industry and Commerce of his intention to introduce amendments to the Control of Manufactures Acts, I had thought that the Bill we would get would be a better type of Bill than that which is now presented to us.  As I see it, the Bill is an extremely difficult <Col N="564" /> Bill to understand.  It is seasoned, and well-seasoned, with all kinds of technicalities.  It looks to me to be the product of a mind which was confused. Undoubtedly, so far as the drafting of the provisions of this Bill are concerned, I thought Deputy McGilligan would have extended at least one compliment to this Bill, which he apparently omitted to do, that is, that this Bill is a lawyer's dream.</P>
      <P>Every lawyer in the country who sits down to look at this Bill will say: &ldquo;This is certainly going to be an improved source of income from the point of view of the interpretation of its sections.&rdquo;  If this Bill is not intended just as eyewash and if it is seriously intended to implement its provisions, I venture to say the lawyers will get, under this Bill, more briefs than they got under the Workman's Compensation Act which was intended to simplify the payment of compensation to injured workers.</P>
      <P>One of the things about the Control of Manufactures Acts of 1932 and 1934 was that not a single prosecution was ever instituted under them.  I do not believe there was a single prosecution. When I was in the Department of Industry and Commerce, I came across some notorious cases of evasion of the Act and, when I inquired, nobody could ever recollect anybody having been prosecuted under the Act because the Act was so full of loopholes that the Department and the Attorney-General never wanted to go into the courts.  The result was that you had in operation a Control of Manufactures Act or Acts designed to protect Irish industries, but side by side with the existence of the Act, you had the most notorious evasions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I came across one case of a firm here doing business in a very substantial way.  It is financed something like this: its capital is about £100; the parent firm outside the country gives it six months' credit on the raw materials which are supplied and the firm operating here gives three months' credit to its customers.  The parent firm owns the building which is not subject to control under the Control of Manufactures Act.  That is well known <Col N="565" /> in the Department of Industry and Commerce, but nobody wanted to prosecute because nobody believed they could get a conviction under the Act as it now stands.</P>
    <P>I came across another case where a group of people, mainly resident abroad, put up a building with their own finances.  They started a company with £500 capital.  They then lent this company £12,000, I think, at 12 per cent. and the company was functioning under the Control of Manufactures Act, believed to be complying with the Act.  The building was foreign-owned; it had a loan of £12,000 at 10 per cent. or 12 per cent. and the only capital in it was £500 of Irish capital, and that complied with the Control of Manufactures Act.</P>
    <P>Are these not clear cases of fraud and clear evidence of evasion?  It was known they were evading and they are still evading.  I venture to say there will be no prosecution of these firms under that Act, but the Minister now says there will be a tightening up on people who are not complying with the terms of the 1932 and 1934 Acts and says they will be compelled to comply with the law.  I wonder will they?  Is the Minister now telling us that all these cases of evasion will be dealt with?  Of course, they are well-known cases and the Department has a record of them; in any case, two or three solicitors in the city will give the Minister a list of cases in which the Control of Manufactures Act has been by-passed by devices which were permitted under the Act, and although these devices have been used since 1934, there has been no attempt to amend the Act to close the loopholes since 1934.</P>
    <P>It may well be&mdash;and this comment has been made to me&mdash;that action in the courts might establish that the Act itself is unconstitutional.  At all events, wherever the ghost or the bogey is, nobody wants to prosecute under the Control of Manufactures Act, with the result that there has been wholesale evasion.  The Minister knows this; so does the Department and the Attorney-General, and as I say a few solicitors in town could write a long thesis on the best means of getting <Col N="566" /> round the Act.  I think it is merely disrespectful to put two Acts on our Statute Book and sit down and see these Acts flagrantly violated, as has happened.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan rightly says the honest person who feels that to establish an industry here involves an acceptance of certain restrictions will probably take the view that he does not want to operate under these restrictions and when he is shown that there are loopholes, he will say: &ldquo;No, these are not my business methods.  I will not accept licences to operate under these conditions,&rdquo; with the result that a number of very slick gentlemen have been able to hire the best legal brains they can get and, with that aid, have been able to produce companies which are a travesty of what was intended under the Act.</P>
    <P>The Minister says he will tighten things up&mdash;well, we shall see whether he will or not.  I take that to mean that the Minister will go into the courts and compel compliance in all cases.  Will he do that in the case of firms established here for a long time, while he is at the same time allowing firms not yet here to come in and establish themselves for the purpose of using this country as a base for their exports?</P>
    <P>I confess I am puzzled about some sections in the Bill; perhaps we will get clarification on the Committee Stage.  Section 3 (2) (d) seems to me to be a curious compromise with what might be described as the impossible. In order to operate under Section 3 as an excluded company, it is necessary for the company to comply with certain conditions, and one of these is set out in Section 3 (2) (d).  It says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(d) that, of each class of shares carrying voting rights issued by it, not less than 50 per cent. have been made available primarily to Irish citizens or Irish companies which are managed and controlled in the State through being <i>bona fide</i> issued for public subscription in the State.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What does &ldquo;made available&rdquo; mean there?  Does it mean that the company must issue an announcement in <Col N="567" /> the papers saying their shares are available and that you can take these shares, if you pay their full value&mdash;or perhaps the shares will be issued at a premium&mdash;in one instalment within 48 hours after this notice appears?  Is that &ldquo;making available&rdquo;?  If so, then that interpretation could make a mockery of the whole section because shares could be made available on terms under which it would be utterly impossible to attract the interest of potential Irish shareholders.  It is hard enough to get our people interested in Irish equity, hard enough to attract attention to the Irish equity market instead of to the British equity market; but if there are to be shares subject to conditions which are much more onerous than those which normally apply, then, of course, this section could well be just a masquerade for permitting something to happen which is completely contrary to the spirit of the section as indicated by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Or is it possible for an external company to make shares available, as the section says, in the way I described, and having induced some people to subscribe, to repurchase the shares the following day?  It is not unknown that, for publicity purposes, certain people buy National Loan from time to time and have their names published in the papers; but they do not hold the National Loan too long as they flog it at the very first opportunity. They have got an advertisement out of it and that is that.</P>
    <P>Is it possible for an external firm of this kind to make shares available perhaps under onerous conditions and then to repurchase whatever limited number of shares has been bought by Irish subscribers?  Is it possible for them, having induced people to take up, say, 10 per cent., 15 per cent., or 20 per cent. of the shares in this company, to repurchase these shares, even at a premium?  Or can they get them back by going into the Stock Exchange and telling a stockbroker: &ldquo;Buy me such and such shares at such a price&rdquo;.  That would get back the shares bought under onerous conditions. Is it possible for a firm, having normally made shares available, <Col N="568" /> to repurchase these shares and then function on the basis of 100 per cent. foreign capital, and at the same time comply with the provisions of Section 3?</P>
    <P>I think the Minister's use of this phrase &ldquo;made available&rdquo; could be responsible for an unlimited number of court actions.  I do not know on what grounds a firm could be prosecuted under this sub-section because they can make the terms as onerous as they like and they can even offer the shares after they have made some gloomy prognostications as to the company's earning capacity.  I do not think the term &ldquo;made available&rdquo; in any way strengthens this section.  As I have said, it is further evidence that this Bill is a lawyer's dream.</P>
    <P>Many sections of the Control of Manufactures Acts have outlived their usefulness, particularly in the circumstances of 1958, and more especially having regard to our economic circumstances. Nevertheless, I believe the fear of the Acts was in fact more restrictive than the actual terms of the Acts.  The terms of the Control of Manufactures Acts immediately created in the minds of potential industrialists here a fear that they would be controlled, that they had to apply to somebody for permission to operate, that they were subject to a permit.  They rarely knew that the permit, once granted, could never be revoked.  They had all the time the feeling that to get a permit to operate under the Control of Manufactures Acts was a rather arduous legal exercise and that one had to be extremely careful in one's attitude in order to get it and extremely careful in one's conduct, once one had secured it.</P>
    <P>I do not think the licence to operate under the Control of Manufactures Act in fact carried any of the risks which inexperienced persons feared.  When I was in the Department of Industry and Commerce, I issued generously new manufacturing licences to anybody who came here to manufacture a commodity for export or to produce for the home market commodities at present being imported.  I made their issue as easy as possible.  I let it be known in the Department that I was anxious to avail <Col N="569" /> of any and every opportunity to attract people here for the purpose of producing commodities for export, or to supply the Irish market with goods which were not supplied here.</P>
    <P>If the Minister had left the Acts alone and had publicised the fact that these licences could be issued on terms which did not impose onerous conditions, he might in the long run have done a better job than is done by producing a Bill of this kind steeped in technicalities and bringing no clarity into legislation which is already clouded with legal and technical expressions. I think that would have been sufficient.  We could all have agreed with the idea of leaving the existing provisions there and not making them an object of political contention here, recognising that the urgent need is to establish industries to produce goods for export where existing industries are not capable of doing so.  Even there, there need be no competition, because, conceivably, the export market could be unlimited. One firm could export to one country, while at the same time we would be justified in allowing another firm to come in here to make goods to supply contacts which it could establish in other countries.  We could have a truce so far as the Control of Manufactures Act is concerned, instead of having discussions in this House.  We could have concentrated on publicising the willingness of the Government here to grant licences to persons who would come in here to produce for export or to supply for the home market goods not at present being manufactured here.  That would have been much better than to introduce a complex technical Bill of this kind, and, at the same time, would have been a guide to our attitude in the direction of a more liberal approach to the establishment of industries here.</P>
    <P>Instead of that, we are saying to potential industrialists: &ldquo;Come in and manufacture for export.  You do not need a licence or, if you comply with certain conditions, you can be an excluded company and you will be all right.&rdquo;  At the same time we are saying to people who are already operating here that so far as they are concerned, they have availed of the <Col N="570" /> Act for perhaps 26 years&mdash;that is the currency of the Control of Manufactures Act&mdash;and now we shall make them comply with the terms of the Act.  What is the need to stir up all that muddy water at this stage?  Let it rest for another few years, particularly until we get a clearer picture as to what the Free Trade Area will produce.  If the Minister had propagandised a more liberal approach to the granting of licences, he would have got all the effect he is striving to get by this Bill, without causing any of the difficulties which will arise in the interpretation of this Bill and in the implementation of the Act, if the Minister's speech to-day is an indication as to how the terms of the new Act will be implemented.</P>
    <P>One phrase in this Bill the significance of which has not been fully appreciated is contained in Section 4 (1) (a) which deals with restrictions on carrying on of manufacturing processes by companies.  It talks about a company carrying on business solely for export.  I do not know whether the phrase &ldquo;solely for export&rdquo; puts a strait-jacket on industrial development. There may be cases where a firm does 95 per cent. of its business for export, but which might find it necessary, for good reason, to sell 5 per cent. of its products on the home market.  If, in order to be excluded, it is obliged to export the entire of its product, does it transgress this Bill if it supplies 1 to 5 per cent. on the home market?</P>
    <P>I had a case in the Department of Industry and Commerce of a person who was allowed to bring in certain raw materials, on the grounds that the finished article was exported.  This person was making a commodity which had to be farmed out for processing. In the course of the farming out, some of the material might occasionally suffer a blemish; the pattern might not be in accordance with the desires of the manufacturer or of the customer. This manufacturer said to me: &ldquo;If you or the Department insist that I must export processed goods equivalent to the raw material which I import, I can do either of two things: I can destroy a certain quantity of goods which are perfect, but which <Col N="571" /> are not in accordance with my customers' requirements, or I can sell these goods on a foreign market where I do not want to sell them because they are not up to standard and I would prefer not to tarnish my name or the name of Irish industry by sending out an article that is somewhat substandard.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It would be insane to tell the man to destroy his goods but, if he did not, he had to pay duty on the imported raw material.  It would be unwise to tell him to export it, no matter what the results.  I gave him a permit to sell that kind of stuff on the home market.  I think that was a wise decision. Can he do the same, if he is engaged on the export market, under this particular Bill?  In any case, the full significance of compelling 100 per cent. export as the condition of the granting of a licence may well be an unwise decision in the long run.  Every country recognises that, in order to have a good export market, you must necessarily have a stable market at home, a market in which you can pretty well regulate your prices, a market in which you are not subject to the fierce competition of the export market and a market in which it might be desirable to sell your goods at particular times at a lower price rather than take the still lower price on the export market.  There ought to be some flexibility, even though it might be utilised only in circumstances where the reasons for so doing were compelling from an economic point of view.</P>
    <P>Another reason why I think a Bill in these terms is a mistake at present is the possible impact it may have on our economy as a result of the emergence of the Free Trade Area.  Our hopes in that respect seem to be built on the possibility that we can induce people to come in here and manufacture goods for the export market&mdash;in other words, for the Free Trade Area.  We are on the perimeter of the Free Trade Area. If somebody wants to manufacture goods for the Free Trade Area it may well be that such person will feel that the goods ought to be manufactured where the customers are in the greatest profusion, and therefore, that he <Col N="572" /> ought to manufacture these goods somewhere in the heart of Europe.</P>
    <P>It may be pleaded that we have some advantages.  What are the advantages? We have the definite disadvantage of long haul both of raw materials, if necessary, and in respect of the export of the commodity.  According to the Minister for Lands, we have one advantage, namely, that Irish sweat is cheap and, therefore, that if you come here you can buy sweat cheaper than in any other country in Europe.  That, he says, is particularly so in rural areas.  How long will it remain so, if we get an industry in those areas? One of the natural things to happen, following the establishment of an industry, is that the wage standards will be built up and that new wage levels will be established comparable to those in a similar industry on the eastern seaboard or elsewhere.  It is unwise to gamble heavily, at all events, on the idea that you can sell the potentialities of this country to foreign industrialists on the basis that sweat is cheap in Ireland.</P>
    <P>It is a fact that if we are in the Free Trade Area a lot of these folks who will be in industries in the countries comprising the Free Trade Area will be entitled to export their commodities to this country without any tariff whatever and that it will take a good deal of persuasion to induce industrialists to establish new industries here.  However, I am in favour of doing everything possible to induce them to do it.  I am in favour of capitalising on every inducement we have to offer in order to get outside industrialists to come here and manufacture for export and, at the same time, supply the requirements of the home market which are at present imported.  It is very much better to bring in outside capital to produce goods to supply our home market, where the market is not being supplied at present, and to produce goods for export than to allow the present appalling condition to continue of thousands of our men and women emigrating to other countries where industries have been established.</P>
    <P>The situation in respect of industrial development is by no means easy.  I want to make no capital out of a discussion <Col N="573" /> on a Bill of this kind.  The Minister might have short-circuited the whole procedure by leaving the Bill alone and concentrating the emphasis on the fact that we are giving something away, that we will make it easy for people who will come in and manufacture for export.  It would have been better to concentrate on the fact that those people will be welcome and that every facility will be given to them&mdash; that they will not be taken and passed through all the labyrinthine procedures associated with the Control of Manufactures Acts but that, instead, everything will be done for them.  That would be a better line of propaganda than this Bill.</P>
    <P>This Bill starts a new witch hunt as to who is complying with the Control of Manufactures Acts and who is not. Presumably that will happen at the same time as we are inviting foreigners to come in here to establish industries for export purposes.  The two things seem to me to be somewhat inconsistent. While I support this Bill simply because any improvement in the Control of Manufactures Acts is desirable, nevertheless, I think the Minister would have got a better effect by leaving the Bill alone and using his executive and administrative powers and the departmental and governmental propaganda machine to show that there are now advantages in Ireland which foreign industrialists had not seen before or had not been permitted to see adequately up to now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is about 26 years too late.  It is designed mainly to attract outside capital and foreign technique for the purpose of establishing industries here.  I say that I consider this Bill too late because at the moment the establishment of a Free Trade Area is contemplated.  If it is decided to participate in the Free Trade Area then industries, especially where there is freedom of movement so far as customs are concerned, will be located mainly close to the place where the goods produced will be sold.  I cannot visualise the production of goods here which will have to be transported 500 or 1,000 miles to the place of sale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Control of Manufactures Act, 1932, was harmful to the country inasmuch as it was designed to prevent <Col N="574" /> the investment of outside capital in the establishment of industries and to make it impossible for persons outside this country to engage in the building-up of our industries.  The result was that advantage was taken by a number of slick operators, in defiance of the Control of Manufactures Act, 1932.  These industries were built up mainly at the expense of the consuming public.  They were built up at the expense of people who availed of the goods manufactured in our factories according to the provisions of the Control of Manufactures Act and with the special advantage of not having the competition of foreign techniques where there was a tradition which would enable various classes of goods to be produced at a fair price to the consumer.  The result was that the consumer had to contribute very heavily and dearly towards the building-up of these industries.</P>
    <P>We now have a situation where we have reached saturation point in the production of various classes of goods and must seek a market outside.  We find it difficult to obtain that market outside owing to the manner in which the industry has been built up.  It was not built up on a good technical tradition, which would have been available but for the Control of Manufactures Act, 1932, which kept the outside technicians away.</P>
    <P>Above all, I feel that if we had outside capital available in the early years of the industrial period we could have built up more rapidly a greater number of efficient industries, which would have brought great advantage to the consumers in the matter of price levels and the quality of goods.  Instead of that, over the years, Irish consumers were compelled, by reason of the protection afforded by the Control of Manufactures Act, to pay very dearly for the building-up of those industries.</P>
    <P>This Bill is just about late.  When a decision is made, and if it is decided to participate in the Free Trade Area, by reason of our small population and limited marketing opportunities we will be unable to compete in the manufacture of goods here, when the question is taken into account of transporting those goods to markets where <Col N="575" /> there are larger populations.  Instead, the Minister ought to clean up the 1932 Act, for a start; even at this stage, he would be doing a good job for the Irish consuming public.</P>
    <P>Although I feel that the Bill is late now, I am in favour of attracting outside capital and modern techniques for the improvement of the production of industrial goods here.  However, when the emphasis is on export in connection with this Bill, I feel we will not get from its provisions what is hoped for, that is, an expanding export market for the goods produced here.</P>
    <P>It is welcome to have from the Minister the obvious change of heart about outside capital and foreign technicians for our industries.  It is regrettable he did not take that view when he was bringing in the original Act in 1932.  That Act has done a considerable amount of harm to the Irish consuming public and to the building up of our industries.  Those industries would have been better built had the Minister adopted at that time the attitude which he is adopting now, in relation to the attraction of foreign capital to this country.</P>

      <P>I am a collector of historical curiosities.  Is it not interesting that the &ldquo;Blueprint for Prosperity&rdquo; of 1953 was issued by the Fine Gael Party a year before they came back into office?  It is surprising that it was forgotten all about immediately after it was published.  A quotation which Deputy McGilligan read from it related to the Control of Manufactures Act.  He gave us the text of a speech <Col N="576" /> made by Deputy Costello on the need for a revision of the Act.  Why did they not revise it?  If the need existed in 1953, surely the opportunity of revising it presented itself to him on many occasions since then?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>On the contrary, shortly after the change of Government in 1954, I myself urged a revision of the Act, and, indeed, on two or three occasions I published my views as to the form that its amendment might take.  Therefore, they were well aware that proposals of that character would be not merely acceptable but supported&mdash;and I helped them on by trying to give them a few ideas on what to do.  It was a waste of time, I agree.</P>
      <P>Deputy McGilligan spoke of the policy of the Fine Gael Party on this Bill.  Frankly, I do not know what it is.  If he was trying to inform the Deputies behind him as to what line to take, it is no wonder they are not speaking on it, because I am sure they are as much in the dark as to his attitude to the Bill as I am.  In so far as I followed him at all, he was arguing in favour of allowing industrial development by means of branch factories. He quoted Professor Carter of Belfast &mdash;with whom I have had some recent associations&mdash;in a recent article dealing with conditions here.  Professor Carter does not have to come down here to study this problem, because it is a form of development which has been promoted rather energetically in the part of the country where he resides; and I have good reason to know of the wide anxieties which are entertained there by business people as to what the consequences of that development could be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is common sense to assume that a branch factory of a large parent firm whose headquarters is located in some other country will always be regarded as a marginal unit, one which will be fully employed only when trade is booming and which will be the first to be cut off when trade tends to get slack.  That was one of the considerations <Col N="577" /> why, in 1932 and 1934, when we were starting the industrial drive here, we decided deliberately not to encourage that type of development.  We knew that through the operation of protective tariffs we could force that development.  It was obvious that we could get progress more rapidly if we were prepared to go on that line than by relying on building up the confidence of Irish investors and encouraging the formation of Irish companies to undertake it.</P>
    <P>Quite deliberately, we decided against branch factory development because we realised it was an unhealthy type of development, one which would give no guarantee of permanency, which would be limited in its scope to the minimum that was required by the tariffs in operation and which never would, in any circumstances, give this country the possibility of export trade. One of the conditions I regard as essential to this Bill by which freedom is being given to foreign participation in Irish industry, is the condition that only companies will be encouraged which are established here, which are managed and controlled here, which are Irish units in the sense that they are separate undertakings which will be able to frame their own policies and promote their own development.</P>
    <P>The second condition is that export trade should be a main purpose.  I think we have gone a considerable distance towards the liberalisation of the Act by the provisions we are proposing here.  I confess I am surprised by the speeches I have heard because when we had a preliminary canter on this question last November both the spokesman for Fine Gael and Deputy Norton expressed views which seemed to me to convey the idea of repealing the Control of Manufactures Act.</P>
    <P>Now I gather there has been a change of mind in this regard.  I do not think it would be wise to repeal the Act altogether.  While the inducement that would give to external participation in the development of Irish industry would not be very much increased, the danger of discouraging local investment in Irish industry would be considerable.  It is probably true to say that a large part of <Col N="578" /> our industrial progress in the future as in the past will be the result of Irish enterprise.  That is certainly true as far as new production for the home market is involved or as far as development intended to meet any increase in home market demands may be concerned.  It is in the matter of new export trade developments where special techniques are required and where established market contacts are of assistance that we have to rely to a very great extent on our efforts to attract external participation.</P>
    <P>Many of the points raised on the Bill were matters for discussion on Committee Stage rather than on the Second Reading of the Bill, and I perhaps could leave them over for discussion then.  I was rather surprised, however, by Deputy McGilligan's speech and by his suggestion that instead of seeking to protect the position of firms which were established in the past against the danger of being subjected on the home market to the competition of branch factories by the retention of the Control of Manufactures Act, we should do so by an extension of the reserve commodity licence procedure.  I have a very vivid recollection of violent debate in the Dáil on the one attempt I did make to give a reserved commodity licence in respect of a Westport factory.  Arising from that experience I never attempted to do so again because it is quite possible that similar charges and allegations would be associated with any policy aimed at extending that procedure to cover industries of a different character already established and distributed generally throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I do not know that it is a matter for apology by me that my Party may have asked industrialists for subscriptions to Party funds during election time because of the protection these industries may have received, but I would hate to have on my conscience that at any time I subscribed to a circular, as Deputy McGilligan did, to agents of importing firms on the assurance that these industries would never be protected.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is necessary at this stage to discuss many of the points made.  Deputy Norton has some misunderstanding <Col N="579" /> which I hope I shall be able to clear up for him on the Committee Stage.  I should like now, however, to say that he obviously is attaching far too much importance to the few clauses in the Bill designed to tighten up the provisions of the existing Acts.  He attaches far greater importance to that matter than I do. I am not quite clear what he had in mind in that regard because he gave examples of the type of evasions which were successfully attempted and said that it was detrimental to the interests of the State that legislation should remain on the Statute Book which permitted such evasions, and he argued, in conclusion, that we should not change the Act at all, that in so far as we wanted to facilitate the establishment of industries with the aid of external capital we should rely entirely upon the Control of Manufactures Act licence procedure.</P>
    <P>I do not think that is a good procedure. I am not saying that it has operated to prevent the establishment of any undertaking, the promoters of which could not qualify under the Control of Manufactures Act but who had decided in any event to go ahead with their proposals.  Experience has shown, however, that there is wide reluctance on the part of industrial promoters to submit themselves to the requirement of Government licence procedure and to give all the information which is usually sought when such an application is under consideration.</P>
    <P>Indeed there was a report some years ago by O.E.E.C. on impediments to American investment in Europe which pin-pointed that particular impediment&mdash;the requirement by most European Governments of holding a Government licence.  That impediment was listed very highly among the factors which were operating to discourage American industrialists from investing in the European field.  There are other objections in that regard which have arisen from our own experience.</P>
    <P>May I mention an instance which occurred very recently?  I had negotiations with representatives of an external firm of very considerable <Col N="580" /> importance in the world markets who were thinking of starting some developments in this country.  They were proposing to start on a small scale with one line and, at a later period, to go into other lines.  The question of their status was one of the matters that arose during the negotiations.  I told them I would give them a manufacturing licence for the line that was proposed at that time and that the licence could be amended at any time they required it so amended so as to get into the other lines.  Alternatively, I told them, I would give them a licence then covering all the items that they might manufacture later.  They told me they were going to establish a £100 company.  I was astonished, looking upon it as a device to evade the Act.  I asked what advantage they hoped to gain from that procedure.  It was this: that they did not have to announce then their intention to consider subsequent developments at a later stage.  On the other hand they did not want to be subject to the need to make application for an amendment of their licence if they decided to go on with further development and they felt they would have much more freedom if they put themselves outside the Control of Manufactures Act.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to meet entirely a case like theirs and this Bill does not do so.  While such a case might be met under the Bill by an exemption certificate, it would still be necessary to give a description of the commodity and a time-table; a description of the commodity so that the intentions of the company would be clarified, and a time-table to prevent a situation arising where a firm would get an option to engage in industrial work with which they might not get on at all, but where the existence of such an option would be a discouragement to others intending to get into the same lines of goods.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton seemed to think I have now in mind what he called a witch hunt, that is going back to the companies which were successfully established in the past by methods which amounted to evasion of the Control of Manufactures Act and prosecuting them.  I have no such idea <Col N="581" /> in mind.  This Bill does not provide for that.  This Bill does stipulate certain conditions with which companies must conform to be entitled to manufacture without licence or some other permission under the Act.  One of these is that it must have a share capital liability related to its fixed assets.  That was, of course, the main method of evasion&mdash;where the share capital liability had no relationship at all to the actual capital employed in the undertaking.</P>
    <P>So far as this Bill is concerned that will become a condition which must be met within a year's time or, in certain cases, within a longer period.  Any question as to whether in fact it is being observed is one for the courts, not for the Department of Industry and Commerce.  Indeed one of the purposes of this Bill is to keep the Department of Industry and Commerce out of the picture as much as it is possible to do so.  A company that meets the requirements about export trade only or offering shares for subscription to the Irish public need not go near the Department of Industry and Commerce at all.  Provided it conforms to the provisions laid down there it can undertake any manufacturing business it likes and does not have to go near Kildare Street or seek any permission, authority, or licence from Kildare Street.</P>
    <P>In the case of the companies which are not financed in that way, then if they are unable to comply with the normal conditions which entitle them to operate in any industry without a licence they have to get authority, but they will get that authority in a manner which will ensure them against any subsequent interference.  A certificate of exemption once given is irrevocable and there can be no question of their being subject to further investigation by the Department.  If there is any question of whether they are complying with the requirements of the certificate it will be entirely a matter for the courts to determine.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton was worried about the provision concerning the issue of shares and he seemed to think that it would be possible for a company to appear to comply with that condition <Col N="582" /> in some fictitious way which would not represent a <i>bona fide</i> offer of shares to the public at all.  That is precisely the point I mentioned which delayed the completion of the drafting of the Bill.  The draftsman was asked for a suitable provision and he produced a number of restrictions and safeguards which, while completely effective for the purpose, were so intimidating in their aspect that they could lead to a complete misunderstanding of our intentions in the Bill.  We sought and got this alternative device of bringing in the committees of the Stock Exchanges and they agreed to cooperate in this matter.</P>
    <P>Any company which claims to have fulfilled that condition to have made a <i>bona fide</i> offer of shares to the Irish public and which has not merely made the offer but made the shares available to any Irish subscriber to them can go to the committee of the Stock Exchange and ask for a quotation.  If the Stock Exchange are satisfied of the <i>bona fides</i> of the offer they can give a quotation and the company, having got the quotation, is now in the clear and cannot subsequently be questioned regarding any transaction in which it has been involved up to that.</P>
    <P>I gather that the general intention is to let the Bill get through its Second Reading so that we can deal with it in Committee.  As I have already made clear, I am not approaching the Committee Stage of this Bill with a closed mind.  I think it is necessary that we would have some legislation of this kind in force for the time being. I indicated that arising out of the European Free Trade Area Agreement there might be need to examine it further because we might under that agreement, if we adhere to it, accept obligations which will in some way conflict with the provisions of this Bill. However, until some external pressure of that kind requires its re-examination I think we should have an Act of this character on the Statute Books.  We are morally bound to preserve some of the safeguards imposed by the original Act under which a number of Irish companies were promoted and to which Irish people subscribed.</P>
    <P>It is only in respect of industrial export possibilities that we should <Col N="583" /> think of liberalising these provisions and we should try to make these provisions as liberal as possible while at the same time maintaining a minimum of safeguards for the firms which are already established in our home market, and indeed we should aim at continuing the policy of favouring Irish controlled enterprises where home market sales alone are involved. Then we should, as we are amending the Control of Manufactures Act, take cognisance of the evasions which have been successfully attempted and while not attempting to go back over the past, make sure these evasions, if not impossible, will be at least less easy in the future.</P>
    <P>Within the limit of those general considerations I am quite prepared to consider any suggestions related to the sections of the Bill and I would welcome the help of Deputies in making these sections as effective as they can be.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands if he will state the location, acreage, and year of acquisition, of all lands in the possession of the Land Commission in County Mayo; whether schemes have been prepared by the Land Commision for the division of these lands; and when it is proposed to carry out these schemes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>A comprehensive reply to a question of this kind in relation to such a large and active county as Mayo would necessitate considerable investigation and labour and it is not practicable at present to divert staff for such a purpose. Broadly speaking, however, the position is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Including untenanted land on estates of the former Congested Districts Board, the Land Commission have on hands an arable area of 5,500 acres situated in various districts throughout County Mayo.  In addition, there are on hands some 13,500 acres of bog, rough grazing, woods and waste, largely comprising residues of allotted estates and generally very difficult to dispose of.  Though some of the properties came on hands prior to 1950, the bulk of the arable lands passed into possession of the Land Commission only in recent years and consists of the vacated holdings of migrants who have been transferred to the midlands: in the main these surrendered lands will be devoted to curing the rundale problem in the county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="592" /> It would not be possible at present to indicate when all lands on hands can be allotted but every effort is being made to secure the early disposal of at least the arable area.  Over 2,000 acres have already been allotted in County Mayo this year and I am hopeful that the total allotment in the county for the current financial year will reach 4,000 acres.</P>

      <P>Land Commission records are not kept on a constituency basis.  In the North Mayo district, however, proceedings have been instituted for the acquisition or resumption of 52 estates comprising 3,414 acres and, in addition, negotiations are in progress for the voluntary purchase of ten estates comprising 430 acres.  Due to the uncertainty in the outcome of acquisition and purchase proceedings, it is not possible to forecast what holdings may become available for the relief of congestion in a particular year.  Furthermore, in the case of voluntary purchases, it would be a breach of confidence if the Land Commission were to disclose details in advance.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if he will state the number of applicants awaiting the provision of telephone service on the last convenient date, and the approximate average period for which they (a) have been waiting on that date, and (b) will still have to wait for such service.</P>

      <P>The number of applicants awaiting telephone service on the 31st January, 1958, was 3,242, of whom 1,348 are currently being provided with telephones.  The remaining 1,894 applicants have been waiting about eight months on average and will have to wait an estimated 12 months more, on average, before being provided with service.</P>
      <P>In considering average figures of this kind, it needs to be borne in mind that the connection of subscribers, including &ldquo;removals,&rdquo; to the telephone system is currently running at a rate in excess of 700 a month and that it is only a proportion of applications that suffer delay.</P>
