      <P>As the Deputy is aware, a special committee was set up some two years ago to advise the Government on various matters in connection with the peaceful uses of atomic energy.

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether there are any proposals regarding the establishment of a free port in the Shannon estuary at present under consideration in his Department; and if he will indicate the nature of such proposals and make a statement.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>No firm proposals for the establishment of a free port in the Shannon estuary are under consideration in my Department, but representations have been made to me that the State should meet the cost of an engineering and economic survey to assess the potentialities of the area as a site for a free port for shipping.</P>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the answers given to questions on this subject in Dáil Éireann on 19th June and 4th December of last year.  I referred then to the fact that the question of establishing a free port in this country had been considered by the Ports and Harbours Tribunal, 1930, and again by an inter-departmental committee in 1945.  It emerged from these investigations that the cost of providing and maintaining the facilities which would be necessary would be very substantial and inquiries made both at home and abroad suggested that the extent to which they might be utilised was highly problematical. I said I had no reason to believe that the situation had since altered in any important respect and that still remains the position.</P>
      <P>I can only repeat that before considering any contribution from public funds towards the cost of establishing a free port or undertaking a preliminary survey I would require to be furnished with convincing evidence that commercial interests were willing to contract to use the proposed free port facilities to an extent which would justify the expenditure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether wheaten flour and/or wheaten meal was imported in 1957; and, if so, if he will state the total amount, cost and purpose of such imports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Imports of wheaten flour in 1957 amounted to 782 tons approximately valued at £27,424. There were no imports of wheaten meal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from some biscuit flour brought in as an exceptional matter, <Col N="4" /> under a temporary arrangement, towards the end of the year, this flour was imported by manufacturers of cakes, biscuits, and certain other food products for use exclusively in their export business.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister think it advisable to bring in flour when we have a surplus of native wheat at the present time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I said the flour was imported by certain manufacturers for use exclusively in the production of goods for export.  Unless the flour was available at world prices, quite obviously the export business would not result and therefore there would be no gain to Irish wheat producers.</P>

    <Title>Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Flour for Biscuit Manufacture.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce what quantity of flour for biscuit manufacture at animal feed price is to be issued in the financial year 1958-59 to biscuit manufacturers; and what is the differential per sack in price between the normal price of such flour and the special price to be charged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Wheat for the production of biscuit flour is issued to millers at the animal feed price on the basis of one barrel of native wheat for each sack of flour supplied to a biscuit manufacturer.  The flour requirements of biscuit manufacturers amount to about 70,000 sacks a year, so that, on the assumption that the arrangement remains in force throughout the financial year 1958-59, about 8,750 tons of native wheat would be utilised in this way.</P>
      <P>The price to be paid for biscuit flour is a matter for negotiation on a competitive basis between the biscuit manufacturers and the millers from whom the flour is purchased, so that it is not possible to indicate precisely the differential per sack in price between the normal price of such flour and the price at which it is supplied by any particular miller, but normally it would be of the order of 20/- to 30/- per sack.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="5" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I to understand from the Minister's reply, on the assumption that the price is between £1 and 30/- per sack, that this proviso means an annual subsidy to biscuit manufacturers of between £70,000 and £100,000 per annum?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will understand that biscuit manufacturers cannot be given any increased protection against imports from abroad.  The rate of duty upon biscuits, which is a very low rate of duty, is fixed under the Trade Agreement with Great Britain and cannot be changed.  Therefore, unless they can get flour at the same price as their competitors abroad, the result will be an importation of biscuits and a loss of market for native wheat producers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true to say then that we contemplate by this device an annual subsidy to biscuit manufacturers here of something between £70,000 and £100,000 per annum?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but the word &ldquo;subsidy&rdquo; is clearly misleading. Biscuit manufacturers get their flour at this price and sell their biscuits at that price.  There is no question of subsidy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I understand that the Minister proposes to control the price of biscuits?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>As I explained, if the price of biscuits goes higher than the price of imported biscuits, the imported biscuits will be used.  Therefore, the price of biscuits is not subsidised in that sense.  It is merely that the price of flour is related to the price at which biscuit producers in other countries can get flour.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state whether Bord Fáilte Éireann are empowered to make grants available to local authorities for the purpose of improving tourist amenities, etc., or whether such grants are made available as a result of representations made by the Irish Tourist Association.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Bord Fáilte Éireann is empowered by statute to make grants to local authorities for the provision, extension or improvement of tourist facilities and amenities.  The exercise of this power is entirely within the discretion of the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say if a local authority fails to subscribe to the I.T.A., whether that will have any adverse effect as far as the local authority is concerned in connection with proposals for improvement purposes to be paid for by An Bord Fáilte?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not say that. The Deputy understands that Bord Fáilte gets a sum of money by way of a grant-in-aid, the apportionment of which for different purposes is entirely at its discretion.  I could not say what factors the board takes into consideration when deciding on applications of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it a fact that if a local authority fails to subscribe to the I.T.A., that may very well mean that the local authority is precluded from getting grants for amenities from Bord Fáilte?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that over 50 men were laid off by Irish Steel, Ltd., Haulbowline, last week, and that there is grave danger of a further lay-off in the near future; and whether it is intended to proceed now with the erection of the sheet mill so as to provide alternative employment, as there is a big demand for Irish corrugated iron.</P>

I have been assured that every effort has been made, and continues to be made, to get business, so as to minimise the disemployment arising from this cause.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether the present slump in world shipping freight traffic is having an adverse effect on Irish Shipping, Limited, and, if so, whether, instead of the present practical monopoly being exercised by foreign shipping steps will be taken to utilise ships which may become idle as <Col N="8" /> a result of this slump for direct travel between Irish and foreign ports.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The fall in shipping freight rates has affected Irish Shipping, Limited, in common with shipowners throughout the world.</P>
      <P>What the Deputy may have in mind in the second part of his question is not very clear but it is to be assumed that the company will examine any practicable possibilities of utilising their ships wherever cargo offers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that our increasing export trade demands the use of ships and would it not be more desirable under the circumstances to utilise Irish ships for direct contact with foreign ports rather than have the Irish ships laid up in port at the moment while the traffic is carried by cross-Channel shipping concerns?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>

It was to the committee that the application mentioned to the Deputy was made.</P>
      <P>The committee has made a rule setting out the ratio of apprentices to skilled workers in this trade and unless this ratio is observed permission is not given by the committee for the employment of an additional apprentice. Fresh legislation would not be required to effect an amendment of a rule of this kind; but the initiative in promoting an amendment would have to come from the apprenticeship committee.</P>

      <P>A return furnished by the Dublin Corporation shows that on Saturday the 2nd March, 1957, there were 80 members of the permanent staff and 80 members of the temporary staff of the James Connolly Memorial Hospital resident in this institution.</P>
      <P>The corresponding figures shown for Saturday the 9th March, 1957, were 80 and 81 respectively.</P>
      <P>Five permanent members and one temporary member of the resident staff were absent on sick leave on the 2nd March, 1957.  On the 9th March, 1957, six permanent members and two temporary members of the resident staff were absent on sick leave and one permanent member of that staff was absent on annual leave.</P>
      <P>The total numbers of persons, indoor and outdoor, employed at the institution on the 2nd March, 1957, and on the 9th March, 1957, were respectively 261 and 264.</P>

      <P>The cost of building the regional sanatorium near Blanchardstown, including the cost of site development, has not yet been ascertained finally, but is estimated at £1,919,000.</P>
      <P>The sanatorium provides accommodation for a total of 520 beds.</P>
      <P>The maximum number of beds actually provided for the treatment of T.B. patients is 492.  In addition 28 beds have been provided for the treatment of non-T.B. patients.</P>
      <P>The number of beds occupied, as at 31st March, 1958, was 447, made up of 422 T.B. and 25 non-T.B. beds.</P>
      <P>It is expected, however, that following the further rationalisation of T.B. accommodation, all the beds in this institution will be occupied in the relatively near future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health whether insured workers and their families are entitled to free doctors, and/or specialist treatment, if they occupy a public ward in a hospital; whether he is aware that doctors have charged and are charging such workers and their dependents in certain instances; and what action he proposes to take in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The capitation charge payable by health authorities to hospitals for the maintenance and treatment in public wards of persons insured under the Social Welfare Acts and for the dependents of such persons, whether it is the full normal capitation charge in respect of patients sent in (or deemed to have been sent in) by the health authority or the full capitation charge reduced by 10/- a day in respect of Section 25 cases, covers all services provided in the hospitals by the medical staffs of the hospitals and they are not entitled to charge fees to such patients for their services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not aware that in general the medical staffs of hospitals have charged and are charging fees in such cases, but if the Deputy will furnish me with particulars of specific cases in which it is contended that fees have been charged irregularly, I shall have them investigated.  In the meantime I shall consider what further steps I can usefully take with a view to making eligible persons aware of the facilities <Col N="15" /> and services to which they are entitled under the Health Acts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that insured workers are not fully cognisant of the rights they enjoy under the Health Act and that there should be more publicity than there has already been?  Is he further aware that this charging by the medical profession to insured workers is rampant throughout the whole country?  Is he further aware that only last night the Limerick City Manager reported to the Limerick City Council that in a case referred back to him by the Minister for Health for his attention the doctor who had charged fees, and fairly substantial fees, to an insured worker refused to refund those fees?

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the series of supplementary questions which the Deputy has put is more than I can digest in the second or two in which he has presented them to me.  So far as the third part of the question is concerned, I am not aware of the position as he has stated it, because I could not, having regard to the limitations upon the transmission of knowledge, have any information in relation to it.  But, in regard to the first and second parts of the supplementary question, I think there may be some misunderstanding as to the rights of insured persons under the Health Act, so that it may be that some people are taking advantage of the fact that this knowledge is not as widespread as it ought to be.  On the other hand, it is very difficult to see what more we can do to publicise the fact that insured persons who occupy beds in public wards are not to be charged anything over and above what is paid on their behalf by the local authority.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Arising out of misunderstandings among the Italian public and Press, it is necessary to explain that Belfast is the principal city of the Six Counties which constitute so-called Northern Ireland, still held by Britain against the will of the great majority of the people in the whole island of Ireland.  The team which played against Italy yesterday is, therefore, representative only of the six counties of Ireland divided from the remaining twenty-six counties which make up the rest of the country.</P>
      <P>Apart from this fact, I can say that all Ireland regrets very much the incidents which took place yesterday in Belfast on Irish territory.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister think it reasonable and equitable that a number of officers, including some well placed officers, should be given pay for two years so as to enable them to rehabilitate themselves on discharge from the Army, whilst no consideration whatever of a similar character is extended to N.C.O.s and men who have given a very considerable period of service in the Army?</P>

    <Col N="35" />
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>These officers were not given two years' full pay to enable them to rehabilitate themselves.  The fact was that the previous Government had given these officers a two years' extension of service.  When I came in, I decided that, in order to restore the position of their fellow officers, this should be taken away from them.  It was subsequently decided that they should be given the two years' supplementary retired pay in lieu of the extension of service which had been granted to them previously.  As I said, that does not arise in this case, as no extended service has been taken away from the N.C.O.s and men referred to in the question raised by Deputy Norton.  They are retiring on the completion of their engagement. There is no comparison between the two situations.</P>

A change of Government took place and a change of policy also took place.  Seeing that the Minister did interfere with the arrangements made by the outgoing Government and introduced something which was of substantial benefit to the officer class, would he not now consider making some contribution towards the rehabilitation of these N.C.O.s and men now discharged after long service in the Army?</P>

When I came into the Department of Defence, the only provision made for these men was 21 days' pre-discharge leave.  Now, after 21 years' service, an N.C.O. or man gets 91 days' special pre-discharge leave; a man with 12 to 21 years' service gets 56 days; and a man with 2 to 12 years' service gets 28 days.

      <P>In page 10, line 6, before &ldquo;shall&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;established after the date of the passing of this Act&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am not at all clear what the Minister had in mind in this Schedule.  It seems to me we are going back to the old story we had so much discussion over earlier, that is, the position between 1934 and the present time.  The appointed date will be fixed by the Minister.  I am not clear why the position arises there in respect of the first anniversary and not after the passing of the Act.  Surely there must be certainty for companies that are going to operate under this section forthwith, that companies cannot be in the situation of being deferred, so to speak, in their operations by being pushed back for the year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>These Schedules are, in the main, intended to preserve the provisions of the 1932 or 1934 Control of Manufactures Acts and to ensure that any rights companies had under these Acts will be continued in the future.  One of the effects of this Schedule is to provide that, in future, a company will not be deemed to conform with the requirements of the Act unless there is the prescribed relationship between its nominal capital liability and the fixed assets employed in the business.  The effect of Deputy McGilligan's amendment would be to create that position for the future only whereas my proposal is that, in respect of companies formed heretofore on the £100 capital basis, they should be given a period of time in which to bring their capital structure into conformity with the requirements of the Bill.  This does not apply to companies formed in full accordance with the requirements of the Control of Manufactures <Col N="47" /> Acts but to companies which have secured a nominal conformity by the process of keeping their capital liability down to the £100 figure and financing themselves by loans, credits, and so on.  In respect of these companies, it is proposed that they should be given a reasonable time in which to bring about the changes required to enable them to carry on in the future. As I understand the amendment, they need not make any changes but may still carry on in the future even though there&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>That is as I understand the situation, namely, that the position under the Bill limits further the companies that can operate and that Deputy McGilligan's amendment would extend the basis on which existing companies can carry on.  As I understand the Minister's explanation, it is that, under his provision in the Schedule, companies carrying on business at present within the law are now, under the Minister's provision, to take certain further steps before they can continue to carry on business.  I did not think that was the explanation at all in relation to the Schedule and to the amendment.  However, the Minister himself has given us his view.</P>
      <P>If the effect of clause 3 of Part 1 of the First Schedule is a further limitation on existing businesses, then it is a highly undesirable one.  I quite honestly admit that I did not so read clause 3.  If the situation was that a company at present in business, before it could carry on other businesses and before it could expand, required a period in which to do certain things first, I could understand it, but I cannot see why any company legally complying with the law at present should be restricted in the way the Minister has just explained the First Schedule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to be quite clear that by that I am not accepting that the Minister has correctly explained the First Schedule.  I am merely taking up the Minister on his own explanation. Surely the whole purpose of this Bill, if there is a purpose other than <Col N="48" /> window-dressing, is to make it easier for externs to invest here for the purpose of carrying on business and increasing our industrial potential?  If the effect of clause 3 of the Schedule is to make it more difficult, then it seems to me to be contrary to the principle of the Bill, and if it is contrary to the principle of the Bill, relying on the analogy we had in relation to another measure, it should not be in order at all.  I think the explanation which the Minister has just made is quite out of accord with what he said earlier.  We may have an opportunity of considering the matter further between now and the next stage.  If the position is as he said, then this clause must be amended, and the sooner the better.</P>

      <P>As I understand, this change will impose retrospective obligations on a company.  In other words, from now on or within a reasonable time, companies formerly not complying with the requirements of the Act will be required to do so.  It is possible to argue in favour of that change, but, as this is an amending Bill designed to liberalise the arrangement, is it not reasonable to deduce that those who in the future propose to invest here will do so in the knowledge that subsequent legislation may impose disabilities on them which did not exist when they made the investment? People formerly evaded this Act by a variety of devices.  Although this is a liberalising measure, it proposes to rectify that position by compelling them to comply within a reasonable time or on or after the appointed day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister why it is necessary to bring <Col N="49" /> these within the scope of this new Bill.  There has been considerable talk during the discussions on this Bill about evading the 1932 and 1934 Acts. I think that, possibly unwittingly, the impression was given that a big group of manufacturers in this country have done something dishonourable or dishonest in the methods by which they have financed a number of Irish manufactures. I do not think that is the case.  I think that a number of these companies would not in the normal course of events be established at all and were enabled to be established because of these&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Devices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;devices which, I think, possibly the Minister may even have had in mind when drafting the legislation in 1932 and 1934.  Most Deputies could think of at least one instance and possibly more where manufactures have been set up in various parts of the country that would not have been set up if external capital, or loan capital, if you like, had not been made available. If the Minister goes ahead with the Schedule in its present form, it might cause serious embarrassment to genuinely established Irish industries.</P>
      <P>A number of Deputies referred to the £100 companies with substantial loans, but there are companies, not £100 companies, with an issued capital up to the limit which permits the Irish interests to own a 51 per cent. share. Thereafter, their only hope of getting additional capital to provide plant and machinery and working capital was to get it by way of loan and the only way of getting the loan capital was to get outside loan capital.  I do not think that is an undesirable development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am quite certain that, as in the case of every other piece of legislation, there have been deliberate attempts to evade the Act by companies which possibly we would rather not see set up in the State.  I do not think that any form of legislation will exclude those companies.  No matter what appears in the Bill and no matter what wording is used, you will always get a certain minority section of the commercial community, as well as any <Col N="50" /> other community, who will try to evade.</P>
    <P>I do not think we can avoid that. Even if the Bill goes through, as the Minister has set out, there will still be possibilities of evading it.  There is nowhere in the Bill anything to stop an outside interest lending money to an Irish undertaking which, in turn, would lend it to a factory.  Can the Munster and Leinster Bank with headquarters in Cork lend money&mdash;nobody knows whose money it is&mdash;to an Irish undertaking, the money being lodged from outside sources?</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister to consider this section because I do not think that, after 25 or 27 years, we should quickly interfere with a form of financing which has now become established practice.  This loophole in the Act has been the means of providing a number of factories in the country that would not have otherwise been set up and giving considerable employment.  If you interfere with that after a long number of years, you may create an unfavourable impression outside the country.</P>
    <P>People may ask&mdash;it has been said to me and I do not mind repeating it in the House&mdash;that if a Government comes in and changes an Act or the provisions of an Act established 25 or 27 years, what is to stop another Government coming in after the next election and making other changes? We should avoid that.  I personally, whether for good or for bad, would be against any retrospective legislation. It is a good idea in this case to leave well enough alone.</P>
    <P>In framing this Bill, I should be quite content to rely on the Minister's wording at column 583 of the Official Report, Volume 165, No. 4.  This is, to my mind, the principle that should condition the whole Bill:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We should try to make these provisions as liberal as possible while at the same time maintaining a minimum of safeguards for the firms which are already established in our home market, and indeed we should aim at continuing the policy of favouring Irish controlled enterprises where home market sales alone are <Col N="51" /> involved.  Then we should, as we are amending the Control of Manufactures Act, take cognisance of the evasions which have been successfully attempted and while not attempting to go back over the past, make sure these evasions, if not impossible, will be at least less easy in the future.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I suggest that that is what we are doing, going back over the past, I think the mere fact of going back over the past will create an unfavourable impression on the very type of people whom we are trying to induce to invest capital, that is, the external capitalists.</P>
    <P>Apart from the general question of the Bill, I think this is the one significant section in it which the Minister should amend.  I do not think any useful purpose will be served by going back over the past 20 or 25 years.  I hesitate to use the words&mdash;I think it was Deputy Norton who used them&mdash; a witch-hunt&mdash;but I should like the Minister to reconsider that whole section. I have myself put down an amendment which will be coming up shortly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think Deputies should discuss this particular paragraph as if it were the whole Bill. The Bill sets out, in Section 4, all the circumstances under which companies can carry on manufacturing operations here.  A company that conforms with any one of the provisions in that section is entitled to carry on manufacturing operations.  One provision is that it should have 51 per cent. of its capital owned by Irish citizens, and two-thirds of its voting shares&mdash;the previous provisions of the 1934 Act repeated.  What do we mean by that? We mean that we are prepared to allow a company to engage in any manufacturing enterprise whatever, provided it conforms to these conditions, but when we come to take that decision, we must have regard to our experience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know that, under the 1934 Act, a person who complied with these shareholding and share-owning conditions was entitled to engage in any manufacturing operations and that that intention of the 1934 Act was met <Col N="52" /> in some instances by the establishment of companies with a purely nominal capital which was held in accordance with the provisions of the Act, but the operations of which were financed entirely by external loans or credits of one kind or another.</P>
    <P>Quite obviously, we do not intend that that should continue and nobody is proposing that it should, because it would be negativing the whole intention of the Bill to create a situation where any such company, provided it conformed in that nominal way to the terms of the Act, could engage in any manufacturing operation whatever.  Let us think of those companies already established in that way, companies which were not genuinely entitled to manufacture under the Control of Manufactures Act, 1934, without a Control of Manufactures Act licence, but who, having been refused that licence or not wishing to apply, established themselves by this device.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is missing the point.  There are these companies, some quite substantial in size, with a capital structure of that peculiar kind&mdash;£100 share capital divided among the shareholders in accordance with the provisions of the 1934 Act in such a way as to qualify them to operate without a licence.  Are we to allow these companies in the future to engage in any manufacturing operation they like?  I am trying in this Bill to remove all limitations and restrictions upon new companies engaged in manufacturing operations which add something worth while to the industrial organisation of this country.  We are not prepared to give that liberal treatment to a company which is not going to add to the industrial organisation of the country, which is merely coming in to invade the home market with goods already produced by existing companies in adequate quantities for the requirements of the home market.  That is, in effect, what the effect of this amendment would be. Even though the financial structure remains as it is, even though they have this £100 nominal capital and are financed by external loans, they can still engage in any manufacturing operation they like.</P>

      <P>The proposal is that these companies without any alteration in their capital arrangements should nevertheless continue in perpetuity to have the right to engage in any manufacturing operation without restriction. I do not think that is desirable. I think we should favour either their bringing themselves into conformity with the requirements of the Act, that is to say, that they must have paid-up share capital of not less than half the value of the fixed assets which they are employing, as defined in this paragraph, or their seeking to obtain the authority to proceed under one or other of the paragraphs in Section 4 of the Bill.</P>
      <P>I certainly do not visualise any circumstance in which a company, genuinely established here and engaged in manufacturing operations now, is likely to be refused a Control of Manufactures Act licence, if it applies for it, but it would be given a licence to engage only in the operations in which it is now engaged.  I do not see any circumstances in which a Minister would say to such a company: &ldquo;Whether you engage in export trade or not, whether you add anything to the country's trade development or not, whether you conform with anything in the law or not&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an argument about that.  It is quite clear that the amendment is to ensure that any company at present carrying on business within the law can continue to carry on in that business, without having to ask for leave or licence.  If that principle is not conceded, let me say this flatly&mdash;we may not have put this in a perfect way before the House; it may not be perfectly drafted&mdash;I can assure the Minister he will not get one single extern to come into this country as a result of the Bill.  One of the things they always ask is: &ldquo;Is there any danger of a succeeding Minister changing this Bill?&rdquo; And one of the things they are always told, and I have always felt up to the moment, rightly told, is that &ldquo;as long as you act within the law as it stands at the moment, then, though the laws may be changed in the future, even so as long as you are within the law at the date you operate, you can be assured that we are a fair-minded people and we will not change the law to affect you in any way retrospectively.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This clause does violence for the first time in the history of the State to that principle and it is a vital principle.  If the Minister wants to make the point that this clause enables people who are carrying on one type of business to jump into an entirely new type of business, that is a matter which would be taken in the same way as if they were <Col N="56" /> a new business starting off.  But it is absolutely vital that we get it across to everybody within and without the country that once they come in and establish a business legally, within the law on the date on which they establish it, as long as they keep to that business or to its normal ancillaries, we will not go back on our word as a people.  As this section is phrased, we do go back on our word, and it would be quite disastrous to our reputation as a country if we gave anybody the opportunity of saying that.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the amendment does not completely meet the case on its phraseology.  Quite frankly, I admit that until the Minister spoke first this evening, I did not realise the full significance of it.  The full significance is now quite apparent to me and the full significance of it is something I shudder to contemplate.  We often had similar discussions here on the provisions of Finance Acts.  If there is a flaw in a Finance Act when it is passed, certain steps are taken arising out of that flaw.  We never go back and legislate retrospectively.  We may seek to see that the gap is closed for the future and I do not quarrel with the Minister in closing the gap for the future.  That is a matter of policy of Governments from time to time and everybody must accept that, if there is a gap in any legislation, or if the legislation is wrong, if a succeeding Government decides that an earlier Government were wrong and they want to reverse it completely, that is within the province of Government.</P>
    <P>It must be accepted and held out, however, that it must not be in any way possible for people who propose to set up industries here&mdash;and these people are bound to be more suspicious than our own people&mdash;to believe that if they come in and establish themselves under one set of laws, if they act within those laws&mdash;I am not concerned with people outside the law&mdash; any succeeding Government can say: &ldquo;We do not like your way of complying with the laws and if you do not change yourselves and come within new laws, you must close down your existing investment and everything you have spent up to the present date will be confiscated.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>As I said on the Second Reading, there is a whole lot of cry but very little wool from the point of view of the development of Irish industries, that in fact the same effect could be got in a much better way by allowing the existing Control of Manufactures Act to run its course, but to use a new manufactures licence provision whereby licences could be granted to people who are coming in here to make goods for the export market, or to fill a very substantial void in our own industrial production. If we had taken that line, the line I would have taken, we could have blazoned forth to the world that we welcome all new industrialists coming here, that all these new financial facilities will be here for them, that they will get irrevocable licences to operate these new industries here and, as long as they comply with the terms of the licences, there will be no likelihood of their revocation.  As I said on the Second Stage, this is a lawyer's Bill.  There will be more misunderstandings about this law than there are about the workmen's compensation law&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>And which has finally built up a volume of case law that is nearly the equivalent of a bible.  Why do we not take the direct and short course?  What are the reasons for our taking this line instead of the more simplified line?  I asked the Minister on the Second Stage did it mean under <Col N="58" /> the provisions of the new Bill that he was going to inaugurate a witch hunt of those who got through the meshes of the Control of Manufactures Acts, 1932 and 1934, and try, as it were, to unscramble the egg which was scrambled when they managed to get through the meshes of the 1932 and 1934 Acts and registered under those Acts, £100 and £1,000 companies.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt in the world that all the companies which have got through the 1932 and 1934 Acts complied with the law, and many of them have been in existence for more than 20 years.  Nobody is attempting to prosecute them.  You cannot induce the Department of Industry and Commerce or the Attorney-General to prosecute them.  Nobody wants to have anything to do with them.  Everyone is rather doubtful as to the thickness of the ice on which they are skating, if they attempt a prosecution under the Control of Manufactures Acts of 1932 or 1934 in respect of these £100 companies. I think it must be assumed that they all complied with the law at the time, but they complied with the law because the law was so clumsy; they complied with the law because there were dozens of loopholes in the law.</P>
      <P>So far as complying with the Acts is concerned, nobody has attempted, since the Act was passed in 1932 or 1934, to challenge the legality of these companies under those Acts, whether they were formed on the basis of a £100 or £500 capital.  Therefore, so far as this House is concerned, this House which is the dispenser of legislation for conversion into law, these people have complied with the Acts. They are still innocent of any offence until they have been convicted of an offence.  Nobody wants to convict them; nobody wants to prosecute them.  Nobody wants to look at a file in Industry and Commerce or in the Attorney-General's Office, where the question of prosecution under the Control of Manufactures Act is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That being the real position, what, at this stage, is the value of churning up and throwing into the melting pot all that has happened, and happened legally, <Col N="59" /> under the 1932 and 1934 Acts?  No doubt, if somebody goes out head hunting or witch hunting, he will find that firms did not comply with the law of 1932 or 1934 but with what was intended to be the law of 1932 and 1934, but which in fact was not the law of 1932 or 1934.  The Minister might approach this from the standpoint of leaving well enough alone in so far as the activities of these companies can be confined to what they have been doing purposefully and constructively since they were established.</P>
    <P>It ought to be possible, if they want to break out into new activities, to see whether they could not be fenced in in some way against entering these new activities or whether they could not be corralled against neglect in regard to these new activities without being required to secure permission in some way from the Minister, from the Department or from some such body. But to contemplate, as this section does, that they must now completely reorganise themselves is to approach this matter from the most mischievous possible angle.</P>
    <P>This discussion on Irish industry and on our law is the worst piece of propaganda I have heard for selling abroad the simplicity and the ease with which you can establish an industry in Ireland. Anybody reading this discussion to-day will come to the conclusion that if there is one thing muddy in Ireland, it is the law and the intentions of the legislature, so far as the legal status of a company formed in Ireland is concerned.</P>
    <P>In any case, is this the right time to start to do this spring cleaning which ought to have been done 25 or 30 years ago?  We had a speech from the Minister for Health and Social Welfare recently in which he said that if this country does not get into the Free Trade Area, the mainland of this country will be as denuded of population as the Blasket Islands are.  I do not know whether the Minister for Industry and Commerce approves of that oration by his colleague, but one must assume the Minister for Health is still a normal person, that he still has the confidence of the Minister for <Col N="60" /> Industry and Commerce, that he was sent to speak on the subject of free trade and that he was giving the point of view of the Government.</P>
    <P>If it is true that we must get into the Free Trade Area with the haste that the Minister for Health and Social Welfare says, is an entirely new situation not opened up for us?  If we get into the Free Trade Area, manufacturers from the six countries in the common market and those who join the Free Trade Area, manufacturers from Greece, from Turkey, from Iceland, will all be entitled to send their goods in here with the label &ldquo;Made in Turkey&rdquo;, &ldquo;Made in Greece&rdquo;, &ldquo;Made in Iceland&rdquo; or made in any part of Central Europe.  If we are in the Free Trade Area, we must pay for these goods and let them in here free of duty.</P>
    <P>Contrasting that situation with the situation in which a man complied legally with the Control of Manufactures Acts of 1932 or 1934, but did not comply with the intentions of the Minister in 1932 and 1934, is it not better to allow that industry to run along here, making goods in Ireland, employing Irish workers in the production of these goods, in the utilisation of Irish raw materials and giving a livelihood to our people here, many of whom would not have that livelihood if these people had not established these companies in the unusual way in which they were legally permitted to do it, under the Acts of 1932 and 1934?</P>
    <P>The Minister has got into the role of industrial moralist under this Bill.  He thinks these people have been living in sin too long.  He now intends to correct them, to bring them back to the path of industrial rectitude.  The way in which he intends to do that is to compel them to do this, that and the other. I do not know who will do the compelling under the Bill; I do not see any provision in the Bill where anybody is to be the prosecutor in a case of this kind.</P>

      <P>Maybe the Minister, but even if there is to be a prosecutor in the form of the Minister, even if <Col N="61" /> the constitutionality of the 1932 and 1934 Acts is all right&mdash;which some people doubt-is it desirable that we should have cases in which the legal validity of companies is questioned by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, acting on behalf of the Government, at a time when we are appealing to the industrialists of the world to come in here and establish industries for the production of goods to supply our own home market, goods which are not produced here at present, or in the production of goods for export?</P>
      <P>It seems to me the Minister has got a hammer in this to deal with a problem which by no means calls for instruments of that kind in order to remedy the situation.  I would strongly urge the Minister to find some way of getting over whatever are the real difficulties, instead of the imaginary difficulties he says exist, in a way that is not calculated to have our industrial legislation made the subject of case after case in the courts.  It would be bad propaganda for our industries and I know of no more effective way of frightening away people from establishing industries.  The Minister should take advantage of the time between now and the discussion of this Bill in the Seanad to see whether he might find another and less mischievous way of dealing with this matter.  If his attitude is an indication of his intentions, then I am afraid that existing people who complied with the law even though it was not the law as the Minister thought it would be when he was introducing the 1932 and the 1934 control of Manufactures Acts, will have cause for a good deal of disquiet. This is a matter for caution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To some extent I agree with what Deputy Sweetman has said.  We ought to put our industrial legislation, particularly in relation to non-Irish firms, on the basis that everybody will feel that a change of Government will not bring about a change in the basic law. That situation would be fatal from the point of view of encouraging people to establish new industries here, situated as we are&mdash;an outpost of Western Europe.  There are enough difficulties already in trying to induce people to come in here without bedevilling the <Col N="62" /> whole situation by taking a course of action calculated to bring about misunderstanding.</P>

      <P>99.9 per cent. of what Deputy Norton has said is completely irrelevant to this amendment.  If we are to discuss the attractions to be held out to foreign firms to establish industries here, may I make it quite clear that we are not interested in foreign firms coming in to establish £100 companies to supply the home market with goods with which that market is already supplied?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the only question that arises here.  Deputy Norton says these existing £100 companies were established in accordance with the law.  I am not accepting that.  I am accepting that under the provisions of the 1934 Act a successful prosecution would have been very difficult.</P>
      <P>What are these companies? They are in the main, so far as I know, companies that were established here to carry on operations on behalf of foreign interests where these foreign interests had already been refused a Control of Manufactures Act licence on the grounds that their advent into Ireland would add nothing to the industrial organisation of the country and that the goods that they were proposing to make were already being made by existing home concerns in adequate degree.  It was always a threat of foreign companies succeeding in getting in after Irish companies had established themselves in the home market, exploiting well-known trade names, or previously established connections with the market, to the detriment of the Irish companies which was the main deterrent to greater development by Irish enterprise in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could not tell you how many times in my period as Minister I was discussing with some group the possibility of establishing an industry of a particular kind to produce a particular range of goods in which I was met by that group with the objection that, if they did succeed in making a &ldquo;go&rdquo; of the industry and getting into production to supply these goods to the home market, <Col N="63" /> some well-known foreign firms, which had previously been supplying the market, would get in to compete with them by one method or another; and, on the files of the Department, there are hundreds of letters written officially in the name of the Minister giving to particular firms about to embark on new enterprises an assurance that, if they did embark upon that enterprise, a new Manufactures Act licence would not be given to a foreign-owned firm to produce the same goods.  In some cases, however, that assurance proved to be fallacious because the firms that it was intended should not be encouraged to come in, after somebody else had already started to supply the market, succeeded in getting in by this device of setting up a purely nominal company here with a nominal capital held in accordance with the Control of Manufactures Act but financed in the main by extended credits or loans.  That happened.</P>
    <P>What are we going to do about these companies in the future? That is the only question that arises on this amendment.  Are we going to say to these companies established in that way that, now that they are here, not merely can they continue to operate as they are now doing, but they can engage in any other manufacturing operation they like without restriction? We may decide to do that in a particular case but surely there should be an examination of the case and a decision taken by somebody that to give that freedom of action to some of these £100 companies would not be a further deterrent to industrial progress here, because it is still true, in relation to the production of goods for the home market at any rate, that that fear is operating as a deterrent to the establishment of new undertakings here&mdash;the fear that if they are established a determined attempt to put them out of business again will be made by some external concern which previously had an established position in our market.</P>
    <P>We must be able in those cases to give reasonable protection against that possibility and the protection we give is to enact legislation of this kind <Col N="64" /> which sets out in precise form the conditions under which people can engage in manufacture here.  Of course if there is to be a privileged class of people, a small group of companies established on this £100 capital basis, which will in future have the right to engage in manufacturing operations here, even though they are foreign-owned, if they can be acquired by some other interests with all these privileges and rights, then of course this legislation is of no protection whatsoever and we may as well go the whole hog and repeal the Control of Manufactures Acts altogether and ignore all the undertakings we gave to these existing companies in the past.</P>
    <P>I do not think that would be good policy and I do not think there is anything in the argument that, by enacting this section as it stands, we are doing something which will in future induce firms establishing new industries here to fear that the conditions under which they will be allowed to engage in manufacture may be altered to their detriment.</P>
    <P>I point out once more that in Section 4 there are set out all the conditions under which companies can engage in manufacture here.  A company that complies with any single one of these conditions will be entitled to engage in manufacturing operations here.  One of these conditions is that provided 51 per cent. of the capital is owned by Irish citizens or companies in which Irish citizens have a controlling interest; if that condition is met, any manufacturing operation can be engaged in.  But we want to make that real, too, and that is why we say to the existing companies: &ldquo;You have to conform to that condition&rdquo; or, if not to that condition, to some one of these conditions in that section.  The £5,000 fixed asset provision, Section 4, paragraph (h), will put many of them outside the Act anyhow.  If the others want to get into business here, it will be no trouble to them to conform to the requirements of one or other of these paragraphs.  By doing that, we maintain the position that we think it is necessary to maintain in order to inspire the confidence we must build up if we are going to get industrial <Col N="65" /> progress at all by Irish interests in the future.</P>
    <P>That is why I would be opposed to this amendment which gives not merely forgiveness for any past acts by these companies but unlimited rights of operation in the future.  That amendment could not be accepted.  I have stated my recognition of the fact that in the case of an existing concern of that £100 character which, for any reason, finds itself unable to conform with the requirements of paragraph (3) or qualify under Section 4 it is unlikely they would be refused a licence if they applied for it.  They should be in the position that they should be expected to seek a licence and to be confined by that licence to the particular operations in which it is thought that they should be allowed to engage having regard to the existing industrial organisation of the State.  They should be in no different position in that regard than any new company formed in which foreign interests wanted to have control and which were not able to comply with any of the other paragraphs of Section 4.  Such an organisation would be given a licence and such an organisation would be welcomed into our industrial set-up provided they were doing something which was adding to the industrial organisation of the State.  These companies should be in the same position.  That is the whole object of the section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I intended to ask how many people are concerned.  The Minister has answered by saying a small group.  In his argument the Minister says a small group of £100 companies.  As the debate proceeded it looked as if the country was full of these £100 companies.  I do not know any of them.  The Minister says a small group.</P>
      <P>We are setting a very bad example outside to people who were inviting or trying to induce people to come here. We are doing so in order to get hold of a small group of people.  The Minister is talking about £100 companies. I want to ask, may a £100 company complying with the arrangements in Section 3 be an excluded company?  I see nothing to prevent it.  We cannot be against the £100 company as such. It seems to me as if the £100 company is only to be derided when one is considering those who have come in here and have complied with the 1932 and 1934 Acts.</P>
      <P>My intention in putting down this has been queried.  My intention was perfectly simple.  It has become complicated. I intended to avoid retrospective legislation.  If we are to make arrangements for any companies, very good.  The share capital must not be less than a particular sum set down here.  Do what you like about these new companies.  The argument can be adduced, of course, that it is an unwise procedure in legislation which is suggested to be primarily for the purpose of liberalisation.  To that legislation in regard to future companies nobody can complain.  We are entitled in this State through this legislative body to make arrangements to deal with any company which comes in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to see any company established after the date of the passing of the Act having to comply with whatever conditions are in this Schedule. That is fair.  Of course, I could argue against it.  If nobody can say: &ldquo;you are breaking faith with people who came in here already&rdquo;&mdash;but then turn to Section 3, the excluded companies section. If a company complies with certain conditions set out in Section 3, it <Col N="67" /> has not to bother about a licence or going to the Department of Industry and Commerce or anybody in the way of authority.  It can bypass all those and is free to set up.</P>
    <P>One of the conditions is that the memorandum of association and every prospectus provide that the carrying on of a manufacturing process in relation to a commodity intended for export is a principal object.  I queried that when we were last dealing with this. If it is meant as it is made, it is not very much of a condition to impose. Then I thought there might be something hidden in it.  But I was told very explicitly by the Minister that what that clause says is intended.</P>
    <P>Suppose in a year or two hence we have been able to induce a few foreign companies to come in here who intended to do their business and certainly did make it a principal object that they should export, but who found that they could not export.  But they have become excluded companies.  As far as I can read the measure, once an excluded company you are an excluded company for all time and for any manufacturing process, not the manufacturing process for which exclusion is gained.  You are in exactly the same position as is alleged to be that of the £100 companies and which are now, according to the Minister, allowed to operate and are able to engage in any manufacturing process.</P>
    <P>Is it conceivable that in a year or two the Minister will be coming in here and imposing new conditions, not on companies looking in the future to become excluded companies, but companies which have already gained the status of excluded companies?  Certainly if you go to America and tell the Americans that under this excluded company section they are quite free, but if you are asked what is the prospect of the Minister coming in and making a change, you can say that up to this particular date such a prospect was nil.  But, referring to this debate, they will say: &ldquo;Are you not doing that exact thing which I fear in regard to companies that have already in some way or other managed to comply with the conditions of the 1932 and 1934 Acts and apparently have been enabled <Col N="68" /> to operate here for 25 or 26 years?&rdquo; It is a bad example.</P>
    <P>Similarly with regard to the certificates of exemption.  It is rather more restricted but the Minister is entitled to give certificates of exemption.  One of the things the Minister boasted of when last dealing with the matter was that once a certificate of exemption has been given it cannot be revoked by any circumstances.  It may be impossible, if we follow along the tracks we are marking out for ourselves at this particular moment.  I ask is it worth while creating a bad precedent, giving something which will certainly be pointed to as a danger to any manufacturers intending to come in here for the purpose of exporting. They will be told: &ldquo;The trap is there set for you.  It is fine legislation, but do not forget that, in the passing of that very piece of legislation, the Minister showed his hand.  He showed an inclination to get after certain people who had got through too easily. They had complied with the Acts on any legal interpretation but did not comply with what the Minister thought the Acts should have said, but apparently did not say.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is a very bad precedent.  It there was a great deal of damage being done to the country by these companies that have scrambled in in some other way under the Acts, there certainly would be an argument to be used in the economic circumstances of the country. But the Minister referred to a small group.  I would ask people to have a balanced mind.  Is it worth while to do this great wrong, to have this retrospective legislation, order to rectify something small that is operating?</P>
    <P>The Minister says that if my amendments were carried it would mean that any company here at the moment, without meeting the requirement of the share capital being of a certain type, could engage in any manufacturing process.  Deputy Norton has said that it is not for me to do that. I say we want to prevent retrospective legislation.  The Minister said: &ldquo;Very good, we will accept that. We take it that this section will apply only to the future but I have to look after the people who are here.  They have got <Col N="69" /> in here and, although I do not want them, they are here and they are doing certain work&rdquo;.  Although it still would be something in the way of retrospective legislation, it would be less harmful for the Minister to provide that those who are here and are engaging in manufacturing process, although they do not comply with the capital requirements of Section 3, will be entitled to carry on but only in the manufacturing process in which they are at present engaged or&mdash;and I take the words from the Act of 1932&mdash;something that forms part of that business or is a reasonable extension of it.</P>
    <P>As the Minister must have realised when we were arguing here the last day, I had possibly paid too much attention to that phrase where it occurs in many sub-sections of Section 2 of the Act of 1932 and I had thought that the way this matter ran was in the main&mdash;I know there are exceptions&mdash;that if you fix the particular manufacturing company with a particular manufacturing business or, when you look to the relevant extension of that, something that forms part of that business or is a reasonable extension of it, that is only limited in its application and I suggest, if the Minister wants it, that is a possible way out of this.  Again I want to say that I do not think he would be entirely free from the criticism that he is imposing new conditions on people who have already complied with conditions if he says to people who are here: &ldquo;I will allow you to stay on without meeting the requirements of share capital but you will legally be carrying on that business only if you are engaging in the business that we find you at the moment in or whatever is a reasonable extension of it.&rdquo; That would be a less disreputable attempt to amend the law retrospectively than what is being done now.</P>
    <P>Let people clear their minds of this. We have our arguments here.  We know the home circumstances.  We have now been told that this is not really a very big matter at all.  Let this discussion here or any synopsis of it be sent off to any group of foreign industrialists who attempt to come in here and let it be marked to them that in this year, 1958, we have decided to <Col N="70" /> amend back to catch companies who have been here since 1932 or 1934, that we are doing that in 1958, imposing new conditions.  Will that induce people to come in here?  Will they have any idea of stability of government, that a succeeding Government, because it was properly done, will agree with what was done by a predecessor? Once, so to speak, the exception is made and you break through all this, and you are imposing a new condition&mdash;it is recognised that this is the imposition of a new condition&mdash;on people who are already here, I think you have done irreparable harm.</P>
    <P>Personally, I would prefer what Deputy Norton said was the alternative-abolish the Control of Manufactures Acts altogether.  If they had any purpose to serve at any stage, they have served it, and if they are here, let them continue here.</P>
    <P>Apparently, our whole future depends on having this enlargement of manufacturing production in the country, whether it is to be for export or for the home market, and the export markets offering are supposed to be better and, certainly, under the system of no protection, are likely to be much better than anything we can offer at home.  The fears, the doubts, as to any more companies coming in here to clutter up an already satisfied manufacturing organisation ought to be very remote.  We are away from the days of 1932 and 1934 when there were economic aspects of the whole matter. We are turning our backs on all that, clearing away from it, and the whole Continent which we hope to rejoin is doing the same.</P>
    <P>Taking it in a balanced way, in the circumstances in which we find ourselves, so many years after the first of these Acts was passed, if we do find that people have come in legally, even although it may have been by certain ingenious devices, we should at least say to them: &ldquo;Since you came in here, we will not impose any new condition but, for the future, anyone who comes in will have to meet this requirement with regard to share capital.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As I said before, if this was a very serious matter, if the people whom the Control of Manufactures Act was intended <Col N="71" /> to protect and safeguard in regard to their capital involvement were very seriously impeded and affected by a mass of people operating as £100 companies, the argument would be weightier, although it would not at all meet the principle stated.  The Minister said that it is a small group. Let them alone or at least put the hobble on them that they will continue in the manufacturing process in which they are at present engaged or some reasonable extension of it but, for the sake of getting your own back on a small group of companies which came in here, do not work harm, very serious harm, in the future by causing doubts in people's minds as to whether there was any stability in the view held here.  Are we open, as I think we will be open, to the criticism if this is passed in its present form that we pass a piece of legislation one day and then find out that the law has not been carried out, and amend&mdash;you are entitled to do that&mdash;but amend backwards, looking back, when you involve and penalise people who have got in properly under the existing law?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say, to avoid misunderstanding, that I am completely in sympathy with the Minister's desire to protect the efficient Irish manufacturer who is doing a good job in the home market.  I have no sympathy whatever for the inefficient Irish manufacturer and personally, if the device of the £100 factory will get a better job done with the assistance of outside capital, I would rather see it done.  The Minister's argument in that regard is unanswerable by anybody in this Dáil who wants to protect the efficient manufacturer who is doing a good job but, in order to do that, the Minister is doing a disservice to two other sections.  One is the section I mentioned when I spoke a few minutes ago, that is, the industry that was set up with the assistance of outside capital because the home investor or capitalist, as the case may be, did not have sufficient capital to start the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Such industries have been in existence for various periods over the past 25 years.  It is not good policy at this <Col N="72" /> stage to say to them: &ldquo;We want to bring you within the scope of this section.  We know you have been there for 20 or 25 years.  We think you have evaded the 1932 and 1934 Acts. Now is the time to bring you within the scope of this section.&rdquo; If anything was to be done, the time to do it was when the Irish home market was vulnerable, when it was not completely catered for.  As the Minister himself has said on a number of occasions, the home market is well and efficiently catered for and it is in respect of exports that any expansion in industry must be looked for.</P>
    <P>As other Deputies have said, and as I have previously said, this piece of legislation will create a bad impression. The good the Minister will do, to prevent this real or alleged hornet's nest of £100 factories, he will more than undo by the damage he will do to the established genuine companies that could not have been financed except by the assistance of some outside capital and he will certainly create a bad impression outside the country.  I have reason to know that because I have sent a draft of this Bill outside the country to get observations on it and that was the impression.  The main dissatisfaction expressed was because of the fact that here is an Irish Government, 25 years after enacting certain legislation, going back over it and creating a new set of conditions. I do not think it is outside the Minister's competence to contain the £100 factory that he was talking about.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy McGilligan, I did not appreciate the significance of the fact that once a £100 factory is in they can jump from one type of manufacture to another.  I do not know how many £100 factories have done that.  I have no information on that point.  If that is a serious danger to the established and efficient Irish manufacturer, it should not be outside the wit of the Minister to devise a section to cater for that.  I say: do not do it at the expense of genuinely established companies, companies established with the assistance of outside capital, and certainly not at the expense of the good name of the Government by interfering <Col N="73" /> with legislation enacted over the past 25 years.  Whether we like to admit it or not, the loopholes were availed of to create factories that have given employment and that is the best answer to the complaint that these loopholes have been there.  I may be completely wrong but I should think that successive Ministers have shut their eyes to the fact that these loopholes were there.</P>

      <P>The type of case Deputy Russell refers to is different from that which we have been discussing. I am not by any means clear in my mind as to how it could be met, on the one hand, or as to the need to meet it on the other.  The Deputy is not thinking of the case where an external company was refused a manufacturing licence but nevertheless got into manufacturing here either by the process of establishing an under-capitalised company of which 51 per cent. of shares were held here, or some device like that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is thinking of the case where a Control of Manufactures Act licence would have been given if applied for but where the Irish shareholders did not want to apply for it because they wanted to retain the position in which control of the company would be in their hands. I do not know whether there are any of these cases where this requirement, that the paid-up capital should be not less than half the value of the fixed assets with all the deductions set out here, could not be fulfilled.  That is a matter I would have to look into.</P>
      <P>My trouble in dealing with the argument put forward by Deputy McGilligan is this.  I cannot see circumstances in which a Control of Manufactures Act licence would be refused to a company which was formed in that way in the past and which was actually engaged in manufacturing operations now and which had good reason for not making the changes which would be required by the provisions of this paragraph&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>All that talk is so much special pleading in this matter.

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be a good argument but it has nothing to do with this case.  So far as the law is concerned it is set out in Section 4 of this Bill, and any company that complies with any one of those paragraphs is entitled to engage in manufacturing here or provided it is owned by Irish citizens.  If it cannot comply with any other conditions it can manufacture if it complies with that condition.  But what do we mean by that?  We mean in a <i>bona fide</i> way that the company is an Irish company in the sense that the majority of its shares are held by Irish citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We now come to the case of the company which is set up with £100 capital the larger part of which is held by Irish citizens but which is actually employing say £100,000 in its operations, obtained by loan from external partners or in the form of extended credit for supplies of materials or something like that.  We say to these companies: &ldquo;In order to become respectable in the future there are certain things you must do.  You must either change your ownership so as to conform with the requirements of this Act or you must get a licence to carry on the process of manufacture in which you are engaged or in some other way qualify under Section 4 to carry on. If you cannot do that then you are in conflict with the Act.&rdquo; In the case of existing companies actually carrying on operations now, I cannot see a licence being refused, but there was a multitude of these companies formed over the years which are not carrying on operations now.  Are we to create in respect of them that privilege by which they can in the future carry on, or by which any external companies that acquire a controlling interest in <Col N="76" /> them are now exempt from the provisions of this Bill?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;here, whether their ownership remained in the hands of those who established such concerns or whether it has been transferred to any other ownership whatever.  We cannot have that.  Now, can we devise a system under which we can put on these companies the onus of trying to conform with the requirements of the section and recognise that if for any reason they cannot do it we will still give a licence provided they are actually manufacturing now, provided they are not defunct companies and are in business now, and secondly, can we limit their operations to the type of work they are doing now with some reasonable freedom of action in respect of normal extensions of their operation?</P>
      <P>I would not object to putting into the section another paragraph instead of paragraph (4) which says that the Minister may extend the time during which they must conform, a paragraph to say that the Minister must give, provided he is satisfied with the <i>bona fides</i>, a licence under the Control of Manufacturers Act to enable them to carry on.  But what Deputies want is some automatic provision which will not involve recourse to the Minister.  I do not see how we can get it.

      <P>If a company complies with the law as it is at present and is carrying on business in compliance with the law, we have no business to pass legislation in relation to that company which will change the terms under which it must comply.  We can pass legislation for the future. Certainly we can say in respect of the future that people must do certain things.  We can say that for the future, to comply with the law, they must do a, b, c, d, e, f and g, or any terms you like.  That is all right for anybody starting up in the future, but once you <Col N="78" /> take the line that a company complies with the law at present and the law with which it has to comply is changed and may disqualify them, you are cutting across the whole root of confidence.</P>
      <P>I accept&mdash;Deputy McGilligan has already accepted&mdash;that, perhaps, the exact wording of this amendment may not meet the case which is being thrashed out here.  Neither I nor Deputy McGilligan is interested in the exact wording of the amendment.  It is the principle that, once people comply with the law, they are not to be put, because of that compliance, in a different condition after it.  If they do not comply with the law, then I have nothing whatever to say in favour.</P>
      <P>Let me put this to the Minister Suppose, for example, a firm comes to him and says: &ldquo;We propose to do this. That is our scheme of operation.  We think it is in compliance with the 1932 and 1934 Acts.&rdquo; We know the Minister would be bound officially to take the line that it is not for us to lay down what is or is not in compliance with the law.  Excluding that, if the Minister were an outside business industrial adviser&mdash;or both of us were&mdash;and said: &ldquo;Yes, I think that scheme is in compliance with the 1932 and 1934 Acts&rdquo;, and they set up on that basis and are carrying on that business on that line and, assuming the advice tendered by both of us was right and the judges in the courts were there to determine we were right, it would be most improper for us to change what was the legal and judicial definition of compliance with the law.  That is, in fact, what the Schedule does.</P>
      <P>A lot of this trouble arises because people are inclined to read the word &ldquo;evasion&rdquo; as meaning the same thing as &ldquo;avoidance&rdquo;.  I have no sympathy with anybody who evades.  I think the word &ldquo;evasion&rdquo; connotes a breach, whether deliberate or not, of the law. I have no sympathy with anybody who breaks the law.  If a person avoids one legal pitfall by legally taking another course which he is legally entitled to take, then we have no right to go back to him and say: &ldquo;What you did before, though it was perfectly legal at time A, at time B is illegal.&rdquo; That is a matter of principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="79" /> I think the Minister is quite wrong when he says that the only things that people are coming here to look at are the terms of employment, the supply of raw materials, the supply of employees, and suitability of sites, suitable services, and so on.  I have experience of meeting them on the Minister's side of the House, as well as professionally.  Invariably, they all ask the same question: &ldquo;Is that the law and is there any likelihood that the law would be changed retrospectively after we invested our money here?&rdquo; The answer has always been, on both sides of the House, &ldquo;Frankly, no&rdquo;, that whatever new policies we might adopt, it would be unthinkable that a Government would penalise restrospectively people who would come in here.</P>
    <P>We have all held that view on both sides of the House, but the clause in this section would have that effect.  I am saying quite categorically it would have that effect, and if this clause is passed in its present condition, any solicitor, acting for any business concern, if he is asked whether the projected scheme is in compliance with the law, must say: &ldquo;I think it is.  I think a judge will uphold my opinion at the moment that it is, but I am afraid that, having regard to the manner in which the First Schedule of the Industrial Development (Encouragement of External Investment) Bill, 1957, alias the Control of Manufactures Bill, 1957, was passed, even if the judge gives you a decision, there is a danger that the Oireachtas might legislate against you retrospectively. Therefore, you cannot be sure whether the interpretation of existing legislation is that.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We cannot possibly get to that position to secure any results under this Bill.  I am not very sanguine in regard to the methods adopted in relation to this Bill.  That is another day's work. We all want to ensure, whether we agree with the methods or not, that we get some results under this Bill. We cannot get any results, unless, if I may use the phrase, we exude confidence in relation to those who come in and comply with the law.  As the Schedule is at present, we do not do that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="80" /> Like the Minister, I am not interested in the case of a &ldquo;dud&rdquo; company being operated for the purposes of this Bill in the same way as a &ldquo;dud&rdquo; company would operate for the purposes of the Finance Act, 1937.  I am perfectly prepared to concede that they can be easily covered in the Bill by a suitable phrase.  It is a matter of drafting and it is not beyond the with of the draftsman to get something to cover it.</P>
    <P>We can cover it without any difficulty at all in the Schedule if there is the wish to do it.  I am vehement in my argument that we must exude confidence that no Government in power here, having got people to believe they were complying with the law, would afterwards tell them they have to do something else and that they are to be denied the protection of the courts in relation to existing contracts <i>vis-á-vis</i> Governments.  It should be quite easy to meet that.  If the Minister indicates he is prepared to endeavour to get a form of words, on his side, that prevents the dud company being bought or utilised by other people, on the one hand, and to preserve the existing undertakings and to preserve faith and to protect confidence in our administration, I think we, on this side of the House, would equally exercise our minds to see if we could find some method that would ensure that the genuine case would be protected and that the necessity to protect that genuine case would not be abused.</P>

      <P>I am rather disappointed at the references to the £100 companies, especially when the Minister states he does not wish to put them in the position where they will get free forgiveness&mdash;I think that is the word he used&mdash;for what they had done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>If that was the Minister's intention, I am delighted.  I was afraid he was trying to forgive them for disagreeing with him.  I am still unconvinced that these £100 companies have done any considerable harm and I should like further information in that respect.  I gather from the debate this afternoon that there is only a comparatively small number involved. I am not at all aware of any evidence that these £100 companies have acted detrimentally to the industrial development of the country.  If they have done so I am surprised, and I should like to know something more about it. I get the impression that the Department, as such, and the various Ministers have always been frightened of these companies but have been unable to control them and, being unable to control them, have built up a phobia about them and, I think, an unnecessary one.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that the Minister states it is not his intention to close down a company simply because it finds itself unable to comply with Section 3 of Part I of the Schedule to the Bill. There, again, a new external investor will not be impressed by what the Minister now states his intention will probably be in the future.  I am absolutely prepared, myself, to accept that it is not the Minister's intention to close down a company.  However, you cannot expect an outsider to accept that assurance or to be as confident as we, on this side of the House, might be of the Minister's benevolence on the matter.  Once you preserve the power to do it, the damage has been done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to the danger that, if this section is not retained, a new privileged group of businesses will be set up who have been acting prior to the appointed day.  However, even that does not seem to me to be a fully valid reason as there is already a privileged group of businesses operating here since prior to 1932 which does not appear to have done any great harm to anyone.  The Minister stated he would be prepared, possibly, to put the onus on companies to try to comply with the Bill.  There, again, if you are trying to interest a foreign investor he will insist on some definite ruling <Col N="82" /> on the law.  If he is told: &ldquo;You may or may not comply now or at a later date but if at any stage you do not comply it is probable that the Minister will ask you to try and it is also probable that if you can satisfy the Minister you are trying he will grant you a new manufacturer's licence,&rdquo; no businessman is prepared to act on that basis.</P>
    <P>I am sorry there seems to be a feeling in the Minister's mind that anyone who has avoided some of the restrictions of the Control of Manufactures Act has done something improper. I do not think that that is so. We have to regard the matter cold-bloodedly&mdash;if you comply with the law, that is the end of it.  Once you comply with the law, there must be nothing but goodwill towards you, even if you disagree with the particular way in which a man is doing it.  I know it is most disappointing to someone who has prepared legislation and who wants it to go a certain way and finds it going slightly contrary to his wishes.  Compliance with the law is all that can be enforced by any Government or court. Once you introduce further restrictions, I feel you are undoubtedly inviting avoidance or evasion.  Avoidance of the provisions even of Section 3 of Part I of the Schedule would be quite legal.  I am already assured by some of the leading solicitors in Dublin that they are fully prepared to avoid most, if not all, of the provisions of this Bill. We have to face the fact that any control invites avoidance or evasion.  I think this Bill will undoubtedly do so and that ways under it, over it or through it will be found.  I do not believe the Minister's wishes will be carried out.  I see what he is trying to do but I do not think it will turn out as he desires.</P>
    <P>This insistence on control and protection is not really to the benefit of our economy.  I will quote an extract which I have already quoted to the Minister from the <i>Journal of the Irish Management Institute,</i> September-October, 1957, which refers to an article by a gentleman named Eugene R. Black, President of the International Bank.</P>

      <P>Here is the significance of the amendment, as I see it.  Some of us here are trying to establish a principle that controls can be made retrospective.  If I have wandered too far away from that, I apologise.  However, I feel it is inevitable that, once you make a retrospective control, the whole purpose of the Act will be confounded. I am not fully in agreement with the suggested amendment but, at the same time, I feel it is trying to meet this point&mdash;the point being that a legal company can now, if the Bill is passed, become an illegal company.  If the Minister could get it into his head that a company which has done something which he did not like in the past is still a fully legal company I feel we might be able to make some progress. In all his contributions this afternoon, the Minister appears to feel that the fact that a company has got round him in the past means it is illegal and that he will catch it out in the future.  That would be an unfortunate precedent. Possibly I have misinterpreted the Minister but I cannot see that any other interpretation would be given to it by anyone else.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the difficulty of the House in this matter is that it does not know how many companies are supposed to have transgressed the 1932 and 1934 Control of Manufactures Acts or how many companies avoided the provisions of those Acts.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce cannot say that a company is avoiding or evading the Control of Manufactures Act.  He has no qualifications whatever to pronounce on whether a company is complying with or abrogating the law.  No one on these benches has any such power.  The Attorney-General himself cannot say that the company has transgressed the law.  That can be done only by the courts.  We cannot pass legislation and set ourselves up as a judiciary as well to say who has complied with the law after it has been passed.  The courts have not yet pronounced judgment on a single case under the Control of Manufactures <Col N="84" /> Acts of 1932 and 1934, so far as I know. Therefore, nobody has been declared to be an offender under those two Acts and the presumption must be that everybody has complied with the law, at least until the court determines otherwise.</P>
      <P>Nobody knows, either, how many companies might be suspected of avoiding or evading the law.  I do not think there is any record in the Department of Industry and Commerce as to the number of companies which are regarded in the official view of the Department as borderline cases or suspect cases.  Now and again one heard of cases, perhaps, of a shady kind of company running its business in a way that did not excite admiration or commendation in the Department, a company that perhaps was financing itself through small capital, the rest coming through the conduit pipe of a loan or extended credit.  So far as I know, there is no list there. Certainly, no list was ever shown to me and I do not believe there is any official list, nor do I believe there is anyone in the Department qualified to express a view as to whether a company has complied with the law or is complying with it, whether it has avoided or evaded the Act.  All these rumours floating round here in connection with this matter are very largely unreal because we cannot ascertain the extent of the problem with which we have to deal.</P>
      <P>If it is true&mdash;as the Minister says, and I am willing to take his word on it as I think it represents roughly the position&mdash;that there is a handful, perhaps a big handful, of &ldquo;hundred-pounders&rdquo; who have got through the wide and clumsy machine of the 1932 and 1934 Acts, I ask him is it worth while, is the game worth the candle, that we should introduce a Bill of this kind, with the discussion we have had, in order to try to make these companies, which got through the previous two Acts, comply now with the 1957 Act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Against the background of what is to come in the Free Trade Area, it might be good policy to say: &ldquo;Let us leave well enough alone, it is our fault that they were able to do this; this legislation <Col N="85" /> was passed by the House and they were able to comply with it in doing what they did.&rdquo; We cannot help that now.  In any case we are in an entirely new era and it looks a bit thick, 25 years after these Acts were passed, that we should seek now to amend them.  That is not good public policy and it is not good propaganda when dealing with foreigners, many of whom do not even know the language, much less the method by which we make legislation in our parliamentary institutions.</P>
    <P>The Minister might well take the view that while there is some problem to be dealt with it is not a serious one.  In any case, no Minister could contemplate closing down an industry to-day&mdash;we have too few of them already&mdash;merely because it did not comply, in his view, with the provisions of those two Acts.  If that is not going to happen, surely there is some other method of regularising the position? I think the Minister can get what regularisation he wants if he takes this Bill back and sits on it for a further period.</P>
    <P>It should be possible to draft an amendment whereby whatever has happened can be allowed to rest where it is, but whereby those who got through the Acts, complying as they did with the Acts then extant, will be contained within their existing activities, or immediately associated activities, and whereby nobody will be permitted to revive a dud company which is not, in fact, a company, or to use a company which is not now operating, for the purpose of arranging, because of its £100 capital, to carry on a new company into the activities of the old company, or still wider activities.  It ought to be possible to arrange things in that way and then the views of all sides of the House would be met.  What I am afraid of is the bad propaganda which is involved in this Bill and in this discussion.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that the people who come to him in future and ask what the law is will be told all this. These people will not all go to the Minister; they will go to solicitors, lawyers and friends.  They will ask what the law is in relation to the control <Col N="86" /> of companies here.  They will have copies of the Dáil Debates handed to them which they can read for themselves. Does anybody think that the reading of this debate is calculated to inspire terrific confidence in the immutability of the legislation we pass from the point of view of controlling companies, or is it calculated to create in the mind of someone who is suspicious: &ldquo;Well, that is the law to-day but you cannot be sure that will be the law if there is a change of Government&rdquo;? That would be a fatal impression to give any potential industrialist from afar.</P>
    <P>Again, one may have this situation arising.  Supposing that by an inquisition in the Department, the Minister does establish the fact that there are 15 or 20 industries which are not complying with the law; and then this Bill is passed in the form suggested by the Minister.  Suppose those people come to the Minister and say: &ldquo;We have read your Bill, we have taken legal advice, and the advice is that our company is within the provisions of the 1932 and 1934 Acts or we have made some very slight change which has brought it within that.&rdquo; The Minister will consult the Attorney-General, who will say: &ldquo;No, I do not think they are within the Acts.&rdquo; The companies say: &ldquo;That is interesting because we have the best lawyers we can buy and their advice to us is that we comply with the law and there is no doubt whatever on it.&rdquo; The Minister is still advised by the Attorney-General that that is wrong, that they do not comply with the law.  What is contemplated then; who wins?  Is the Minister to take the case into court and to institute proceedings against the company and say it does not comply with the law and have a heavyweight battery of lawyers on both sides for three or four days arguing in court as to whether such and such a firm complies with the law; and after a decision perhaps an appeal to another court?</P>
    <P>That is the first signs of battle to establish the legality of companies under those Acts.  Then there are 14 or 15 still in the background and the same process has to be gone through <Col N="87" /> in each of those cases.  As a result, suppose you get half a dozen or ten cases thrown into the courts, the courts being asked to pronounce as between the views of the companies' legal advisers on the one hand and the Minister's legal advisers on the other hand; and all this gets publicity, is that the best kind of atmosphere in which we think we can ask for an industrialist to come here to manufacture goods for export or to supply our home market where it is not at present supplied?</P>
    <P>Whatever has happened is not worth all this risk and danger.  We have taken a clumsy way of dealing with the problem of inviting people in.  However, let us take the situation such as it is.  The Minister would be well advised to try to forget what has happened, annoyed though he may be about the matter.  He should endeavour to contain all those who complied with the existing defective law not merely from extending their activities into new and unrelated domains and he should prevent others from using silent or obviously dud companies which have obviously got through the meshes of the 1932 and 1934 Acts.</P>
    <P>I think that course is preferable to throwing all this business into the melting pot, with all the criticism we are going to get from potential industrialists at a time when we cannot take that risk.  There is no question of a difference of political approach in this matter.  It is a question of industrial wisdom and sagacity as to what to do in the best interests of the nation.  The Minister would be well advised to have another look at this matter and bring back an amendment to this House which will meet whatever needs should be met.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has said that he would consider an amendment along certain lines.  I agree with Deputies who have already spoken that that does not offer much to industrialists. The Minister has referred to Section 4 and pointed out that a company complying with any of the relevant paragraphs may qualify and carry on business, and it would be <Col N="88" /> lawful for them to do so.  I dealt with this on the last occasion.  I said, and I think it may be repeated, that there are really only two paragraphs in this section which give liberalisation.  The first one is that it is quite lawful for a company to carry on business, if it carries on solely for export, and the second one is where the company is an excluded company.  Everything else means either something approaching the old conditions of control in the two earlier Acts or else going to the Minister to get a certificate of exemption.</P>
      <P>Consistently I have taken the line that people are not going to come in here, if they have to go to a Government Department to get leave to carry on business here.  The Minister brings us back to Section 4 of the Schedule and speaks of an extension of that.  I have moved to cut out that section because I think it is bad, once we have established the law, to give the Minister power to remit in respect of certain people the conditions of the law and to enforce them in respect of other people.  That gives room for favouritism, and, whether there is favouritism or not, there will be suspicion.  I should prefer to have the sub-section omitted altogether.</P>
      <P>The Minister says that he would not mind extending it, so that there would be some extension of time to allow companies to comply with the share capital conditions set out in the first part of Section 3.  I do not see any great difficulty there.  I am not pretending to put in a finished draft now, but the section might well run, at the end, &ldquo;provided always that company shall be a qualified company, if notwithstanding its non-compliance with share capital provisions, it is carrying on business at the time of the passing of the Act, and is then complying with all the conditions specified in Part II and continues in compliance with the said conditions to carry on such business or do anything which is part of or a reasonable extension of it&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That would mean that you would say: &ldquo;We regard you as a qualified company, although you do not comply with the share capital requirements, if you carried on business at the date of the passing of the Act, and complied <Col N="89" /> with the conditions of the earlier Acts and continue to comply with them.&rdquo; It would mean that you would stop these people from running wild and getting into new manufacturing business where the market was already satisfied.</P>
    <P>That is just something I have drafted here while the argument was going on. It could be improved and possibly there are some points which I have missed.  Personally, I still think it is a piece of retrospective legislation, but it is not so open or so blatant a piece of retrospective legislation as this is here.  I think what Deputy Norton asked was material to the argument. We have been told that it is a small group of companies and we take it that the Minister regards them as inconsiderable. I think that the fact that the company is on the basis of £100 capital does not mean that it has not necessarily got very heavy commitments in relation to capital.  I do not know the number but certainly some companies with considerable capital involved are operating on the basis of £100.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Minister's offer to do something in respect of Section 4, he may not appreciate the point of view, but there is a point of view which does not like this idea of having to go to the Minister for a certificate for any sort of exemption and therefore to give him wider power in Section 4 is making the thing worse and adding greater chances of favouritism than those already there.  I suggest the Minister should adopt some amendment on the lines I suggest: have his new conditions for the new companies and then in regard to the <Col N="90" /> companies already here say to them: &ldquo;You crept in in a way we do not like. We have got to keep our own honour and we will let you stay here, but we will restrict you to any business you are doing at the time of the passing of the Act.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Yes.  I think the arguments that have already been advanced by myself and other Deputies on this subject are sufficient in support of this amendment without going over the whole case again.  However, the case about which I am particularly concerned&mdash;and I think the Minister, unless I am mistaken, promised to consider the point&mdash;is that of <i>bona fide</i> companies with limited Irish capital who were not in a position to provide all the necessary funds particularly, or specifically, as my amendment suggests, for capital assets, and had to avail of outside loans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take the case of a company with a nominal capital of £50,000.  The Irish directors wish to maintain control of the company.  They can advance only, say, £5,100 to make it 51 per cent. The other interests, maybe outside interests, advance £4,900.  The cost of the factory buildings, plant, machinery, equipment comes to another £20,000 or £30,000, and that can only be supplied by loan capital.  I do not think they could be put into the category of the £100 companies we were discussing a short while ago, with some of which I have very little sympathy.  This is a genuine industry and it is rather hard on a company to insist on its bringing itself within the conditions set out in Section 3 of the First Schedule.  If loan capital is put up or provided for the purchase of capital assets, it is an addition to the country and should receive sympathetic treatment.  If the money was purely to be provided, say, for working capital or for purposes other than fixed unmovable assets, I would not be so sympathetic, but where such capital has provided a valuable addition to the country's fixed assets <Col N="93" /> the case should be considered sympathetically.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go over all the arguments already advanced because it would be largely repetition but I do feel that this would be a genuine case where a company failed to get sufficient Irish capital and genuinely availed of loans from outside sources. It would be very hard to ask them, whether it is one year or 20 years later, to bring themselves within the scope of what is set out in the Bill.  It might cause serious embarrassment not so much to the outside interests as to the Irish interests.  It might mean that special arrangements would have to be made to dispose of their interest.</P>
    <P>I know that provision is made whereby such people can go to the Minister but they may not wish to go to the Minister.  Taking the liberal intent of this Bill, I believe it is better&mdash;and I am sure the Minister will agree&mdash;to exclude, as far as possible, the necessity of going to the Minister. The Minister himself said that.  He wants to make it as easy as possible for people to establish industries.  One way of doing that in the case of industries already established, genuine, <i>bona fide</i> industries, giving employment, having built factories and holding capital assets by way of plant and equipment, would be by giving them all the protection they need and there should be no question of conditions being altered now in relation to such industries, irrespective of whether they have been established for a year, two years or 25 years.  I would ask the Minister to accept the amendment on those grounds and on the grounds advanced in the discussion on the section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it the Deputy has in mind some company which would have got a Control of Manufactures Act licence under the 1934 Act if they had applied for it, but where the Irish interests decided not to apply in order to force a situation in which they would have control of the ordinary shares of the company.  If the Deputy has in mind a company which would not have got a licence and which was formed under circumstances which would have precluded the possibility of <Col N="94" /> its getting a licence, then I have not much sympathy with it.  But, if it is the other type of case, then I would like to try to meet it.  I do not think the Deputy's amendment meets it.  The Deputy's amendment is unworkable.  I cannot see any circumstances in which it would be possible to prove that a loan obtained from external associates for that company had been used for the purchase of fixed assets as distinct from any other purpose.</P>
      <P>This is the same problem as that which we have discussed already and if we find a way of solving the former then we shall have found a way of solving this particular problem also, namely, allowing a <i>bona fide</i> company in existence as a manufacturing undertaking at this moment, even though it would not be a qualified company assuming paragraph (3) of this Schedule were in effect, to continue to manufacture, doing the same class of business as it is doing now, as if the section had not been passed.  That is a provision I shall try to devise with the safeguards necessary to prevent a reemergence of a whole lot of companies of the £100 kind which were started and are now defunct, but which could be revived as a means of getting out of the provisions of this Bill, when it becomes law, by those who wish to do so.  It may be possible to devise a method and, if I do devise a method, it will cover the particular case the Deputy has in mind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to people who did not apply for a licence under the Control of Manufactures Act.  What about the case of a company set up to manufacture a commodity that was already being manufactured but not manufactured efficiently or in accordance with the required standards?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>A case has occurred to me since we discussed the situation <Col N="95" /> earlier in which a man is not a qualified person but his wife is.  He set up a factory here.  He was advised that if he chose to give beneficially the moneys for the shareholding to his wife he would qualify completely on the basis of full shareholding.  There were certain obvious objections to that&mdash;it might create difficulties&mdash;and the shareholding was organised not on the £100 scale but on a fairly nominal scale.  That man has put a great deal of money into the building of a factory and establishing a certain line of business.  He has never taken a penny out of it in any shape or form&mdash;dividends, directors' fees or anything else. Recently he decided that in order to expand he would go into another line of country for export purposes.  That was about six or 12 months ago and the company is being developed along those lines.  He has got a fair distance. The actual process of manufacturing to the prototype has not yet come in.</P>

      <P>It would, and it would not, because they have done the trial work for this new departure.  They have set up certain separate parts of their factory premises, and so forth and they have got their prototypes but they have not yet come to manufacturing. I think the Minister should consider that type of case, too, where a <i>bona fide</i> attempt had already been made to go into a new line.</P>

He will be partly doing what he was doing <Col N="96" /> before and partly doing an export business and the type of use that he had his home business for was as a method of experimenting so that he could utilise the results of those experiments in relation to business abroad.  Without having some method of ensuring that he can get his machinery in working order, he does not know whether or not his new line will work.  The Minister should bear that type of case in mind.</P>

      <P>I want to repeat my objection here. When we are establishing new legislation, we should establish it as a complete break.  I do not want to give the Minister this power to suspend.  We ought to get away from all this.  I mentioned this on Second Reading. This is something the Kings of England had at one time, the power of dispensing and the power of suspending.  A king could operate the laws against his friends or he could dispense with the operation of the laws in relation to a few selected people.  It is wrong that that principle should persist in modern times.  It is a pity to have these conditions in modern legislation.</P>
      <P>I do not regard it as a safeguard for the Minister to have power to suspend for (a) but not for (b).  The Minister is in a certain mood, but it is not the mood of the public.  The Minister should revise this.  &ldquo;Nobody shall manufacture unless he operates under a licence from the Minister&rdquo;&mdash;that might be a simple way of doing it. That would mean the Minister could control.  You go a bit better when you lay down certain legal conditions and say these may be exempted.  You may have a new section and then you say the Minister may suspend the operation of it in regard to certain companies. I am satisfied so long as there is a chance of selection&mdash;there is no publicity in regard to this&mdash;and I would like to avoid favouritism.</P>

      <P>Perhaps this might be the best period to raise a matter in <Col N="100" /> connection with this Bill.  This Industrial Credit Company is one of the band of companies that are commonly known as State-sponsored companies. It has been a long and thorny problem in this House, and with many Governments, to devise some method by which the activities of State-sponsored companies, while giving them the freedom of detailed, administrative, day-to-day action would, at the same time, be brought in some way under the control of the Oireachtas.  It is a problem on which the Minister and I could each talk at great length, but it is a problem that some time somebody will have to face, and I should like to know from the Minister what progress is being made in relation to that problem, so far as it affects this company during the past 12 months.  This company is one of that band and, as such, must be considered in the general picture.</P>
      <P>Various suggestions have been put forward.  I do not propose to discuss them at this stage here to-night, but I should like to know from the Minister whether any progress has been made along the road and, if so, if he can give us an indication of the way his mind is moving.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite true, of course, as the Deputy said, that every Government has been considering this problem of whether there should be more control over these State companies, because, of course, they have not got the control, as it were, of shareholders, which public companies have outside.  Even the British Government have been dealing with this point and had two committees appointed and did not get very far.  I studied their difficulties also.  The only thing I did was to write to the chairman of every State company and ask him for his views.  Some of their views have come in; some of the chairmen said that they would send their views as soon as they would get a little time to consider the matter, and so on.  I am waiting for these to come in to study them properly.  I hope we will get some light from the chairmen, who have experience of these companies and who may be able to make suggestions for some sort of public inquiry or public control, as the case may be. <Col N="101" /> In the case of this particular company, of course, there could not be any close investigation of the proceedings, it being a finance company.  It just shows the necessity, as it were, for dealing with them in different ways. Some of the companies could be investigated somewhat as shareholders at an annual meeting would have the right to ask questions, and so on. Something of that nature might be done in time, but it is an extremely difficult problem.</P>

      <P>Is the situation not this: if there is something due to the State and due in circumstances like these, the Minister has had to make good a guarantee, and the Minister had to pay it?  It virtually only arises in cases where the company has gone &ldquo;bust&rdquo; or very nearly gone &ldquo;bust&rdquo;. The debt is due to the Minister and the Minister has had to make good a guarantee.  Surely the position is, under the existing law, that he is able to make any bargain he can to get back what he has had to pay for.  It does not seem to me that this phraseology meets that point.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy knows, of course, when the Minister sets out the heads of a Bill, he sends it to the draftsman and the draftsman puts it into legal form.  It is very difficult to know the mind of the draftsmen in some of these cases, but it is the same form as used in the State Guarantees Act.</P>

      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as sub-section (2) of this section is concerned, I quite appreciate that without it the Minister might not be able, perhaps, to borrow in the ordinary way by Exchequer bills or any other method for the purpose of meeting the guarantee, but, so far as sub-section (3) is concerned, is that sub-section visualising a separate borrowing and separate charging for the purposes of this Act? I do not think that is what should be envisaged.  If the Minister has to make good a guarantee out of the Central Fund, then the ordinary Central Fund arrangements for raiding the Central Fund should <i>ipso facto</i> follow.  I do not think it is desirable that for the purposes of making good a guarantee <Col N="104" /> under this Bill, there should be visualised the making of a specific borrowing for this purpose.  I do not think that would be right at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The wording here appears to be the usual form in relation to repaying money to the Central Fund.  Of course, the securities are issued specially for the purpose and, therefore, this section deals with the repayment to the Central Fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>It is I think a normal form for a Central Fund advance but I do not think a normal form for a normal Central Fund advance is properly applicable to this Bill.  I do not think we should visualise the position in which, if the Minister had to meet a guarantee under this Bill, say for £1,000,000, he could go and make a separate arrangement with some lender to charge for this separate purpose.  It should all be merged as part of the general Central Fund arrangements for the financial year in which it operates.  What I have particularly in mind is that in relation to the general Central Fund advances and the methods of charging them, there are statutory provisions about the moneys that must be given, in relation to the tabling and so forth.  That position does not operate here.</P>
      <P>As far as I can understand, the effect of this section is that if the Minister has to pay £1,000,000 under guarantee and chooses to meet that guarantee, and having met it, if the banks are down £1,000,000 on the guarantee and the Minister agrees to meet it as an action under this sub-section by issuing 5 per cent. stock or 6 per cent. stock, or any stock he likes in lieu, and pays off the guarantee that way, he could do it under sub-section (3).  It does not follow at all that he has to take the same steps as he normally has to take in relation to Central Fund payments and making them public.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the vacation, I had an opportunity to make a few remarks.  I directed whatever time I had to this matter of the lengthy address made by the Minister.  He made no reference to any amelioration of the conditions of almost 9,000 State personnel who are covered by these Votes.  The personnel is divided in this way.  The main bulk would be members of the Guards themselves and their officers, but, in addition, there are such people as warders attached to the prisons and there are certain court officers.  The Minister was kind enough to give me a typescript, but in <Col N="108" /> the Minister's typescript, I find no reference whatever to the amelioration of their conditions.</P>
      <P>I raised that point on their behalf before the Easter vacation.  I am glad at least to see that there has been some change of attitude by the Government in respect of State servants since that time.  The civil servants have been offered a compromise with regard to their pay.  It would seem that, prior to Easter, we were going back to the old-time conditions of Emergency Powers Orders which restricted any increase in wages to State personnel.</P>
      <P>I previously described the matter, before the war, as an immoral proceeding. That phrase is not lightly chosen.  It does not come from myself. I am given to understand&mdash;I have personal reasons for knowing&mdash;that certain ecclesiastics addressed letters to the Government, prior to 1947, querying their attitude towards people like court officers and State personnel, such as members of the Civic Guard and officers of that force.  Some of them got the reply that State servants were in a different position from people in the industrial world and in agriculture, and that if any increase were given in their wages, they were paid out of the extra prices sought for their commodities and that in the end it was borne on the increased cost and price for the commodities.  The answer was that the Government could not afford to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A contrast was then made.  It was a contrast I wanted to make very fully, but which I can now make only in a limited way.  It is no answer to people to say to them that we agree that everybody outside the State personnel has got an increase in his emoluments equal to the increased cost of living, particularly when the increased cost of living has been brought about by Government action in such a way as by the reduction of the subsidies.  It is no answer, in so far as State personnel are concerned, to say: &ldquo;We admit that the cost of living has risen, that you have in justice a claim, but we are not going to give it because we do not propose to raise the taxes to provide the money.&rdquo; It is not on any question of merits; it is not because State personnel <Col N="109" /> are less deserving than those in the outside world, but simply because those people are under the thumb of the Government and the Government are in complete control of whatever wages may be given.  To say that is to make a distinction on certain circumstances, not on the merits and certainly not on justice.</P>
    <P>I want to make the remark that the Government were living from day to day on what they had scrounged out of what was justly due to the civil servants as a group and the members and officers of the Garda.  The position has now changed to some extent, but only to this extent, that some compromise has been achieved as between the Government and representatives of the Civil Service.  It is clearly a compromise agreement.  There is a clear admission that if civil servants went to arbitration, they would get a bigger award than that which they have been asked to agree upon.  The only reason they are asked to agree is that the Government finds itself in a parlous condition, having promised to get the cost of living reduced, and end emigration and now finds that these things have gone in the opposite direction.</P>
    <P>There is greater misery in the country and those who are depending on State aid have increased in numbers. The Government says they admit their claim but that if they go to arbitration they will go to Dáil Eireann and say: &ldquo;We do not propose to pay as we do not want to increase taxation.&rdquo; Some compromise has been arrived at in regard to civil servants in so far as they are under administrative control. Those attached to prisons, court officers, civil servants and Guards will get something in the way of a compromise. They are asked to accept that because the Government is in such a parlous condition, notwithstanding their promises to get cracking, that it cannot do anything but eke out a miserable existence. They are not paying to civil servants as much as they believe arbitration would give them.</P>
    <P>However, for such advantage as the civil servants and other State personnel have got, they may be truly thankful. We may be somewhat thankful. The bad example is given and this immoral <Col N="110" /> procedure is being pursued simply because these people are under Government control.  The Government have not the same strength in regard to people in industry and agriculture. I do not see that there will be any possibility of getting satisfactory work from the civil servants or any of the State personnel, as long as they are led to feel, as they are at the moment, that they are not being given conditions equivalent to those gained by those in the outside world who are able to put on industrial pressure.</P>
    <P>In the second page of the typescript, there is reference to an interim report on crime.  It shows that there was an increase in the number of indictable offences.  I do not know whether what appeared in the paper recently is something more than an interim report. Yesterday's <i>Irish Independent</i> carried the news that the number of indictable offences in the Republic was 14,322 in 1957 as against 12,782 in 1956. It is quite clear that crime is up.  In that, it is like the cost of living and the numbers of those unemployed and those emigrating.  All these things are up, and there is some relationship between the two things.</P>
    <P>It has always been understood that by what is called &ldquo;undeserved poverty&rdquo; is meant people who are prejudiced in their livelihood by Government action which raises their cost of living without giving any recompense to meet it.  Then, again, there is, unfortunately, a resort by some people who feel they have been badly treated and who resolve to get their own back on the community.</P>
    <P>Crime is up by 12 per cent., and the Minister gave some details.  He says that most of the increase is attributable to the fact that in the course of the year the number of bicycles stolen exceeded the number stolen in the previous year by more than 1,000.  The Minister continues:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The figures, which are provisional and subject to correction, put the number of indictable offences known to the police last year at a total of 14,322 for the whole country as compared with a total of 12,782 in the previous year and 11,531 in 1955.  In <Col N="111" /> the Dublin Metropolitan District alone the number of indictable offences known to the police have risen to 8,750 as compared with 7,120 such offences in 1956 and 6,333 in 1955.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a significant increase.  The Minister contented himself with giving that statistical fact, without going into any consideration of what drove people to commit so many offences as to make such an increase in the number of offences committed in the period 1955-56 and those committed in the period 1956-57.  We are told that, as usual, about 95 per cent. of these crimes&mdash;that is to say, of the total volume of indictable crime&mdash;consisted of the offences of housebreaking, stealing and other forms of dishonesty, and that it is in this field that there has been the most persistent and progressive deterioration in public morality. I wonder if the Minister does not stop, or get the officers of his Department to stop, at that point and ask &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I read a statement made by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare.  I know he withdrew part of it, but, according to the statement as reported in the Press, there was such an amount of known fraud being perpetrated in connection with social welfare benefits that, as he put it, the Supplementary Estimates likely to be introduced last year would be of the order of £3,000,000 to £4,000,000.  On being questioned in this House, he ran away from that statement, but said that the known fraud in connection with people trying to get what they thought the State owed them by way of social benefits was of an order that meant £3,000,000 to £4,000,000 in Supplementary Estimates in a financial year.</P>
    <P>When questioned, I admit he said it was not a very clear explanation.  It amounted to the fact that he was at a Fianna Fáil convention in his own area where he was asked a lot of questions.  He promised everything to everybody and wound up cheerfully by saying that if all these things he was asked to do and promised to do were brought to fulfilment, they would cost from £3,000,000 to £4,000,000.  In other <Col N="112" /> words, he was complaining that at conventions people were clamouring for services and that he had committed the Government to an expenditure of between £3,000,000 and £4,000,000.</P>
    <P>There have been conferences over the Easter.  Some of them were of a sodality type.  Some were composed of groups of laymen with ecclesiastics attached and some groups were composed of ecclesiastics alone.  However, there have been at least two of these in which in one case, a clerical member and, in the other case, a layman, but speaking under the supervision of certain clerics, said that fraud was notorious in the country in respect of fraudulent claims for benefits.  One precise statement was made that a number of people were known to have had employment cards signed for them by people in whose employment they had not been.  If social welfare and if the Welfare State is allowed to deteriorate to the point where people believe they are entitled to claim, whether the claim is honest or not but simply because the Government are providing the funds, then the position is really serious.</P>
    <P>It may be argued that there are people who, in their desperate positions, believe there is no great difference between other people's property and their own.  They may make wrongful and fraudulent demands for social welfare benefits and employment benefits, taking the view that they may as well have the benefit of whatever is going.  In that way, we come to have stealing, housebreaking, larceny and so on.</P>
    <P>The Minister congratulated himself that there is no significant change in juvenile crime, which has shown a slight decline.  He continues:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;But the fact that in 1957 there were no fewer than 2,368 persons under 18 charged, and a further 665 cautioned in respect of indictable offences shows how serious the situation is...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then he adds: &ldquo;...the more so as it is likely that these figures do not tell the whole story&rdquo;: that is not even guesswork or suspicion, but knowledge. That is a shocking state of affairs.  The <Col N="113" /> Minister, as a member of the Government, has collective responsibility for their financial and economic measures and must take full responsibility for the fact that, due possibly to the policy of other Departments which he connives at, even if he is not an enthusiastic supporter, there is deterioration in public conduct in regard to indictable crime.</P>
    <P>In his opening statement, the Minister says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In view of the crime wave, I would be glad to be able to tell the House that there had been an increase in the proportion of the indictable offences known to the police that have been cleared up.  But this is not the case and, while the position outside Dublin is little changed at over 80 per cent., the percentage of detections in Dublin has dropped from about 40 per cent. to about 32 per cent.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is outrageous.  There is a significant increase in the number of indictable crimes which have not been cleared up.</P>
    <P>I take that statement to include people apprehended but not convicted. The figure is very enlightening.  Of the known indictable crimes, not more than one-third are cleared up by police detection and the bringing of the case to the courts.  The Minister continues:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To put the matter in perspective, however, I should mention, first of all, that a detection rate of 32 per cent. for a large urban area is roughly the same as that obtaining in comparable conditions in other countries and, secondly, that the rate is affected to a very large extent by the detection rate for larceny, which cannot but be low from the nature of the crime, though larceny is, of all crimes, the one that is most frequently committed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I want to know about that.  We are told that a detection rate of 32 per cent. for a large urban area is roughly the same as that obtaining in comparable conditions in other countries.</P>
    <P>About ten years ago, two articles appeared in successive issues of the <i>Garda Review</i>, obviously written by a <Col N="114" /> man who knew the circumstances.  I think I was told afterwards that they were written by an ex-member of the Garda.  He started off to examine whether the methods of police organisation in this country were good and whether the circumstances that surrounded the police were such as would lead to a proper apprehension of criminals.  In these two articles, he reported adversely on the then organisation, which is very nearly the present organisation, and on the circumstances.</P>
    <P>He brought out this fact.  He took our population and he took the population of Wales, England and Scotland, and he took the number of crimes that were known to have been committed. He related those to individuals and then thought of how many crimes were committed in relation to the population&mdash;the percentage, so to speak.  It was a most excellent thing that he should have got the figures.  He then went on to ask if these countries were better provided with detectives or police of the ordinary uniformed-type than this country.  He divided these areas into urban areas and country areas.</P>
    <P>I have not the article under my eye at the moment, but, as far as I remember, his conclusion was that this country had more police in relation to our population, either rural or urban, than the other parts of the old United Kingdom.  He concluded that we were better policed, in the sense that we had more police, but there were more crimes being committed, notwithstanding that we had more police in this comparable part of the old United Kingdom, dividing them and comparing them as far as the urban areas and rural areas were concerned.</P>
    <P>When it came to bringing people to book, he concluded that we are again deficient, in comparison with those operating the forces of law and order in England, Scotland and Wales. Therefore, in all three circumstances, he said, there was a greater proportion of crime to the numbers of the population; and although we had more police to the number of population or even to the number of crimes committed, there were fewer people, proportionately, <Col N="115" /> brought to book than there were in any of these other countries.  If those conclusions are correct, it would seem to me that, if we had the numbers in the police, there was something wrong with the organisation or the system.  It would seem that, when it came to detection of crime and bringing offenders to book, there was either something wrong with the police, in not being able to get these offenders or else something wrong in the court system which enabled people properly brought before the courts to get away under the Probation Act or with something light in the way of sentence.</P>
    <P>A further matter is the remarkable trend in the detection rate, which shows a drop of 40 to 32 per cent. in the metropolitan area.  We have to comfort ourselves with the fact that this is roughly the same as compared with comparable conditions in other countries.  Certainly, the Minister's remarks before Easter will not be received with any great enthusiasm when he is found to recommend to the owners of premises and warehouses that they should appoint their own police by having a system of night watchmen.  He says there are many cases where, in view of the value of the goods stored and the easiness with which the stores could be broken into, it would be wise to employ night watchmen on whom the owners could reasonably depend.  In other words, the Minister is trying to off-load the protection of property from the police forces in the city to the owners of warehouses.  In so far as the question is one of the ease with which stores can be broken into, surely something could be done about that, in the case of those who own property where valuable goods are stored?  If they are easily broken into, their attention should be drawn to it and they should be asked to take some precautions to make it difficult for housebreaking to occur on the scale on which it is occurring.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that these firms should employ night watchmen, &ldquo;especially in view of the number of ex-Civic Guards who are out on pension and who could be employed at this <Col N="116" /> work.&rdquo; In other words, the Minister says: &ldquo;We have got rid of a number of Guards, they have gone out on pension; you ought to take better care of your premises; we have grand experienced men who were in the Civic Guards and they will look after your premises.&rdquo; If that sentence had not occurred on the page succeeding that in which we are told that the detections had dropped from 40 to 32 per cent., it might have been a better recommendation. Instead, however, the Minister said: &ldquo;We have a lot of Civic Guards out on pension; I am sorry to have to tell you these are the people under whose auspices the detection rate in indictable crime in Dublin dropped from 40 to 32 per cent.&rdquo; It was not the best possible recommendation to give to owners of warehouses that they should take in men who had gone out on pension from the Guards over whom he presides.</P>
    <P>The Minister has spoken of the number of Civic Guards.  He says it is 1,000 fewer than 10 years ago and 100 or so less than it was on the 1st April last year.  I should like to know from him why the numbers have gone down by 100 in the last year.  That is possibly the point to which he might address himself first.  I should like to know, and I think the country should know, why the number has gone down to 1,000 fewer than it was ten years ago.  In so far as it represents a reduction in the cost of the service, I welcome it.  I often thought that the number of Guards we have could be better used if the system were better organised.</P>
    <P>Those two articles in the <i>Garda Review</i> of about two years ago, to which I have referred already, accurately and critically examined the whole situation with regard to the police and made recommendations. Those are recommendations which in an intervening period I did my best to foster in connection with the disposition of the Guards and the system under which they work.</P>
    <P>Those articles recommended that there should be fewer centres, certainly fewer centres in which there were a large number of men, and that they should be better organised to do work <Col N="117" /> over a bigger area, by having more transport.  In relation to that, so far as I remember, there was a recommendation that there should be fixed hours in the Gárda barracks for routine work.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the slogan still persists among the Guards, a slogan which I heard very many years ago, that &ldquo;A Guard is always on duty.&rdquo; He should not be.  I remember once urging that the number could be reduced and I got certain memoranda to show what Civic Guards did, and I indicated it would not do the country any harm if they did not bother their heads about some of these things.  I was told to remember that all the while the great thing was that a Civic Guard was &ldquo;always on duty,&rdquo; that he was never off duty.</P>
    <P>I have seen some of these Civic Guards on duty.  I am not criticising the individual in what I say now. Occasionally, when motoring through the country I have gone into Civic Guard barracks.  I found the man on duty on a hot day, sitting with his tunic loosened, with his feet on the table; and smoking.  He is really not occupied at all and perhaps does not want to be there.  He is there because of the persistence in the view that there must be somebody always on duty.  Examine the conditions in some of those stations and you find that reports have to be made to the Guards when something has happened.  The Guard either calls on somebody or there may be a prosecution.  Someone has to prosecute and then a licence or a certificate of insurance has to be brought to the barracks.  The situation apparently is that there must be a Guard always on duty, no matter at what hour a person calls to produce the document.</P>
    <P>There are certain returns which Civic Guards are ordered to collect. Sometimes this is done by way of asking people to fill up forms and the forms then have to be returned. Apparently, again, there must be in any station, right through the whole of the day&mdash;I do not know whether it has to be right through the 24 hours&mdash; somebody there on duty so that reports may be always possible of reception, in case someone comes in with a report <Col N="118" /> or a return.  I suggest that is nonsense. If returns have to be made, why should the Guards not have office hours the same as anyone else?  In any small town or townland, why should not the office be open during hours stated in the notice&mdash;say from 10 to 12 and from 3 to 5, or some stipulated hours?</P>
    <P>There must be somebody there to receive documents but let us get rid of this idea that a Guard must always be on duty.  Duty of that kind exhausts strength, the only strength this country can afford, and that is certainly not any more than the numbers we have at the moment.  It exhausts the strength of those who must be borne by the community, in an unprofitable way.  I understand that over recent years there has been considerable development in the use of transport. I do not know if it has gone far enough.  I suggest this question should be examined further, to see if there can be a bigger reduction of centres, with the work being done over the area by some better provision of transport.</P>
    <P>I am well aware that, as in the case of post offices and so on, if there be a Garda barracks of a certain strength in a particular town and a rumour spreads that, instead of having one officer and four men, the strength is to be reduced to an officer and two men immediately the population is up, protests are signed, and deputations are sent to the Minister.  The whole of the area is thrown into excited confusion at the thought that the strength of the Gardaí serving the particular area is likely to be changed, even if a good case can be made that an area depending on this particular centre would be better served by more transport.  I know well that these are the considerations the Minister has to think of.  I do feel that in present circumstances people are crying out loud, with good reason, for a reduction in the cost of State services. There should be some other examination of whether the strength of the Civic Guards can either be reduced or better employed by the greater provision of motor transport.</P>
    <P>In that connection, in Dublin&mdash;and the Minister's speech referred to this &mdash;there is a vast amount of the Guards' <Col N="119" /> time taken up by concentrating on, or more or less observing, minor offences of the parking type, the parking of motor cars or scooters.  The procedure in regard to these offences in the courts is most wasteful and certainly extravagant.  It is something the community should not be asked to bear. A person parks either for too long a period or in the wrong place.  The Civic Guard comes along and sometimes he is content to place a notice on the car and sometimes the person is summoned for the offence.</P>
    <P>It is an education to go to the courts on a day on which there are a whole lot of these offenders before the court.  You get a group of Guards sworn collectively&mdash;about five of them are sworn together, each with one hand on the Testament.  A Guard then proceeds to read from his notebook and calls out the names of the offenders.  Mainly the offenders do not appear in court&mdash;possibly I am mixing these up with the cycling offenders, the hardened criminals of this country who ride bicycles without lamps or who have not got rear reflectors.</P>
    <P>But to get back to this performance of a number of Civic Guards being sworn in collectively, they read from their notebooks and the district justice listens and asks is &ldquo;Mr. So-and-So&rdquo; present.  Mainly the offenders are not present.  As far as the district justices whom I have heard dealing with these cases are concerned, they seem to have made a system for themselves. There are people who are summoned for not having lights on their bicycles, and if they come down to court the district justice asks them: &ldquo;Are you out from work?&rdquo; If the answer is &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, he says: &ldquo;Have you lost money by coming to court?&rdquo; If the answer is again &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, the district justice says: &ldquo;Well, you have lost money by coming down here to-day&rdquo;, and he fines them 7/6.  If a man is not present, if he has decided to pay whatever fine is imposed and not to lose his day's wages, generally the fine is double or three times for not appearing.</P>
    <P>What happens after that?  I am told that many a man has come to court <Col N="120" /> knowing that he is going to be fined 5/- or 10/-, and has that 5/- or 10/- to give out of his pocket, and then it will not be taken from him because the position is that the district justice has all the sheets up in front of him, which he is signing&mdash;a race against time. Until the office can get hold of the sheet with the district justice's signature, the fine will not be accepted, and what happens?  A man has left his car, perhaps inadvertently, perhaps deliberately, for longer than the recognised period and he is fined, and 10/- has to be collected from him.</P>
    <P>A Guard appears at a suburban residence and the neighbours wonder what the man has done.  The Guard comes out and either there is not 10/- in the house, or the man and his wife are out and the maid has not got the money to pay the fine.  I am told that the average is three applications made personally by a Guard to recover a fine which a man is willing to pay on the spot and which will not be taken because office conditions will not allow it.  If that is anything like the case, there should be some amendment to it.</P>
    <P>There was a suggestion considered by an inter-departmental committee, and I do not understand why it was not accepted, that the Civic Guard be given power to fine on the spot, always subject to the individual offender's rights to object to being fined on the spot, or to say either that he has not been parked for too long, or parked outside the regulation hours, or that in any event there are some extenuating circumstances.  Take the case where a person agrees to be fined on the spot. He has parked a car for longer than the time allowed.  A Guard comes along and supposing the maximum fine is 5/- or 10/-, and the Guard says to that person: &ldquo;Pay me 5/-.  You need not come to court, I will report you for having committed the offence and report to the court that you admitted the offence and paid the fine.&rdquo; I understand that there were objections to that on constitutional grounds and that that was not proper procedure, because, under the Constitution, justice must be administered in public and in the courts.  The argument ran that to impose fines on the side of the <Col N="121" /> street was not administering justice in the courts, but of course it is.  The sequel to that would be that the Guard would appear in the courts before a district justice on a particular day and would report that he had found a citizen who had parked for too long a period, that the citizen had admitted his guilt and had paid whatever was the maximum fine and the district justice would probably call his name, and, whether the man was there or not, say: &ldquo;Fined 10/-&rdquo;, or whatever was the fine.  There would be no necessity for the Guard to go off to the citizen's house to collect the money.</P>
    <P>Why that system was not inaugurated, I do not know.  It could be inaugurated. I join that up with another point.  I know that, in recent years, efforts have been made by the officials of the Department of Justice to shorten and simplify court procedure. I do not think any legislation is required for it.  I am pretty certain, and I have read considerably on the matter in recent months, that this can be done by Rules of Court.  The Rules of Court can be made by the judges and the judges are supposed to report to the Minister yearly as to how the administration is going and what amendments they think necessary.</P>
    <P>I know that, amongst other items of procedure, something should be done to get away from the terribly laborious system of taking depositions in cases where there is a prospect that a person may be sent forward for trial.  We have this laborious system in which witnesses parade, and, while I do not say it is the normal thing, very often it occurs that the State has upwards of two dozen witnesses.  Each of these steps into the witness-box, is sworn and then speaks his evidence.  The evidence is written down in longhand by the District Court clerk.  Over and over again, I have seen cases in which the district justice, feeling that the clerk's hand must be getting paralysed by all the writing he has to do, has taken over the writing of the evidence himself.  The procedure originally was to have these things taken down in writing, in manuscript, and then read over.  There are a lot of other conditions&mdash;an accused must be there or <Col N="122" /> must be represented, and people giving evidence are open to cross-examination. That has all to be taken down and the statement is read over to the witness and he signs it.  If the Minister would ask some of the Attorney-General's officials to send him a few selected files, he will see the amount of work that goes into the recording of the preliminary matter, which then has to go forward.</P>
    <P>I know that, in emergencies, certain courts have resorted to taking depositions on typewriting machines.  The evidence of the witness as he speaks is recorded and tapped out on typewriters. There are noiseless typewriters which do not interrupt court work by having evidence recorded in that way.  That procedure has been criticised.  If a court could make it possible to have these depositions or recordings taken in that way, and thus save all the terrible labour which there is on the part of the court clerk or on his chief, if, in circumstances, the district justice takes over from him, the essentials of justice will have been done, no matter how the evidence has been recorded.  The evidence can then be read over, either that day or the next day&mdash;in fact, it would be much better to be done that day, so that the witness does not get a chance to change his mind.  If a person's evidence is recorded and then read over to him, it could be in a shorthand script and the transcription could be read over to him later on, that day or next morning. That would not, however, be proper at the moment, but it could be made proper and there is nothing illegal in what I have said, in what I recommend.</P>
    <P>There was one other thing which was tried and it would be a great benefit to everybody, litigants, practitioners and judiciaries themselves, if it could be extended.  It is not possible to take evidence on what we call the jury side of the courts, excepting in the way that is ordinarily done, the person speaking, giving his evidence orally.  That is important evidence the pivotal evidence, a man in the witness-box sworn and giving his evidence orally.  It is not possible to have any system of recording that, <Col N="123" /> because there are frequent interruptions, the prosecutor continually asking questions, and it is not easy to get the run of who is asking questions and who is answering; but, in the chancery courts, where the procedure is not so confused&mdash;I do not speak disrespectfully of the other side when I say this&mdash;the witnesses speak at length and it is generally not a question of quick fire, of question and answer.  It is more sedate answering and the experiment has been attempted to have a tape recorder used in chancery courts.</P>
    <P>One of our judges did allow a tape recorder to be used as an experiment in his court and I understand that his report afterwards was, not that the tape recording system was bad but that it had certain defects, and he said these could be cured by very slight adaptation.  If one uses these dictaphones or recorders, there is a way in which one can interrupt at certain stages.</P>
    <P>I have no very reliable information, but I have been told that whatever difficulties were discovered in the attempt to record evidence by tape recorders are ones that could be easily overcome by the court registrar making certain breaks and putting in statements of who is speaking at certain times.  It may be the witness, or it may be counsel asking questions, or the judge asking questions for clarification. Those are the three parties concerned, and if that system could be extended it would be of enormous benefit, and would shorten cases which, in itself, would mean a diminution in the costs of trials of actions.</P>
    <P>I am suggesting also that under the Rules of Court&mdash;I will quote the Rules of Court section in a moment&mdash;a great deal of improvement could be made. Improvements have been made already on the other side of the water under the Rules of Court over there.  A great improvement could be made in the cases which form the bulk of the cases which come before our courts.  There is the common case of the accident type, the case which turns on negligence.  I want to give an example I know of.  I do not say it is very typical, that it <Col N="124" /> occurs very often, but this type of thing occurs over and over again.  An accident takes place on a straight bit of road.  A person becomes a plaintiff after he is injured and takes an action against whoever ran him down, and there is an insurance company in the background.  Both the plaintiff and the defendant insist on getting a map of the road.  The road may be as straight as one could imagine a road to be.  If there are hedges along the sides, a turn to the left or a turn to the right, all that has to be shown.</P>
    <P>The plaintiff gets a map showing every feature of a straight road and the defendant gets a map of the same straight road, showing exactly the same physical features, the turns and the widths of the road at certain points.  It becomes worse than that. Not only does the plaintiff have a map made of the straight bit of road, but he will also get a photograph taken. and sometimes two, one from the city end and one from the other end.  The defendant also gets photographs of the same thing.  Both people appear in court.  Generally, one gives evidence and if there is any divergence between them, that is got out by cross-examination of that witness.  The general result is that the second photographer and the second mapper is not always called, but they have been feed for the case and they form part of the expenses, whether they are called or not. They have prepared maps and photographs and if they appear as witnesses, they have to be feed.  That is nonsensical and it no longer happens in England.</P>
    <P>There is another type of case in which a person has been injured and it is an agreed matter between the doctors on both sides that the man has been incapacitated for the work he has been doing for six months.  One question that has to be determined, supposing negligence is proved against the defendant, is the amount of the loss of wages which the plaintiff has suffered.  Taking it that there is agreement between the doctors that the person has been incapacitated for six months, his wages have to be determined for that period.  The firm is called to say what the man's wages <Col N="125" /> were and, if there is any dispute about it, they have to come to court with their wages book and statements to show what the man was getting.</P>
    <P>They are sometimes asked to say what the man's wages were for a year before the accident, to see if the six months' wages he is claiming are a typical six months' wages.  There is usually a certain amount of cross-questioning as to whether insurance has been paid and a number of questions arising out of that, but the whole thing is capable of easy settlement by one side producing the wages book and the other side accepting it.  This is not done, I will not say in all cases but in many cases.  In England they do not allow that sort of thing to happen.  If a defendant there did not accept the wages book on production, then he would be mulcted in the sense that he would not be allowed costs or the costs would be diminished in certain respects.</P>
    <P>Another question is that of injuries, what injuries did a man suffer, and after that you are told exactly what they were, whether they were fractures, torn ligaments, and so on. There is also the question as to how long did the injuries incapacitate the person.  This procedure is gone through with a doctor and surgeon appearing for the injured man.  They make statements on oath in the box as to what they found in the way of injuries and give their view of how long the disability had lasted.  Counsel, instructed by an opposing doctor or surgeon, asks these two people, the surgeon and the doctor, questions designed to minimise either the seriousness of the injuries or the residual effects.  Eventually, the defendant may produce his doctor and his surgeon to give evidence contrary to what already has been given.</P>
    <P>The situation in England is that on what is called a summons for direction, people are asked to get medical reports.  If the medical witnesses cannot agree, there are times when the court is empowered to send in a medical assessor.  He listens to the doctor and the surgeon on both sides and makes a report which the judge accepts and which the jury has to <Col N="126" /> accept.  We go through all this confusion, extravagance and increased costs by having, as I said, double maps, double sketches, double photographs, conflicts about wages which could be settled in the main by the production of a wages book, and then a whole lot of confusion in regard to specific injuries and the disability arising therefrom.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt there are many cases which turn in the end upon a jury's view as to how long a man reasonably could claim he was disabled as a result of certain agreed injuries and that, I suppose, will always have to be left in controversy; but the exact injuries and the exact time a man was suffering in such a way that he could not, say, put a foot under him, could not possibly go back to work, could often be agreed on in our courts.  That would make a tremendous difference. It would mean a saving in cost, in the non-production of certain witnesses, in the non-production of certain material, and so on, and having single agreed reports.  Not merely would the cost of these things be saved but there would also be saved the costs of the case.  A case might easily be disposed of where, shall we say, there is the mere assessment of damages where negligence is admitted and where all that has to be decided by the jury is how much the person should get.  That case could be very much shortened, if we had a procedure corresponding to what they have in England.</P>
    <P>My attention was directed recently to a report in an English newspaper in regard to the position in England. It covers the three matters about which I have spoken, simplifying the procedure in the District Court with regard to depositions, secondly, allowing people to be, so to speak, convicted on admission on the kerbstone and fined on the kerbstone and, thirdly, simplifying the procedure in the higher courts, more particularly in regard to accident cases.</P>
    <P>The <i>London Times</i> on 11th January had a note with reference to the new Act that was brought in in England. It is headed: &ldquo;Pleading Guilty on Form 903.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;One of the results of the new Magistrates' Courts Act, 1957, was <Col N="127" /> felt at Bow Street Court yesterday when all the defendants summoned for travelling on the railway without previously paying their fares, with intent to avoid payment, sent in a Form 903, pleading guilty.  There were, therefore, no ticket collectors as witnesses, no prosecuting counsel representing the railway, no one in the public gallery, and nearly no costs.</P>
    <P>Particulars on the 903s were read by William Walsh, ticket inspector. The defendants' letters were read out by the Magistrate's Clerk, and the Magistrate (Mr. Geraint Rees) imposed the fines.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The effect of this new Act in England is that people are given a notification in respect of minor crimes.  They have to be non-indictable crimes, cases of the summary jurisdiction type.  The people are given a notice that they are to be summoned for a particular thing, then told by notice that they may plead guilty and then certain things follow. Their letters are read to the court and the court proceeds in their absence, as if they had been there and pleaded guilty or not guilty, depending on the circumstances of the letters.</P>
    <P>Before I leave the English situation, may I refer to the case of the Audlet Land Company, Ltd., against Kendall. It was reported in 1955, First Weekly Law Reports, page 639 and it refers to rules of the Supreme Court in relation to Order 37A, Rule 1, and I extract one relevant part from that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In a case to be tried without a jury the judge may in his discretion at any time on the application of any party appoint an independent expert (&ldquo;The Court Expert&rdquo;) to inquire and report upon any question of fact or opinion not involving a question of law or construction.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In this case, actually the expert included in his report a whole lot of matter which everybody agreed was irrelevant.  That did not destroy his report.  They cut out the irrelevant part and the rest of the report was included as evidence.  Under the English Supreme Court rules, Order 30, <Col N="128" /> under the heading Summons for Direction, there is a headnote which reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This Order is entirely new.  It is the result of the recommendations of the Evershed Report.  The intention is that there should be a thorough stocktaking relating to issues in connection with the manner in which the evidence should be presented at a trial with a view to shortening the length of the trial and saving costs generally.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The first part of that Order goes on to speak of orders for the discovery of documents for inspection.  Sometimes there may have to be a general order for discovery, but sometimes that is not so.  If there is either a restricted order for discovery or no order for discovery, then the full direction for the trial may be given.  Later it says in this headnote to the Order: &ldquo;Such directions are given as to the future course of the action as appear best directed to secure the just, expeditious and economical disposal of it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Again, it says that the court, if required by both parties is not unwilling to decide mainly or exclusively on documentary or other evidence which would not, except by consent, be available or admissible in evidence; in other words, they can even go to the point, by consent, of allowing documents or records or memoranda not usually admitted in evidence to be brought in with a view to shortening the case and therefore to diminishing the costs of it.  In particular, they may amend the pleadings or endorsements. They may order the admission in evidence of statements and documents, notwithstanding that the makers of the statements are not called as witnesses or the original documents are not produced; and they may give directions as to the method of giving evidence. Altogether, the court is to endeavour to secure that the parties make all admissions and agreements as to the course of the proceedings which might reasonably be made by them.  The whole endeavour is to secure that there will not be time wasted and costs incurred in bringing unnecessary witnesses.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="129" /> Later, the Order, which deals with evidence generally, lays it down that all or any evidence may be produced by affidavit of particular facts, by a statement of them, or an information or belief, by books that are produced or entries from them, by copies of documents or entries in the documents. It goes on to speak of the limitation of medical and expert evidence.  These witnesses may be limited in number as specified in the Order.  In other words, the parties in a building contract will be allowed so many expert witnesses&mdash; one engineer and one builders' representative. The court can limit the number of witnesses who can be called and will be allowed on taxation.  There is limitation of plans, scales, maps and so forth in evidence.</P>
    <P>All that paraphernalia has long since disappeared from the English courts and is no longer tolerated there.  A plaintiff or a defendant cannot produce mappers, photographers and so forth, and claim fees for them as against the losing party.  I am not reading the whole of the Order.  I am just giving the gist of it.  I do not intend to refer any further to the magistrates' courts.  This is the Act of 1957 and certain arrangements are made there.  Once they are complied with, to get the situation disclosed in that note, then the position is covered. Those who travel by rail intending to avoid payment may plead guilty and they need make no appearance.  They pay the fine afterwards.  If that procedure were adopted here, a Guard could collect the fine, giving a receipt for it.  That would mean tremendous expedition in court procedure, as well as avoiding this annoyance of suburban householders being visited two or three times for the collection of a fine for a parking offence, though the neighbours may think the matter is something very serious, instead of just a minor offence.</P>
    <P>We have rule-making authorities for all our courts, one for the Supreme and High Courts, one for the Circuit Court and one for the District Court. The secretary of each of these rule-making committees must summon a meeting of the committee for the purpose of general consideration by such <Col N="130" /> committee of the practice, procedure and administration of the court in relation to which such committee is constituted, and the law affecting or administered by such court.</P>
    <P>In Section 75, provision is made that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;As soon as conveniently may be after each meeting of any such committee in pursuance of this section such committee shall report to the Minister whether any and, if so, what amendments or alterations should in the opinion of such committee be made in the practice, procedure or administration of the court or in the law affecting or administered by such court with a view to the improvement of the administration of justice.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to tell me how many of such reports he has received. Has he ever received any recommendation from any of these rule-making committees as to what amendments or alterations should be made in the practice, procedure or administration of the courts, leaving out amendments of the law?  Do the departmental files record the receipt of any reports from these rule-making committees?  If so, would the Minister be good enough to state what improvements they suggested in the practice, procedure and administration of the various courts?  The Minister might urge the various committees to adopt the type of procedure they have in England.  We have an equivalent rule-making authority here, and I suggest an effort should be made to bring about an improvement in procedure and practice.</P>
    <P>There are two or three minor matters to which I should like to refer.  I do not intend to speak at any length on the Solicitors Order which was made and which was kept out of this House by a resort to the Seanad.  The Seanad turned down an Order which had been agreed as between the Minister and the professional body with which he had been in consultation.  The Minister might reveal to the House what that Order was, how it was arrived at, what it effected, how it came and the reason why it was refused.  I think the Minister <Col N="131" /> was accompanied by the Taoiseach in the Seanad, and both of them said they were running considerable risk in agreeing to amendments proposed in the Seanad, because they did not know what the Government might do.  Their excuse was that they were all for the Solicitors Order, with certain amendments, but the Government turned them down.  I should like the Minister to clarify the exact position in relation to that Order.</P>
    <P>I understand&mdash;I have no precise experience of this myself&mdash;that certain people find themselves embarrassed by the fact that the vacations common to the courts as a whole are also accepted by the court officers.  Not so many years ago, it was not possible to have a vacation judge hear a case, unless there was a very very strong point of urgency in the matter.  That procedure has been somewhat modified, though not in the case of very big issues in regard to urgency.  I am told that the court offices close down for the same period as the courts and occasionally difficulty arises.  The accountant's office closes down and there is no way of getting payments out.  Nobody wants to deprive court officers of any vacation to which they are entitled, but the suggestion has been made that at least there should be somebody in attendance over a substantial period&mdash; not necessarily the whole period&mdash;to make payments out.  I ask the Minister to see that the very good record that the Department of Justice had in recent years with regard to law reform should not be taken away.  There is a great need for a great many pieces of legislation reforming the law.  I ask that the Minister should administratively see that the Department be allowed to advance along the lines along which they have been advancing for the past five or six years.  There have been quite a number of good pieces of legislation of the law reform type produced in the last four or five years.  There are a few others still on the stocks.  I wish they could be expedited. If those who are zealous in these matters were given a little bit more freedom and more time, there are many points to which these officers could direct their attention, but to <Col N="132" /> which they have not yet directed their attention, in the way of producing draft results.</P>
    <P>A lot of our law is very much out of date.  We are here trying negligence cases in connection with motor-cars, mechanically propelled vehicles, going at extraordinary speeds compared with the speed at which the old horse and cart and pony and trap used to go.  We are still considering the law of contributory negligence by what is ordinarily referred to as &ldquo;the hobbled ass&rdquo; case which occurred more than a hundred years ago.  That was the Davies v. Mann case where the gentleman drove his wagon and horse over a donkey which had been hobbled and left on the roadside, and the question of contributory negligence arose.  He was not entitled to recover, notwithstanding the negligence of the person who left the ass on the road in a way in which it could not get away.  The man driving the wagon could have avoided the consequences of that, if he had used ordinary care.  That is the phrase we are still trying to apply in connection with accident cases brought about, in the main, by mechanically-propelled vehicles.</P>
    <P>We have a great deal of confusion, over what lawyers will know as the third question.  Two questions are put. &ldquo;Is the defendant guilty of negligence?&rdquo; If so, that finishes the case. The second question is: &ldquo;Is the plaintiff guilty of negligence?&rdquo; Sometimes that finishes the case, but sometimes one goes on to the third question: &ldquo;Notwithstanding the negligence, could one of the parties, by the use of reasonable care, have avoided the consequences of the other person's negligence?&rdquo; There are cases up and down and there have been zig-zag decisions. I do not think any member of the judiciary would say that there is a clear view as to when the third question may be left to juries and what is the result of the jury's determination of that.  That all goes back to this old business about Davies v. Mann and the hobbled ass on the roadside.</P>
    <P>A lot of our property law depends on the feudal system.  It is only as students nowadays that people get an introduction to the feudal system.  Yet, <Col N="133" /> A lot of our laws on property depend on certain repercussions of the old feudal system.  Those have been modernised elsewhere.  We are one of the few countries which lag behind.  I ask the Minister to see that those officials of his who are enthusiastic and zealous in this matter be given sufficient opportunity and time to produce measures of the law reform type which this country very definitely requires.</P>
    <P>It is very early, following on a decision, to ask the Minister for a definite statement on the matter, but the Minister must surely in his Department have given some consideration to the new circumstances that have developed, owing to the recent judgment of the courts in connection with the Solicitors Act in which it has been ruled that the disciplinary provisions of that Act are unconstitutional.  This of course, raises a very big question. As I say, the decision is not very old and one could not expect that any detailed consideration would have been given to it already, but in any event, the matter ought to be brought under consideration at once.</P>
    <P>I should imagine the Minister would agree it is not proper to leave a professional body like solicitors in the condition in which they cannot operate the disciplinary provisions of that Act and that conditions in respect of solicitors may result&mdash;as they have up to this decision resulted&mdash;in the striking off of certain solicitors.  Suppose a solicitor disposed of his client's money. As the Act was administered, a committee of the solicitors' body, the Incorporated Law Society, tried the case, gave the person complained of an opportunity to make his case in opposition to whatever was said against him and, in the end, came to a decision. There was a right of appeal to the Chief Justice.  I cannot speak of how that has been dealt with, because the report of that case has not yet been fully published and made available in our reports.  One has to go on newspaper reports.  The newspaper reports give us the gist of the decision.</P>
    <P>In any event, at the moment, the solicitors' body are left in this position, that they must reinstate to the rolls people whom they have struck off <Col N="134" /> for peculation of clients' funds, so long as those people have not been criminally convicted.  I understand that people whom they had suspended must be restored to the profession. That all waits.  Those people remain there and possibly one might add to them in the next half year.  Yet there is no power against this because the disciplinary provisions have been declared unconstitutional.  The profession has to tolerate them and expect the diminution its reputation must suffer, if that, being now known, is allowed to go on and become more frequent.</P>
    <P>There is a graver question raised by all this matter.  It was argued in the solicitor's case that, while it might be admitted that what the solicitors' body &mdash;this body of laymen, this committee &mdash;was doing represented a judicial activity, there was a question of whether they were administering justice, or attempting to administer justice.  The argument was taken that if they were, they were properly doing so, because there is an article of the Constitution, Article 37, which says that limited powers and functions of a judicial nature, otherwise than in criminal matters, may be exercised by people who are not judges or by institutions which are not courts established under the Constitution.  It was argued that if the solicitors' group, particularly with the resort of appeal to the Chief Justice were exercising a judicial function, it was a limited judicial function.  Although they were not judges and the group could not call themselves a court established under the Constitution, still it was argued that this was made constitutional by Article 37.</P>
    <P>The judgment on that pivotal point is very far-reaching.  It may go well beyond the solicitors' body.  In fact, it is very difficult to see how it can be restricted to the solicitors' body.  The judgment does cut out people who accept a particular type of jurisdiction by consent or by contract, say, a trade union, a club, a body like that where, say, the members of a club may go in and they know that they may be struck off the club rolls by some order of the committee of the club.  They accept that <Col N="135" /> by contract and I understand that these cases are definitely distinguished in the recent judgment.</P>
    <P>The judgment tackles this point of what is a limited power or function of a judicial type and it is argued that &ldquo;limited&rdquo; does not mean limited in number.  There may be a few powers, so to speak, and they may have very far-reaching effect.  So, we cannot judge, so to speak, by counting heads, what power, X, Y and Z hand over, which is very limited.  They do say in the end that one has to look for the effect of the assigned powers.  This, I understand, is the pivot of the judgment, but I speak subject also to correction because it is not yet published:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If the matter is calculated ordinarily to affect in the most profound and far-reaching ways the lives, liberties, fortunes and reputations of those against whom those powers are exercised they cannot properly be described as limited.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If any power is given over to a body of people who are not judges or not a court, and if the power affects people in their lives, liberties, fortunes or reputations, that judgment means that those things are not limited powers of a judicial nature and may be exercised only by the Judiciary.  I say to the Minister that that is a very far-reaching decision.  It brings this State, to my mind, clearly up against the old-time conflict between what was called the judicial authority and the adminitrative tribunal.  As it appears to me from that judgment, if there is anything in the nature of an administrative tribunal, it will have to have its power confined to a very narrow scope indeed, but if it affects lives, liberties, reputations or fortunes, then it will be considered, not administrative but judicial, and will require the interposition of the judicial authority.</P>
    <P>I thought that this might have been a way out of the difficulty but I believe the judgment is against it&mdash;that, no matter what the first body was that decided, if there was an appeal to the judicial authority that would mend the matter.  I understand the judgment negatives that and says that it is not <Col N="136" /> possible to regularise, by appeal to the judicial authority, something that was done by a tribunal acting as a judicial authority not composed of judges.  If that is the case, undoubtedly, a very serious matter has developed and one that will require immediate consideration and almost immediate rectification, whatever way rectification can be done, either by legislation or by, possibly, a constitutional amendment.</P>
    <P>The Solicitors Act judgment, undoubtedly, is very serious and must demand the immediate attention of the Minister and, I should imagine, of the solicitors' body who were granted this Act by a Government.  One Government prepared it and another Government brought it in, and so it has the backing of alternative Governments in this matter.  If they have been left in this condition that their actions have been declared to be unconstitutional and certain consequences will flow from it, I think the Minister ought to give immediate consideration to the question as to how he can ameliorate that position in respect of those individuals who form a committee.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether I should ask the Minister with regard to certain phrases that a colleague of his, whom he saw off at Shannon, has been using in the United States of America. Deputy Briscoe has been exposing himself to all sorts of comments at home by statements he has made.  I do not know if any statements he has made yet on the questions here have been regarded as authoritative but the Minister travelled down to Shannon Airport to see Deputy Briscoe off and in that way he more clearly than any of his colleagues identified himself with the Deputy's departure as, what has been called, a new ambassador from this country to the States.  Having got there, he is reported in a paper of the 22nd March as having said that &ldquo;the Labour Government in Britain would drive Northern Ireland into union with the Irish Republic.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The paper goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. Robert Briscoe, former Lord Mayor of Dublin, forecast yesterday. He told Harvard business school students at Cambridge, Massachusetts, <Col N="137" /> he expected the British Labour Party to win the next general election.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I wonder is he authorised to make statements like that?</P>

      <P>The Minister will not go to the length of standing over that particular statement, I am sure. I am coming back to where I started, the Civic Guards.  What pay will be given to them&mdash;what increase?  A question was asked to-day with regard to it.  Will they get an increase equivalent to what civil servants are getting?  It has always been the situation that arbitration was granted for the Civil Service and a certain type of arbitration was granted to teachers but such personnel of the State as the Army and the Guards had, as the phrase used to go, their salaries assimilated to the salaries that were given in the Civil Service and there are points of, I do not say contact, but points of comparison as between the Guards and, say, the civil servants. The civil servants have been forced to accept the compromise which does not give them their full claim.  Are the Guards getting even that and, apart from the members of the Garda, are the officers of the Garda?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is understood that the compromise that has been achieved with the Civil Service is giving about 7½ per cent. where their claim was over 12 per cent.  It is a little more than half.  I wonder is that the <Col N="140" /> situation with regard to the members of the Garda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder what it means with regard to individual members of the Garda?  It could mean what the Minister says but I am not certain of that.  We may, however, agree on this that the original claim as published in the Press was for a 12½ per cent. increase and they have accepted a compromise of about 7 or 7½ per cent. That is, they have accepted a little better than half of what they felt they were entitled to on the cost-of-living increase.  If that is the situation they might say that they are thankful for getting something but they might also say that it is very little they have to be thankful for.  This claim, after all, is in respect of conditions brought about by Government action because in the main this claim was clearly based on the increased cost of living which to a great extent was caused by what the Government did in the Budget.</P>
      <P>It appears then that the Government is not being completely immoral in relation to State personnel but is being partly immoral in giving only part of what they believe those people are entitled to and part of what they would get if the case went to the arbitration court.  It is, perhaps, something to be thankful for but it is not very much.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised to find that, notwithstanding reports, the Estimates for salaries and wages have been considerably increased, and that the full Estimate for the Garda is increased by over £140,000.  I am also very worried to find it is expected that at least 420 Gardaí will retire during the year and that provision is being made for about 400 recruits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the reason for anticipating such a large number of resignations? We know that men who have served for so many years are entitled to retire <Col N="141" /> before they reach 65, but is there any other cause?  Are men transferred unnecessarily away from their homes and families for &ldquo;temporary&rdquo; duty which often lasts a year or two, 50 or 60 miles away, with no chance of returning to their homes although recommended in some cases by their officers for transfer back?  Is there any discontent in regard to that?</P>
    <P>The Minister might have taken a certain attitude with the Commissioner. I had to do it on several occasions and I found the Commissioner very reasonable where he was anticipating wholesale resignation of pensioners. He wants to maintain the strength we had ten years ago&mdash;7,000. I happen to live in the town where the officer concerned at the time reorganised the Garda stations and I am familiar with his ideas, as he had been in the British force.  At that time we had more trouble than at present.  The country had just secured its freedom and they organised the Garda on the same system as existed for the R.I.C. Where you had three licensed premises you put a sergeant and three constables in charge.</P>
    <P>We have progressed from 1922 and nearly all headquarters now have motor-cars.  I know when small stations are closed, deputations of Deputies of all Parties come along with influential people from affected areas, and notwithstanding the fact that it can be proved they would have a better service from headquarters a few miles away by using motor-cars, they still try to maintain the prestige of the village by retaining the Garda there. I am sure the Minister in certain cases will have to do what I had to do&mdash; leave one Garda there to keep in close touch with headquarters.</P>
    <P>I cannot see the necessity for maintaining the Garda at the same strength now as in 1922 or 1923.  I do not believe we shall have 420 resignations this year but the Commissioner is always inclined to take the safe course, like ordinary civil servants, so as to be in the position of having sufficient men if anything should crop up.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister say if the £140,000 extra for the Garda includes the increase granted in the last few weeks <Col N="142" /> or will there be a Supplementary Estimate? I welcome the increase because I believe the Garda are well worthy of all the support we can give them in that way.</P>
    <P>I should like to know if the Minister has had any report from the firm of management consultants appointed in headquarters staff because I was satisfied that the headquarters was overloaded. When a vacancy occurred for a chief superintendent I refused to fill that vacancy with the approval of the Commissioner and there were no ill-effects. I was satisfied then we had too many chiefs, too many superintendents and too many inspectors to carry on the work there.  I was then informed that I would have to wait for a report from the experts' committee and I wonder if the Minister received that report since.</P>
    <P>I complained time after time about what were called &ldquo;refresher courses&rdquo;, when men, say, in weights and measures offices, who had been in service for 25 years were brought up here for these courses.  They spent a week here, getting subsistence allowances and other necessary expenses, incurred attending a few lectures.  We had a similar procedure in connection with motor drivers.  All the young recruits were involved.  That is why I should like to ask the Minister if the £264 for licences means provision for licences for recruits. I refused to pay that because I find that most of the country boys coming into the Garda are familiar with tractors and machines on the farm and I could not see why the State should contribute the cost of the driving licence to enable a man to drive for a few weeks around the Park and go back to a station where probably he would not drive a car for many years. I was against that unnecessary expense when we were supposed to make a drive for economy.  That is why I wonder if the extra £264 this year for driving licences is for recruits or does it mean permanent men for driving?  I was told that there was no necessity to have the young recruits trained to drive by the experts.</P>
    <P>A driver, now on pension and in a position to complain, told me that when he was brought up to have a lesson from one of these experts he <Col N="143" /> found the expert was a man he himself had trained to drive a car three years previously.  He was the instructor who was to show him how to drive a motor-car.  I brought the matter to the notice of the Commissioner.  I was of the opinion that it was unnecessary to have all this at a time when there was a shortage of petrol.</P>
    <P>If we are going to purchase new cars, I hope Irish cars will be purchased. Cars made in Cork give employment to a large number of our people and they should get preference. I should like the contract to be given to that firm which gives most employment to our own people.  When I had to complain to the Commissioner and point out the difficulties from the point of view of the economy, I found him most reasonable and prepared to meet me.  He had, of course, to make a case on behalf of the Garda.  However, he saw our point of view and was prepared to meet us in every way.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government has not the slightest conception of the work performed in the Department of Justice.  A Minister for Justice is not in the fortunate position of a Minister for Local Government who goes round the country promising thousands and thousands of pounds for the improvement of roads.  What I resent is the reckless statement made by the Minister for Local Government when he went to Kilkenny.  I suppose it was made to the delegates present as an excuse to cover up why he reduced his Estimates for the reconstruction of houses and grants by £700,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>He says that the expense incurred in connection with the maintenance of peace was caused by the disagreement of the previous Government and by their failure to take effective action.  I do not want to go into the question of what action has been taken by the present Government. There is a motion down to deal with that.  I want only to point out that there was no disagreement as to what action I should take.  I had my own mind made up.  I had a difficult job to try to force the civil courts to take certain action.  We succeeded in forcing the courts to take the constitutional action I advocated.  The Government gave me their full support. There was never the slightest disagreement between the Department, the <Col N="145" /> Commissioner, the Government and myself.  Having said that, I want to show that, when the Minister made that statement, he did not know the facts.  I do not want to deal with the matter as there is a motion down which can be debated when the appropriate time comes.</P>
      <P>I am perturbed only with what might be discontent in the Garda.  Men are away from their homes for over 12 months on temporary work which could be performed by other and more suitable people in Dublin.  We all compliment the Garda for the very efficient way they carry out their work.  I was twice arrested by the Garda during my political career in the past 35 years. I say they do their duty and no matter what Government is in power it can rely on the Garda always to carry out their work impartially.</P>
      <P>I was very pleased when the Commissioner advised the Garda to be more friendly with the people and join in their social activities.  Such a policy will pay because, when it comes to finding a criminal the Garda will have the support of the public.  Officiousness, such as summoning people for trivial offences such as parking cars three feet from the kerb and pasting notices on their vehicles makes the Guards unpopular with the people.  I am glad the Commissioner has given the advice which I myself gave some years ago. With the exception of a few individuals, the Garda on the whole are a credit to our country.  When we see what is happening in other countries we can appreciate the work which the Garda are doing here.  I regret that the Estimates are being increased for these purposes.  I only hope that there will be greater contentment among the Garda.  I do not wish to say anything at the present time to make matters any worse than they are.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one matter in connection with these Estimates which I should like to raise and that is in regard to the Estimate for the Garda Síochána.  It is a matter which is of vital concern to a very important sector of my own constituency.  I refer to the question of the provision of a Garda station in the East Wall area of Dublin.  I know the Minister himself <Col N="146" /> is acquainted with this matter.  Indeed, he has been sympathetically interested in the case for a number of years.  I should like to urge that he should, if at all possible, do something to supply this urgent need.</P>
      <P>The East Wall area is one of the most important commercial and industrial areas in the country.  It contains the vast docks which lie along the northern side of the Port of Dublin. Through it, each year, flows a great quantity of imports into the country and, out through it, each year, is channelled a vast volume of industrial and agricultural exports.  The whole area is full of warehouses and business premises of one sort or another, all containing important and valuable stocks and there are a great number of factory and transport installations in it.</P>
      <P>From the commercial point of view it is important that larceny, pilfering and wilful damage be controlled to the greatest extent possible and reduced to the very minimum.  Apart from the commercial aspect, there is the position of the residents in the area to be considered.  As the Minister knows, it is one of the finest old parishes in Dublin City.  The ordinary people of the area are industrious and hardworking. As a matter of ordinary justice, they are entitled to have law and order maintained in the area and to have their private property and, indeed, public property in the area protected.</P>
      <P>Most of the people concerned with this problem are agreed that the only way in which the important commercial property in the area can be protected and the only way in which the law-abiding citizens in the area can be permitted to go about their affairs in a normal way is that a police station be provided in the area and that the whole area be properly policed.  I urge the Minister to give very serious consideration to the provision of such a police station, particularly as this is a very important life-line, commercially, to the country and a very important industrial and commercial centre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My second suggestion to the Minister is that he should institute a review of <Col N="147" /> the whole parking position in Dublin City.  I should like to put before him the case of the unfortunate motorist in Dublin City.  The Dublin motorist is contributing a very fair share in every way to the Exchequer and he is very badly provided for, indeed.  The facilities for parking in the centre of the city make it almost impossible for people to carry out their normal business. I do not mean that greater facilities should be provided for people who are motoring merely for pleasure. I have in mind the ordinary man or woman going about their daily business in the centre of the city.  I would ask the Minister to try to institute a complete review of the whole position and to try to get a completely new approach to the whole problem on the part of the Gardaí.</P>
    <P>I feel Gardaí in the centre of the city waste a considerable amount of time and manpower checking-up on small trifling parking offences when they could more suitably be engaged otherwise.  In his opening remarks, the Minister said the rate of detection of indictable crime had gone down.  Presumably, to some extent, that is due to a lack of manpower, an insufficiency of Gardaí to get after the law breakers. If the whole problem of parking and traffic in the centre of the city were rationalised, and if less attention were given by Gardaí to hounding unfortunate motorists who are only trying to do their day's work in the centre of the city, there might thereby be released for some important work a considerable number of Gardaí.</P>
    <P>Again, I would ask the Minister, on behalf of this very important area in my constituency, the East Wall area, to consider the provision of a Garda station there.  I do that particularly because I see in the Book of Estimates that new Garda stations are being provided at various places throughout the country: Swanlinbar, Kinsale, Carrigart, Kilmacrennan, Pettigo, Clondalkin, Carna, Cloone, Newbliss, Ballinafad, and Grangemockler.  In addition there are improvements to existing stations at Glencolmkille, Blanchardstown, Tallaght and Moneygall. <Col N="148" /> I have no doubt that these are all very estimable places and that the provision of stations there is very desirable but none of them could compare at all in size or importance, commercially, with the East Wall area, for which I speak.  I am certain also&mdash;and I put it to the Minister&mdash;that in none of these other areas would the provision of a Garda station affect so much the commercial and social life of the area as in the case of the East Wall.  I shall conclude with that appeal on behalf of the East Wall area and with an appeal also on behalf of the ordinary hardworking motorist in Dublin City.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no legal knowledge and I cannot speak like some legal gentlemen here, but I have certain experience and therefore I want to comment on a few aspects which I think come under the Vote before the House.  I want to refer to the need for free legal aid in the district courts. It has been my experience that there is a fair amount of in justice in district courts by virtue of the fact that poor people, or people ignorant of the law, defend themselves without legal assistance.  I know of a number of cases and, using my common sense, I know there must be a lot of cases of people who are charged with minor offences and who, because the offences are minor, do not want to commit themselves to large sums which they believe they would have to pay to counsel or solicitors.  Frequently, they are unemployed or just working people and they take a chance of defending themselves or of getting justice.  But the justice, naturally, is there to dispense justice, depending on the evidence. If you have trained Gardaí giving evidence, or if you have solicitors on one side and none on the other, it follows you have expert and pertinent evidence on one side and a complete blank on the other.  In many cases, justices have no option but to give a certain ruling in accordance with the evidence.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened to Deputy McGilligan and I thought I could take liberties, too.  However, I have made the point.  As far as the need for free legal aid is concerned, I could quote many cases of injustices because of the lack of legal help in the courts.</P>
      <P>With regard to the form of address that is expected to be used by litigants who defend themselves in court, I happened to be in a case some time ago and I was advised by my solicitor how to address the court.  I am not a very servile type; I respect the justices the same as I respect you, Sir. I was advised how to &ldquo;Worship&rdquo; and to &ldquo;Lordship&rdquo; and so on, and I objected to that, but I was told that if I did not do it, this justice would make it tough for me.  I claim that we have reached the stage in our republican form of Government where &ldquo;Sir&rdquo; should suffice in any court and we should eliminate all this servility of the past of &ldquo;Worship&rdquo; and &ldquo;Lordship&rdquo;. There are places where people fall over themselves thinking they will get favours in this way.  I am putting the point to the Minister, whether that would require legislation or not, that he should at least keep it in mind that there are lots of people who object to this servile approach, that &ldquo;Sir&rdquo; and respect should suffice in any court in the Republic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer to the question of personation at elections.  Some time ago, when a question was put here, I made a rejoinder and said there were 500 votes personated in North Central in the general election.  The Minister said in reply that he advised all my friends not to personate.  That was a joke, we know.  For the information of the Minister, I had no one helping me in the general election.  I had not an office; I had no one at the tables; I had no meetings; and I had no cars &mdash;absolutely nothing.  My wife was at <Col N="150" /> one polling station and my daughter at another; and it was only at half-past seven that some pals came along and said: &ldquo;Vote for Sherwin.&rdquo; Even if I wanted personation, I had no one. There was wholesale personation and I suppose there is personation in every election.</P>
    <P>There is an Electoral Act which states that, if you personate, you can be fined and sentenced.  However, there is a certain code amongst Parties not to give evidence against one another. It is like Prohibition in the States&mdash;they have it out among themselves, but do not give evidence.  The Guards will not act without evidence; therefore there is no charge of personation. It is the simplest thing in the world.  Official cards are sent out by the sheriff.  As we know, during the past couple of years, large numbers of people had to leave the country.  At the general election, the most up-todate register was not used.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I just mention that to prove my point, that there was scope for wholesale personation in the general election.  I am certain now that there is wholesale personation in every election.  People get possession of official cards which permit them to enter a polling station.  When members of their families are away, they hand the cards to political clubs in great numbers.  Then strangers, on the strength of having a card, will walk in brazenly and if the presiding officer is alone, with only a Guard, there is no one to dispute their right.  The personating agents around the table are not going to dispute it.  I am not referring to any particular Party.  If we want respect for democracy, let us be sure it is not abused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to make it illegal for any person to surrender an official card which he receives from the sheriff. <Col N="151" /> That should be made an offence.  It should also be an offence for anyone to be in possession of a card which is not his own.  It is known that agents from Parties go around and collect these cards during the canvass and use them in bulk on the day of the election, especially during rush hours.  I am putting this before the Minister, because, while I have a certain amount of contempt myself for this system of ours because of the amount of abuse which I know exists, I should like to see it perfected, as I accept that there is no better way of selecting a Government than by democratic means.  However, we are not going to get a great deal of respect from people who know what is going on.  It may be got from people who do not know.  I ask the Minister to review this Electoral Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I turn now to the question of the right of the Garda to search premises without a warrant.  I do not know what their powers are, but, under common law, they must have a warrant to search a person's home.  I have been informed by a person named Drivers, who was an internee on the Curragh, that his home was broken into on two occasions by members of the Special Branch.  As there was no one at home, he being a bachelor and on the Curragh, he expected that he should have been informed and that he should have been in the company of those searching his home.  I should like the Minister to say if under the Offences Against the State Act, the Garda have power to enter a person's home without a warrant; and, if a warrant is required, why the person in question was not served with a warrant <Col N="152" /> and, if it was correct that the person should be on the premises while his home was being searched, why he was not invited to be present.  He states that his home was broken into on two occasions.</P>
      <P>The same internee states that he has requested the Minister on a number of occasions to be allowed parole, so that he can make further inquiries and take some proceedings in respect of those two entries to his home.  He also states that he is engaged in some law suit and wants parole.  I understand the Minister has agreed to give him parole in the company of a military force.  Anyway, I should like some information from the Minister, particularly in regard to the right of members of the Special Branch to enter a home without a warrant and without the owner being served with a warrant.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer to the censorship of films.  Because of the competition of television, films in the United States are now, with a view to attracting audiences, becoming a little brazen, and the question arises: should the Minister not decide now that there should be various grades of films for various ages of patrons?  I mention the fact for the Minister's consideration, because there have been objections to certain films shown in Dublin recently.  It is not enough to cut them up.  They might not be so demoralising for adults, but they would be for children and it might be unfair to cut them up for adults.  Therefore, I think the Minister should introduce grading for persons under a certain age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like also to ask the Minister to consider&mdash;maybe this is a question of legislation, too; I can be corrected, if it is&mdash;inquiring into the practice of landlords demanding large sums for keys for accommodation.  They can get around some Acts by putting a few pieces of furniture in a room and then demanding £40.  It is put into the contract that the £40 is in lieu of the so-called furniture.  They have various ways of getting around restrictions. It is common practice, and you cannot get a room in Dublin without paying £20, £30 or £40.  I should also like to ask the Minister to consider the position <Col N="153" /> of a landlord who is trying to get rid of a tenant refusing to accept rent.  The practice and the intention of those people is to run the tenant, who might be a poor person, into so much debt that he will not contest the matter, and so the landlord gets possession.  The landlord does not take the rent for six months; he then serves notice and as the poor person has not got six months' rent, he slides out and that suits the landlord.  I have had a lot of experience of people being evicted in this way.</P>
    <P>I would also ask the Minister, when dealing with wine licences, to remember that there are quite a large number of after-hour eating places in this town and they have only licences up to 11 o'clock.  I know that they are constantly breaking the law.  They are tempted to break the law, and why not give them a licence under proper supervision?  There are tourists coming into this country&mdash;and we are looking for more&mdash;and we must give them a certain amount of entertainment. While I know that there are certain objections to drink, we must take certain chances.  A lot of our income is got through such things as the dance tax, the tax on drink and the sweepstakes. Why not grant licences to 2 o'clock in the morning, instead of having this constant breaking of the law?  It is going on continuously, so why not legalise it?</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to know that, in criticising, it is his Department I am criticising and not himself.  I have a very high opinion of the Minister.  I have known a lot of people in high places, people who are selfish and without understanding, and I know that the Minister is a man with a great deal of understanding.  I want to remark on the behaviour of some Guards. Some of the Guards act in a provocative manner with people who might, themselves, be rather provocative. Guards should handle people&mdash;especially people with a few drinks on them at the week-end&mdash;in a polite way.  It is the practice of some Guards to act in a high-handed manner and that often leads to assaults and court cases. I am suggesting that people could be and should be handled politely, but in a firm manner, not in a provocative <Col N="154" /> manner, and not with the attitude: &ldquo;I am a Guard; I can make it tough for you.&rdquo; I mention that because I know of a number of cases where Guards were too provocative and brought to a head cases that might not have come to a head at all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to say a word or two, as it is the only opportunity presented, on the subject of law reform.  From time to time, reference has been made in this House to the appalling state of our common law and to the urgent need for law reform.  I am sure many Deputies do not realise that the great body of the rules and regulations which govern one's obligations to one's fellow-citizens and one's right of action, are controlled by a set of conventions laid down some 400 or 500 years ago&mdash;conventions which are now completely out of tune with the needs of our modern society.  In the sister island of Great Britain, despite the urgency of a war situation some ten to 15 years ago, the British Parliament nevertheless regarded the need for law reform as so urgent as not to permit the war situation to interfere with the law reform programme they had embarked on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this Parliament, since it was established in 1922, there has been very little law reform legislation introduced. In fact, I think it is true to say that it was only in the period when the Minister's predecessor was in charge of the Department that any considerable volume of law reform was introduced.  I know well that any proposal for the reform of our common law, or indeed of our statute law, is not regarded as a matter of white-hot urgency.  There are very few votes involved. It is generally true to say that it is difficult to get many people interested in such a subject.  Nevertheless, many people are interested when they hear of a neighbour who is involved in an accident and who perhaps suffers very severe personal injuries, but because he was 1 per cent. to blame, it is held, in accordance with our law, that he is not entitled to a farthing damages.  People are beginning to wonder why that should be and it is because we rule in this country by a law of contributory negligence <Col N="155" /> that was established 400 years ago and which is completely out of tune with the needs of our modern society.</P>

      <P>I am making only a passing reference, but I do urge upon the Minister that the section of his Department which I know is engaged in the study of law reform proposals, and the Attorney-General's Department, should be given the green light.  There is, in my view, a tremendous need for the introduction of urgent measures of law reform and I hope they will go ahead.  I mentioned this matter in the debate last year and I make it relevant by referring to the Minister's statement when he assured me and the House last year that the matter would engage his attention as soon as he had become familiar with the problems of his Department. Twelve months have now passed and I do express the hope that, in the session of this Dáil, a certain effort will be made to introduce these very urgent measures.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manley</NameTxt>
      <P>The various Estimates under the heading of the Vote under the charge of the Minister total a sum of £5,500,000 approximately.  The Minister rightly says that there is very little difference between the various Estimates he presents this year and those which he presented last year, except in the increase in the Garda Vote.  It is generally conceded that that is because of the abnormal number of retirals we will have in the present year.  It is generally appreciated that the men who built up the force in the early days of the Garda Síochána are due to retire in the years now ahead, and these retirals will impact rather seriously on the sum voted for the Garda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were all pained to hear the Minister's figures with regard to crime.  I think it is very much on the increase and the cause of that is rather mystifying.  It is disquieting to take up the evening papers in Dublin and see all the various forms of juvenile <Col N="156" /> crime and juvenile delinquency in general.  I suppose it must be due to the fact that parental shackles are loosening.</P>
    <P>The Minister has told us that the Garda force at present is 1,000 fewer than it was ten years ago, and the detection of crime in Dublin has been reduced to something like 32 per cent. That is rather disquieting.  Is it that the force is not sufficiently strong in Dublin?  Is it that there is not sufficient vigilance to watch the various forms of criminal intent which some of these people practice?  May I suggest that in Dublin City, where there is a large military force, that the military policemen should be called in to assist in vigilance and the detection of crime?  I do not think it is right that the Minister should suggest that firms should engage their own watchmen to protect against robberies.  It is the duty of the State to protect people's property.  If his suggestion is implemented, it will mean that the public will pay for these watchmen when they buy goods from such firms eventually. More is to be expected from the Minister's Department in that respect.</P>
    <P>It is quite true, as Deputy McGilligan stated, that a great deal of time of the Garda is wasted in trivial functions, in forms of duty that bring about delay, duties that the Gardaí should not be asked to perform.  He suggested there should be some means of collecting fines on the dates on which these fines are inflicted in the courts.  That is a very sensible and practical suggestion.  From mid-May to the end of June, the Gardaí in rural areas will be engaged in collecting statistics.  I do not know if it is possible to collect these statistics other than through using the Gardaí force to do so.  I think that a simplified form of statistical sheet could be filled up and posted back to the Department of Agriculture which would obviate the need for the Gardaí to go round from house to house, week after week, trying to collect this information.</P>
    <P>The closing of barracks has been mentioned here.  Every area regrets the closing of its barracks because the Gardaí have been exemplary during the last 35 years and have grown to <Col N="157" /> earn the respect of the people.  That is a good thing.  At least one or two men should be retained in areas where it is proposed to close barracks and the young men who are now coming out of the Depot, and who are familiar with motor vehicles, should be provided with motor-cycles, rather than motor-cars, and they could patrol a greater area than the men before them did.</P>
    <P>There has been a great deal of talk about the provision of police cars, and the Minister mentioned a sum of £32,000 for replacements and the provision of new cars in certain areas.  I doubt very much if, no matter how mechanised the force becomes, it will be as efficient as the old foot patrol system was.  If that patrol system existed now, as it existed in the past, we would not have the same amount of crime.  The presence of a policeman in a street is an insurance against many forms of crime, while very often the police car betrays itself.  In areas outside of Dublin it is hardly necessary, except in a few densely-populated centres like Cork, Waterford, Limerick and Galway.  I do not think the mechanised patrol is as effective or efficient, or has given as good results as the old patrol system did.</P>

      <P>I am not too interested in that.  I do not know that, but I think a motor-cycle used by one man in a remote area would be very effective. We are not allowed to talk about law reform, though it was mentioned very extensively by Deputy McGilligan and Deputy O'Higgins this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My main reason for rising to speak in this debate is to inquire from the Minister if his Department has succeeded in devising some better means of dealing with camping itinerants.  This is a matter which was raised here during the year, and there was a promise from the Minister that his Department was engaging itself in a consideration of this whole question.  This is a problem which arises in suburban areas of Dublin, Limerick, Waterford, Galway, and particularly in the city I am more familiar with, the City of Cork.  I <Col N="158" /> know of people living in suburban areas of Cork City who had to leave their homes because of the annoyance they suffered at the hands of these itinerants.</P>
    <P>The Minister has told us himself that they are 7,000 strong and that they create a very serious problem for his Department, but it is a real crisis for the unfortunate people who are the victims of the visitations of these people.  They seem to be outside the pale of the law entirely.  The School Attendance Act does not apply to them.  The ordinary people, if their animals stray on the roads, are liable to prosecution.  These people seem to be immune to the law entirely and they leave their camping places in a filthy condition, which is particularly obnoxious when we have tourists visiting the country and going from place to place.  These people camp for six months on end in certain parts of Cork suburban areas and, with no laws of hygiene, you can understand the position in which they leave their camps when they move off when the fine weather begins in April or in May.  I hope the Minister will tackle this urgent problem seriously.  It is very important for the people affected who are disappointed that they cannot get the protection from the State to which they are entitled, the protection of person and property.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickGiles" hpid="Captain Giles Captain Giles">
      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>This Department is one with great responsibility and I wonder if it is living up to its responsibilities. Over the past few years, crime is on the increase, not alone in the cities and towns but all over the country.  A lot of this crime is treated as minor offences and the criminals are looked on as unfortunate, afflicted creatures.  It is necessary for the Garda and the Minister to work more closely together to stamp it out.  It is not a question of men who are down and out, trying to rear big families and looking for the money to feed them.  These offenders are young scoundrels who never worked and whose parents never made them work. When they commit a crime and get away with the swag, they get a small sentence of nine months.  Then they appeal and it is reduced to six months. <Col N="159" /> When they get out, they start their career all over again.  These people should be given the full sentence of three or five years and there should be no reduction in the sentence.  What is the use of any man being honest, if these people can get away with this conduct?  These young whelps go up to Dublin, for instance, take a motor-car by the usual methods, drive it 30 or 40 miles away, commit a serious crime and then park the car back in Dublin.</P>
      <P>Many of these crimes could be detected if we had better supervision.  I do not expect the ordinary police force down the country to detect them. There are only a few Gardaí in the towns.  There should be more special squads to deal with this type of crime speedily and a full sentence given to the criminals when they are caught. There should be a special place in our prisons for this type.  At the present time, they say: &ldquo;I was better off in Mountjoy than at home.  I had a royal time, with pictures twice a week.&rdquo; These juveniles up to 25 years of age should be publicly whipped, which would quickly put a stop to their activities.  These people have organised themselves into gangs and, although we talk about the itinerants on the road, they are only trotting after the gangs organised in the City of Dublin and throughout the country as barefaced criminals.</P>
      <P>In connection with the raiding of pubs, I believe there is not so much need for this now, but if there is, there should be no such thing as an exemption for people because somebody has a big pull and if the Guards come near his house they will be sent to hell or to Connacht very quickly.  If pubs are to be raided, there should be no exemptions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately at the moment we have also a wave of political trouble. The present Minister is a man of broad vision, courage and intelligence and I hope he will deal tactfully with the situation because the situation needs tact and consideration.  However, internment without trial is a bad thing.  It is history repeating itself. If a man commits an offence and is <Col N="160" /> sentenced, that is all right, but these young fellows who are interned should be released.  We are only making patriots out of them.  We had the same experience during the Civil War when young fellows were brought in.  We made heroes of them by putting them behind bars.  If we had given them a kick in the tail and sent them out, that would have been adequate to deal with the situation.  The same applies to-day and it is my belief that these internees should be released.</P>
    <P>We in this House are much to blame for the agitation going on in relation to Partition.  We should have made the question of the Border a live issue in this House and not outside it. Partition is the cause of all our troubles.  I believe a lead should be given from the Dáil on this question.</P>

      <P>This house has failed the country in this respect.  I would ask the Minister to handle the situation very tactfully and to see that no man is arrested and interned without trial.  We should not allow ourselves to be made the tools of the Northern junta and I am afraid the people of the country are saying that the Minister is nothing more than a tool of that junta. We are not tools and will not be tools for them.  The day has come when we should bring to the notice of the other countries of the world the gerrymandering taking place in the North. We do not seem to appreciate what the people are suffering up there.</P>

      <P>I will raise it on the Estimate for External Affairs.  As I have said, the amount of crime committed here is too much for a small country and we are not tackling it properly.  I am leaving the political <Col N="161" /> side out of it.  That is not crime and it is bound to happen while there is Partition.</P>
      <P>Barefaced robbery coupled with leniency of sentence is going too far. People are entitled to protection. Their property should be respected. They should be able to sleep without, so to speak, having to keep a gun handy all the time.  The Minister is doing his best; the people themselves will have to do more.  At the moment they are afraid to open their mouths when a crime is committed.  I would ask the Minister to put more detectives on duty all over the country and not leave everything to the ordinary Gardaí.  That would help to give the people courage and also help to put down crime in a very short time.</P>

      <P>There is grave need for an increase in the numerical strength of the Garda in Galway City.  We have the same number of Gardaí there to-day as in 1935 despite all the building schemes that have taken place and despite the increased numbers of cars on the roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to itinerants, Galway is a tourist centre and we suffer from an influx of these undesirables during the tourist season.  They pester tourists. They are a sore problem in our area. Certain public bodies have protested and, when they did, we had a certain member of the Garda writing to the public Press, a long-winded letter running into five columns, criticising the members of the public bodies who protested. That was done under a nom-de-plume but one does not have to be a member of the Secret Service to know who the writer was.  It is well known in Galway City.  Evidently certain people can find time to burn midnight oil typing letters on official typewriters instead of being out doing their duty.  I am not casting reflections on the Garda in general.  One does not blacken all because of one. We have as fine a group of men in Galway City as was ever stationed in any part of the country.  They have the goodwill of the citizens and they will continue to have it.  It is, however, most unfair to turn the Garda into semi-civil servants, watching thistles and cows, and this, that and <Col N="162" /> the other.  We need more Gardaí in Galway City to-day.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister to ease the public mind in relation to one matter, namely, the recent attempted break-out in Mountjoy.  There is a suggestion that certain privileges will be withdrawn.  We have heard it said in other areas that prisoners have been ill-treated.  Certain propagandists may try to cash in on this and I suggest that the representatives of the public Press be invited to visit the prisons and ease the public mind in regard to this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>It should not be forgotten that the preservation of law and order is not, in the first instance, a matter for the Garda, the courts of justice or any other official body.  In the final analysis, it is a matter for the people themselves and, if the people are law-abiding and orderly, the work of the Garda is very simple indeed. It is disconcerting to read of Gardaí being set upon by young blackguards&mdash; Teddy Boys would perhaps be a more accurate description&mdash;and injured while several hundred, presumably law-abiding, citizens looked on.  In certain instances Gardaí were actually obstructed in the discharge of their duty.  No force, no matter how numerous or efficient it is, can keep law and order if the citizens are not prepared to lend their support.  Again, if the Garda do not get the support of the courts&mdash;that has happened from time to time where offenders have been brought before the courts and purely nominal fines have been imposed or purely nominal punishment inflicted&mdash; they cannot be expected to maintain law and order, to say nothing of their status being severely injured.</P>
      <P>With regard to Limerick, the population of the city is 50,000.  There are four barracks, all situated on the south side of the city, which holds about two-thirds of the population.  On the north, and growing side, where there are 15,000 or 16,000 people, there is no Garda station and the area is very badly patrolled, particularly at night. I would ask the Minister to examine that position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The biggest Garda station is situated <Col N="163" /> in the centre of the busiest street in Limerick, William Street.  It occupies a site which could be very valuable as a commercial property.  I know that financial considerations enter into the matter just now, but a very good case can be made for transferring the Garda out of the old, dilapidated building they now occupy in William Street to more modern premises.</P>
    <P>I should like to say a word on the subject of itinerants.  I do not think that any centre has suffered as we in Limerick have from this, what I can only call, blight of itinerants.  Limerick City seems to be a Mecca for itinerants from all over the country. Unless some action is taken by the Minister for Justice or the Minister for Local Government&mdash;I am not quite certain what Department is responsible&mdash; there will inevitably be serious trouble, if not in Limerick City then in some other centres.  These people have become a serious social menace in several centres of the country.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be taken as questioning the right of these people to live.  They have a perfect right to live.  Indeed every public representative in Limerick takes the view that if they are prepared to settle down and become respectable decent citizens, they will be as welcome in Limerick as any place else.  But they do not do that.  They live on the people, destroy property, frighten women and children, and are a menace to tourists. They take up their positions outside hotels, post offices and populous centres.  During the busy tourist season they certainly are anything but an advantage around the place.  They are a menace and, as far as I can see, a growing menace.  They are certainly so in Limerick and also, I understand from complaints I see in the papers, in other areas as well.</P>
    <P>If this is, as I think it must be, within the competence of the Minister for Justice, I should like him to take cognisance of the menace these people are.  Some form of restriction, I am sorry to say, will have to be imposed on them.  They are not prepared to live according to the ordinary rules of society.  If they are not prepared to do that, then some set of regulations <Col N="164" /> will have to be given to local authorities who should have power to restrict these people or move them outside the bounds of their particular areas of jurisdiction.  I hope the Minister will look into that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>In case silence might be interpreted as giving assent, I should like to say I completely disagree with the attitude of Deputy Giles in advocating the infliction of corporal punishment for any misdeeds in this country. That is an outdated method of preventing crime or of doing anything to improve the existing position.</P>
      <P>I simply want to suggest to the Minister that in my opinion a practice has grown up of Gardaí visiting schools and taking out juveniles from the custody and care of the teachers entrusted with their education, questioning them, in some cases taking them to the police barracks and there securing from them statements which are later used as the basis of charges against them or other people.  That is deplorable.  Juveniles, in some cases of very tender years, have been removed from schools, and even from their homes, without the knowledge of their parents and without any help from any adult person.  I would suggest to the Minister that he communicate with the various Garda chiefs and instruct them that such a practice should cease.  It is abominable. I am using this Estimate to voice that opinion in the hope that such practices, where they have been carried on in the past, will cease as from this time out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In connection with motor traffic offences, all of us who drive&mdash;I suppose the majority of Deputies&mdash;are aware of the difficulty of endeavouring to drive safely at present when you have road hogs who in the night-time refuse to dim and in the day-time come around bends on the wrong side or corner in such a way as to risk the lives and limbs either of pedestrians or other road users.  There should be a system of Garda patrols on the main highways, in cars not easily distinguishable as Garda cars, so that motorists would feel that the next car or the one behind it might be a Garda car.  In that way we would be taking every precaution to see that the rules of the <Col N="165" /> road would not be violated, and I believe we would then have a great reduction in the number of motor accidents.</P>
    <P>In my opinion, the Garda as a whole is a most efficient and courteous force. The members of that force are doing a difficult job very well.  We should be proud of the good relations existing between the Garda and the public.  All of us should co-operate a little bit more with the police force rather than criticise them for any failures they have had.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, in case silence means consent, I should like to express disagreement with some of the opinions voiced here in respect of the class of people described as itinerants. They have been condemned without qualification, and I do not think it is really fair.  I must say, as far as my part of the country is concerned, although there have been complaints about itinerants, about straying animals and free grazing, they are not considered the blight or the blackguards they seem to be in Galway City or Limerick City.</P>
      <P>Deputy Russell suggested that Limerick Corporation would allow them to settle down as citizens of Limerick if they so desired.  The beauty about these people is that they do not want to settle down.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of them do not. The Connors and the Cashes in my part of the country do not.  They choose for themselves a rule of life. Many of them have houses which they occupy for about four or six months of the year, but when it comes to some particular day in April, off they go and return again in September or October.</P>
      <P>Two Deputies say they annoy tourists.  They say it is regrettable that these people should be on the roads just because we have American, British, Canadian or German tourists coming to this country.  As far as my experience goes, the tourists almost break their necks looking out the windows of cars or trains to see what they describe as attractive nomads.</P>

      <P>Gipsies can be romantic. I do not think there is the same widespread objection to these people as some Deputies would lead us to believe.  It is true some of them make nuisances of themselves begging outside big hotels and post offices but, by and large, I do not think they do the amount of damage that county councillors and other public representatives say they do.  I should be sorry to see the total abolition of these colourful people from the highways and byways of this country.  We can pick out examples of trespass, of persons stealing hens and getting free grazing in fields but we can also point to crooked lawyers, dishonest shopkeepers and &ldquo;hooky&rdquo; farmers. It does not necessarily mean that all of them should be condemned.  We have even shady politicians.  It does not necessarily mean that all of us should be condemned.  It would be a sad day for this country if what are often called &ldquo;the real Irish&rdquo; were banned from the roads of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Or the highways and byways.  Deputy Giles was concerned, as we all are, about the increase in crime.  He, and perhaps some other Deputies, may have inferred that the Minister was not fully aware of that increase.  As far as I can read the Minister's speech, he is very fully aware of it and gave a very honest presentation of the facts and figures showing that there has been an increase in crime.  Let us not run away with the idea that in recent years this country has been full of &ldquo;Teddy Boys&rdquo; and juvenile delinquents.  Such is not the case.  If there were a comparative picture with Great Britain and other countries, we could congratulate ourselves on the relatively small amount of crime here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is difficult to know where the responsibility lies for the increase in juvenile delinquency and petty crime. Some people blame the parents.  Others blame the Guards.  I would blame <Col N="167" /> neither.  I would blame the times we live in.  It is inevitable, with the glamorisation of gangsterdom and robbery in many films, that a small percentage&mdash;and I say a small percentage&mdash;of young people would be affected.  They are affected by films, radio plays and, in recent times, by television shows.  The parents have a very difficult time.  It was different in Captain Giles's day when there was not the attraction of pictures, and of radio to some extent, to corrupt.  It was a relatively easy matter to be good.  Of course, I am sure the parents of Captain Giles's day used&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickGiles" hpid="Captain Giles Captain Giles">
      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>They used the stick.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the stick and the boot and that the lack of that punishment may be a reason for the increase in juvenile delinquency and petty crime.</P>
      <P>The Garda, as Deputy Kyne said, are doing a very good job.  Those who have experience of the Guards know that they are reliable and honest men, doing their job very well.  Too often the Guards come in for criticism.  Too often people assume that every time a crime happens the Guards must put their finger on the culprit immediately. The country is relatively quiet, relatively peaceful and when an unusual crime takes place it is very difficult for the Guards to get into the groove that the detectives of Scotland Yard are in from day to day, week to week, and month to month.  I do not think anybody could accuse the Garda of dereliction of duty or of being lackadaisical.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A Deputy referred to the numerical strength of the Garda and the Minister in his opening speech recognised that the force was below strength and will be, as the months go by, in this year to the extent of something like 450.  On the one hand, Deputies ask for an increase in the force and, on the other hand, there is criticism of increased expenditure.  It is difficult to say what the strength of the Garda should be as it is, indeed, very difficult to say what the strength of the Army should be. There is no yardstick by which we can estimate the number of Guards per <Col N="168" /> 1,000 or 10,000 of the population and it is only by experience that we can discover the exact number that there should be in the force.</P>
    <P>Deputy Giles has also said that it is very difficult to get a prosecution by the Garda to stick and that it is very difficult in respect of certain crimes to get what would be described as a fair sentence.  I would say that there are two reasons for that.  There are very good lawyers in this country. I shall not blame the justices.  On the other hand, I do not think that the Garda force is equipped legally to appear in court and present prosecutions as the defence is equipped.  That is very difficult in a provincial town. It is possible to have at the most only three men who are qualified lawyers or who have experience in presenting prosecutions in a District Court as against the array of solicitors and lawyers whose exclusive business it is to defend or prosecute.  If the Department could train in a more detailed way the officers of the Garda Síochána the situation Captain Giles hoped for could be reached.</P>
    <P>There is one subject that has been missing to a large extent in this debate, a subject which occupied many hours of discussion over the last ten years.  Deputy Kyne mentioned it&mdash; the subject of parking and traffic. There was a great furore in this House and in public bodies about parking and the difficulties of traffic in the City of Dublin and other cities.  Have the Guards or the Commissioner lost the enthusiasm they evinced five or six years ago?  There is some improvement but no marked improvement in parking regulations in the City of Dublin and the provincial towns.  I know how difficult this matter is.  Local bodies have a certain amount of power and a great amount of responsibility in the matter of parking and traffic problems but, over and above that, the Commissioner has power in circumstances, and in a particular way, to impose parking and traffic regulations. As I have said before in the House, I would be behind the Commissioner and the Garda if they set about the task and devised their own parking and traffic regulations, especially for provincial towns.  In that, they would <Col N="169" /> certainly get the support of the majority of the public.</P>
    <P>I see indiscriminate parking on corners and in public thoroughfares, to the detriment of business and trade.  The tragic and paradoxical situation is that the traders whose thoroughfares are clogged by that traffic are losing business.  After visiting some provincial towns once and driving through the main streets in a car and having witnessed the upset in traffic I, as a tourist, would never return to those streets again.  I cannot imagine why the business people cannot understand that good parking regulations would be to their benefit. The Guards and the Commissioner, in particular, should take a greater interest in parking and traffic problems. The present position is certainly not attractive to tourists.</P>
    <P>I should like to conclude by referring to conditions in the Garda Síochána. We all demand a certain standard from the Garda but few of us demand that their conditions of service and their salaries should be improved.  I do not think that the Governments of the last 35 years have been particularly fair to the Guards who have served them well &mdash;and who have served all Governments well.  It is a notable feature that the loyalty of the Garda has not been questioned irrespective of what Government has been in power.  They certainly have been loyal and have done their duty well and it is only reasonable that they and this House should expect in turn that their conditions of employment, allowances and salaries should be of a standard commensurate with the amount of work they have to do and the efficiency with which they perform their various duties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to give some information to the House regarding the position of legislation that went through here in 1946. For years solicitors in this country wanted to be in the same position, and covered by the same or similar laws, as other professional persons.  For years they had sought legislation here to put them in that position.  I now understand this legislation, the Solicitors <Col N="170" /> Act, has raised a constitutional issue. It has been found that the measure was unconstitutional.  I want to know how exactly that came about, and whether, the Government that put it through at that time did so deliberately or not.

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and in spite of all the praise they gave it recently, I do not know whether this was done deliberately.  I have a sort of an idea there was something fishy about it, and I would ask the Minister to give the House some information on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>The first thing I should like to say is that I do not subscribe to the view that this is one of the most lawless countries in the world.  There could be no greater untruth than that.  This country, as a whole, is as law-abiding, having regard to its size and population, as any other.  Where human beings with human frailties exist there will always be very serious crimes, but here, if we consider them, we find they are mainly serious crimes of passion.  On the whole, crime is not a serious problem with us; it does not endanger the security of the State or the safety of the citizens.  We had better put that on record because the impression might be given that the force employed to protect lives and property, the Garda, was not doing its duty.  There could be no greater slander.  Anybody who goes about the country as I have done all my life would say there is no justification for it.  It would be a shocking thing if it got abroad that such conditions exist here.  In fact it is untrue. <Col N="171" /> There is an aspect of crime to which I shall come presently which is somewhat different, but as regards judges and justices not doing their duty, I cannot agree.  In some cases local people may know something about the parties involved and may wonder why a certain party was not found guilty, and may think there was a miscarriage of justice.  But the maxim of the law, and it has been in our jurisprudence for centuries and I believe it is absolutely sound, is that it were better that 20 guilty people should escape than that one innocent person should be convicted.</P>
      <P>The people who dispense justice have nothing to gain; they must use their discretion.  One aspect of that, in my opinion, is that when you assert the law, the question of the penalty is not so serious.  It is not necessary to be cruel unless one has to deal with a particularly vicious criminal.  Then one must hit hard and let him know one is doing so.  In the main, justice should always be tempered with mercy.  That is a really sound proposition, and I would not like to see any departure from it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main problem to which I should like to refer is that of juvenile crime. I fear I am not sufficiently acquainted with the problem to deal with it fully. It is a problem not peculiar to this city or this country; it is a universal problem, a much more serious problem elsewhere than with us.  I hope nobody in this House will blame the Garda for any outbreak of juvenile crime we may experience.  That, in my opinion, would be utterly stupid.  The unfortunate Garda have to try to counteract the neglect of other people, of those responsible for the training of these juveniles, the fathers and mothers.  The primary responsibility rests on them, and I feel it is our duty to tell parents frankly that a lack of parental control is the foundation of this outbreak of juvenile crime.  I am not shirking that responsibility, or the expression of that conviction.  I suppose many fathers and mothers will raise their eyebrows at that.  I am not concerned whether they do or not; I am here to state the truth and the facts.  Nowadays people <Col N="172" /> feel their own children can do no wrong; they are impeccable and infallible. If anything happens, it is the fault of somebody else.</P>
    <P>We must make our minds up to approach this problem sensibly.  It is not so serious here yet, although elsewhere it is a menacing problem. Of course if some steps are not taken to deal with it here it will ultimately develop into a menacing problem for this State.</P>
    <P>There is no use saddling the Guards with all this.  We are all Guards.  It is the duty of every citizen to insist on enforcing the law and every citizen should be a Guard in that respect.  It should not merely be talked about.</P>
    <P>During the British occupation, this country was a police country and anyone who associated in any way with the police in enforcing the law was a spy and informer.  We should forget that kind of nonsense nowadays.  We have enjoyed freedom and independence long enough to forget that sort of thing.  I emphatically deny that there is a very serious outbreak of crime in this country at the moment.</P>
    <P>In so far as the functions of the Guards are concerned in connection with juvenile crime, each and every adult has the primary duty of assisting the Guards.  Every citizen should be on his toes to assist them.  When the Guards see young lads hanging about a house, they think that they perhaps belong to the house.  Neighbours should be on the alert in regard to any strange young lads who may come about the place, whether it be street, road or avenue.  Telephones are available in practically every place and people should contact the Guards immediately. Indeed, they are invited by the Guards to do that.  I think we will have to adopt that mentality eventually and we should adopt it.</P>
    <P>It is the constitutional duty of every citizen to assist in enforcing the law. We do not do that.  We should, but we are moral cowards in that respect.  Let it be put on record that it is the moral duty of every man and woman to assist the official authority employed for the prevention and detection of crime.</P>
    <P>There is this matter of the fundamental responsibility of parents.  There <Col N="173" /> are many influences at work in connection with youth.  You have cigarettes and pictures, and the youngsters nowadays are not above wanting money to back horses.  Even though parents might exercise as effective control as they can, yet it is hard for them to keep their eyes on everything, especially things over which they have no control.  The whole problem is a complicated and difficult one, but it is one which is capable of solution if people apply themselves to it and organise themselves.</P>
    <P>I stated twice already that it is the duty of every citizen to assist in enforcing the law.  I want to emphasise that.  In regard to the menacing problem of juvenile crime, this duty becomes more imperative.  If we all did our duty, we would make the task of the Guards far easier.  They have a terrible problem on their hands, through the neglect of the people who are primarily responsible.  I do not want to rub that in, but fathers and mothers are neglecting their duty.  I do not make that charge lightly.</P>
    <P>This problem is there and there is no use shirking it.  The longer it remains without being grappled with, the greater and more difficult will it become.  If children are not disciplined at home and brought under control, it is very hard for the teacher to enforce discipline when the children come to school.  It is almost impossible for him to do so.  Reading the newspapers, one sees cases where teachers overstep their duty with regard to enforcing discipline and order in the school. <Col N="174" /> An action is brought against them and damages awarded against them for unnecessary beating of a child.  Of course, nobody could defend that.  I am afraid that it has come to the stage where the teacher has become quite passive and merely keeps the children under some kind of control until 3 p.m. and then gets rid of them.</P>
    <P>Parental control is needed.  Parents should authorise the teachers to enforce reasonable discipline and control and instil into the children a sense of citizenship.  The teacher needs to be backed up in that by the authority of the parents.  When I was at school, we used to get some sharp raps and there was not a word about it and neither was there any action.  We are too mollycoddled in this age.  If we are to solve this problem, fathers and mothers must enforce discipline.  That is the kernel of the whole problem. Then they should support the teachers. Reasonable restraint and control of the children will go a long way towards solving a problem which is really becoming menacing every day.  Every day one opens the paper, one reads of a whole series of these cases of juvenile crime.  It really amazes me.  The thing is to create some machinery whereby we can check this situation before it becomes too menacing and gets out of control.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply on 20th March, 1958, to a similar question put down by him. Since then approval in principle was conveyed on 21st March to the development for housing purpose of the school site at Garryowen.  On the same date the corporation were informed, regarding the proposed scheme at Well Field, that the lay-out plan submitted was not considered suitable and certain specific suggestions for the amendment of the plan were conveyed to the housing authority whose further proposals are awaited.</P>
      <P>The position in regard to the other scheme and the compulsory purchase orders referred to in the previous reply is unaltered.</P>
      <P>A proposal to erect 24 additional houses as an extension of the Island Road scheme was received on 5th instant and is at present being examined in the Department.  A decision on this proposal will issue as soon as possible.</P>
