      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will indicate the number of new industries in the State since 1st April, 1957, the number of persons employed by them and the total amount of money granted by the Government in respect of them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of new industries and extensions to existing industrial undertakings which came to the notice of my Department as having commenced production in the period from 1st April, 1957, to 30th April, 1958, is 115.  There may, of course, be others of which there is no official <Col N="1415" /> record.  It would not be possible to give employment figures without a special investigation.</P>
      <P>The making of grants for industries is the function either of An Foras Tionscal under the Undeveloped Areas Acts, 1952 and 1957, or of the Industrial Development Authority under the Industrial Grants Act, 1956, as may be appropriate according to the location of the industries.  Each of these bodies is required to submit an annual report to be laid on the Table of each House of the Oireachtas, and I do not think that they should be required to supply information other than that included in their annual reports or in advance of the publication of these reports.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the question relates to grants from the Hospitals' Trust Fund towards the cost of capital works and towards the revenue deficits of the specialist cancer hospitals.  The total amounts so paid, in the period from 1st April, 1948, to 31st March, 1958, are £849,924 in respect of capital works, and £466,531 in respect of revenue deficits.</P>
      <P>In addition to the foregoing amounts paid, as indicated, from the Hospitals' Trust Fund, it is estimated that health authorities in the period paid to the hospitals concerned, in respect of patients sent in by them for treatment, a sum of well over £500,000.</P>

      <P>The Land Commission are taking all practicable steps towards the relief of congestion in County Kerry as elsewhere.  For this purpose an area of about 560 acres was taken over in the county during the year ended 31st March, 1958, and, at that date, proceedings were in progress for the acquisition or resumption of a further 700 acres approximately. Last year, an area of about 1,100 acres was allotted by the Land Commission in County Kerry, this land being devoted almost exclusively to the relief of congestion by way of enlargement and rearrangement.</P>

      <P>These procedural changes relate to the period preceding the commissioners' decision as to whether, or not, to negotiate for purchase or institute acquisition proceedings. Under the old system, both voluntary and compulsory subjects generally underwent the same two successive report stages, viz., (1)  preliminary and (2)  suitability and price. That system involved two visits by the reporting inspector.  A detailed valuation of the lands was invariably made at the suitability and price stage, although further progress may not have been indicated.</P>
      <P>Under the new system, voluntary and compulsory subjects receive distinct treatment, there being only one report stage, viz., purchase/acquisition.</P>
      <P>This new arrangement generally involves only one visit by the reporting inspector, compared with two visits previously.  A detailed valuation of the lands is omitted, unless there are indications that further progress, towards purchase, is feasible.  Obviously, the new system has decided advantages from the standpoint of efficiency.</P>
      <P>Resumption cases are governed by different legal provisions.  The inspection procedure affecting them is under examination.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Since I was speaking yesterday I have had an opportunity of looking in greater detail at the notes on Table 1 of the Tables circulated with the Budget.  I want to take the opportunity of saying that the Minister was perfectly correct and that the notes are quite clear.  He was quite correct in saying that, as expressed therein, it appears that there was £50,000 more than was provided by Budget time.  However, it is equally obvious that part of the general overestimation that has been taken every year must have included certain Civil Service savings&mdash;savings because staff posts that became vacant were not filled, and so on.  I wonder if the Minister has an equivalent figure for that saving as part of the general over- <Col N="1433" /> estimation for earlier years, the breakdown in respect of earlier years, as the comparison would be most interesting.</P>
      <P>I think the note at the bottom of the Minister's Table 1 proves one thing quite conclusively, just as the same result was reached after Deputy MacEntee's Budget of 1954, namely, that you cannot take specific savings and expect to get general overestimation on the same basis as normal. Personally, I agree entirely with the manner in which the Minister has retricted the credit he has taken in this year.</P>
      <P>I was saying last night before reporting progress that I was surprised to read the speech by the Minister for External Affairs in Cork; that I thought that speech was tending towards urging spending rather than saving in this country as well as talking about the American slump and saving and spending there.  I should like the Minister to be quite specific in his reply as to whether that is or is not his policy.  My view is that unless you have adequate saving you will never get the response required to any national loans.  The results of national loans are determined not so much on the terms of the issue of the national loan itself as on whether there are in the community adequate accumulations of savings at the time at which such a loan is floated.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister also, when he is replying, to give us clearly his view in relation to the capital programme. We have a very substantial reduction on capital account in certain items of this proposed capital Budget. I saw in one Sunday newspaper some time ago the opinion expressed by one person that it was desirable to reduce Government expenditure, particularly on the capital account.  I disagree entirely with that view so expressed.  It is desirable to reduce Government expenditure on the current account but if we do not increase our productive, as apart from unproductive, capital expenditure, if we do not maintain an adequate volume of productive capital expenditure, we have no hope of ever improving our economic position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I succeeded to the Minister's <Col N="1434" /> seat I found that the State capital programme was under 50 per cent. productive. I think the Minister will find, if he looks at the figures, that in the two years I was there I changed that situation and increased the productive nature of the capital programme from 47 per cent. to 62 per cent. I hope the Minister will be able to continue with that trend and ensure that we have as adequate a volume of productive capital expenditure as the people will maintain.</P>
    <P>We hear frequently in relation to State capital expenditure references to the amount necessary for the servicing of debt.  However, people do not always take into account the amount that is there on the other side of the picture, that is, the repayment of Exchequer advances, sinking fund and interest.  I should like the Minister to indicate whether he is considering the term &ldquo;productive capital expenditure&rdquo; which he used himself as meaning self-financing capital expenditure or whether he has the broader description of &ldquo;productive&rdquo; in mind&mdash;something that increases the national income as a whole.</P>
    <P>The amounts repaid every year to the Exchequer in respect of earlier capital expenditure are substantial. Take, for example, the year 1956-57. The amount in that year that was paid in interest on the national debt was just under £11,000,000.  The amount paid for sinking fund was £5,000,000. But the amount that came back to the Exchequer was just under £5,700,000. Therefore, in that year, the net charge was some £10,000,000.  This year ahead of us, the net charge is £12,500,000, representing a gross outgoing for sinking fund and interest of £19,750,000, less £7,200,000 which is coming in by way of repayment to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that whatever way one looks at the position it should be the net figures that are always to be taken into account rather than the gross figures.  As I am dealing with capital expenditure may I, in parenthesis, say I am amazed to hear not a sound from the Fianna Fáil Deputies about the manner in which certain local loans funds and local authorities' capital expenditure have <Col N="1435" /> been reduced?  When they were on the Opposition Benches, the Fianna Fáil Deputies used to make the welkin ring in respect of that matter.  I can remember particularly how Deputy Briscoe held up this House for I think a whole day, if not two days, on a motion he had down in relation to Dublin Corporation's allotment in 1955-56.  The allotment given to Dublin Corporation in that year was £4,900,000.  The allotment for last year and for the current year is £2,777,000&mdash;and there is not a squeak from any Fianna Fáil Deputy or councillor.  One can see from that, as one can see in respect of other things, the sincerity with which they were at that time speaking.</P>
    <P>I can remember also reading the Fianna Fáil general election manifesto. In that manifesto they said specifically, under the signature of the Taoiseach:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;For this purpose and to provide a stimulus for the recovery and expansion of private business activity, Fianna Fáil will increase the amount of capital expenditure by the State and local authorities.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Instead of being increased, it has been decreased very substantially indeed and it would be interesting to us to hear from the Minister why, in relation to that particular, the Government have gone back again and reneged on the promise that they made during the general election campaign and, no doubt, with that promise, obtained considerable votes throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I have here, also, an interesting leaflet published by the Cork candidates&mdash;I do not see any of them in the House at the moment&mdash;Messrs. Daly, Galvin, Healy, Lynch.  The Minister for Education told the people:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Fianna Fáil have a plan for full employment.  These plans have met with the approval of industrialists, trades unions and farmers.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The trade unions publicly told the Minister exactly what they thought of the Fianna Fáil plans very recently. I have yet to discover a farmer who finds any satisfaction in the Fianna Fáil plans for employment and perhaps <Col N="1436" /> the Minister will explain where the approval is in respect of industrialists.</P>
    <P>In that respect I should like, also, to get clear once and for all as to where do the Government stand in relation to the £100,000,000 plan or proposal&mdash;call it what you like&mdash;published by Deputy Lemass in October, 1955.  I thought that it had been dropped and I was hoping that it had been dropped because it was an entirely ill-conceived proposition. Rumour has it that the Minister for Lands persuaded the Tánaiste to drop it.  Certainly the Minister for Lands has been at great pains again and again to say that it was not a policy, not a firm proposal.  Then I picked up recently the first issue of a new magazine called <i>Development</i> issued in April, 1958, and I found there this quotation from an interview with the Tánaiste:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The great programme of £100,000,000 capital investment outlined by you, is it in abeyance now?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste's answer was:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Not at all.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Let us try to see where we are in that respect so that the country may at least know the policy of the Government in relation thereto.</P>
    <P>I want to make it perfectly clear that I think our circumstances are such that Keynesian theories, on a misunderstanding of which those proposals were framed, have no application to the circumstances of our open economy but I think it is desirable that the country should have the opportunity of knowing where the Government stands in relation thereto.</P>
    <P>I also remember the statement in the <i>Irish Press</i> of the 27th November, 1956, on the question of capital expenditure, in which he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Fianna Fáil had no hesitation in pledging that as soon as it got into office in the reasonably near future they would go ahead and complete the rural electrification scheme as originally planned and bring the supply to every rural house that would accept it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>When we were in office, even in the last year, the amount spent by the <Col N="1437" /> E.S.B. was very substantially in excess of the amount provided for in their capital programme of this year.  The estimated expenditure, as quoted by the Minister for Industry and Commerce in reply to me on the 29th April, is £5.15 million for the whole E.S.B. works, very considerably less than the £8,000,000 odd that was the normal practice in the years preceding the advent to power of this Government.</P>
    <P>I referred already to the issues to local authorities and Dublin Corporation. We will perhaps have a better opportunity of discussing that on the Vote for the Department of Local Government.  It is rather interesting to note that, with all the ballyhoo and all the propaganda started by Fianna Fáil in relation to local authorities' expenditure, the amount expended in 1957-58 was within £100,000 of the estimate made by me that the Minister will find on the file dated 4th January, 1957&mdash; £8,500,000 as against £8,600,000&mdash;and the breakdown of that between the Departments of Local Government, Health, Education and Industry and Commerce is exactly as was indicated in the general pattern and general picture in January, 1957.</P>
    <P>I want very briefly to refer to one other thing dealing with the question of our economic position 12 months ago.  I said yesterday and I want to repeat to-day that all the economic indicators were that we had passed the peak of our difficulties before the present Government took office.  Our external payments had come to balance in the financial year 1956-57, as was admitted by the present Minister for Finance in his Budget speech of last year.  The volume of exports was already rising.</P>
    <P>The volume of exports continued to rise during 1957, mostly cattle exports, and I do not think the Minister will suggest that the Government had anything to do with the increased volume of cattle exported last year.  They were all born and on the land long before the Minister came into that seat.  Butter production was already on the increase and was bound to be on the increase, apart from the weather, for which neither the Minister <Col N="1438" /> not I can claim any credit, although I believe Fianna Fáil do sometimes think that they should claim credit for the weather.  Butter production was on the increase because of the improvement in calf prices and, in consequence of that, more cows calving.</P>
    <P>If one takes the graph of transportable goods production, the graph shows clearly that we had passed the bottom in February and were going upwards. The consumer price index was being held at level pegging notwithstanding the increase in import prices.  Sales of postage stamps, even, as an indicator of economic activity, had increased and passed their lowest point.  Note circulation had increased also, by comparison with the previous year, before 5th March.</P>
    <P>The unemployment figures have been challenged here from time to time.  Let me say quite clearly that in relation to the unemployment figures the best test is, perhaps, the percentage of unemployed to insured persons. If Deputies will look at Table XII of the Economic Statistics they will see that for the whole year 1957, even, the figure 9.2 per cent.&mdash;too high, I agree &mdash;was considerably below the figure for 1953 which was always quoted by Fianna Fáil as one of their extremely good years.  If one takes the percentages for January, February and March, 1957, and compares those percentages with similar figures for January, February and March, 1956, and January, February and March, 1955, in each case it will be seen that the improvement was there on a percentage basis up to mid-March.  Similarly, when the total live register is compared&mdash;not absolutely, because, when I mentioned this before, it was said that it always went down at that time of the year, which, of course, it does&mdash;with similar dates in 1956 and 1955, again, the difference shows that the peak had been passed in that respect for unemployment before Fianna Fáil went into office.</P>
    <P>Finally in relation to unemployment, if one takes the &ldquo;benefit claims current&rdquo; figures and compares January, February and March, 1957, with January, February and March 1956, <Col N="1439" /> month for month, in January there was a difference of 15.69; in February this difference dropped to 14.08 and in March the difference dropped to 7.24, all showing that the trend was there quite conclusively before the Fianna Fáil Government took office.  Let me say emphatically in that respect that the Fianna Fáil Party were entirely successful in one regard, and that was in making the people believe that the peak had not been passed.  I have always handed it to them as propagandists.</P>
    <P>There is one other point I want to mention in relation to unemployment. Deputy Lemass, speaking on the 14th March, 1956, said.  &ldquo;The next Fianna Fáil Budget will mark the beginning of a determined attack on the twin enemies of emigration and unemployment.&rdquo; There have been two Fianna Fáil Budgets since that and I think most of us will find it very difficult to find in this Budget any sign of that determined attack.</P>
    <P>What are our problems at the present time and how can we cope with them?  I suggest there are four problems which must be solved and that there are four ways in which we must approach the solution of our economic difficulties.  First, we must set out to make an improvement in management techniques, not merely in industry but in agriculture, and management techniques not only in relation to the man at the top but all the way down.  We must ensure that we have better direction from the top.  We must take advantage of modern management methods right from the board room of a company, or from the farmer himself, right down to the last operation.  I do not see any sign in this Budget of anything positive towards that end.</P>
    <P>The second thing is that we must proceed apace and encourage in every possible way we can the discovery, the adaptation and the spreading of new technical knowledge.  So far as agriture is concerned the parish plan seems to be one of the best ways of doing that.  I want to take advantage of this opportunity to say categorically I acknowledge the debt which the whole community owes to Macra na <Col N="1440" /> Feirme for its initial work in that respect.  We have, however, to make certain that we push the spread of new technical knowledge much more strenuously than we have already in relation to agriculture.  We have got to improve our techniques for discovering new technical knowledge.</P>
    <P>I must confess, however, that I fail completely to understand the manner in which the Government have seen fit to select the method of election for the Agricultural Research Institute.  It seems to me that bodies of great importance such as the National Farmers' Association and Macra na Feirme, to mention two, and the Creamery Milk Suppliers' Association to mention a third, have been put in that election on a par with bodies that are not of anything like their importance.  I cannot understand why such a method of election was selected.  Indeed, it bears to the reader the interpretation that they were jumbled together in the way in which they were, for the purpose of getting a particular result, and that result will certainly not be to the benefit of the institute, or to the benefit of agricultural research.  In relation to the discovery, adaptation and spreading of technical knowledge in industry, we must ensure that more can be done in that respect.  I do not think this Budget gives any assistance to that second point.</P>
    <P>The third point I want to make is that we have got to ensure our sales methods and facilities abroad are improved. In that respect I look forward hopefully&mdash;whether my hopes will be realised or not I do not know&mdash;but I hope there will be some results coming from the marketing committee instituted last year.  We have been all too slow in appreciating as a people that in relation to exports it is not manufacture which is the vital point, but the method of being able to ensure that our goods, when manufactured, are sold abroad.  There is one manufacturing industry in my constituency of which I am aware, which makes, more or less, the same commodity made over the years.  Some years ago, however, it was able to get a tie-in, from the point of view of getting sales facilities abroad, with an <Col N="1441" /> international firm and, as a result, it has expanded its sales abroad in an immense fashion.  It has been able to increase production and to increase employment due to the sales facilities made available to it by the international concern I have mentioned.  We must ensure that we concentrate on that point.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister has allocated the trifle that he has allocated for whiskey sales because I disagree with the view expressed by Deputy McQuillan.  I think the Minister in doing so, in making this allotment, was, if I may put it so, expressing in a practical way his penance for the great mistake made by Fianna Fáil during the war, the mistake of preventing the distillers going for the American market at the time when the British Government were doing everything they possibly could to push the sale of Scotch whisky.  Apart from that, the Minister is as aware as I am that the distilling industry is one which brings some £6,000,000 into the revenue and that it is unfair, therefore, it should be attacked in the way in which it was attacked by Deputy McQuillan.</P>
    <P>The fourth method, of course, on which we must concentrate is the productive capital expenditure to support the three other points I have already mentioned, and I have already dealt with the position in relation to that expenditure.</P>
    <P>Deputy Costello when he spoke referred to the question of death duties. We did make a start in relation to death duties under Section 21 of the Finance Act, 1956.  I think it is unfortunate more publicity has not been given by members of the Stock Exchanges who are, perhaps, the people best fitted, to propagandise the effects of that section.</P>
    <P>We will have trouble, year after year, in relation to our current Budget and in relation to the amount of savings that are available to support a productive capital programme unless we can get the economy expanded, unless we can get additional wealth into the country.  One of the ways of doing that would be by way of a more <Col N="1442" /> enlightened policy in relation to death duties than we have been able to have up to the present time.  I hope the Minister, as time goes on, will find himself in agreement with that and will be able to implement it.</P>
    <P>That is a thing, however, which must be accepted from all sides of the House, because if it is not accepted, the result will be that people will not come in here, and unless we can get in additional wealth, we cannot support a productive capital programme of the size required to meet the needs of the time.  Apart from that no Minister for Finance will be able to lighten the rateable burden, apart from the gross burden.  The more money we can get in, in that way, the more we will be able to expand in other respects&mdash; respects which we all desire.</P>
    <P>In respect to death duties, I would particularly ask the Minister to examine certain memoranda he will find in his office in relation to the comparison between our rates and those in Northern Ireland.  The northern rates are lower and that is entirely undesirable. In the case of a person of moderate means, our rate is 4 per cent. higher than theirs.  I became aware of that only in the latter half of 1956. It is a thing which is likely to militate against us in the future.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, this Budget does nothing but continue, consolidate and enforce the 1957 Budget, with its hardships and difficulties.  It does nothing to improve production on the four lines I mentioned a few moments ago.  On the contrary, far from giving any such encouragement, it is to some extent a deterrent.  The Budget is in entire repudiation of all the promises made from election platforms by Fianna Fáil a year ago.  It is a cynical repudiation of those promises, a cynical repudiation which will be met in the country with the reception it deserves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The Budget has shocked a number of people, not because of any new impositions but because those who were severely hit by the taxes imposed by the 1957 Budget were expecting some relief and were definitely entitled to it, but they <Col N="1443" /> did not get it.  A number of people, including many Fianna Fáil supporters throughout the country, said: &ldquo;The poor fellows had to do hard things last year because of the horrible inter-Party Government for a number of years, but this year they will make it good to us.&rdquo; That has not happened. Those people were hard hit and were definitely entitled to some amelioration of the pretty savage lot imposed on them in the 1957 Budget.</P>
      <P>The Minister has found a new trick &mdash;although trick is not the correct term to apply on this occasion&mdash;for putting on hidden taxes.  I refer to the method he has found of slashing some of the Estimates, the very Estimates which give most employment, particularly to the ordinary working class.  In his own Department, in the Office of Public Works, he has cut the emergency and relief schemes to which many people turned in winter months when employment was slack.  Vote 9 has been cut by £204,000 and Vote 10 by £59,000, both in his Department.  It is unfortunate that it is the very part of the Votes which give employment in rural areas that has been cut in both cases.  I pass by Vote 19 which is cut by £140,000 as there is a footnote that some of it has been transferred to the Central Fund.  If such be the case, I have nothing to say to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Vote 36, for the Department of Local Government, the Minister has saved £1,050,000 by the simple expedient of slashing housing grants and practically wiping out the grants under the Local Authorities (Works) Act. Housing gives a great deal of employment. If the Minister can say that the applications for grants were falling to justify a cut of £79,000, I could take that, but I do not think that is the case.  Although this is not the proper place, let me comment, in passing, that, since the Government took office, it is almost impossible to get a grant, to which people are entitled under the law we make here.  Every trick in the bag has been used, first, to delay people and then, when the house is finished and the builders are clamouring for their money, the only fault the <Col N="1444" /> inspector can find is that the lavatory cistern is not filling quickly enough.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I know it would come properly under the Estimates, but I was dealing with the way the Minister saved £700,000 in making up his Budget.  The Local Authorities (Works) Act gives employment entirely in the rural areas, and if the Minister could not find money except by cutting employment to the very people fleeing from our country, he is no longer capable of holding the post of Minister for Finance.  We all talk about emigration and the flight from the land.  I regard emigration as very serious and think it is a great pity to see our youth going.  I have said a thousand times that they are going because they do not get employment.  There is not enough private employment to keep them at home.  The Minister is contributing very much to the flight from the land by cutting down on the Estimates which give employment in rural areas.</P>
      <P>He has cut down on that part of the Land Commission Vote which gives employment, by £20,000.  He has cut down on forestry by a total of £100,000 on the parts that give employment. After the welter of new taxes he imposed last year&mdash;including the removal of the flour and bread subsidies&mdash;he should have been able to find some new method of keeping up employment. Surely, in the manipulation of the global figure which appears on the cover of the Book of Estimates, he could have found some other savings, besides savings by disemploying people throughout the country.  I do not see what else he has saved and I have scanned the Book of Estimates and have looked for increases and decreases on the various Estimates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any Minister for Finance can save <Col N="1445" /> money and bring in a Budget that is presentable, presentable to a certain type of people at any rate, if he cuts out expenditure.  A Minister for Finance, on the other hand, can do a lot of good by increasing employment. There is not enough private employment in this country to use up the available labour and the result is that people are being shoved on to the dole and on to unemployment benefit or are taking the boat and leaving for England and America.</P>
    <P>That is one of the bad features of this Budget which deserves to be thrashed out in this House and made public, not for the sake of criticising the Minister but in order to keep the Minister and the Government informed of what is wrong and where they are going wrong.  That is the duty of an Opposition.  Let me say that when the inter-Party Government were in power, there were many times when we were hard put for money.  We could have found money in the same way as the Fianna Fáil Party, by raising blisters on the people and by removing the food subsidies so that the people would have to pay more for their essential foodstuffs.  We could have found plenty of money by depriving them of employment.  Instead, we increased employment in every single branch of the Government service and in many other ways, such as by the payment of the housing grants and other things which have come to a standstill since this Government came to office.</P>
    <P>I could not let this opportunity pass without condemning the Government for what they have done during the past 13 months.  Last year, they came in with a great flourish of trumpets. They got an overall majority in the last election because of the promises they made, promises which were made principally by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  He went around the country beating a drum about the £100,000,000 he was going to spend and the 100,000 new jobs he was going to create.  That led the people to support Fianna Fáil at the time and I do not blame them for doing so.  It was one of the most fantastic bids made to the <Col N="1446" /> electorate of this country&mdash;to say that he was going to spend £100,000,000 on the development of the country and create 100,000 new jobs.  I do not blame the thousands of people who changed from supporting the inter-Party Government to supporting a Party which made promises like those, scandalous promises.</P>
    <P>To-day, instead of trying to honour those promises and giving the employment which he promised just 13 months ago, he has deliberately thrown more on to the unemployed list, and I suppose there are double the number appearing on the list, if we calculated the number who have fled to England.  The Taoiseach himself was not above making the same promises.  He made them in my own county&mdash;in Belmullet and in Castlebar &mdash;while at the same time the Minister for Industry and Commerce was down in the South of Ireland making those promises also.  It was a concerted arrangement between the two of them and possibly the Minister for Finance was in on it at the time.</P>
    <P>We did not believe in making such a bid as that.  Apart from the fraud contained in such promises, I think these things are going to undermine the whole security of the country, because they disillusion the people. We cannot blame the people then when they say that people in public life cannot be trusted.  For generations to come, the promises made by Fianna Fáil can be flung in the faces of public men.  Furthermore, I do not see how the people can respect the laws which we make in this House when we ourselves go down the country at election times and think nothing of making such fantastic promises and think that no bid is too high for the votes of the electorate.  It has done immense damage and will continue to do immense damage.</P>
    <P>The Government should bend their efforts towards the giving of more employment which coupled with emigration, is our worst problem.  The class which is leaving the country is the pick of the working class.  I am told also that many young people who have been educated for the professions have to go also, and, if that is the case, it <Col N="1447" /> is too bad.  The greater number, however, are the ordinary working class people with only a national school education.  They are not going from the country for the good of their health, or to see the colour of the eyes or the hair of the people to whose country they are going.  They are people who cannot get their living here.  If, in all seriousness, we want to stop emigration, we must devote more public money to giving employment in the development of our own country.  We will not stop it suddenly; no Government will.  It has been going on since the time of the Famine and going on non-stop since then, with the exception of the time when the inter-Party Government came into office. We had brought it to a stop, but when the Fianna Fáil Party came back into office they started it again, since 1951 to the present time.  It is doubtful if any Government will re-establish the confidence which we had at that time in stopping emigration.</P>
    <P>Work in the rural areas is essential, and while the Undeveloped Areas Act is doing good work, there are other rural works to help stop emigration and build up assets for the State.  I will discuss that in more detail when the Votes for Fisheries and Forestry come up for debate.  The Minister comes from a rural constituency and I am sure employment for the young people is just as difficult and scarce in his constituency as it is in mine.  There is no way of stopping the flight from the land, except by devoting more public money to giving employment in some of the lines I have indicated.</P>
    <P>The Budget should be condemned for the fact that the blisters raised on the people by last year's Budget have not been eased.  There is no relief given in taxes and none is devoted to stopping the flight from the land and easing the employment situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with interest to the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Sweetman, and I think that in attempting to defend the position of the former Government, which was attacked by the Minister for Health, he was excessively courageous.  The <Col N="1448" /> situation which we face now, and the situation he probably faced during his period of office, did not stem directly from any particular act of his solely. If he is culpable in any way, it is possibly to the extent that he did not recongnise that he was faced with the position where the social and economic methods and theories of Government which had been used over the past 25 or 30 years, long before he took over office, had proved unworkable and had created a situation with which he was unable to deal.  No matter how much one listens to his apologia for the activities of himself and his colleagues during their period of office, the hard fact remains that he was Minister for Finance in a Government which had at one time during its period of office 94,000 unemployed&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and about 40,000 had to emigrate.  He is talking to a Minister now in control who can claim that he has operated our finances to perpetuate&mdash;again I suppose he cannot be said to be personally directly or wholly responsible&mdash;a situation in which there are, or were until recently, 85,000 or 86,000 unemployed.</P>
      <P>I was very shocked to see in a trade union publication recently that the estimated emigration figures were something in the region of 60,000. Simple addition of those two figures&mdash; between 130,000 and 140,000 unemployed persons&mdash;is the clearest assessment of the success or failure&mdash;and of course, it is the failure&mdash;of the political leaders in this country, not during the time of office of Deputy Sweetman or the present Minister but over the whole 35 years of native government. Those can be said to be the true unemployment figures: 94,000 or 95,000 plus 40,000 emigrants; 80,000 plus 50,000 or 60,000.  It is quite clear that on neither side have our political leaders succeeded in meeting the problems of our time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In listening to the financial experts on both sides one is struck by their apparent preoccupation with sums of addition and subtraction, preoccupation with the balancing of the figures <Col N="1449" /> on the right hand side of the column with those on the left and with apparently only a relative interest, a passing interest, in the human content of the figures they are discussing. Relatively little has been said about the problems of unemployment and emigration and the implications to the human beings involved in these very sad problems beyond the time-worn clichés of further capital investment of a vague, unstated nature.  Deputy Sweetman mentioned, as his fifth proposition for prosperity, productive capital investment.  Having spoken nearly two hours or more discussing our social and economic problems, it seems to me to be a very slight sop to throw away if it is to be taken as his solution for the present position of demoralisation, decadence and near bankruptcy facing the country.</P>
    <P>Listening to the Minister speaking on the Budget the other day it was difficult to believe that a Minister of State could&mdash;with, as he must have, the magnificent Civil Service machine behind him, the fullest access to the clearest possible picture of the state of the country to-day&mdash;come to the House with this completely negative, sterile and unimaginative Budget and its proposals.  It cannot bear serious consideration if it is to be understood as a weapon whereby economic policy to beat unemployment and emigration is to be determined for the years ahead.</P>
    <P>It offers no solution whatsoever for the problems which face the country. Emigration figures were never higher. In the years 1951 to 1956, net emigration was in the region of 200,000, an average of about 50,000 to 60,000 a year.  From each of the provinces emigration continued at an unbelievably high rate, denuding the countryside, the country towns and villages with a headlong flight from rural Ireland.  There were 17,000 or more from Ulster; nearly 26,000 from Connaught; over 22,000 from Munster &mdash;young boys and girls, the vast majority of them ill-equipped to make their living in Britain, America or any of the other places where they could find a home.</P>
    <P>I find it difficult to understand the <Col N="1450" /> mentality of the Government in face of the figures for emigration and in face of the unfortunate men, on an average 8 per cent. unemployed&mdash;60,000, 70,000 or 80,000 of them standing on street corners, suffering the inevitable slow demoralisation and degradation of being fit, able and anxious to work and yet denied by their own society, by their own people, that fundamental constitutional right and finding that the only people prepared and able to offer them work are people in other lands.</P>
    <P>I am not a great seer or a great economist.  What I can see everybody else in this House can see, and knows full well.  Nobody knows better than the present Minister the seriousness of the present situation in our society, but he&mdash;and I blame to a lesser extent his predecessor because of his relatively short time in office&mdash;has refused to face up with his colleagues&mdash;for there is collective responsibility in this&mdash;to the fact of which he is fully aware that, carrying on as we are in the Republic, we must gradually and soon find ourselves in a position where we, as a useful independent national entity with any real viability or national purpose, ultimately must cease to exist.</P>
    <P>Deputy Childers recently comforted us in the new magazine <i>Development</i> by pointing out that emigration is no worse here than it is in the Highlands of Scotland.  Is that the objective of the Government?  Is it the objective of our Government to create a situation such as they have in the Highlands of Scotland, vast stretches of deer parks and game preserve?  That the Minister for Finance is well aware of the critical nature of our position is clear from his last Budget speech where he said at column 958, Volume 161 of the Official Debates of 8th May, 1957:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is clear we have come to a critical stage in our economic affairs. The policies of the past, though successful in some directions, have not so far given us what we want.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He went on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Further progress on a worth-while scale calls for a comprehensive view of our economic policy.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1451" /> The Minister said that this time last year.  He could be forgiven this time last year for not providing us with a comprehensive review of our economic policy and the radical and fundamental change which is needed.  However, I do not think he can be forgiven a year later for, once again, having faced the problems with which he is faced, having considered them and assessed them, he should not be satisfied to present the House with this Budget which offers no hope to anyone, no hope of dispelling the widespread national despair which has eaten into the hearts of our people and which has now led them to the belief that there is little or no hope or efficacy in our democratic institutions, and no ability in the elected representatives to govern the country and to create social justice in a prosperous economy 35 years after many of the older members of us won us freedom.</P>
    <P>The Minister claims in his Budget that he has reduced expenditure by £3,000,000.  This Budget in many ways is an epoch-making Budget, and I shall explain why.  First of all, in a relatively minor way, it is important because of the curious change of attitude which this one-time great radical Party with radical policies has adopted towards our society.  These changes are reflected in the reductions and the increases which they have decided to make in the Estimates.  It has been decided, for instance, to cut expenditure on the provision of fuel for necessitous families, on unemployment assistance, on old age pensions, on help to the blind and on secondary education.  Except possibly for those in secondary schools these are probably the most dependent, the most needy, hard pressed and underprivileged sections in our society.  The Government have decided that less need be voted for these people in order that more can be made available to the new class, the new interests or the new allegiances which the Fianna Fáil Party have now formed.</P>
    <P>It is a complete reversal of its former policy of caring for these underprivileged and down-trodden people in our society.  This money the Government have ordained was badly needed <Col N="1452" /> for additional expenditure on the Royal Irish Academy, the National Museum, the presidential establishment and for the Taoiseach's favourite pastime, higher mathematics, cosmic physics, and the rest.  It is clear that he is more concerned now with the man in the moon than he is with the welfare of the man in the street, and the people are at last beginning to understand that.</P>
    <P>Therefore, in a minor way, the Budget is epoch-making, because it illustrates the change that is taking place in the standard of values of the Government Party, the standard of priorities.  It is a new interpretation of the old Robin Hood principle of robbing the poor to pay the rich.  In a modern democracy, it must be an unprecedented decision for a Government to take.</P>
    <P>In a major way, the Budget is also significant.  It makes clear beyond question that the conservative, right-wing reactionary elements in the Party now completely control policy.  In all worth-while political organisations, there is a constant struggle between the progressive and the conservative elements, and, as in any other good, live Party, that has been going on in Fianna Fáil.  It is now clear from the standstill, hands-off, take no action, something-is-bound-to-turn-up attitude displayed in the Budget, that the Taoiseach, probably the Minister for Lands and the Minister for Finance have won in the battle to maintain the conservative policies which have led us into the economic morass in which the country finds itself to-day.</P>
    <P>These men must have seen the terribly serious and, in many cases, very sad consequences of last year's Budget, offset to some extent by the taking away of £9,000,000 for distribution amongst the very wealthiest sections of the community, taking it from the poor and the white collar worker&mdash; for he paid also in indirect taxation&mdash; and imposing great hardship in particular on those sections who have no organisations to care for them, the widows, the orphans, the old age pensioners, the blind and, in particular, the unemployed.  They must have seen <Col N="1453" /> the repercussions of that Budget.  I have certainly seen in my own constituency serious malnutrition amongst the families of widows and old people living in conditions of half-starvation. I say that without fear of contradiction, and, if anybody wants proof, I can bring him along and show him.</P>
    <P>These men are careless of the effects of that Budget and intend to stand over it, feeling that they have done well by those whom they now primarily represent&mdash;businessmen, industrialists, shipowners, master bakers, flour millers, exporters, the moneyed classes and the propertied classes generally. That is again a revolutionary change for a Party which was one time a great radical workers' Party who certainly, I believe, had their interests at heart.</P>
    <P>This Budget is significant again in another way.  It represents, once and for all, the final defeat and rout of probably the only able individual in the Cabinet&mdash;the Tánaiste.  So it is quite clear&mdash;it seems to be clear at any rate&mdash;that the war of succession is now over.  The imaginative plan of the Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash; even if Deputy Sweetman did not approve of it&mdash;at least had an object that was worthy of consideration and discussion and worthy of the ideal he had in mind&mdash;vast State capital expenditure for the creation of full employment. At least, it attempted to do something for a country in sore need of action of some kind or other.  There is no doubt, from the reading of this Budget, that the plans of the Tánaiste for full employment have been dismissed from serious consideration in the political life of the country.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Lands pooh-poohed them, suggesting that they were never possible and that, when many of us listened to the plan being expounded in Clery's a year and a half or so ago, the Minister was, as it were, merely delivering himself of a speech at a university debating society which was discussing some abstract conundrum in the science of government, instead of dealing with the problem of full employment. I do not think that is so. I believe Deputy Blowick is right. There was considerable enthusiasm for the suggestion in the country.  They <Col N="1454" /> were pleased that at least one Party had considered the situation as they saw it and decided the time was ripe for some radical, dynamic, imaginative policy for the solution of those problems&mdash;instead of the old staid, tired, worn-out ideas&mdash;which men, dedicated believers in the capitalist economic system of private enterprise, have so lamentably failed to operate in this country during the past 35 years.</P>
    <P>And so to the problem of full employment and with it the position of the Minister for Industry and Commerce in the Party has been established for all time.  Last year, the matter could be explained, because, in the first few months of office, it is difficult to make any radical changes. But this year there is no explanation beyond the fact that the Minister has lost and that we are irrevocably in the hands of hard-faced old men, to whom the problems of want, hunger, emigration, unemployment and illiterate children in overcrowded schools are mere abstractions, without any of the importance which attaches to the revival of the language or the continued existence of the School of Cosmic Physics or the Institute for Advanced Studies.</P>
    <P>Another point, I think, has been established by this Budget.  It is for this Party a novel and despicable principle.  It was a principle once attributed to the members of the Cumann na nGaedheal Government many years ago&mdash;that is quite unimportant now&mdash;but I think there is no doubt that we can fairly say this Budget now re-establishes a principle of Government which says that the Government can accept no responsibility for the provision of employment. I base that charge on the Minister's statement in his Budget speech in which he said that this means that the public capital programme should afford at least the same of volume of employment as last year.</P>
    <P>The same volume of employment as last year, as the Minister knows full well, gave us 85,000 unemployed persons and an emigration figure of 50,000 to 60,000 people, and he is content with that.  He accepts that as an inevitable <Col N="1455" /> part and parcel of life in our society&mdash;130,000 people without work. In this Budget he makes no attempt whatever to face up to the reality of the clamant demands for work of those unfortunate people because he knows that, unless the State provides the capital and the opportunity through State investment, private enterprise will not do it except to a small and unimportant degree.  He has done a Pontius Pilate act on these unfortunate people, washed his hands of the whole problem and told us that he proposes to create the economic situation in which we can look forward to another 85,000 unemployed next December, men with wives and families who, as we saw last year with Christmas coming on, went about pathetically looking for any kind of work at any price, competing with one another for a job to find a few shillings in order to make Christmas livable for their families.  Of course the 80,000 of them could not find work and they &ldquo;enjoyed&rdquo; Christmas on the dole.  Thanks to the Minister and his colleagues they will &ldquo;enjoy&rdquo; next Christmas on the dole also.</P>
    <P>It would do the Minister good if he could try in his own life to subsist for a week on the pitiful pittance which we offer to the unemployed man as a penalty for the Government's failure to find him work.  One hundred and thirty-five thousand people! The smug complacency of a Minister of a native Government tolerating these conditions among his own people defies understanding. When the British were here we could blame them and we could expect such treatment from them, a colonial imperialist power, disinterested in its colonial people; but this Government has no right to follow that pattern.  Their responsibility is to govern; it is the responsibility of the Government to find work for the unemployed and prevent our losing, as we have lost, 750,000 people out of a small population in the last 35 years.</P>
    <P>What a ghastly litany of failures can be attributed to the blundering leadership on both sides which brought our country to the state in which it now stands.  I have often heard people on <Col N="1456" /> the Fianna Fáil Benches sneering at Cumann na nGaedheal, outraged at the suggestion that a native Government could dismiss the unemployed as unimportant, throw them a few shillings and let them subsist, and in addition&mdash;insult to injury&mdash;increase the price of bread, butter, milk and tea and as compensation throw the old people a 1/- in compensation for a cost-of-living increase for which the unions said 10/- was not adequate compensation, which of course it was not.</P>
    <P>The Government have established yet another principle in this Budget, the principle of a privileged society, a privileged society in every single aspect of life which vitally affects any individual in any society&mdash;in ill-health, the right to the best health service that can possibly be provided, in old age the right to live in dignity and reasonable comfort, and in education the right to development to the fullest extent of the latent talents of any child and the gifts that God gave it. It is clear from this Budget that these are not the Government's objectives. The landlords have been replaced; the son of the manse and all his privileges and rights have been replaced by the political nabobs and their children. They are now the heirs of the world to the privileges and exclusive rights of the wealthy landlords.  When landlords were driven from the land, we hoped to replace them by a democratic Republic which we promised would cherish equally all the children of the nation.  There is no promise, no hope that under this Budget there will be any change whatever in the conditions of the aged, the sick, the unemployed and the emigrant.  The Minister and his colleagues are completely satisfied with society as they see it and propose no change that we know of.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his Budget has made no reference to, no provision that we can see for, the recession which is already sweeping Europe from America.  The unemployment figure in West Germany at the moment is something in the region of 8 per cent. In Belgium it is 7 per cent.; in France 8 per cent.; in Canada 9 per cent. and in America 8 per <Col N="1457" /> cent.  In America there are something like 5,200,000 unemployed.  Fortunately for us, there are only 2 per cent. unemployed in Great Britain.  If, however, the recession strikes in Great Britain and emigration ceases for two years, consider the position in which we shall find ourselves.  At present there are 50,000 to 60,000 emigrating every year.  We shall find ourselves with 120,000 unemployed plus the 80,000 unemployed at home, giving us a total of 200,000 people drawing unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>Without a doubt, it is then that we shall see changes because it will only be then that we shall have the political tension needed to bring about the revolutionary changes demanded by our present situation.  It is only then that we shall set about organising our society in the interests of the mass of the people instead of organising it, as it is at the moment, in the interests of a small, wealthy, powerful minority.</P>
    <P>It is clear that we have to-day what is effectively a vocational State.  In health legislation, the medical association can tell us that it is they who control health legislation for the masses of the people.  They are, of course, quite right.  They do and did control it.  We have the agricultural interests controlling agriculture.  I do not mind so much about them because theirs is the basic industry upon which we all depend and, some day, some Government will have to work intelligently with them to create prosperity for the farmers and to further the prosperity of the nation as well.  We have the industrialists determining the decisions of Government contrary to the interests of the masses of the people.</P>
    <P>Society is organised exclusively for these small, powerful groups and, to that extent, what should be a completely democratic system is negatived in so far as the interests of the masses of the people are subordinated to the promotion of the interests of the powerful minority groups.  The facts are that our public men on both sides of this House have become, in one way or another, associated with the new industrial élite and anything that is designed, therefore, to interfere with <Col N="1458" /> their position in their particular association is frustrated.  Last year's Budget illustrated that better than anything else that has happened in all our years of native government; £9,000,000 could be taken away from subsidies and distributed amongst the big business tycoons&mdash;the flour millers, the master bakers, the shipping magnates, the insurance corporations, the exporters and so forth.  This year's Budget has ratified that decision.</P>
    <P>Yet, the workers are told to increase production.  Of course, everybody knows&mdash;the people who make these absurd suggestions to the workers should know&mdash;that the only way to increase production is by increasing capital investment in industry and agriculture.  That is the main way to increase production.  That is the primary and fundamental way.  The worker has no responsibility for that. As I have said before, the worker is nearly completely at the mercy of the manufacturing process on which he is engaged.  Similarly, there is very little the craftsman or the artisan or professional man can do to increase production. Anyway, remember, output per worker increased by 30 per cent. between 1938 and 1953 but the real wages of the workers were 7 per cent. lower in 1953 than they were in 1938. There does not seem to be much incentive, therefore, to the worker to increase production.</P>
    <P>Those who are so anxious to protect the industrialist continually suggest that increased taxation cripples the businessman.  In actual fact, experience has shown the contrary.  From 1922 to 1928 the rate of taxation was reduced from 5/- in the £ to 3/6 or 3/-.  I think everybody will agree that was a period during which there was industrial stagnation, despite the reduced taxation.  From 1932 to 1938 taxation rose from 3/6 in the £ to 5/6. Again, all will agree that that was one period in our history in which there was a magnificient burst of industrial expansion, despite increased taxation. Taxation has little or nothing to do with it.</P>
    <P>One of the things that have never been explained to me is why it is advocated <Col N="1459" /> consistently that profits for industrialists should be increased and taxation be reduced in order to encourage production and prosperity.  It has never been properly explained to me why an increase in profits should be something admirable and desirable for the industrialist, while, at the same time, any suggested increase in the wages of the workers is invariably met with the argument that such increases will lead to inflation, bringing us to perdition and to economic ruin and that though profits may rise there must be wage standstills at all costs.  There is to be no ceiling to profits but there must always be wage restraints, coupled with delay in implementing increase in wages.  That is a &ldquo;must&rdquo; if we are to attain prosperity.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his Budget, was faced with a crisis situation without any doubt&mdash;a crisis situation in unemployment and emigration and possibly a recession and labour difficulties in Britain, increase in unemployment, restriction on emigration.  All these are facing the Minister.  Yet he assures us once again that the answer to our problems lies with private enterprise, in spite of the fact that he has tried, and that his opposite numbers on the other side tried, over many years to create a prosperous society in a private enterprise economy.  It cannot be done.  Surely it should be clear to anybody that it cannot be done.</P>
    <P>It should not take 25 or 30 years and the complete denudation of our land because of under-employment, unemployment, emigration, and a low standard of living into the bargain, to bring a complete realisation of that fact.  It should not need all these things which any of you can see any day in any of your constituencies in any part of Ireland to convince you that this so-called private enterprise, free competition, cannot and will not operate successfully, will not give you what no doubt you all want, a prosperous society.  We have found that out here. We should have found it out here.  I think most of the other capitalist countries in the world have found it out.  Bear in mind the figures I gave a few moments ago.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1460" /> Western Germany has been cited to us by many speakers as the home of prosperity and booming enterprise, yet there is an 8 per cent. unemployment figure there.  I listened to Deputy Cosgrave praise private enterprise in America.  Yet, there are now 5,200,000 persons unemployed in America with thousands upon thousands there on short time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall deal with that in a moment.  That is not the only alternative. France, Canada, Germany and Belgium have the same unemployment problem.  Here, we have a very much worse one&mdash;a progressive flight from the land and depolpulation of our country&mdash;from 16,000 persons in the first annual emigration figure to 18,000 in the second, to 24,000 in the third, to 40,000 in the next and at the present time it is from 50,000 to 60,000 persons, a total of 750,000 persons.  Does all that add up to success&mdash;and a low standard of living thrown in?</P>
      <P>One Minister after the other&mdash;the Ministers for Education, Health and Social Welfare&mdash;tell us we cannot provide the new schools, we cannot increase the allowances, we cannot vaccinate our unfortunate children against the impending epidemic of poliomyelitis.  God help them, they will suffer because of your failure.  The money is not there, not because of any inherent weakness in our people, not because of any lack of intelligence, lack of ability or lack of technical capacity but because these things have never been harnessed to create wealth for the mass of the people as a whole.  The interest has been restricted to create private wealth for a few individuals for their own personal advancement and the advancement of their own small family circle.  That is the type of society you believe in.  That is the selfish, mean, self-centred, &ldquo;I am all right, Jack, what about you?&rdquo; type of society in which you believe and which is now collapsing all round you in every country in Europe and in America.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to its futility, in addition <Col N="1461" /> to being given the free rein of our economy, that type of society cannot operate without a series of the most restrictive monopolistic cartels and other practices aimed at defrauding the public since it consists of nothing but rings, monopolistic agreements and cartels.  Recently Deputy Booth in one of what we have now come to recognise as his unusually unctuous hypocritical speeches, pretended he did not know of these restrictive practices which so bedevil our whole retail and distributive trades.</P>

The Restrictive Trade Practices Act was passed through this House unanimously to deal with no shibboleth, mirage or figment of my imagination but with restrictive practices which every honest Deputy was prepared to admit did exist to his own knowledge, and which as Deputy Booth full well knows of his own knowledge, do exist.  Capitalist economies are facing the reality that the good old days of war booms are now over.  The time has ended when they can get peoples and nations to go in and tear at one another's throats, thus increasing the sale of armaments and, consequently, their profits.  They now know that when they press the button the whole damn lot of us will go up, themselves included.  They know that no longer can they sit safely behind barricades counting their pounds, shillings and pence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not referring to you now.  You consider yourself not too important.  I dismiss you in a line.  In passing, I should like to refer to a magazine called <i>Development</i> in which is published an interview given by the present Minister for Lands, Deputy Childers.  On page 15 of the second edition of that magazine he is reported saying: &ldquo;Finally, where management is first class ... our workers are without equal.&rdquo; Presumably, he meant that if they are properly led&mdash;a real dare devil touch this&mdash;they are without equal but, on their own, they would go nowhere.  There is a phrase here and I want to know if it represents the Government's point of view: &ldquo;Moreover, our people do not suffer from the adverse effect of overfull employment.&rdquo; The Minister for Lands seems to be cheered by the fact that the great whip hand of unemployment is there, held over the heads of our workers.  The old capitalist slogan &mdash;I think it goes back as far as William Martin Murphy&mdash;was: maintain a pool of unemployed; then you have no trouble disciplining the workers.  That seems to be another principle established in this Budget and to which the Minister for Lands gave expression in his interview.</P>
      <P>I believe, of course, with James Connolly, in the socialist solution to the national problems of any society. I believe that ultimately we will see such a socialist solution in Ireland.  The situation does not need any new thinking. All it needs is a restatement of the old principles of socialism, that the ownership and control of the means of production and distribution shall be in the hands of the people and developed in their best interests.  It is because we have deserted those principles, because we have betrayed those ideals, in my view, that we find ourselves now at the tailend of a queue of the near bankrupts of Europe, because poor Connolly died and with him died his great ideals. Deputy O'Sullivan asked me what is happening in Siberia.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">

      <P>I think the time has come when we should examine methods <Col N="1463" /> which other countries have used on their merits and put against them the methods and the success or failure of those methods which we have used ourselves.</P>
      <P>The trade unions protested against this Budget.  Memories are short in politics and, for fear that there is any feeling amongst the Government that anybody is satisfied with the Budget except themselves, I should like to read what Mr. Walter Beirne, secretary of a trade union organisation, said about the Budget, as reported in the <i>Irish Times</i>, 25th April, 1958:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;... the Government had promised to treat unemployment as a matter of urgency and to give at priority during the last general election but the unions had been disappointed. This month they had 78,500 unemployed and there was not a solitary ray of hope from end to end of the Minister for Finance's Budget speech.</P>
      <P>The Minister had stated that the figures for unemployment had decreased by a few thousands since last year, but had neglected to point out that they were still some thousands above those of 1956.</P>
      <P>The conference, said Mr. Beirne, should show the disappointment that the trade unions felt at the Government's failure to implement its election promises, and at its failure to put forward any solution to the unemployment problem.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is sufficiently unequivocal and&mdash; I do not know this man's politics&mdash; probably, reasonably detached.  I do not know.  It certainly is not a speech of a politician and for that reason can be taken as being detached and objective.</P>
      <P>At the same conference, Mr. J.B. Colgan is reported as saying:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;He could see no future for the country when, in the last few months, its leader had listed as its three main problems the Irish language, Partition and, a very poor third, the economic situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;I think,&rsquo; said Mr. Colgan, &lsquo;that if you have a leader who is sufficiently woolly-headed to put the problems <Col N="1464" /> of the country in that order, there is no hope under the present régime for a solution to the unemployment question.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was the trade union comment on the Budget and it leaves nobody in any doubt that they have not been fooled to any degree at all.</P>
    <P>Mr. Macgougan is reported as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;He believed that too much emphasis was placed on the rôle of private enterprise, but large sectors of the economy were successfully carried on by public enterprise.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That protest and speeches like that brought an editorial in the <i>Irish Press</i> which asked&mdash;rather in the terms of Deputy O'Sullivan's interjection:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Would State socialism, in fact, provide a remedy for unemployment? Apparently it would, on certain terms.  There is the example of Soviet Russia where every man must do the work assigned to him at a wage dictated by the State and where emigration is forbidden.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the kind of silly smearing of the socialist idea which seems to spring inevitably from defenders of the old, failed, outmoded, private enterprise, capitalist economic system whenever planned economy, socialist economy, is suggested.  I do not know enough about Soviet Russia or its socialism to be able to speak of it, but we do not need to go as far away as Soviet Russia in order to find out whether socialism or a planned economy can operate successfully.</P>
    <P>One of the factors which has saved our bacon in the past ten years is the fact that, as a result of the intelligent planned State capital investment, the nationalisation of industry carried out by the late Sir Stafford Cripps and the Labour Government, there has been created in Britain a position of full employment which, up to now, has resisted better than any other country the dangers of a recession which, as I say, is sweeping America and is now invading Europe.  While unemployment is at a level of 8 or 9 per cent. in America and these other countries, in Great Britain, it is still only about 2 <Col N="1465" /> per cent.  It is true to say that, between 1951 and 1956, Britain gave work to the best part of 200,000 of our people, educated their children, treated their sick and enabled their old to live in reasonable conditions, all of which our own country could not afford to do, and would not so organise its economy in order to do it, lest it interfere with the vested interests of the industrial minority who now control our society.  That is the British welfare State; that is the planned economy for which we have every right to be grateful.</P>
    <P>I do not know anything about Russia, the rights and wrongs in relation to this question.  I am neither defending nor attacking.  I am concerned only with something about which we can all say we know something, the success of the British welfare State.  If it were not for the fact that there was full employment in Britain, we would have something in the region of 300,000 unemployed in this country at the moment, and what would we do then?  That would put an end to the complacency and self-satisfaction and to the idiotic spectacle of Deputy Briscoe talking nonsense in America criticising the British welfare State and its society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. MacCarthy Mr. MacCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask did the Deputy take into account at all the many millions who were killed in the six or eight years of war which made the gap to be filled by the Irish worker?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>It is hardly worth while dealing with that, but in the first postwar period in Britain, their level of unemployment was, if anything, very much higher than ours because they suffered under a Tory Government, as we are suffering under one form of Tory Government here.  Presumably, America, Belgium, France and these other countries with high unemployment figures also suffered losses in the last war and, consequently, should have full employment, if it was as simple as all that.  Therefore, as I say, there is nothing wrong in the suggestion of a planned economy.  I am not the first to suggest it in <Col N="1466" /> Ireland.  James Connolly was long before me, one of the greatest leading world socialist politicians and statesmen of whom all of us, I am sure, should be proud.</P>
      <P>However, lest somebody believes this is a radical suggestion, a dangerous suggestion, I should like to draw attention to the official organ of the Association of Chambers of Commerce of Ireland, April, 1958.  There could be nothing more innocent and innocuous than that.  There is an editorial in it which Deputy O'Sullivan might be interested in: &ldquo;Comprehensive Planning in Democracies.&rdquo; It states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;There is a popular misconception that economic planning involves the acceptance of some degree of totalitarianism; this misconception is due to the fact that totalitarian régimes resort freely to compulsory methods in their economic planning.  Economic planning is not the prerogative of dictators; it is practised in most enlightened democracies.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Then it goes on:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;What does economic planning involve?  It involves an assessment of our economic objectives over a given period of time and the formulation of an economic programme calculated to achieve these objectives. In the light of the problems we have to solve, the minimum planning period should be ten years.  The overall general objective would be to ensure that, at the end of the ten year period, a sufficient increase will have taken place in production, exports and employment to sustain our population.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I was trying to establish the idea that a planned economy is the only way in which we will create full employment, and with full employment, develop to the utmost the economic resources of our whole people.  In that way, distributing goods to provide us with a high standard of living, we would achieve the objective&mdash;what should be the social objective&mdash;of any modern civilised democracy.  It must <Col N="1467" /> be quite clear, even to the dullest, that up to the present there is not solution in the methods we have used.  The Minister acknowledges that fact himself in his last Budget speech: &ldquo;The policies of the past, though successful in some directions, have not so far given us what we want.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The job of creating prosperity is, of course, a colossal one and I think, even with the best will in the world, private investors in Ireland, because of the limitations of capital, simply could not find the money on the scale needed to finance the industries and factories required, not alone to supply the home market&mdash;that is a simple thing&mdash;but to expand into the export market where we are competing against Germany, Britain, Japan, America, France, Belgium and other exporting countries whose factories are being turned over more and more to mechanised and automated methods. If we do not follow that example, we must carry on as we are, with the type of economy where we can offer our people only the emigrant ship and the street corner for the unemployed, with a low standard of living, without full educational facilities for our children, with five or six different standards in the health services, and paying our old people 25/- or 26/- a week to eke out their days in solitary misery.</P>
      <P>When we were faced with jobs of this scale before, we did not turn to private enterprise.  We did not ask private enterprise to start Aer Lingus, Bord na Móna, the E.S.B. or Irish Shipping.  The capital was not there and would not be there and, if it were there, these are probably particularly difficult undertakings, highly competitive and with probably too high a risk for private capital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was glad to see the Minister for Health listing in his speech at Manchester recently the achievements of these State Corporations and companies, achievements of a form of socialism for which the Fianna Fáil Government should get every credit. Industry is needed to process the agricultural wealth of our country.  Cattle are one of our best assets but a wasted <Col N="1468" /> asset in some respects.  The export of cattle on the hoof is a wasteful export. Cattle on the hoof helped more than anything else to balance the Minister's Budget last year; yet it is wasteful to export cattle on the hoof instead of exporting the cattle canned and making full use of the by-products. Processing dairy products, cattle, pigs and cereals is obviously something which must be taken up on a gigantic scale by the Government.</P>
    <P>One of the most unbelievable neglects of the last 35 years has been the fishing industry.  An unlimited store of wealth in food and fertilisers is left there to be harvested by any and every nation in the world except our own.  There is yet another relatively neglected field.  Even though we have made some progress in forestry I understand there is anything up to 1,000,000 acres of land which could be properly and usefully employed for the creation of large forests, the markets for the processed by-products of which are limitless.</P>
    <P>Our industrialists are facing the prospects of the Free Trade Area. They are also facing the prospect of a shrinking and saturated market here at home.  The workers are facing also the danger of working themselves out of a job if they increase production too much in a limited market.  We must find new outlets for our goods. Let us by all means keep the other traditional markets, such as Britain and America, but it is high time we tried to establish contact with the former colonial powers which are growing and expanding.  There are many other countries such as Africa, India, the countries of the Middle East and other countries where there would be considerable goodwill towards our products and a willingness to buy them if we could establish some marketing process and contact buyers in those countries.  We seem to be obsessed with the two markets of Britain and America, probably the two most highly competitive markets in the world.  We are still trying to sell to America while it is wallowing in its own personal recession and, understandably, not unduly concerned with our petty problems.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1469" /> It is an odd thing that 35 years after getting rid of one nation which occupied our country we should now be looking to the four corners of the world asking anybody and everybody to take the land at cheap rates, bribing them to train our technicians, allowing them to take profits out without taxation in the early years.  They can do as they please.  The Africans, the Egyptians, the Indians, the IndoChinese are all trying to get rid of foreigners and we are hawking our few wares around the countries of the world asking them to take over this tiny economy.</P>
    <P>Does it not strike people, when these outsiders are offered these wonderful conditions, these magnificent concessions to operate here, to ask themselves, if this is for the industrialist a land of milk and honey and easy profits, why do they not make these profits themselves?  Why will they not risk their own capital?  Many people have tried to raise capital.  Deputy Norton as Minister for Industry and Commerce went to America and there was great promise from that.  Deputy Briscoe did his junketing around the States, and now there is another man, Cyril Count McCormack, who is doing the same thing.  Surely we should have some dignity, a sense of national pride instead of going round the world asking the Canadians to mine our copper, selling Killarney to the Americans, offering Cobh shipyards, apparently, to the Dutch.  This should not happen in an island for which for seven centuries men were prepared to suffer and to give their lives in order that we should be free to organise the welfare and prosperity of our people in our own way.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear from this Budget that we need not look to the Government to create the kind of society for which most of us have hoped and for which many have worked very hard. Deputy Dr. Ryan, the Minister, said recently as reported at column 322, Volume 49 of the Seanad Debates of 27th March, 1958:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I have no objection to the Fianna Fáil Party being classed as a Tory Party except that I do object to being put into a more Tory <Col N="1470" /> category than the British Labour Party.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Let us pass over the silly sneer at the Labour Party and deal with the suggestion that the Minister is now a Tory.  I am afraid he is not a Tory. The British Tory to-day believes in the welfare State.  He believes that health services should be organised so that there are not two standards, one for the wealthy and one for the poor, but the same standard of health for everyone. The British Tory believes that every child should have an opportunity to develop his talents to the fullest in schools financed by the State, through scholarships financed by the State, in technical, vocational and secondary schools and in the universities.  The English Tory has also a very high standard in relation to what he seeks for the old people of his society in Britain.  They are not paid as much as they would like, but it seems to me that the old person has a much better chance, under the British Tory Government to-day, of living in reasonable&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It is difficult to find a name for it&mdash;pre-First World War or Baldwinian Toryism, possibly.  No, the Minister is not a Tory.  The Minister and his colleagues are not Tories, not in the modern sense of the word.  They are merely deserters, men who have deserted a great cause.  They are men who have betrayed a great cause, men who betrayed what, I believe, if I know anything about the policy of the Party, was the democratic programme, the radical progressive policy outlined in the democratic programme of the First Dail, 1919, which is one of the first and main objectives of the Minister's Party.</P>

I do not wish even to attempt to go into the dialectical by-paths into which the Deputy took us in his excursions, but I do think that, even though he said it was not his intention even to attack or defend Russia, he has, for the second time in this House, attacked Western Germany and attacked America for any difficulties they may be experiencing at this time.</P>
      <P>He did not, of course, advert to the fact that Berlin is manned by Communist troops trying to retain the population which are endeavouring to get out, and so many of whom have successfully escaped into Western Germany, and that part of West Germany's problem is created by the fact that she has under her care hundreds of thousands who have escaped from Socialist Eastern Germany.

We know, of course, that were it not for America, and all those nations with her, in what she is trying to do to save the world to-day, many millions would have starved in Europe, Asia and other places.

    </Speaker>
    <P>This debate is drawing to a close and I am sure that every possible description that could be conceived has been exhausted in trying to determine just how uninteresting, flat and hopeless the Minister's financial statement was this year.  We have had Deputies adverting to the absence of interest by the general public evidenced by the half-empty galleries in the House. Those of us who heard the manner in which the Minister read his statement were again confirmed in our opinions of the lack of enthusiasm by the Mini- <Col N="1473" /> ster's own Party when he sat down. On every occasion, once organised bodies and individuals have given thought and consideration to this Budget, that view has certainly been upheld&mdash;that there is nothing in it to give any encouragement, nothing in it to reveal the policy of the Government. That was not revealed on any Estimate by any individual Minister but many people thought it might have been set out lucidly in the Budget statement.</P>
    <P>I regret that, again, a Budget has been introduced that has not set out separately our capital programme as distinct from our current programme, and has not budgeted distinctly for it because there are too many people in the country to-day who decry the investment which successive Governments have had to undertake, in order to catch up with the backlog of underdevelopment which this young State has to cope with.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was speaking in reference to the capital programme initiated some ten years ago and for the implementation of which much money has had to be borrowed down through the years.  This requirement is of such magnitude and importance to the country that it is something on which there should be no difference of opinion across the floor of this House. If a Government seeks a loan to implement any of the items to be dealt with under that capital programme&mdash; rural electrification, telephone development, forestry or whatever it may be &mdash;it is incumbent on everybody in a position to influence public opinion to ensure the essentials needed to make it successful.  In that respect this Government have been left a legacy in the Prize Bonds of which they are availing and which is of considerable benefit in getting the necessary finance for such operations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is regrettable that there are some back benchers of the opposite Party, even some making maiden speeches, who, failing any other argument, advert to the fact that on some occasion in the distant past some national <Col N="1474" /> loan was not successful.  What were the results which flowed from such allegations in the past?  It was plastered all over the city on the instigation of the present Tánaiste.  It took many long months before the effects of that died off.  It was followed in later years, whenever the occasion arose, by some reflection again on something that happened which did not bring about the desired end, in relation to ensuring capital for our capital programme.</P>
    <P>We can recall the instance when the British bank rate was increased and its effects here in the middle of the floatation of a loan.  Let us hope that was a coincidence which will never happen again to affect Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or any other Government here.  The day is long past when such matters should be made the subject of political debate, efforts to throw aspersions on another Party because they did not meet with success in a particular sphere.</P>
    <P>If a Minister for Finance succeeds in keeping the rate of interest as low as he possibly can, he is surely doing that, not for his own political advantage but in an effort to ensure that the economy of the country can in the years to come meet the charges on such a flotation. We know that so much was said in 1952 by the Party now in office in relation to this subject that a great opportunity of floating a loan had to be let pass.  Deputy Cunningham smiles, but Deputy Cunningham was one of the defaulters in this respect when contributing to the Budget debate.  I can recall that a whole year went by, but the Minister for Finance who came in at that time could not even attempt to float a loan and, when he did, it was at an excessive rate of interest.</P>
    <P>On the last occasion on which a successful loan was floated here, it represented purchased confidence at 6 per cent.  That is no indication of what was intended by the political leaders across the floor.  It was claimed it was successful only because there was now a new Government.  They are not alone in putting forward that belief.  There are times when it is difficult not to agree with certain statements made, no <Col N="1475" /> matter how one might disagree with the opinions of the person making the statement, but it is certainly galling when one reads a statement by Mr. J. C. V. Brittain who is very strongly of the opinion that the Government now in office are doing great things and that the sole contribution to that confidence was the change of Government.  That statement was recently published and circulated to the motor traders all over the country.  He said he was looking at it from the national point of view. This is a gentleman who comes to Dublin to make his money; but he will not live in the State; he lives in Belfast.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>His activities are his own business but his public statements are everybody's business.  Of course, he happens to be one of the individuals who received very welcome news shortly after the election of this Government.  There were other sections of the community who did not receive any good news.  They are still waiting for it.</P>
      <P>I wonder, with the reaction in the first few months of this year of a disimprovement in our balance of payments, whether it was wise to remove some of the restrictions which were removed, particularly in relation to hire-purchase? We are glad that the outcome of last year should have been as good as it was, particularly because it bears out what we have ever held: that the agricultural community were capable, given sufficient encouragement and assistance, of making such a contribution to our economy.  Of course, we can remember when a more audacious Minister for Finance wrote into a Budget statement in 1952 that there was little to be expected from the agricultural community in this respect.  He also included a reference to the fact that in his opinion &ldquo;taxation lay lightly on the land&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Its contribution last year, resulting in a higher level of our export trade, made it possible for the situation we had to face in 1956 to be overcome; <Col N="1476" /> but, as I say, there is now apparent a disimprovement, not of great proportions, but nevertheless surely a situation that the Government in office must watch.  Should it deteriorate very much, have they anything in this Budget which they could use to correct such a situation were it to arise again? If there were alternative weapons, surely the Party now in office should have suggested those alternatives, when they were in Opposition, at the time of the institution of the import levies.  At that time, it was said: &ldquo;You are not dividing in the House in relation to these measures; can we take it, therefore, we have your agreement that it is the only weapon we can use?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Indeed, it was the firm, stated intention of the inter-Party Government, repeated time and time again by the then Minister for Finance, that those levies were imposed to do a particular job, and then when the job was done, they would be removed.  The Minister last year, when replying to the Budget debate at that time, said there was an effort being made &ldquo;to drive him into the depths&rdquo;, to use money that accrued from those levies for a period of 12 months only as an alternative to taking away the food subsidies.  If we are to accept his own words then, he has voluntarily descended into the depths, in bringing into his current revenue and fixing as permanent customs duties the duties imposed to do a particular job.</P>
    <P>In ordinary circumstances, when a customs duty is mooted, there is an examination of the reasons for its imposition, the effect it will have on different sectors of the community, and a good case must be established&mdash; whether it is that there would be disemployment of persons, if the duty were not imposed, or whether it is that the purpose is the launching of a new industry.  All these factors must be taken into account carefully before action is taken.  Here we have an operation which was not intended for that purpose.  This was an operation undertaken merely to present to this House something that would approach the balanced Budget that some <Col N="1477" /> Deputies opposite last year honestly believed the Minister would accomplish in those 12 months.</P>
    <P>What do we find?  Has it been balanced?  I remember Deputy Haughey and Deputy Booth being particularly strong in defending the unpopular and harsh Budget of 1957, on the basis that it would succeed in &ldquo;balancing the Budget&rdquo;.  Yet we find £5,000,000 odd of a deficit.  What more can be done now to balance it?  Can we say there is an indication in the terms of this Budget?  In last year's Budget, the Minister had one success, inasmuch as that, for some weeks following its publication, he was lauded by so many people for his intention to reduce the number of civil servants. The only reduction, he can claim is a paper reduction, the transfer of certain civil servants to a new body, which no longer brings them into a category which is furnished in this House. There has been a very poor show in that respect.</P>
    <P>In the Budget statement, the Minister also said that Supplementary Estimates would not pass a particular figure; but during the year he had repeatedly to bring in Supplementary Estimates for millions of pounds. Consequently, if the Minister says in this Budget statement that he will keep a brake on certain expenditure, can we accept it?  We can all recall that, on the hustings during the last general election, charges were made that the administration of the inter-Party Government had been profligate and that a new Government was needed to clean up and wipe away so much unnecessary expenditure and to reduce all this unnecessary extravagance, and that, of course, the natural thing to expect from that would be reduced taxation, lower income-tax, perhaps, and lower taxation on the simple luxuries.</P>
    <P>It was very attractive, but there was a particular attraction in it for the people who were concerned with the growth of national expenditure.  They believed that something dramatic would be secured by a strong Government and they were in the forefront of those who gave vocal as well as <Col N="1478" /> individual support to that Party in seeking election.  Can we say now that the promises have been fulfilled?  In what respects have the Government succeeded in economising?  The extraordinary part of it is that the economies had the effect, in almost every instance, of disemployment.</P>
    <P>Let us take the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  I remarked to a farmer in my constituency that this was a withdrawal of £250,000 for the drainage of land, that it was a good scheme, that it did not carry much administrative expenses such as are entailed usually in administering such schemes. What has happened?  This man told me he thought any saving was a good saving.  I asked him if he honestly believed it was a good saving.  Had not the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare to come in here with a Supplementary Estimate? We can take it that the men employed under the Local Authorities (Works) Act were not of the age that permitted them to go abroad seeking work.  A man receiving £5 a week now that job is receiving £3 1s. a week now on the dole.  Is that the kind of saving that is conducive to better times for these unfortunate people?</P>
    <P>There is a reduction in the Estimate for Forestry; there is a reduction in the Estimate for School Buildings. Whatever economies are necessary, surely those are expenditures worth while, which, in our present circumstances, should not be touched? Deputy Dr. Browne, in the only compliment he had to pay to the Party in office, said they were responsible for a magnificent burst of industrial activity between 1932 and 1938.  He did not advert at all to the fact that it was in those years that the agricultural industry was thrown into a shambles, and that 70,000 people left the land, left for the cities and towns or left on the emigrant ship.  There was no magnificent burst in agriculture. To-day, to a great extent, we are still experiencing the repercussions of that agricultrual policy.</P>

      <P>I know the Deputy's Ministers will be very quick to make the case which the Minister for Lands has made, in this month's issue of <i>Development.</i>  I suggest that the Deputy should read it.  He will find it quite interesting, as in it the Minister draws solace from the fact that Scotland has as high an emigration figure as Ireland.  There is no doubt that these excuses will be forthcoming very frequently in the months ahead.  During the past year, contingencies arose which I do not think will arise this year.  No doubt, the Minister for Finance has been saved a little embarrassment in any charge there was on the Exchequer last year in the export of bacon.  His colleague, the Minister for Agriculture&mdash;who, incidentally, was complimented by Deputy Wycherley for doing so&mdash;by his action in reducing Grade A bacon by 5/- a cwt., is responsible for the fact that the bacon factories availed of that situation to reduce the price of Grade A bacon.  That, again, was responsible for the wholesale sale and slaughter of young sows, and it is responsible now for the fact that we have a scarcity price, and it will be responsible in the year ahead for the fact that the Minister will not be able to look to the export of bacon to contribute very much to the high export figures which he said he would like to have.</P>
      <P>The Tánaiste spoke in a very petulant mood.  In addition to his character assassination of Deputy McGilligan, he made some extraordinary claims. Among them was the claim that it was the measures taken last year which arrested a decline and turned it into progress.  Of course, it is realised the Government cannot possibly claim by the wildest stretch of the imagination that they had any hand, act or part in providing the magnificent exports of live stock responsible for correcting the country's difficulties last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance was asked to be courageous in relation to taxation and to the administration of the Government through the budgetary provisions which have to be made every year in that respect.  We might suggest to him that he should take pattern from the calculated risk which Deputy McGilligan, a predecessor of <Col N="1480" /> his, took in 1948.  The Minister for Finance at that time introduced a Supplementary Budget which was designed to bring in an income of some £6,000,000.  Yet a new Government remitted those taxes and still we cannot say that revenue suffered alarmingly.</P>
    <P>It has now been said by the Taoiseach that we have reached the point of diminishing returns and this possibly is the only reason why we have not a direct increase&mdash;an increase which the individual would recognise in this Budget.  Of course, we have the increased taxation which arises out of the absorption of the import levies. It is rather difficult for the individual consumer to determine just when, and how often, that will hit him.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health, a former Minister for Finance, who is the star turn in histrionics and can actually put a face on anything, has to go one better than the Tánaiste who in turn had gone one better than the Minister for Finance, in describing this Budget as a good, honest, courageous and creative one.  Is it unfair to ask what does it create if it is a creative Budget?</P>

      <P>This Minister, like the Minister for Agriculture, has nothing to offer in relation to present day problems other than to hark back to the good old days.  He is glad to avail of any opportunity presented to him to try to whitewash himself for failures in the past despite the fact that we are faced with all the problems with which we are faced to-day.  The Government appear to be complacent. In to-day's <i>Irish Press</i> there is a report of a meeting of the Kerry County Council who are faced with the problem possibly of reducing the amounts of home assistance for recipients in that county because of the increase in the number of people becoming eligible. At the annual estimates meeting they voted a certain amount of money to cover home assistance for the 12 month period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The councillors in Kerry are faced with the problem of getting additional money, which they seemingly find difficult, for the purpose or of reducing <Col N="1481" /> home assistance in that county.  Are circumstances such as those to be regarded as indicative of the good times the Minister for Health would have us believe are with us or that the corner has been turned?  Surely the fact that there are 24,000 fewer in employment over 12 months should have been enough.  The unemployment figures are better.  They are, while there is emigration to provide the solution for the problem of unemployment. The numbers engaged in agriculture and industry dropped by 24,000.  Those are the figures supplied by the Taoiseach's own office and they cannot be contested.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health harked back to the good old days prior to 1948 when we had 2 ozs. of butter per person and a standstill Order on wages for the workers.  These were the good old days.  These were the days when the present Minister for Finance, as Minister for Social Welfare&mdash;the old age pension was 10/- per week&mdash;said that the country could not afford 2/6 more. They could not afford it.</P>

At any rate, the circumstances were such in 1947 that the present Minister for Finance stated the country could not afford the £250,000 that would have paid that 2/6.  That is what they were asked in order to make it 12/- per week.</P>

      <P>No.  The Minister for Health said they handed over a country which was sound in every way. Our total exports in that year were £39,000,000.  With the standard of living that the £39,000,000 could buy, the country was set fair in every way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to Avoca and the mines there but he did not say that the development which his Government was carrying out at that time was carried out on land to which they had no claim or right until the matter was rectified by the inter-Party Government. He went to town on the deficit in our balance of payments in 1951.  Of course, he did not advert to the fact that the then Taoiseach had called in the editors of the four daily newspapers and explained to them why he was doing it.  There was no criticism at that time of the need for <Col N="1483" /> imports.  It was the time of the Korean war and the situation which developed out of that.  The Minister for Health had to come in to dress up something and present it to the House with the customary histrionics.</P>
    <P>Can we say there is relief in this Budget for the many classes in the community that have during the course of the past 15 months been dealt with very harshly by the present administration? At the present time traders in the small towns and villages are going through a very lean period and some Minister for Finance will have to take action to protect those people who have to pay rates, educate their families and live like everybody else against the type of competition presented by the travelling shops.  That is something to which the Minister could have given some attention and possibly could have eased the impact of taxation on that class of people. The other class pay no rates and do not have to meet the outgoings that the small traders in towns and villages have to meet.</P>
    <P>During the year the most outstanding result of the change of Government was the abolition of the food subsidies resulting in what we feared would occur, an increase in general production costs adding to the difficulties already there in meeting the competition of other, better developed countries in foreign markets.  The level of costs increased and on top of that came the resulting round of wage increases.  The 10/- agreed upon by the Provisional United Trade Union Organisation with the private industrial employers was a good step and there is no doubt that those on the workers' side, who agreed to that, had in mind that anything like a higher demand could mean unemployment for very many then employed.  That was a big factor in getting them to agree to a figure less than would normally be warranted by the increase in the cost of living occasioned by the removal of the food subsidies.</P>
    <P>It was easy for many industrialists to agree to the 10/-.  One to whom I spoke said he agreed with it but could not stand the impact of it and had to <Col N="1484" /> dismiss six men so that he could meet his outgoings in respect of his other employees.  Consequently, we can claim, that when the trade union organisations were prepared to make the sacrifices which they made, some disemployment arose out of the increase in costs which many small firms had to meet following the withdrawal of the food subsidies.</P>
    <P>There were other industralists in a position to make somebody else pay the 10/- and they did not have to dismiss anybody because they could add a little to the cost of the goods they were handling and make the general public pay for it.  That occurred previously and it is occurring now.  We had strong pronouncements made by members of this Government that before acceding to the demands of State employees they would make us march into the lobbies on the question. The Dublin dustmen brought them to their knees.  When the Government had met the just claim of the civil servants, the teachers, the Garda and the Army, we find that in every Estimate that this House has dealt with, or has yet to deal with, there is some charge arising out of that supposed saving of £9,000,000 last year. It was no bargain; it is continuing to make difficulties and the Minister for Finance has to cope with that difficulty now in administering our finances.  We saw the impact of the partial reduction of food subsidies in 1952 and we knew that their complete abolition could not but do what it is now doing, which is so unfortunate. But let us not think that everybody has been compensated for the withdrawal of the food subsidies. The 1/- given to the old age pensioners is an absolute joke as far as cushioning them against the increased prices of flour and bread and butter is concerned. What have the farmers got, the people who answered the call to produce more, the people who resolved the country's difficulties over the last two or three years?  They are getting less for their wheat, less for milk, less for barley.  Their trouble, in fact, is that they do not know what they will get, particularly for wheat and to some extent for milk.  In the circumstances in which these people in Munster have to face the capital charges involved in <Col N="1485" /> the elimination of bovine tuberculosis, I ask, was it just that this Government, after its financial enactments during the year, should reduce the price of milk which was to contribute in some way towards the extraordinary capital cost dairy farmers would have to bear all at one time?</P>
    <P>I am not going into the political side of it; I am not discussing the promises made in the North Kerry and East Limerick by-elections in regard to the price of milk, but it was a red hot topic in these areas.  It was indicated that there would be no limit to what a strong Fianna Fáil Government could do for the dairy farmers.  Now,because of that Government, they are getting 1¼d., or in some creameries 1½d. per gallon less than when the inter-Party Government was in power. Where is the compensation to the small farmers, their wives and families who have to meet additional charges for bread and butter and all these items they must consume, for which we are compensating other classes?</P>
    <P>Is it just that they should be singled out to have their income slashed at a time when we are giving compensation to the better organised sections of the community?  That was the outstanding consequence of last year's Budget, the Budget which we warned the people at election time would be introduced if Fianna Fáil were re-elected.  The people, of course, took the word of the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste that if they returned to power such things would not happen.  The present Government is in office and is as strong as it is because of that assurance.  The people fell for the propaganda and are now suffering.  No doubt, if they had the faintest idea that charges would be levied upon them in respect of necessities and that they would have to face additional taxation and at the same time endure the cuts they have received, they would think twice before doing what they did some 15 months ago.</P>
    <P>The Government cannot possibly continue to regard the present conditions complacently.  They must realise that they assured the people they would &ldquo;get cracking&rdquo;.  They assured so many women that they would get their <Col N="1486" /> husbands work; they assured so many farmers they would receive higher prices for their produce.  Instead, any economies resulting have been effected at the expense of that section of the community and of some of the workers. Surely in view of the circumstances now obtaining the people must seek a positive line of policy from the Government.  Such a policy has not been indicated, or evidenced in the enactments of the Government since they came into office.</P>
    <P>Last year we had a paucity of legislation and this House never met for fewer days in any year, I think, since the State was established.  Yet, listening to Fianna Fáil speakers on the platforms one would imagine that, when they got into office, a variety of Bills would be introduced and implemented to bring to many people better conditions in the future.  Even in administration, far from getting a reduction in taxation, far from an improvement in the lot of our people, there is nothing in this drab Budget which would in any way indicate either to those employed or to the boys or girls leaving school that while this Government is in office it is capable of producing a policy to improve the standard of living of the people, the policy promised in their speeches before the last election.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought I would hear some original contribution to this debate from the Opposition during the last few days, but not one constructive speech was made by a member of any of the Parties on the other side of the House.  We heard hackneyed speeches to the tune of &ldquo;anything you can do, we can do better,&rdquo; but there was nothing in them that was constructive or helpful to the nation.  People are sick of listening to this kind of tripe, night, noon and morning.  The last speaker, and some of his colleagues, had an opportunity of doing the things they now say we should do after a short time in office.  The people made no mistake in putting us here and we did not make any false promises to the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people saw last year that the nation was on the verge of economic ruin because of the mishandling of its <Col N="1487" /> affairs by the inter-Party Government. The Opposition are now trying to cover up their tracks.  They are trying to tell us now that they did this, that and the other.  I heard Deputy Blowick tell the House that there was full employment during his period in office.  One knows that these statements are completely false.  We can look back with pride on our record as a Party.  We can point to the things we did to improve our economic position.  We can point to the way in which we built up this nation to make it as self-supporting as possible.  We can point to the employment we provided in implementing that policy.  We can point to the protection we afforded all classes of industry and agriculture.</P>
    <P>From the farmers' point of view and from the industrialists' point of view, Fianna Fáil gave adequate protection, as far as the home market is concerned. Everything that could be done to help production was done.  We extended rural electrification so that there would be electrical current in every part of the country, thereby creating employment.  We set up Bord na Móna to provide employment and to give our people an opportunity of consuming their native fuel.  We built power stations which are now operating on Bord na Móna turf.  These are worthy contributions to the nation's economy, contributions of which we can be proud.  We have done everything possible to keep our people in employment.</P>
    <P>In relation to industry, we guaranteed to every individual who set up a factory here a protected market for his goods.  We introduced legislation to give loans and grants to help establish factories here.  We helped the farmers in every way.  We even subsidised them in regard to the labour they employed by means of a substantial relief in rates.  We established the Tourist Board, that board so much decried here, but which nevertheless is responsible for correcting our balance of payments position to the tune of almost £35,000,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>We succeeded in creating employment in all our years in office, even in the face of adversity. We succeeded in making the country as self-supporting as possible.  We set up Aer Lingus and Aer Linte.  It was we who introduced arterial drainage, rural improvements, land reclamation, the reconstruction of farm buildings, and various loans and schemes, with one object in view, namely, to improve the national economy.  It was we who introduced legislation for the improvement of harbours, the extension of afforestation, the improvement of public buildings, libraries, dispensaries, health clinics.  All these things were done under our administration.  We gave grants for the improvement of hotels to induce tourists to visit this country.  Then, we are asked: What have we done for the unemployed? What have we done for the farmer? What have we done for the industrialist?</P>
      <P>Admittedly, we have now reached saturation point as far as the home market is concerned in relation to certain products.  Indeed, I was hoping that we would have some contribution from the Opposition in that regard.  I thought we would be told that times change and one must change everywhere, and they are changing here.  We have done everything we can. We will continue to do all we can.  We shall have to try to get an export market for our surplus products.</P>
      <P>Recently, I read in the paper a speech by the Secretary to the British Board of Trade.  He was dealing with the position of the breweries.  In export trade alone, the breweries in Britain are worth about £28,000,000. Exports of Scotch whisky totalled 6,500,000 cases.  I would appeal to our brewers here to get together for the purpose of creating a blend of whiskey suitable to the American and European palate.  We have first-class barley. Surely if the Scottish brewers can export 6,500,000 cases of Scotch whisky, we ought to be able to enter that export market with our particular product.  That would create employment for our own people.  It would also help to correct the balance of payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1489" /> I appeal to our nationals abroad to do their utmost to push Irish products abroad.  They should ask for Irish products wherever they may happen to be, England, Scotland, the United States of America or in any continental country in which they find themselves.  If an appeal were made to our kith and kin abroad to help to push our exports abroad, that appeal. I am sure, would not fall on deaf ears. The individual in every area can do a great deal towards securing the sale of some Irish product in his district.  I have heard people return to this country and insist on obtaining Irish-made products when making their purchases. That is good propaganda and it will help us.  We in Fianna Fáil are determined, as far as possible, to get into the export trade.  We have tried every avenue to sell our products and we shall continue to do that.</P>
    <P>I shall deal with this point possibly on the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture, but I should just like to glide over it now.  At the moment we have an exportable vegetable trade. Last year, we exported a good deal of vegetables, especially from County Dublin.  I am associated with a few men who have been exporting vegetables at a disadvantage and that disadvantage is due solely to the fact that the cross-Channel shipping freight rates are so high.  However, that matter is being inquired into at the moment and I shall not dwell on it now.</P>
    <P>Our cattle trade has again succeeded in helping us a good deal and I hope it will continue to do so.  We had an export market for Irish tweeds and we are hoping that the United States will again grant permission for the import of Irish tweeds.  Córas Tráchtála has been doing a good job.  While our ambassadors abroad have been criticised very severely in this House for travelling in the United States, my feeling is that any delegate who leaves this country, speaks about Irish products and tries to influence people to come here either as tourists or with a view to investing money in Irish enterprise is doing a good job for the country.  If the work does not bear fruit to-day, I believe that in a short <Col N="1490" /> period such work will be to our advantage. Therefore, in speaking about Ireland and getting people to think about Ireland, either from the point of view of spending holidays here or as a business proposition, our delegates are doing excellent work.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil has over the years introduced many beneficial schemes. I could spend the next two hours on that subject alone but I shall not delay the House.  I might mention, in passing, that, in addition to the Agricultural Credit Corporation we introduced the Industrial Credit Corporation. We must not forget the many social schemes which we also introduced.</P>
    <P>Deputies from the Opposition Benches spoke about loans, grants, reconstruction grants, reclamation grants, and so on.  These were not all paid.  I had a number of applications in County Dublin from people who started work in good faith and who then found there was no money to meet it.  Yesterday, Deputy Sweetman said there was plenty of money to meet that work. I can tell him that in County Dublin 300 people were told they would get housing loans and then were left high and dry.  Nobody gave two hoots about them.  When Fianna Fáil returned to office we honoured these grants and anybody who wanted them got them.</P>
    <P>Surely nobody on the Opposition Benches can deny that the Coalition Government left this country in a muddle? Surely no Opposition Deputy can deny that this Budget inspires confidence?  It will inspire people to invest money in the nation.  After only one year in office, this Budget shows what a capable Minister for Finance Deputy Dr. Ryan is.  It proves the capable way he has administered the affairs of the Department of Finance, supported by an able Government.  I am sure the nation is very grateful to the Minister for the manner in which he has fulfilled a tough job in the short period of one year.  I hope he will live long enough to help us out of the remainder of our difficulties.</P>
    <P>During 1956, I had more questions down for answer in this House in relation to the way we were being treated by the Coalition Government as regards <Col N="1491" /> loans, grants and so on, than I care to remember.  However, I shall not delay the House further than to say that we in Fianna Fáil are doing our best about the unemployment problem.  It must be tackled in a practical way and a very important point in that regard concerns our getting into the export market.  We want everybody to help us to realise that aim.  There is no use in saying that an economic crisis or an economic slump can be short-circuited.  It there were any short-cut, it would have been taken long ago.</P>
    <Speaker pid="StephenDBarret" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>However grateful the nation may be to the Minister, if we are to believe Deputy Burke, it struck me immediately after the Minister for Finance sat down, having introduced his Budget, that the Fianna Fáil Party itself was not over-grateful.  However inspired the Budget may be, certainly the Fianna Fáil Deputies sitting behind the Minister for Finance did not appear to be inspired.  Only when they were whipped up by Deputy Haughey did they suddenly remember that it was the formal thing to clap the Minister after making his Budget statement.</P>
      <P>The Budget has been described as &ldquo;unimaginative&rdquo;.  That is the least that can be said about it.  Deputy Burke mentioned that if he were to read out all the benefits which accrued from Fianna Fáil administration he would keep the House until a quarter to nine: he had already spent some 20 minutes reading out the benefits which had flowed from various Fianna Fáil administrations.  Speeches and attitudes of that sort are drawing politicians of all Parties into disrepute in this country.  The sooner we reach a stage at which men on both sides of the House can pay tribute to what has been done by people on either side of the House, the sooner we shall bring the Irish politician back into public respect.  The necessity for that was underlined here a short time ago when I listened to one of the most misleading and mischievous speeches I have ever heard in this House or outside it by Deputy Dr. Browne.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Browne suggested that, <Col N="1492" /> with the possible exception of a period between 1932 and 1938, I think, no Government since 1922 was capable of governing this country.  He said that nothing good had come of the experiment of Irish government.  He told us there was widespread national despair, leading the people to believe that there was little or no hope of our democratically-elected leaders giving social justice to the people.  I do not know what alternative there is to democratically-elected leaders.  I feel that if Deputy Dr. Browne had been honest in stating his convictions to this House he would quickly have told us of his alternative.  As he spoke, I tried to find the moral of his speech.  Towards the end of his speech it appeared that the moral was: Away with private enterprise, away with democratic government and an underlining of the moral which he wanted to get home that in all the free countries of Western Europe there was something rotten in the State.</P>
    <P>At a time like this, when there is undoubtedly and admittedly pessimism abroad, it is the duty of all public men sometimes to show the brighter side of things.  Deputy Dr. Browne, from the moment he stood up to the moment that he sat down, vilified everything that has been done by every Irishman who tried to serve his country since we won freedom.  The words he used were that we were here in demoralisation, degradation and near bankruptcy, that the villages and country towns were denuded, that there was a headlong flight from the country by young boys and girls, the vast majority of them ill-equipped.  What about those staying at home?  Those staying at home suffer demoralisation and degradation at street corners in a capitalist economic system.  He said that if we carry on as we were going, we must ultimately cease to exist&mdash;the reason being that we had a democratically elected Government in this country and that we followed the Western way of life.</P>
    <P>The realisation that we have in this House Deputies of that type elected by the votes of the people should encourage us to do our best to point out, sometimes at least, some of the benefits <Col N="1493" /> which have flowed from native government. I say that because Deputy Dr. Browne is not alone in what he says. People in other high places in this country are going around the country preaching gloom and depression.  It infuriates me sometimes to see men in responsible positions doing so.  It still more infuriates me when I see men in public life, for purely political ends, misrepresenting the situation in this country at the moment.</P>
    <P>I know there is unemployment.  I know there is emigration.  Everybody knows it.  But anybody in this House who underlines the fact that there is emigration and unemployment is not doing a service to the country.  If some organisation had been set up to encourage unemployment and emigration it could not have done more than public men of this country who, day after day and year after year, use emigration and unemployment as weapons with which to beat the man on the other side.  If you happen to be in Government you say emigration and unemployment are due to the misdeeds and mistakes of the Government that preceded you.  If you happen to be in opposition you say emigration and unemployment are directly related to the misgovernment of the Party then in office.</P>
    <P>There is necessary in this country a more generous spirit among public men, a more generous spirit among politicians.  I instance a speech made by the Leader of the Party to which I have the honour to belong, Deputy Costello, in Cork, the Saturday night before the Budget.  He made it&mdash;I was sitting next to him&mdash;to a Fine Gael gathering.  In that speech he invited the Irish people to have confidence in the Irish nation, to have confidence in the Irish Government and admitted freely that many of the things that Fianna Fáil did had resulted in benefits to the Irish people.  I would ask for a similar spirit from people on the other side of the House because, the following Saturday night, we had in Cork the Minister for Health, who told the people of Cork and the Irish people that the Government which had preceded the present Government were the men who almost brought the nation <Col N="1494" /> to disaster and then abandoned the ship in February, 1957.  He complained that Deputy Costello and the leaders of the Party to which I have the honour to belong were claiming credit for what the Government had done.</P>
    <P>In my submission, Deputy Costello and the Ministers who formed the inter-Party Government have a right to claim credit for many of the benefits which we now enjoy and any fair-minded Deputy on the other side of the House will admit that many of the benefits which we now enjoy are due to the activities of the inter-Party Government during the most difficult time in the history of this State since it won self-government.  At the time of the Suez crisis and on other occasions the inter-Party Government took the strong stand which got us through very difficult times.</P>
    <P>I do feel it necessary at a time like this that we should count our blessings as well as underline our misfortunes. We should look back and see what we have done since we won self-government and what we are still doing and get away from the dismal picture painted by Deputy Dr. Browne of a crumbling social structure from which all the Deputies and leaders of all political Parties lean out, waving to the unfortunate people, saying, &ldquo;I am all right.  Damn you, Jack,&rdquo;&mdash;which were the words used by Deputy Dr. Browne&mdash;the only person leaning over the ramparts in a sympathetic way being Deputy Dr. Browne who leans over weeping for the Irish people because they are subjected to native democratic Government.</P>
    <P>Let us remember that since we did win self-government we have started things such as the E.S.B., the sugar beet factories; we have built tens of thousands of houses to replace the hovels in which people were living; we have replaced hundreds, if not thousands, of schools which were crumbling away; we have built thousands of miles of roads.  I do not always agree with our roads policy but at least we have built roads and they are an asset.  We have our own shipping lines.  We have land reclamation. Near my constituency we now have an oil refinery.  There has been <Col N="1495" /> mineral development and various other things.  All these things are the result of native government.  They are something of which we should be proud, of which we should be glad to speak on occasions such as this, instead of harking back to unemployment and blaming the inter-Party Government of 1957 or the Fianna Fáil Government's policy of 1958 for it.</P>
    <P>I was glad that Deputy Costello stood up here and expressed his happiness that, at a time like this, when there was pessimism, he was able to testify to the fact that there were indications of buoyancy in our revenue, that there was a surplus balance on our external account last year, that the deposits in the commercial banks have increased, that there is a gratifying increase in the total savings of our people, that there is an increase in agricultural exports and a larger acreage under crops, and that there is an increased output in industrial undertakings.  Why cannot people tell the country all these things?</P>
    <P>Although Deputy Costello is the Leader of the Opposition, speaking to a Budget which was unimaginative and which did not give much incentive or did not induce courage when incentive and courage are needed, he was generous enough, strong enough and honest enough to indicate that there is hope for the country, that all this moaning and groaning by people in high places and low places are unnecessary and that if men in this House and men in high positions outside the House would only change their tune and sometimes encourage the people to feel that there is a living for young men and women in this country, we would do quite a deal to end emigration and unemployment.</P>
    <P>We always hear about the people who go away.  Within 100 yards of this House there is a young lady who came back recently from America and took up a position here and was glad to get it.  Only yesterday, in my constituency, I was talking to a young Irish engineer who was in America for the last ten years and who has come home to settle down with his family in Ireland to give <Col N="1496" /> them an Irish education.  It is seldom that we hear of people who come back but there are plenty of them.  If, at a time like this, we could sometimes encourage the people to feel that all hope is not lost and if the nation holds its head high, with chin up, we shall assuredly get through the difficulties which now face us.</P>

      <P>In intervening in this debate on the Budget I should like first of all to refer to one of the closing sentences of Deputy Burke, a sentence in which he complimented the Minister for Finance on a wonderful year.  He hoped he would be Minister for Finance for a long number of years to come, in order that succeeding years would be equally wonderful.  Deputy Burke is a very responsible and very respected Deputy, but one wonders for whom he was speaking when he said we had a wonderful year.  One wonders was it for the 50,000 people who emigrated during the past 12 months, following the coming again into office of a Government, not a new Government, not a naive Government, but a Government whose members had wide knowledge and experience of the problems of government. The members of that Government had succeeded in convincing the people at large that they had the answer to all economic problems.</P>

      <P>Was Deputy Burke referring to the existing very large-scale unemployment?  In recent weeks, speakers from the Government Benches have referred to the reduction in unemployment figures, a reduction of several thousands.  I remember the day when that phrase was used in this House: &ldquo;Several thousands.&rdquo; At that time, it referred to a reduction on the live register of 4,500 out of a total figure of over 70,000.  The ordinary citizens are entitled to be a little loose in their type of description when they talk in numbers and figures, but it is a little too much to permit an alleged responsible spokesman of the Fianna Fáil Party to indicate, without question, that everything was now lovely <Col N="1497" /> in the garden because unemployment had been reduced by several thousand.</P>
      <P>Of course, even then it was not indicated quite clearly, in the House or outside the House, whether this slight change represented not just a reduction in the number of people on the live register but also an increase in those in employment.  I am afraid that at the time the statement was made we had the peculiar situation that there was a reduction in unemployment and, at the same time, a reduction in those employed.</P>
      <P>I do not think any Deputy indicated at any time that when the Budget was brought in last year, he expected that the situation would be changed completely overnight, that the unemployment figure would be reduced magically, or that there would be 10,000 or 20,000 new jobs created every year. Viewing the matter in retrospect, it appears to me the Minister for Finance has done very little during the past 12 months, because there does not appear to have been any definite or clear gain resulting from definite efforts on the part of the Government as Government.</P>
      <P>It is agreed there has been a change in the balance of payments.  There has been substantially increased income from the sale of agricultural products, particularly cattle, but I do not think anyone on the Government side will have the hardihood to claim that the increased sale of cattle, which has effected the balance of payments question so much, resulted from the entering again into office of a Fianna Fáil Government, and from some action taken by that Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year, in the course of the debate on the Budget, I had occasion to refer to a deputation which had been received by a number of Dublin Deputies, including the Minister for Justice.  The deputation was representative of a group that is referred to in the Health Act as the lower income group.  It was composed of working-class women whose husbands and sons were unemployed, whose husbands and sons were in receipt of low wage rates and who were, as part of their normal day-to-day life, facing serious economic difficulties.  They came in protest <Col N="1498" /> against the action being taken by the Government at that time in the removing of the subsidies on foodstuffs.</P>
    <P>The women were asked, and the matter was referred to later on in the course of my participation in the debate, whether they would not be happy if their husbands and sons were working and if their problems would not be so much easier.  It was indicated to them that this question of unemployment would be the major task that would be faced up to by the Government. Those women, even at that time and since that time, facing the increased economic hardships resulting from dearer basic foods, indicated in cases where the husbands or sons were unemployed, that naturally their situation would be easier if the men were working and there were a week's wages coming into the house.  I should like to ask the Minister to specify clearly and without equivocation how many such men have been put to work by the Fianna Fáil Government in the past 12 months.</P>
    <P>It is fashionable from year to year and according as the Government changes over from that side to this side, to adopt this attitude: &ldquo;We, as the Government, have no responsibility for providing work for the Irish people. We are elected here to sit and twiddle our thumbs and hope that some private enterprise will come along and do the job.&rdquo; That is the usual attitude by whatever major Party happens to be in Government, but it is very often the exact opposite when they are in opposition.</P>
    <P>In the case of Fianna Fáil, they convinced the people of Ireland that they had the solution.  Now, the Minister for Finance, in his second Budget is going to the country and saying: &ldquo;You should all be happy.  You should all be hopeful.  You should have no problems because I have not imposed any new taxes.&rdquo; There is, of course, a certain amount of relief among those who anticipated that there might be some increase in taxes.  Having listened to radio pronouncements, having read the speeches of various Ministers in the weeks and months immediately preceding the Budget in <Col N="1499" /> which indications were given that the situation was very difficult, a very large percentage of our population felt that there would be some increase in taxation. Consequently, those of our citizens who had anticipated such an increase were relieved to a certain extent.</P>
    <P>What of those social insurance classes who had expected that, following upon the penal action of the Fianna Fáil Government 12 months ago, which the Government have stated was in the interests of the national economy, and that if, in the event, the situation proved to be somewhat easier this year, they at least would derive some benefit from this Budget?  However, they are still required to continue an uneconomic existence, worsened as a result of the withdrawal of the food subsidies and the increase in the cost of living, and there is no provision made by the Minister to afford to these sections any relief from their present hardship.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his Budget statement indicated also that capital expenditure would be at about the same level as last year.  That is a wonderfully cheering statement.  The Minister and the Government should be proud of it.  Nobody will attempt to deny that the Government were put into the position of governing this country because the people believed that they could deal with the problems in an active manner.  We are told in this Budget that capital expenditure will remain at the same level, that there will be no attempt to utilise State capital in order to inject some life into our economy and to ease the growing problem of unemployment.</P>
    <P>The Minister has also indicated that the Government are satisfied that their objectives, of their predecessor and of many Irish Governments in the field of housing have been to a great extent reached and that, therefore, they can see a reduction under the heading of capital expenditure on housing.  It may be true that, because of the continued emigration from the rural areas, the demand is reduced. If you estimate, say, in 1947, 1948 and <Col N="1500" /> 1949, in a country in the West or South of Ireland, with a certain population in its towns and villages, with a certain degree of overcrowding and a certain number of insanitary dwellings, that there is a particular housing requirement, you proceed to provide some houses, but, parallel with the provision of those houses, the people are leaving that county, and it is obvious that you will reach your objective fairly soon.</P>
    <P>Even here in the City of Dublin, we have been experiencing that phenomenon, in a situation where, only a few months ago, it was estimated that some 17,000 families still required houses, but because of lack of employment, because of what has been described as a regrettable development among a large section of our people, a realisation that there is little future at home for them, there has been a reduced demand under that heading.  Tradesmen and others who, in 1949, were appealed to to return and aid in this essential social objective have had to return where they came from.  Many of those were citizens in the middle income group and many of those families depending on the salaries of white collar and professional workers are still leaving our cities and rural areas.</P>
    <P>It is admitted that the Government have been successful, to a certain extent, in many efforts at economy, where economy has meant a reduction in employment content.  It can be admitted that the Government have made some little effort to induce private enterprise either to expand existing industries or, in particular, to form new industries.  A remarkable thing is that Government spokesmen always dwell so much on the necessity of providing an incentive to those who are in control of capital.  They do not appear to think it at all necessary to endeavour to provide some incentive to our people to remain at home.  There is one group whose only interest in this country may well be what they can get out of it and the Government are most anxious to consider all possible means of providing incentives to these people so that they will do the job which so far they have not done.  It is a job <Col N="1501" /> which, except in rare circumstances, nobody in this House will suggest they will do, unless there is a substantial profit in it for themselves.</P>
    <P>To those whose past, present and future has been and should be connected with the country, and whose development should march hand in hand with the development of the country, the Government this year have given a &ldquo;wait and see&rdquo; policy. Because of the economic situation facing our people, and, in particular, those who are unemployed, or who may be facing unemployment, because of the continuing and steady decline in the rural population, I have no objection, in principle, to the encouragement of industrial enterprise, if such enterprise will provide work for the unemployed and so retain a larger number of our families at home.</P>
    <P>Alongside such encouragement should definitely go, in my opinion, an examination of possible schemes of capital investment and capital enterprise by the Government, or under its auspices, on the lines that have proved so beneficial to our economy.  Hand in hand with that should go a determination, on the part of the Government, not just to tell us that they have plans to spend £100,000,000 in ten years and not just to tell us that they hope to provide 20,000 additional jobs each year, but some constructive action along these lines.</P>
    <P>Twelve months ago, a harsh Budget was imposed on the people.  To-day we have a standstill Budget, a &ldquo;wait and see&rdquo; Budget.  The Minister for Health suggested that next year there would be tax reliefs.  Then the unemployed could wait on the Kathleen Mavourneen system and the emigrant ships could still sail out just as full as ever.</P>
    <P>The Government have had 12 months' grace and so far they have not given very much indication of whether they have any real constructive plan to deal with these problems.  I would ask the Minister to indicate only two things, when replying: the number of people who have been put in employment in the past 12 months as a result of his Government's action and his <Col N="1502" /> Government's proposals in this connection for the next 12 months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>In his Budget statement, the Minister said he was faced with a deficit of £5.88 million on last year's current account.  When last year's Budget was introduced, the hope was expressed by the Minister and his colleagues that the year covered by that Budget would end without a deficit.  We can see now that that hope has not been realised. We are told that the excess expenditure, in the main, was caused by the necessity to subsidise agricultural exports.</P>
      <P>Listening to the Minister's statement, I recalled certain statements which were made by various Ministers in relation to the great difficulty which the Minister would have in his effort to balance his Budget.  These statements were made in the weeks immediately prior to the introduction of the Budget.  On more than one occasion, it was said that the Minister would have extraordinary difficulty in keeping taxation at its present level.  Now that we know the contents of the Budget, we are prompted, on this side of the House at least, to suspect that the fears expressed in those statements were designed principally to give the impression that the Government would have wrought a miracle, if they had balanced the Budget.  As a result of having succeeded in balancing their accounts, they have, according to themselves, wrought that miracle, and the plaudits and thanks of the people are expected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his efforts to bridge that gap of £3.203 million in his Budget, the Minister resorted to what I might term juggling of figures.  He said at the outset he was faced with a deficit of £1.753 million, and, adding to that the cost of the recent Civil Service award, the total deficit came to £3.203 million. The Minister did not balance his Budget by increasing taxation.  Neither did he do it by cutting the Estimates. He said he could not see his way to prune the Estimates any further; neither, of course, could he increase taxation because taxation was at the highest level that could be borne at the <Col N="1503" /> present time.  Instead of adopting either of those methods, he resorted to other steps.  He resorted to the procedure of transferring the levies from capital account to current account and also reduced still further the amount which is usually allowed for over-estimation in the Estimates.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies referred to the action of the Minister in transfering these levies to current account.  I wish to add my voice to their protest.  The Minister appears to forget conveniently that the inter-Party Government imposed these levies for the express purpose of redressing the adverse trade balance which obtained at the time. The imposition of those levies had a double effect.  Not only did they succeed in redressing that adverse trade balance, but the proceeds from them were to be used for capital purposes.</P>
    <P>When such measures were taken in 1956 by the Minister's predecessor, the House was in full agreement with them.  It is good to recall that so anxious were the inter-Party Government to ensure that the money accruing from the imposition of these levies would be used for capital purposes, they enacted special legislation making it mandatory so to use them.  It appears now that the Government, as a result of the Minister's action, will have to introduce counter legislation to enable them to effect the switch from one account to the other.</P>
    <P>In his references to the levies, the Minister made some interesting comments and, in my opinion, he contradicted himself on more than one occasion.  He said that these levies continued to play a very important part in keeping our external payments in order.  He said also that one reason for the transfer of these levies to current account was the fact that at the moment there is less need for the use of these moneys for capital purposes than was the case at the time of the imposition of the levies.</P>
    <P>I have here the Minister's statement. On page 18 we read:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is clear that the levies still play an important part in keeping our external payments in order.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1504" /> They have a deterrent effect on imports and are conducive to saving.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Further on, he says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The assistance which the levies afford in financing the capital programme has already been greatly reduced.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I suggest that that is the very reason they should not be interfered with and not transferred to current account and so diminish further the capital fund resources.  He goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The changes made since March of last year have taken away roughly two-thirds of the income of the capital fund.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I suggest that is another reason why the levies should have been left as they were, in the capital fund.  He continues:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The need to apply the proceeds of the levies to capital purposes is still diminishing.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I fail to understand the full import of that sentence.  As I understand the present position, we are anxiously looking for as much capital moneys as we can get.  Yet the Minister says that the need to apply the proceeds of the levies&mdash;the need to avail of capital moneys, in other words&mdash;is diminishing. He ends by saying that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Current savings have been increasing, while public borrowing is being kept in check.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It appears from those statements that all is well on the capital front and that he contemplates no difficulty in procuring money to finance the various capital projects.</P>
    <P>I assert that, by adopting this subterfuge, the Minister has broken faith with the people who, although resentful of the harsh effects which the initial imposition of these levies had on their various business activities, at the same time, were consoled by the assurance given to them and the public in general by the Minister's predecessor, that the proceeds of those levies would be used for capital purposes solely.  We must remember that <Col N="1505" /> that assurance was backed by legislation. The Minister has broken faith also with the House which passed that legislation.  I would say he has broken faith with himself, as if the truth were known, he has a twinge of conscience about adopting this very irregular method.  Admittedly, the amount yielded at the moment by the levies is comparatively small, but it is with the principle we must concern ourselves. They were imposed to correct the adverse trade balance and in that we know they were 100 per cent. successful.</P>
    <P>Some recent figures from the Central Statistics Office are very illuminating. This is an extract from one of the daily papers last week:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The net income receipts from the cattle trade for January and February last were over £6,000,000 compared with over £9,000,000 in the corresponding period last year.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>From those figures, we see that already our external trade is inclined to run against us, to the tune of around £3,000,000.  Already the writing is beginning to appear on the wall again. I am convinced, as is many another Deputy here, that the Minister is travelling in the wrong direction when he transfers those levies to current account.</P>
    <P>He adopted two methods to balance his Budget.  The second one relates to his reduction of the amount allowed for general over-estimation.  The amount now allowed is £1.5 million.  I am surprised that the Minister resorted to that step.  I think it is fraught with danger.  During the current year, we may find ourselves faced with the need to introduce Supplementary Estimates &mdash;a thing we all wish to avoid.  As a result of these two methods, the Minister has in fact balanced his Budget, but I do not see any particular genius being displayed in that procedure.  I am convinced that it was a matter of expediency.  He could not afford to balance it by increasing taxation&mdash; perhaps on account of the by-election which was pending in Galway; he could not balance it by reducing the Estimates, because of the need to finance the very excessive Government <Col N="1506" /> expenditure which is evident to-day.</P>
    <P>It is only right that the Minister should ask those who criticise him what alternative steps they would suggest.  I am not experienced or competent enough to suggest any alternative methods; but listening to Deputy J.A. Costello, the Leader of the Opposition, I was very impressed by what he suggested.  He had some very interesting suggestions, one of which related to the abolition of death duties.  He suggested that, if the Government were prepared to abolish death duties, that step would attract people with money.  As a first step, he suggested that death duties should be abolished in relation to people who invest here in Ireland.</P>
    <P>He had a second suggestion.  It related to the removal of all obstacles towards the attraction of foreign capital. He pointed out that, if those suggestions were adopted, good results would accrue, employment would be stepped up considerably, higher incomes would be obtained and there would be a better standard of living; and then higher yields of revenue would accrue to the Government and eventually there would probably be a reduction in taxation.  I should like the Minister, when replying, to give the House his reactions to those suggestions. They may be long-term suggestions, but at least they are an earnest of his efforts to help the Government in their present dilemma.</P>
    <P>I think it is opportune to make a few general remarks on matters which hinge on the Budget.  As we know, this is a very small country, too small to live as an isolated unit.  We depend on other countries, particularly on Great Britain.  Years ago, it was popular in some parts of the country to exclaim: &ldquo;Burn everything English, except coal.&rdquo; It is a different cry to-day.  We go about in fear and trembling lest Great Britain may not buy our cattle and other produce.  We claim preferential treatment in the proposed Free Trade Area; as an underdeveloped country, we claim exemptions from the regulations which will govern that project.  We cannot have it both ways; we cannot have our cake and eat it.  It is imperative that <Col N="1507" /> we remove all obstacles to the injection of capital. If we do not do so, we will drift on and on in our present state of acute unemployment and high emigration.</P>
    <P>As an eminent churchman said recently, it is one of the chief responsibilities of any Government to provide reasonable opportunities of employment for the people.  The first and prime responsibility of a Government, of course, is that it guarantees the rights and liberties of the individual. Following that comes the guaranteeing of reasonable opportunities for employment. That is a very definite responsibility.  As that same speaker said, it is more important than the reunification of this country or the restoration of the Irish language.  I am convinced that no real progress can or will be made here, until we realise and accept the need for outside help and act upon that realisation.  We will not get that outside help or that foreign capital, if we do not remove all unreasonable and avoidable obstacles to such help.</P>
    <P>In that regard, I should like to take this opportunity to say that the relations which exist to a certain degree between industry and labour are not what they should be.  The rule now all over the country is for prices to chase wages or <i>vice versa.</i>  Of course, the suggestion was made that if prices and wages were kept at a constant level, things would improve in that regard. That is a difficult thing to achieve because we all know the reaction of some employers in this country to applications for increased wages.  When employees apply for increased wages, they are sometimes told that if such applications are granted, in turn, the employer must increase his prices.</P>
    <P>There is a vicious circle setting in in that regard.  When a certain employer increases his prices, all sections, not necessarily connected with that industry, likewise apply for increased wages and we have the vicious circle all over again.  It would be Utopia, of course, if we lived in a country where a system could be evolved which would remove this anomaly <i>in toto</i>, but <Col N="1508" /> if some automatic system could be evolved which would eliminate this vicious circle, it would help very considerably.</P>
    <P>In my opinion, a common duty devolves upon both employers and trade unions to achieve that end. Both have a contribution to make towards bringing about a more harmonious climate in their relations with each other.  If employers were more assiduous in their efforts to offset wage increases by increased and more efficient production, it would help in a great measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That matter would be more relevantly raised on the Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>Likewise, if trade unions were less inclined to take strike action to enforce their demands, they would be making a worthwhile contribution as well.  I do not feel that the Government can congratulate themselves on the contents of the Budget. No reliefs of any substantial kind have been afforded. The same high prices must be paid for essential foodstuffs. No relief is being given to those who pay income-tax.  The old age pensioners and the widows must still face what was described by Deputy Sweetman as the chilling blast of the high cost of living.  In that regard, I would urge the Government to try to bring about some system whereby those people, as well as the lower income group, could be afforded cheaper butter and cheaper bread, because these represent the chief grievances of the majority of the people.  We know that these hardships were inflicted last year and this year's Budget continues that position.  I pay tribute to the Minister for the good points contained in this Budget, few as they are.  He has granted certain tax exemptions to people who are successful in exporting manufactured goods.  In that respect, he has extended the period of remission from five to ten years.  Those steps will help, but they are necessarily long term steps, and I doubt if they will have much immediate beneficial effect upon the man in the street, because what he wants and what most people want at the moment is cheaper butter and bread.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1509" /> There is another question to which I want to advert, that is, petrol prices. No reduction is being given in regard to petrol and oil, although we know, from what we read in the papers at the present time, that there is the greatest oil glut in the world that ever happened.  In addition to that, world freight rates have fallen considerably, but, in spite of that, we find we must still pay the very high price for petrol. The Minister's refusal to grant any reliefs and his feeling of security in adopting that attitude may be explained by the fact that the Government have a large majority and are in no danger&mdash;no visible danger&mdash;of defeat in this House.</P>
    <P>I think that if the public were asked to-morrow to record their verdict on this Budget, they would condemn the Government for having done nothing to alleviate the hardships which this strong but not good Government imposed in 1957.  I am afraid it looks as if the people must wait for a general election to loom in the offing before any reliefs can be expected.  I will conclude by expressing the well-worn phrase: Jam yesterday, jam to-morrow but never jam to-day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Coburn referred to one of the three sets of millions which have been intriguing those who still pay any attention to debates in this House.  It must be confessed that they are a definite minority in the country at the moment.  Apparently the ranks of those who are not at all attracted by the debate here are increasing every day.  That is possibly due to the fact that they look forward to reliefs at this time of the year and, when reliefs are not given, they are inclined to get pessimistic and not merely lose interest in but lose hope for the future as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Coburn inquired about the amount by which the Budget last year did not balance.  We were told, when the severity of the Budget was being criticised, that the aim was to get a balanced Budget.  That aim was not achieved.  It was not achieved by a substantial sum.  Deputy Coburn put it at about £6,000,000.  A second tot of millions that intrigues people at the moment is the money the Government <Col N="1510" /> saved and put the people themselves to find what is required to meet the new cost of food.  We know from last year that the saving on the food subsidies in a full year would be about £9,000,000.</P>
    <P>Let us take it that the cost in a full year of making good, or attempting to make good, to the lower income people the abolition of the food subsidies would be about £2,500,000.  There is another £6,500,000 that disappeared from the face of the Estimates which, therefore, had been a relief from the point of view of the person making up the Budget this year.  In addition to that, the last return for the year showed that there was extracted from the people £5.3 million more than last year.  It is hard to realise that in a year in which the Government had saved £6,500,000, although they offloaded it on to the people and in which they had extracted from their system of taxation £5.3 million more than the year before, the Budget could be in a deficit to the extent of about another £6,000,000.</P>
    <P>People ask what has become of all this money, this extra £5,000,000, extracted during the last financial year which, as opposed to the year before, is a considerable sum and why that should be the case in a year in which the Government had saved themselves of having to find a sum of £11,750,000. Notwithstanding that, the Government were unable to make their budgetary ends meet.</P>
    <P>Last year, when the austerity Budget was being commented upon, as I said, we had first the excuse that we were going to balance our Budget.  We failed to do that, and failed significantly. The second comment that came from the Fianna Fáil Benches last year when the Budget was under discussion was that it was a &ldquo;back-to-work&rdquo; Budget.  The unemployed were to be again employed and the total of unemployed would be definitely reduced and the misery of those walking the streets would at least be mitigated.</P>
    <P>On 12th March this year, a question was asked with regard to those in industrial and agricultural employment and we find it at column 15 of the Official Reports of March 12th. <Col N="1511" /> The figures there given show that, as between 1956 and 1957, there were 14,000 fewer employed in industry and 10,000 fewer in agriculture, so that we had a deficiency of employment of 24,000 people between industry and agriculture and that at a time when it was recognised that emigration was running at its highest point.</P>
    <P>A Deputy of this House, Deputy Briscoe, who is rather quietly getting on in America at the moment, where he has promoted himself with Press notices from time to time, said on his arrival in New York, as reported in the papers of 27th February this year, that he wanted to try to persuade American industrialists to become interested in investment in Ireland.  He would like to get them to join in our plans and he would personally try to get them interested in the free port of Shannon.</P>
    <P>He went on to describe the country's economic condition.  He said it was bad, &ldquo;to put it mildly&rdquo;, and he then added: &ldquo;We are unable to absorb our unemployed in industry; consequently, our emigration figures are at their highest peak.&rdquo; He went on to give figures and said that we had about 80,000 unemployed.  That was the tot, roughly, when he left and he described that as being about 12 per cent. of our working population, and that, statistically, is correct.  Then he added: &ldquo;The percentage of unemployed would be about 50, were it not for emigration.&rdquo; That is an amazing figure.  The employable force of the population, the people who could be employed here, number about 700,000 people.  I think that was about the tot he said. Deputy Briscoe's calculation is that while we are running 80,000 unemployed at the moment, were it not for emigration, the unemployed would number 350,000.</P>
    <P>If we do get to that point&mdash;and it is not inconceivable, I suppose, that we might&mdash;certainly, it can be said then that the previous Fianna Fáil record for unemployment would have been beaten.  It is forgotten in these days that the Fianna Fáil history with regard to unemployment is not too happy.  I shall give a summary of the <Col N="1512" /> figures from 1934 to 1948.  Unemployment during that period reached the all time high level.  In February, 1934, the figure stood as 128,000 and from that on to February, 1947, when it was 103,000, the figure varied from the high record of 146,000, which occurred in the year 1936, down to 103,000.  In those years, unemployment never dropped below the 100,000 mark and it went as high as 146,000 in the year 1936.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEoin speaking at Drumlish in June last said that, in 1940, the unemployed figure was 118,000 people. In that year, over 23,000 recruits were taken into the Defence Forces; 6,000 people were specially recruited into the Civil Service to deal with rationing; 50,000 joined the British Army, Navy and Air Force and 37,000 were recorded as going to Britain to work under permits issued by the Fianna Fáil Government.  All those amounted to the amazing figure of 234,000 which would have been the unemployed tot here, but for the fact that our Army recruitment took off a certain number and the British Defence Forces took off other considerable numbers.  Now, according to Deputy Briscoe, if it were not for the fact that emigration is draining the country of its population, the figure for the unemployed would not be the 80,000 or 12 per cent. it was running at when he left but would be about 50 per cent. of the working population.</P>
    <P>Recently, the Taoiseach got himself to admit that it would not be reasonable for us to assume that there has been much improvement as regards emigration and all he could say about unemployment some months ago was what he called the &ldquo;desperate upward trend&rdquo; had been checked.</P>
    <P>The actual situation, of course, is that unemployment has mounted. Fewer people were employed here in industry and agriculture last year than in the year 1956.  Emigration is admittedly at its peak: the figure of 60,000 is currently accepted as being the number of those who fled from the country last year.  Business, everybody knows, is in a definite decline in the country, and right through the country, the agriculturists are not merely depressed but resentful of the way in <Col N="1513" /> which they were fooled by promises and were so badly treated when they came to ask that these promises should be translated into something like progress.</P>
    <P>It is true that during last year international payments were balanced, but they were balanced by the measures taken by the second Coalition Government before leaving office.  If the present Budget is to achieve a balance &mdash;and it is doubtful if it will&mdash;that will only mean that it will have been done because there has been a reduction in the capital programme and the Government are neglectful or indifferent as to whether that will mean, in the end, a further increase in the number of people emigrating, or, if emigration were suddenly to stop even at the record height of 50,000, it will mean an increase in those registered as unemployed in the coming year.</P>
    <P>If the Budget is balanced, it has been achieved at considerable cost to the citizens.  They have had to bear increased costs of food; they have had to bear the increased cost of those things on which the Government relies on them to spend money because the one policy which the Government had in this Budget, or had in last year's Budget, is to try to remove the purchasing power from the hands of the community.  That is the policy they tried in 1947, the policy they definitely represented themselves as being in favour of in 1952 and it is, to my mind, the policy behind the Budget of last year which is being carried forward again.</P>
    <P>If one can get rid of certain embarrassing factors, the Finance Minister has not to budget for so much when he brings his proposals to the Government; but in the background there is this figure of almost £9,000,000 that has to be found by the citizens where previously they got, through the taxpayer, aid from the subsidies.  While these figures have disappeared from the Estimates and have not, therefore, to be met by the Minister, the Minister for Finance failed by almost £6,000,000 to achieve a balance, the balance it was the aim of this group last year to achieve.</P>
    <P>Last year, when the subsidies were <Col N="1514" /> taken off, and when it was suggested here that that would necessarily mean another shake-up in the industrial framework of the country, it was asserted here that the workers would naturally expect to receive some recompense for the increased costs put upon their cost of living through the medium of the Budget.  The cry that went up from the Fianna Fáil Benches at the time was that that was a conspiracy to defeat the good aim of the 1957 Budget.  It was said that anybody who encouraged the workers to look to arbitration, to the Labour Court, or in any other way, for even a percentage increase to meet their increased cost of living was engaged in conspiracy and that conspiracy was being engineered by politicians out to do mischief.  The Minister for Defence, the Minister for Education, the Minister for Lands, and various more important Ministers, all had the view that every effort made by the worker to get some recompense to compensate for what the Budget had done to him would in the end mean more unemployment, possibly more emigration, because this country, it was said, had to get its standards reduced and the best way to reduce standards was to impose taxes on the foodstuffs of the community and not allow wages to rise to meet them.</P>
    <P>There is in operation at the moment a serious squeeze of a credit type.  As I understand it, it is operating in two ways.  New credits are being refused to those who are looking for them, even though they can make good proposals of a business type, and old-time loans are being called in notwithstanding the embarrassment caused thereby to some of the people who are caught midway in a course of development. The bank rate has been allowed to go up.  Money has become scarce and dear, and this at a time when bank dividends have been increasing.</P>
    <P>One wonders if the increase in the bank rate was due either to the inexperience of the present Minister for Finance or to duplicity of the banks in dealing with them, or whether, in fact, it is not part of the actual policy which Fianna Fáil is trying again to operate, as they tried in previous <Col N="1515" /> years.  In any event, there was no reason why the bank rate should have been increased and that matter had been tested already in Deputy Sweetman's time.  It had been agreed by the Irish banks that conditions here did not call for any increase in the bank rate.  It was accepted that conditions in England did call for such an increase.</P>
    <P>Then the argument was used that, if the bank rate here were not raised, deposits might fly out of the country; depositors might find they could get a higher rate if they put money on deposit in banks in England or Northern Ireland and that would draw resources out of this country.  The argument proceeded with the bankers in those days that there was not very much in the way of an investment mind noticeable in some of the small depositors in this country; it was agreed that that was so.  Further agreement was reached that, in respect of the large depositor, if he was tempted to move his money because it would earn a better rate in England or Northern Ireland, the banks might raise the rate and give more to the big depositor. It was argued that the banks would get a more profitable use of the money that they had to lend on short term and that, out of the extra profits they would make in that way, they could offer an increased rate to the big depositor if the big depositor showed any sign of flying deposits out of this country.</P>
    <P>At the end of the year the question was asked of the banks why, having been given permission to raise the rate in respect of the large depositors, they had not done so; and the answer was that they found there was no flight of deposits out of the country.  Some inconsiderable sum short of £250,000, was spoken of as the most that was considered as due to any change in the bank rate.  Notwithstanding that, the bank rate here was raised.</P>
    <P>Certain remarks were made at a meeting which was addressed in Belfast by a very well-known economist from this part of the world.  At that meeting two bankers spoke&mdash;one representative <Col N="1516" /> of the northern banks and the other representative of a southern bank.  The banker from the North said there was no necessity in the Republic to raise the rates of interest because the people there were not investment-minded and it was, therefore, possible to keep deposits at home even though a lower rate of interest was being offered.  The chairman of one of the banks, which also has its headquarters outside the country but might be regarded as more national than another, expressed again this old fear of deposits flying out unless the rate was raised.</P>
    <P>The Government, apparently, accepted that point of view and they agreed to make money dearer than it should be and to hold up the people who were trying to develop their businesses, where the development was a rather narrow one&mdash;where, say, an extra 2 or 3 per cent. on risk capital might make all the difference to the promoters.  I cannot credit that there was not enough in the way of experience around the Minister for Finance to tell him what happened in the year when Deputy Sweetman was dealing with the finances of the country.  I doubt very much if, even in the face of their own experience, the banks, having made known that deposits had not shown any inclination to fly abroad, would have such duplicity as to put up a false argument to the present Minister.</P>
    <P>I believe personally that this was accepted as part of the programme of taking purchasing power out of the hands of the community because of the fear the Government has with regard to imports, imports which happened to swell up one year, for causes not yet explained, and because they had become completely overawed at the thought of our famous sterling assets abroad and their investment power.</P>
    <P>There is depression in this country to-day.  There is depression in business. There is depression everywhere. There is depression amongst those who felt last year that possibly by spreading the amount gained from the subsidies it might be possible to get people back into employment, even though the employment would not be at the same high rate as before.  One thought that <Col N="1517" /> there possibly might be an excuse for spreading the poverty, so to speak, of the country over the whole of the working community.  But that has not happened. Again, Deputy Briscoe was the witness and outspoken commentator of what was here accepted, namely, that were it not for the very huge rate of emigration the unemployment figure would have overtopped the highest figure of Fianna Fáil days.</P>
    <P>One looks to the legislation the present Government have brought in to find if there is any acceptance of these facts and if there is any chance that they are bestirring themselves to take steps to remedy the prevailing depression. I looked at a list of the prevailing legislation introduced since the present Government took over.  Nine-tenths of the legislation was legislation prepared by the last Government, prepared to the point of almost perfection, and certainly when these pieces of legislation made their appearance there was no improvement on what had been left behind.</P>
    <P>There were two matters only, the first of which was called the Prices Bill.  That Prices Bill was written up a couple of days before it was discussed here, in the editorial column of the <i>Irish Press</i> of 12th October last.  We were told that the Prices Bill had aroused wide interest.  We were told:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It marks the fulfilment of the promise of permanent price control machinery and is a measure which has been foreshadowed for a considerable time.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It indicated that the problem was difficult to solve.  It criticised Deputy Norton, the predecessor in office of the present Minister for Industry and Commerce.  It said that even though Deputy Norton in opposition bemoaned the absence of permanent price control machinery, he failed while in office to formulate the required legislation.  The last paragraph of the editorial states:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Few legislative measures are likely to meet with unanimous approval, least of all a Prices Bill. But that the Bill now proposed represents a fair and just effort to deal comprehensively with a problem <Col N="1518" /> vitally affecting every citizen few will deny.  Constructively approached, given the required measure of goodwill and support and accorded a fair chance, there is no reason why the new Bill when enacted should not prove to be not merely a valuable safeguard for the consumer but a significant contribution towards the maintenance of effective price control and the attainment of price stability.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Reading that editorial, one would imagine that the legislation did propose something in the way of price control.  The Tánaiste's statement in introducing the measure was to the effect that he was putting price control aside and was making arrangements so that years hence, if price control were required, there would be something in the way of a panel of people to deal with prices.  However, his own phrase was that he was abandoning price control except for four commodities. That, however, is the way it is written up for the gullible folk who still believe what is said in an editorial in the <i>Irish Press.</i>  The Minister for Industry and Commerce said that the machinery is now effective and is there to be used, when necessary, as an efficient price control.</P>
    <P>There is no price control.  If there is any point of policy that emerges from the meanderings of the present Government over the past 14 months it is that they do not pretend they want price control.  I presume it is in the hope of bringing in, if possible, American investors who require complete control of prices and great dividends and great profits before they will engage in industry in any country.</P>
    <P>Apart from the legislation we left behind as fully perfected, there was what was originally entitled the Control of Manufactures Bill.  That was supposed to be a liberalising piece of legislation.  It was considered here and discussed.  It is due for its final stages soon.  It does not liberalise trade.  It is the same old control of the years 1932 to 1934, put at greater length and likely to affright possible American investors rather than induce them to come in here.  These are the only two pieces of legislation that could <Col N="1519" /> be called new and, presumably, they form some part of the Government's policy as against the depression they themselves caused by their Budget of 1956.</P>
    <P>There is this asserted, namely, an improvement in respect of finance and savings.  There is.  Savings have gone up.  It is said here in an article in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of the 26th April, 1958, that the trend seems likely to continue.  How has that improvement in savings been brought about?  The biggest item is the item referable to the Prize Bonds, which, of course, was not a product of the mind of any of the members of the present Government. There are also these Exchequer Bills which represent another movement towards getting what should have been got in this country many years ago but to which the banks steadily refused to lend any countenance.</P>
    <P>Anything else that there is of a good trend comes from the fact that capital last year fetched such enormous prices and that there is so much money arising from the sale of the capital that bank deposits have gone up.  However, can the Government claim with any pretence of assurance that they have done anything to increase savings? Their attitude has been to make life dearer and harder and in that way to take away the capacity to save from the vast majority of the people of the country.</P>
    <P>When faced with quotations from himself and from the Tánaiste, the present Taoiseach said it was quite right that they had said they had no intention of doing certain things.  He said they had not any such intention as they did not know what the situation was and that they could not therefore have formulated their plans.  That may pass for an argument.  It is a debating society point that, as they did not know the situation, they cannot be accused of making plans or forming intentions until they realised the situation.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste said that the Fianna Fáil Government does not intend to do any of these unpleasant things, namely, wage control, cuts in civil servants salaries, higher food prices and a lot <Col N="1520" /> more besides.  The Tánaiste denied that these were in preparation.  He used the same phrase: &ldquo;The Fianna Fáil Government does not intend to do any of these things&rdquo; and he added &ldquo;because we do not believe in them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach may quibble about the intentions but he cannot quibble about what he believes in.  All through the war period, the present Government believed in and operated wage control. In 1947, the time when subsidies were first brought in, they decided again on wage control.  When we came into office in 1948 we found the text of the new Bill which the Ministry of Industry and Commerce had prepared and which would be put into operation against the trade unions of those days.  In 1952, we had the brutality of that Budget explained by the then Minister for Finance.  We were told the Government had come to the conclusion that as wages and salaries had advanced more than the cost of living there was no social or economic reason for the continuance of the subsidies at that time.  Last year, the subsidies that were then left after 1952 were cut. There is a policy right through all those years&mdash;the policy of keeping money out of the hands of the spending public, the people who earn money in return for the work, labour or service of some type they give.</P>
    <P>The Government have become bemused by this fear with regard to foreign assets.  Probably the fear grew during the war period but, having emerged from the war period, the Government proceeded as far as they could to maintain the old system of control on wages and salaries.  That is what they believe in and they believe in it for the reason that they have become bemused by this thought of assets lodged abroad and which are to be regarded as reserves.  In England at the moment there is operating a system of credit squeeze and an attempt to keep wages at a certain point.</P>
    <P>In England it is done because over there Chancellors have become bemused by attempts to get what is called a stable £.  Many economists have written recently objecting both to their views and to their policy and <Col N="1521" /> saying that, in a country like England, where investment is not yet as high as it might be, where production to be got through investment has not yet reached the proportions it should reach, there is a good deal to be said for taking a chance in respect of the £ and that it is an economist's nightmare, not his dream, to have millions of people standing idle, to have millions of people not properly remunerated or to have millions of people not properly provided with purchasing power to cause a demand for the goods which then can be still more easily produced on the great market that England provides for her own community.</P>
    <P>Here we have not the stable £ as the idol; it is the assets, the famous sterling assets, and apparently here we operate between saying there is not enough capital in this country for our requirements and that there is too much.  The Tánaiste is responsible for both these statements.</P>
    <P>We had his famous plan, the £100,000,000 plan, a plan that was to leave us without a single unemployed person in the country.  It was a plan, and it was spoken of as late as November of 1956, and spoken of by the author of this plan.  Speaking at Carlow on 11th November, 1956, the Tánaiste said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;He had published on behalf of Fianna Fáil proposals for a full employment policy designed to secure that in five years capital investment would be extended until jobs were available for every boy and girl leaving school as well as absorbing those unemployed at present.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These proposals, he remarked, still stood, &ldquo;and represent Fianna Fáil's idea of how national affairs should be conducted.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Earlier in the year, in April, 1956, he spoke of these proposals as proposals published, providing for a full employment policy and he then boasted that they were the only proposals which had been made and that nobody had attempted to show any serious defect in them.</P>
    <P>As late as November, he could go back to his old-time statement in this <Col N="1522" /> House and say that the only thing wrong about unemployment in this country was that there should be any. Here he is in Carlow speaking of proposals to make jobs available for every boy and girl leaving school as well as absorbing those who were unemployed at present.</P>
    <P>That is the plan and part of the plan was:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is an essential feature of these proposals that the whole of the additional investment expenditure to be undertaken by the Government must be financed without drawing on current savings.  The higher volume of savings which is anticipated must be forced to seek investment in private business.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He had, of course, calculated things nicely.  He said the £100,000,000 was totted up in a special way and then he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There is no doubt that there is available to finance the proposed capital investment programme resources which are well in excess of the £100,000,000 which may be needed and which are at present being employed in a way which yields the minimum of national advantage.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There were, of course, a few safeguards that had to be taken.  There were difficulties and there were dangers and one of the difficulties was that, if you got full employment in this country, of course, people who were selling their services for wages might ask for more wages.  He practically said that the best way to prevent that would be to have a certain amount of current unemployment so that workers would be afraid to ask for what they might feel was legitimately due to them lest they might find themselves sooner or later joining the ranks of the unemployed.  However&mdash;1956, November&mdash;£100,000,000 needed and there is more than £100,000,000 that can be got.  Then we turn to the other side of the picture and the same Minister tells us that the savings of the community are not sufficient for the community's needs.  He told us at Wexford, at the annual dinner of the Chamber of Commerce, that <Col N="1523" /> capital generated within the country was not sufficient to finance the industrial expansion called for by the country's economic position.  He spoke of a crucial test of the industrial progress as being the number of new jobs created and by that test present progress was inadequate.  Then, again, of course, the warning had to come.</P>
    <P>He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Everybody wishes to see workers getting the benefit of higher wages when they can be awarded without danger to prices, or to their employment or to the expansion of activity in their trade.  A rising living standard for workers must be the aim of successful industrial development. The penalty for wrong policy, however, may be declining trade and less employment.  That is why there is need for effective understanding of economic realities by employers and workers, so that our price levels may remain competitive and that our trade may expand.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In that mood, that the resources which were generated inside the country are not enough for industrial needs, the Tánaiste sends emissaries to America and himself lectures the American industrialists about the necessity for what he calls getting a springboard to leap inside the Free Trade Area which is, apparently, shortly to come on us.</P>
    <P>Here are the two figures&mdash;£100,000,000 and more than that, easily achievable, easily in our hands, required to be spent on industrial employment here, and the aim that every boy and girl leaving school will go into a job and that the present unemployed will be absorbed.  On the other hand, he suggests that we have not enough capital and that there is not enough capital being generated from our own resources and therefore we have to parade ourselves as selling parts of this country and all sorts of devices being thought of to induce Canadians and Americans to come here in order to do what, apparently, the Tánaiste has despaired of getting the natives themselves to do for us.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste is very much in the limelight in connection with the O.E.E.C. talks.  He made two statements <Col N="1524" /> on his arrival from discussions in Paris and a third when he was in Cork recently opening the factory of Messrs. Goulding at Marina in Cork. He is reported on the 18th January of this year at Dublin Airport, commenting to reporters in this way:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Our predominant interest is the British market and in that regard I think it desirable to say that nothing has emerged from the discussions which appears in any specific way prejudicial to our interests.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The older members of this House will remember the time when the British market was derided and we were told that, in any event, it was gone and gone for ever and it was like a child crying for the moon for people to think that that market could ever be restored.  Now our predominant interest is in the British market and he holds out the consolation to our people that nothing has happened at the talks that will in any way prejudice our position there.</P>
    <P>Speaking on March 6th to the National Agricultural and Industrial Development Association, the Tánaiste told the groups to whom he was then speaking that they should now begin to reconsider their economic aims and policies which a decision to join the Free Trade Area would force on them. The headline the <i>Irish Independent</i> gave that is: &ldquo;&lsquo;Prepare now for Free Trade,&rsquo; says the Tánaiste.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste, apparently, cannot recollect the days in which he paraded himself as the great champion of economic nationalism, isolation of this country, and he was joined by a colleague in telling us that if we could not sell our produce abroad the only difficulty that might meet us would be that we would have to get the doors of our houses enlarged because we would be eating so much of our own production that we would all grow enormously fat. Now the Tánaiste is in full retreat from economic nationalism, the champion of that whole idea and the person who foisted his propaganda upon the public here, telling them we could live happily here on our own resources and that we neither needed to sell by way of export nor required much in the way <Col N="1525" /> of imports, that, in fact, imports were a curse and the sooner they were reduced the better.</P>
    <P>The speech in March was the most brazen of all the speeches by the Tánaiste.  He was opening a factory of Messrs. W.H. &amp; M. Goulding, Limited, at Marina in Cork and the headline and the report in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 31st March ran:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It was evident that our grasslands constituted the country's main potential for increased export of agricultural products.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He later said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Whatever possibilities might exist in other directions the volume and quality of our exports of live stock were of overriding importance and were likely always to remain the sheet anchor of national prosperity.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I remember a time when a colleague of the Minister boasted on those benches: &ldquo;It has taken possibly 150 years to build up our cattle trade, but, please God, it will not take anything like that length of time to break it down.&rdquo; On 31st March, the Tánaiste repeated that live stock is always likely to remain our sheet anchor.  If there is prosperity, if there is a trend in the way of savings, that trend was not in any way solely developed by the policy when Deputy Sweetman was Minister for Finance.  It is due to the fact that cattle, the sheet anchor, brought in such enormous prices that the farming community, at least those engaged in that particular farming activity, are well off, and they are the people increasing these bank deposits.</P>
    <P>I have said there is one plan obvious through the whole of Fianna Fáil policy, that is, the plan they started during the war and which they continued afterwards, and which they proposed to continue in a more aggravated way in 1947.  They tried to put that plan into effect in 1952 and for some time subsequently, and they have succeeded in putting it across since 1956, that is, this idea that the country must live at a lower standard of life. A great exponent of this is the Minister for Lands.  The Minister for <Col N="1526" /> Lands has told us his idea of how the country should be run&mdash;&ldquo;that the paternalistic care of a community by a Civil Service acting on instructions from a Government elected by the people, could alone preserve the fundamental freedoms and sanctity of human existence&rdquo;.  He said that in 1946, as reported in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of December 31st of that year.</P>
    <P>He summed up his own view, as later reported on 24th June, 1957, when he suggested this: &ldquo;Millions had been wasted in the vain hope that building houses and hospitals would keep our people at home.  We had spent £226,000,000 in ten years, of which only a small fraction really directly expanded trade and only 10 per cent. of that was spent on agriculture. Fianna Fáil was pledged to turn capital spending into production.  For this, 80 per cent. of the initiative must come from the people.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He wound up his speech, made at Kilbeggan, by saying the Government had set its course solidly and resolutely to kill the idea that a Government could end emigration by spending money to give employment. Through the years, he has been promoting his views on this.  He stated that we got happiness out of wireless sets and television sets, but our savings had been largely dissipated and it was time we paid tribute to the directors of the Central Bank for the prediction they issued in 1951 concerning the economic position of the country.  The last three Budgets proved what the directors said was right.  This was the beginning of the real Irish economic nation.  It meant getting away from the &ldquo;Celtic twilight&rdquo; outlook of earlier days.</P>
    <P>At an earlier stage, he had come back from a trip on the Continent and addressing Longford Committee of Agriculture said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Import restrictions, abolition of food subsidies, compulsory savings, heavily increased taxation, credit restriction, building limitation and wage &lsquo;freezes&rsquo; were among measures taken by European countries to check inflation....  No one could doubt that some of the universal <Col N="1527" /> remedies applied by Socialists and Conservatives alike in developed and undeveloped countries would have to be adopted in wise and reasonable measure here if national development was to continue.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We have now got most of these.  The levies were import restrictions and they have now been made permanent. The food subsidies have been abolished. As far as compulsory savings are concerned, the Tánaiste has threatened that if everybody does not save 5 per cent. of his income, he would do it for them by increasing taxation.  We have building limitation and credit restriction and, finally, wage freezes were attempted, but that has broken down.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Lands has also told us that we have to face a stern competitive struggle for export markets. Costs must be brought down and, in the case of some commodities, sales increased to make a lower profit margin more remunerative.  The wages and salaries of all the community must be related to economic selling.  At a later stage, he told us ten years were needed to ensure real progress in expanding output, that there could be no swift change.  It would take time to build up the competitive side of our export markets.  He later said that, for the next 20 years, the Irish people would have to accept a somewhat modest standard of living until times improved.  There were signs that capital was flowing back into undeveloped areas of the world because industrialists were looking for willing and productive labour.</P>
    <P>These statements made by the Minister for Lands are in line with what Fianna Fáil policy was in 1947, 1952, and are in line with the policy they have been working since 1956.  They have their eyes firmly fixed upon these famous deposits of ours and, at the same time, the Tánaiste had the idea there was a sum of £100,000,000 readily available to provide employment for every boy and girl leaving school and to absorb the current unemployed. That is the view which has prevailed in Fianna Fáil Government circles since the war.  They are afraid to let <Col N="1528" /> purchasing power freely pass into the pockets of the spending public.  They are afraid our resources might be absorbed.  As the Minister for Lands said, we were building houses and hospitals merely to try to keep people employed, to keep people from emigrating. Unless this money is put into productive work, the Minister for Lands at least throws up his hands and thinks nothing can be done.</P>
    <P>Last year, we were told that the standard of living had so increased that there was no necessity to give subsidies.  It was said there was no economic or social necessity for the subsidies.  This year, we reduced the subsidies, whatever of them were left. This year, we have thrown on to the farming community the task of increasing production and the duty of paying the cost of that increased production, if it results in a surplus that can only be exported on a subsidy basis.</P>
    <P>There are certain other things we let pass.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare spoke in February of this year about the frauds that are being practised under the Welfare State.  I know he made an effort here to back away from this later on.  Speaking last week on the subject, the <i>Independent</i> of 2nd May said they were</P>
    <P>&ldquo;faced with wholesale fraud which resulted in the necessity to bring in Supplementary Estimates amounting to £3,000,000 or £4,000,000.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He questioned that and he gave a rambling explanation that it was at some Fianna Fáil meeting this happened, and he was being asked to agree to new benefits for different groups of people, and in some way or another he counted this up as meaning that Supplementary Estimates for £3,000,000 or £4,000,00 would have to be brought in, if these demands of his constituents or of the Fianna Fáil Party in his area were to be met.  How that came to be confused with the wholesale fraud growing under the Welfare State he did not explain very successfully here.</P>
    <P>We expected to hear the Minister for Finance refer to this matter.  It is <Col N="1529" /> common talk that there are frauds.  No one has yet put them at the height at which the Parliamentary Secretary put them, requiring Supplementary Estimates of £3,000,000 or £4,000,000, but there is quite an amount of common knowledge that there is fraud going on in regard to benefits of the social welfare type and the Minister for Social Welfare let it be known that they have heard these complaints and they believe in them.</P>
    <P>What is happening?  Are we taking any steps to put an end to it?  Is it a question that we can subsidise fraud, where we cannot subsidise food subsidies; or is it a question that there are votes to be lost, if people now fraudulently preying on the community are brought to book through the operation of law?  I do not know. In any event, it is on record that a serious situation was revealed by the Parliamentary Secretary most close to this matter.  The people can judge his attempted explanation here in regard to these figures and can realise that probably he said most of what is reported in the newspapers, and that his effort here in the House is simply an excuse, because he probably found the members of the Government were not going to support him in any effort he made to get those abuses rectified and the delinquents brought to book.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand the divergence between Fianna Fáil and its two wings.  There are people who say that we have plenty of capital, more than is required, that we should use current savings for industrial development, but we should use our resources for the purpose of getting productive employment and getting every boy and girl and everyone now unemployed back at work again.  On the other hand, there are other people&mdash;and sometimes even the same persons&mdash;who say this country has not enough capital, that we have to go begging American industrialists to come along and help us to do either what we are not able to do ourselves or what we have not the capital to finance.</P>
    <P>Then, the Minister for Education, on going to Liverpool on St. Patrick's Day, made an appeal to our folk&mdash;I do not know how many of them&mdash;at a <Col N="1530" /> dinner he attended there.  He said they should send their savings back home here.  He said they owed a good deal to the land of their adoption, that it was only right that they should subscribe to industries over there; but it was also right that they should send some part of their savings back here. I do not know whether the Minister for Education is getting educated into the intricacies of certain financial matters, but I wonder if he realises the absurdity of his statement.  He wants Irish people who have emigrated to Liverpool to send back here some of their savings.  Apparently, he does not know that a tremendous amount of the savings generally inside this country is being sent to England to be invested in industrial development there. Probably he does not realise that if any of these emigrants' savings get into the hands of the Central Bank directors, so much praised by the Minister for Lands, they would probably immediately reinvest them in English securities.  Therefore, the appeal made by the Minister would be successful and some savings would be brought home&mdash;to be sent back immediately for use in the way in which all our savings for many years have been invested and in which a great quantity of our savings is still being invested.</P>
    <P>The Minister could do one thing for the community, if he could clear up these three sets of figures with which I opened my speech.  Why in a year in which he offloaded from the shoulders of the people £9,000,000, the cost of the subsidies, and in which he extracted £5.3 millions more than a year before, how was it possible that he could achieve the incredible under these two amazingly favourable circumstances, from a Government point of view, and let a Budget run into deficit to the tune of nearly £6,000,000?  If the Minister could throw some light on those sets of figures which are confusing the public mind, he may at least get some credit from the public for understanding what he is doing and for being able to explain to the people what they certainly do not understand at the moment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Many questions have <Col N="1531" /> been asked in connection with this Budget and many people have attempted to ascertain the value of the Budget to the ordinary citizen.  I said on the day it was introduced that it was a dreary and uninspiring document, that it brought no light into the lives of the people and brought no hope for tens of thousands of people who must rely on Government policy to secure employment, to maintain employment or to generate industrial and agricultural activity on a level which will ensure for them a reasonable standard of living.  This Budget does none of those things.</P>
      <P>One is tempted to ask what it means for the ordinary industrialist.  Does it provide a solution of the many difficulties which surround those people? Does it provide any hope for the agriculturist?  What does it mean to the ordinary men and women of no power and no wealth who must necessarily rely on an expanding and vibrant economy in order to assure themselves of a reasonable standard of living?  Subjected to a test by industrialists, by agriculturists, by the ordinary men and women of the country, this Budget is probably the most colourless we have had introduced for many a year.</P>
      <P>The Tánaiste made a brief effort to show that the Government had embarked upon a progressive policy which he felt had already brought results and was calculated to bring greater results at a later date.  He said the Government had attempted to move in this direction and that direction, and proposed to do this and proposed to do that; but the net result of all the Government's endeavours over the past 15 months has been to leave us with an unemployment problem greater than it was two years ago and to give us an emigration problem last year, the like of which we have not so far experienced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the result of all the Government planning; that is the result of all the gloss which the Minister endeavoured to put, not only on the Budget but on the Government's action during the past 15 months.  The Minister, however, was strangely <Col N="1532" /> silent as to what was really meant by his so-called £100,000,000 plan.  When Fianna Fáil were in opposition, they apparently put on their thinking caps and, as a result, a newspaper sedulously disseminated the story that Fianna Fáil had a plan, under which it would invest £100,000,000 in the Irish economy, to provide approximately 100,000 more jobs.</P>
    <P>When they were asked during the past 15 months to let us see in what way that £100,000,000 investment programme would be implemented and in what directions the 100,000 new jobs would be provided, the only explanation we have got so far has been the rather naive and audacious suggestion made by the Minister for Lands that this was not a plan at all, that anybody who mistook this for a plan was really taking leave of his senses.  It was never intended to be a plan at all. Look now at the heading which the Fianna Fáil organ gave to the plan and remember now that we are told it was intended only as some headings for discussion, something one might discuss at a debating society or on some wet night when one had nothing else to do.  That is the extent of the Government's £100,000,000 plan.</P>
    <P>I could understand this Budget in certain circumstances.  I could understand this Budget if this country were one in which we had full employment, in which there was a scarcity of labour and in which we had no emigration problem.  This is the kind of Budget that fits a situation of that kind, where there is over-employment and a scarcity of labour.  This is the kind of Budget one might well use, in such a situation, as a kind of economic chloroform in order to damp down the expansion of our economy.  What is the position?  We here in Ireland have the unenviable reputation in Western Europe that proportionately we have more unemployed people than any other country in Western Europe.  We have a bigger emigration problem, relatively, than any other country in Western Europe, and all that notwithstanding the fact that we were spared the ravaging, dislocating consequences of participation in the war.  Economic- <Col N="1533" /> ally, we can now be described as an undeveloped country.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce is a representative of this country on the O.E.E.C. Committee which is dealing with the question of the possible emergence of a Free Trade Area in Europe and he has been compelled by force of circumstances to plead there that, industrially and economically, we are bracketed with Iceland, Turkey and Greece, that is, that our economic standard is bracketed with the economic standard of those three countries, and below the standards which obtain in small countries like Belgium, Denmark, Holland and Luxembourg.  We are in the lower category and we now plead that we are not ready to take on the responsibility of associating in a Free Trade Area because our muscles are too soft, because we have reached the stage of economic development where we cannot withstand the shock which the emergence of a Free Trade Area in Europe would undoubtedly mean for this country.</P>
    <P>It is in circumstances such as that, where we are undeveloped, where we have a substantial and persistent unemployment problem, and an emigration problem which causes grave anxiety as to the future of the nation, that we get fired at us here a lengthy speech from the Minister introducing his Budget, which makes no effort whatever to face up to these grave problems which press with such rigour and vigour on the whole national economy.  One would imagine, after the £100,000,000 plan, that at least this year's Budget, whatever about last year's, would show courage and vision. Instead, we get a Budget of this humdrum, indifferent character.  We get a Budget which offers nothing to anybody and which makes no attempt accurately to appraise the economic infirmities of the nation.  It is a Budget, in fact, which is the most cautious this country has ever had to deal with. What the Minister has not realised, and what the Government have not realised, is that, in our circumstances, excessive caution could not be and is not a virtue, but, indeed, a vice.</P>
    <P>What are the basic problems confronting <Col N="1534" /> the country?  I have said that we have an unemployment problem and an emigration problem without parallel in Western Europe, and, worse than that, these are problems not of yesterday's growth.  They are endemic in this country.  We have had them now for over 35 years and those two problems to-day are greater than they have ever been at any time during the past 35 years.  Has anybody ever stopped to think what the condition of this country would be, if the 750,000 men and women who have gone to Great Britain and overseas in the past 20 to 30 years had stayed here and said: &ldquo;This is our homeland.  We expect to be given the right to earn a decent living in our own land&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>Suppose they had insisted on staying here, what would the economic situation be like, if we were to apply the present methods to a solution of such difficulties&mdash;if all those who have emigrated, the shiploads of those we have sprayed all over the world in the past 35 years, had stayed at home and claimed their birthright, the right to a decent living in their own land?  Can anybody imagine what the position would be like?  In fact, we have escaped anarchy only because of the fact that we have been content to see an emigration problem of such serious and persistent dimensions acting as a salve to our economic difficulties, for the solution of which, apparently, we have no remedy whatever.</P>
    <P>Added to these twin problems of unemployment and emigration, we have also a problem of under-employment, of under-investment and, in a particularly acute way, a low standard of production and productivity to cap these other evils.  Can anybody think that this Budget provides a solution for the problem of unemployment and emigration, of under-employment, of low productivity and under-investment? If there is one line in the Minister's speech on this Budget which indicates that there is any prepared plan, or any really intelligently-conceived scheme for effecting a remedy, so far as these basic national problems are concerned, I fail to see it.  I fail to find anything in the Budget calculated to deal with problems of this kind.  In fact, not one of these problems was referred to by <Col N="1535" /> the Minister in the 31-page speech which he delivered in this House.  Not a single one of these problems was referred to in any serious way by the Minister, although one would imagine that the whole intention of the Minister, the whole intention of the Government, the whole focus of Parliament and of the nation, would be to see how best and how soon we can solve these problems which are undermining the whole national economic structure.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the problems we have. Look at the problem of unemployment. In spite of the fact that last year we exported, by emigration, approximately 60,000 virile and most capable people to work in other lands, we still have with us to-day an unemployment problem measured by the fact that 73,000 people are signing as unemployed at our labour exchanges.  If the 60,000 people who went away last year had remained at home, we would have 133,000 unemployed, and this problem of unemployment will be kept at its present dimensions only because this year another 60,000 people will join those who went last year.  Instead of being concerned about that, instead of Budget planning to stop that appalling haemorrhage of the best of our manhood and womanhood, there is no remedy whatever suggested in the Budget, no mention of any serious attempt by the Government to face up to their national responsibilities to deal with these two problems.</P>
    <P>Look at the price situation.  I do not want to weary the House with quotations of the lamentations of the Fianna Fáil Party about the cost of living when the inter-Party Government was in power.  I shall just epitomise what I want to say by referring to the fact that for the whole of 1956, during which we had to impose the levies and to meet the impact of the Suez crisis which dislocated the level of prices in every country in the world, we were able to come through 1956 with a rise of only two points in the cost of living&mdash;two points notwithstanding the imposition of the levies and the Suez crisis.</P>
    <P>What is the position in 1957?  With the problems which the levies were intended <Col N="1536" /> to deal with solved, so far as the Government is concerned, with the Suez crisis over, the Government now in office was responsible, by its actions in the 1957 Budget, for an increase in the cost-of-living index figure for last year of no less than nine points.  Two points increase in 1956 with the Suez crisis and the levies battle against us; nine points in 1957 with no Suez crisis and no serious levies problem.  That is the record of the Government on the prices question.</P>
    <P>One tries to peer through this picture of unrelieved gloom, represented by 73,000 unemployed people, to try to find somewhere on the horizon some ray of hope, some glimmer of light that there is a better time coming.  If one approaches the problem in any realistic way and looks for the indicators which should unleash the brighter light at a later date, what does one find?  If we are to provide more employment for our people we can do so in various directions.  We can provide it in industrial employment, but an examination of the industrial employed personnel in 1957 shows that the total number of persons employed in 1957 was, in fact, less than in 1956&mdash;again with the Suez crisis and the levies battle against us.</P>
    <P>If you look for other places in which you might expect to provide employment for people, you can take a number of spheres of national activity.  Let us take housing.  A parliamentary question, which I put to the Minister for Local Government on the 23rd of last month, elicited the reply that the number of men employed in local authority housing schemes in March, 1957, was 4,180 and in March, 1958, the number had fallen to 2,613.  I think that is the lowest number of people employed on housing schemes for the last 15 years at least.  So that there is no hope whatever, so far as the housing situation is concerned.</P>
    <P>That fact is confirmed in an examination of the problem by a trade union official, the Secretary of the Operative Plasterers' Society, and another official of the Building Workers' Trade Union, who a week or so ago at a consultative conference of trade unions in Dublin <Col N="1537" /> gave details, according to this Press report, of the very grave effect that the virtual close down of work in the building industry was having on building craftsmen and their dependents. The report stated that over 20,000 building trade workers had emigrated in the past two years.  Does anybody believe there is any potential employment for them in the building industry? The number employed is now lower than ever as far as housing schemes are concerned, and 20,000 people have been forced to pack their tool boxes and take to the emigrant ship during the past two years.</P>
    <P>Another indication of the bleakness on the housing front is to be found in the fact that in 1956-57 the Cork Corporation spent on housing schemes £884,000.  It is anticipated that this year it will spend substantially less. The figure is £687,000.  In 1955-56 the Dublin Corporation spent £4,900,000 on capital housing work.  This year it is anticipated it will spend £2,777,000, a substantial reduction in capital expenditure on housing.  That reduction in capital expenditure explains in a very special way why the figures for those employed on housing have reached such an all time low record.</P>
    <P>It is not that we do not need houses. Thousands and thousands of our people in this city are still living in slums, in places certified by medical officers as unfit for human habitation and yet, in spite of that fact, we continue to cut down on our capital development work in the housing field, we continue to export our skilled craftsmen to Britain and other countries because apparently we are unwilling to organise our housing potential at home to provide decent houses and employment here for those who must now seek a living overseas.</P>
    <P>Look at road work.  Road work has come to be a very substantial source of employment in this country but because of the introduction of machinery&mdash;all imported machinery&mdash;and because of the cutting down proportionately by local authorities of expenditure on road work, there are fewer people employed on road work to-day than last year.  The Local Authorities (Works) Act, which at one <Col N="1538" /> time gave employment to upwards of 20,000 persons, is providing no employment whatever this year and of course it provided none last year because the present Government stopped making grants under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  Forestry work is being similarly cut down and electricity work, so far as rural electrification is concerned, is less to-day than it was at any time during the past ten years.</P>
    <P>There is the picture, the outlook, the prognostications as to what is coming. This Budget makes no effort whatever to deal with the situation in which employment in these fields of national activity is drying up.  There is no alternative employment available for our people.  I should like to ask, in view of the statement by officials of the two trade unions catering for building trade workers, what the Government propose to do with building trade workers?  Are all our building craftsmen to be trained here for export to Britain and elsewhere to do in those countries the work on which we are not prepared to employ them here?  If anybody suggested we should give away 20,000 hands for nothing to another country and we did it, we would be labelled as economic lunatics and we would deserve to be so labelled.  What do we do?  Though we want schools, hospitals and houses, we export in two years 20,000 skilled building trade workers instead of employing them here at home.</P>
    <P>What is the future for the building trade worker to be?  Is he to serve his time in Ireland and, when he qualifies, look for a job in England, in America, in Canada or Australia?  Is that to be his outlook for the future?  Or are we to say to him, as happily the inter-Party Government of 1948 to 1951 was able to say: &ldquo;Come back to Ireland and we will give you jobs building houses and when you have finished them you can be switched on to other kinds of building work&rdquo;.  We ought to know what the Government's policy is in respect to building trade workers. Are those 20,000 building trade workers to reconcile themselves to permanent domicile in England?  Are they to live there for the rest of their lives?  Are they to keep families here and try to <Col N="1539" /> earn a living there?  Or are they, realising that they are not likely to get permanent employment here in the future, to uproot their wives and children and get all their families to emigrate to Britain as well?  Is that the prospect, or have we any brighter light than these gloomy pictures reveal to offer to these building trade workers who have been forced into emigration?</P>
    <P>I want to try to find out, if that is possible and if I do not give offence by being inquisitive, what the capital development policy of the Government is.  One Minister says that now is the time to plan for expansion.  Another Minister, the Minister for External Affairs, in Cork recently said to everybody: &ldquo;Now, get your money into things at once, go and do a whole lot of work you feel you ought to do and bring forward work you were not contemplating doing earlier.&rdquo; He is let out on Saturday night to make that kind of speech.  Deputy Childers, the Minister for Lands, is let out of the trap on Sunday morning, to go down to Longford-Westmeath to preach an entirely different policy, urging prudence and caution and generally acting the kindly old lady in the management of our finances and our economy.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health is occasionally let loose, too, no doubt with the grave concern of the present Minister for Finance, to contribute his views on the financial situation.  Then, when it is felt that the position is not clear, the Minister for Industry and Commerce is thrown into the arena to cheer things up and say things, or at least put a good slant on them, and to say them firmly and brazenly, and the Government hopes then it will be believed because it is said in that kind of way.</P>
    <P>This Budget, of course, has cut down capital expenditure deliberately.  That is one of the purposes of the Budget, to cut down capital expenditure, to cut back on employment and to cut back on this kind of capital investment which brought dividends, perhaps not immediately in money but in better health and in social contentment for our people.  These are to be cut back.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1540" /> The Minister for Lands said that one of the most unfortunate things we did and have been doing, is spending too much money on things like houses, hospitals and other amenities of that kind; that we should not have been spending money in that way at all. What this country needs, he said, is 20 years of resolute government&mdash;do not spend your money on houses, hospitals or schools.  These are the things on which you should not dissipate your money, according to the Minister for Lands.</P>
    <P>Why are we cutting down on this capital development?  Does anybody suggest we are short of capital, or that we were short of capital last year? Does anyone say we have not got capital for investment purposes and that it is necessary, therefore, to prune back, in the way in which this Budget prunes back, on investments of a kind calculated to give employment and to enrich the whole national estate?  Of course no one who knows the facts would attempt to assert that.</P>
    <P>Last year, in spite of the wailing and croaking about a shortage of money, we exported an additional £9,000,000 to Britain for investment there, under our balance of payments situation.  Bank deposits last year rose by £13,500,000. The external assets of the private banks increased by £6,000,000 and the Central Bank added to its already impressive record of investments in Britain by increasing its external holdings by £5,000,000.</P>
    <P>In view of these facts, what is the purpose of maintaining the present high bank rate?  What is the purpose of the Government standing behind the banks in maintaining this high bank rate?  What is the purpose of the Government in saying: &ldquo;Hands off the banks, they must be allowed to sell money at the highest possible rate, no matter what inconvenience they cause to customers or what dislocation they cause to the economy.&rdquo; I know, of course, that there are gentlemen in this House who believe that the banks are a holy institution, that it is bad luck to interfere with them, that they have a way of bewitching you, of casting a spell over you, if you touch them and if you pretend to understand the <Col N="1541" /> simple mechanism which they have been able to distort as to make it not easily understandable by the average person.</P>
    <P>In face of the fact that we need money for industry, for housing, for afforestation, for electrical development and a whole variety of schemes of national development, why are the Government standing behind the banks in a policy of high bank rates?  I quite understand the British increasing their bank rate, as Britain is the sterling banker for the world.  I quite understand Britain, in a situation of full employment, finding it desirable, at least temporarily, to have a credit squeeze in order to manipulate its economy.  I cannot understand a country which is now being bracketed with the lowest industrially developed countries in Europe and which has an unemployment and emigration problem without comparison in Western Europe deliberately implementing, as if it were sacrosanct, the policy of high bank rates which is having a crippling effect on everybody, whether they buy a house or run a little business when they must necessarily go to the bank in order to get financial accommodation.</P>
    <P>What is the Government's policy in respect of the bank rate?  Are they going to do nothing about it except sit here and wait until the British Chancellor and the Bank of England announce they have adjusted their rates, and then, a few days afterwards, announce that having studied the Irish economy, they have decided to fall in line with whatever the British Chancellor of the Exchequer or the Bank of England decide to do?  Is that the extent of our financial independence? Is that one of the reasons for breaking the connection?  Is that a Republican policy?</P>
    <P>The banks pursue a policy which is absolutely uniform in its general direction and trend with the policy pursued by the British Chancellor of the Exchequer and by the Bank of England.  There is no word in the Budget as to what the Government intend to do with the bank rate. Mundane matters of that kind which affect the ordinary house purchaser, the small shopkeeper and the small <Col N="1542" /> farmer who needs a loan do not matter to the Government when a Budget is being prepared.  They are not concerned to adjust their mentality to how people live who have to keep their feet on this earth.</P>
    <P>As long as we have the transatlantic air service, that is all right.  How the ordinary fellow, who cannot afford to hire a taxi, lives does not matter at all, so far as the Government are concerned. Thus, we get no indication from them as to whether they propose to do anything, legislatively or executively, to deal with the problem represented by the fact that we have a higher bank rate now than many countries in Europe and for no other reason than that the British have a high bank rate and whatever the British do on Monday, we do on Tuesday, so far as bank rates are concerned.</P>
    <P>I should have thought that one of the methods of stimulating the economy would be to ease the present credit squeeze and make it easier to get credit, to prime the pump, as it were, by making that credit available, if the object was to provide additional employment for our people and, consequently, additional wealth and additional income to the nation.</P>
    <P>When I said I wanted to find out what the Government's capital development policy was, it was because I became more confused about it when I read the <i>Irish Press</i> recently.  I do not know who is in charge of editorial policy of the <i>Irish Press</i> these days. That might be rather a tender question to ask in high circles.  It seems to me that the leading articles are written jointly by the Minister for Health and the Minister for Lands.  The Minister for Lands is apparently in charge of the economics and the Minister for Health is probably in charge of the brazen side of the economics.</P>
    <P>In any case, here is an extract from a leading article which appeared in the <i>Irish Press</i> on 21st April.  It says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;After a decade of deficits, the news that the balance of payments account showed a credit surplus of £9,200,000 in 1957 makes welcome reading.</P>
    <P>It is a useful indication of the success of the measures taken by the <Col N="1543" /> Government to redress an adverse balance which assumed such critical proportions under the coalition administration.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In fact, the steps taken to correct this equilibrium in our balance of payments were taken by the previous Government by the imposition of the levies which we felt, after a period, would undoubtedly bring about the necessary corrective action.  In fact, it did that within three or four months of this Government taking office.  The article goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A strong backing of external assets ensures too that we will have the reserves necessary to meet an emergency or to buy capital goods needed to strengthen the national economy.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It further says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The increase in the value of our external earnings, represented by the £9,200,000, helps, therefore, to safeguard the economic position of the country.  But it will take several years and larger credit balances than £9,200,000 to make good the losses suffered over the last ten years or so.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Let us have a look at the arguments there.  Is this Government policy?  Is it the policy of the Government to increase our sterling assets in Britain and starve for capital here?  I can understand a country which has full employment, bulging at the seams with employment, desiring to invest its surplus earnings in other countries.  That is a perfectly understandable situation, but what I cannot understand is why we should export capital for investment in Britain at lower rates of interest while we charge higher rates of interest here, and all the time we plead that we have not the wherewithal to engage in schemes of capital development such as are necessary to put our idle people into employment.</P>
    <P>I know that the policy of the Central Bank has been one long nostalgic yearning for sterling assets.  The Central Bank believes that if you can stuff the Bank of England with our money and leave it there, it does not <Col N="1544" /> matter what you suffer at home.  You get somehow or other an indefinable pride in the fact that, although you may be hungry and unemployed at home, it does not matter so long as you have millions and millions nominally in the Bank of England, but, of course, invested by the Bank of England for ground nut schemes in Africa or some other scheme in the Sahara, scattered to the economic winds of the world.</P>
    <P>Britain uses our investments for the purpose of developing her own resources elsewhere.  Do the Government accept the view of the Central Bank that this is a desirable policy? The <i>Irish Press</i> does, but then if the Minister for Health and the Minister for Lands are responsible for this economic thought, one can well imagine what thought comes out of a marriage of that kind.  There is the article.  There appears to be an emphasis on the value of exporting our capital.  Do the Government believe that that is the best policy?  I thought the policy&mdash;the nationally wise policy &mdash;preached by Arthur Griffith and everybody else was to retpatriate our sterling assets for the purpose of capital investment at home and for developing our own resources at home.</P>
    <P>I gladly concede that, so far as we can check it, we should not permit our external assets to be repatriated in the form of the purchase of unnecessary or luxury articles.  We must necessarily have disciplined buying in order to prevent our hard-earned assets from being dissipated in that way.  I understood it was a fundamental plank&mdash;now apparently abandoned&mdash;in the Government's policy that it was desirable to repatriate our sterling assets to provide productive employment for our people at home. Now the <i>Irish Press</i> appears to take the view that everything is going well because we invested £9,200,000 in Britain last year and looks forward to the day when much more money will be invested in Britain in this form.</P>
    <P>I do not know&mdash;and I challenge contradiction on this&mdash;of any other country in Europe that exports its capital and its manpower.  No country in Europe would be guilty of the <Col N="1545" /> economic lunacy which can properly be charged against us, that we export our money and our manhood whereas by keeping our money at home for capital development works, for productive works of national development, we could keep our men at home also to create wealth for the nation and incidentally to provide employment for our people.  Yet, in the face of what every other country in Europe does in the opposite direction, we cheerfully gear ourselves to a policy of sending out our man-power and women-power and sending out our money.  That appears to be the policy of the <i>Irish Press:</i> it is the policy of the Central Bank.  The Minister might tell us when replying whether it is the policy of the present Government.</P>
    <P>It seems to me to be nothing short of economic lunacy to be exporting hard-earned capital while we maintain at home at very considerable expense over 70,000 people for whom we are unable to provide work.  Apparently, that is the policy which now has the approval of the writer in the <i>Irish Press.</i>  Does the Government approve of that policy?  Of course, if we continue to pursue this policy we shall have more and more assets in the Bank of England, more and more Irish men, women and children in England and we shall continue to have a vast army of unemployed people at home, and in 20, 30, 40 or 50 years hence the same sort of problems will be discussed in this House as we are now discussing.</P>
    <P>Last year further evidence of the ease with which we could have relaxed on the credit side is to be found in the fact that domestic savings increased from £32,000,000 to £57,000,000.  Why, then, in the face of these facts do the Government pursue the excessively cautious and barren policy of this Budget?  Why does the Government not put to the banks the urgent necessity of adopting an easier credit policy on the understanding that the easier credit would be made available in directions which would add to the national wealth and provide more employment?</P>
    <P>Perhaps the most interesting comment on this Budget is to be found in <Col N="1546" /> a paper which is called <i>Liberty.</i>  It is the official organ of the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union. This is an organisation which, in Government circles and in the national councils, occupies a high position for prudence and responsibility.  Here is what appears in the current issue, May, 1958.  I shall quote a few extracts from it.  It says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Budget of 1957, which was savage in its attack on working-class people and their standards was the cause of a great outcry....  Trade unions were very outspoken in their condemnation of its provisions which, all in all, resulted in a steep rise in the cost of living, dismay amongst the poor and needy, unrest amongst workers and a general demand for the initiation by trade unions of a wages increase campaign to ease the intolerable burden of ever-increasing prices and soaring costs.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If we were to believe the Fianna Fáil Government in 1957 their then Budget was planned to help solve the economic ills that troubled us. Industry had to be given the impetus necessary for it to expand and develop...yet this self-same Budget was the main cause of a further national round of wage increases imposing, the industrialists say, a heavy burden on the economy of industry and manufacture.  If that is so, then the 1957 Budget did no more than to add to problems already in existence.  The fact that we are no nearer a solution to our unemployment and emigration difficulties is proof positive of that.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then it adds:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Unfortunately for themselves, this inertia has been brought to light again for all and sundry to witness in the shape of the spineless Budget of April, 1958.  Here was a &ldquo;conservative Budget of the first order: here was a take-no-chance Budget. Here was a grand example of &lsquo;take care of to-day and let to-morrow take care of itself&rsquo;.  Here was a Budget that was a contradiction of progressive thought and action.  Here <Col N="1547" /> was what the wishy-washy economists call a &lsquo;safe Budget&rsquo;.</P>
    <P>But it was not the sort of Budget this country needs.  A Budget of initiative, of courage, of foresight and planning is what was and still is wanted; one that would firmly establish a positive economic policy in relation to our needs and requirements; one that would show the form of things to come; one that would help to shape that form; one that would at least hold out some hope for ending our festering sores of unemployment and emigration.</P>
    <P>Our Budget and the speeches to announce and support it were but empty platitudes and one cannot but conclude that it was inspired solely to avoid the death-blow being given to the tottering Fianna Fáil régime.  Fianna Fáil has even lost the courage to be true to form, but they have not lost the guile of deception. For it is deceptive to present a standstill Budget in the face of the promises and assurances given just over 12 months ago when the people of the country were duped into putting them back into office.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It winds up by saying:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We had thought that a Budget was motivated by an economic policy; that it was calculated to work towards a positive goal; that it would be the means of applying cures to our ills.  But apparently, we were all wrong.  The latest definition of a Budget now appears to be: &lsquo;To heck with you, Jack; I am on the raft.  You can swim.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Thus speaks the organ of 150,000 trade unionists.  That is their view of the Budget and I think in expressing those views they express the views of the ordinary man and woman up and down the country.  The country needed a Budget impregnated with courage, vision and determination to get things done, an unrelenting determination to deal with our basic economic problems because no matter on what side of the House we sit, no matter what our political views may be, the clear thing that emerges over and above the cut and thrust of Party politics is that unless we deal with the <Col N="1548" /> problems of unemployment and emigration, under-investment and low productivity the country will become a miserable, dreary outpost of Western Europe.</P>
    <P>We now find ourselves among the lowest in the scale of economically developed countries in Europe.  We may not even be able to hold that position, unenviable though it may be.  But if we are to hold it, or if we are to get out of that category and into a higher classification, then we shall only do so by using all our resources, our courage and our faith in this land of ours and in its people to finance projects which will give our people work, above all, and faith and confidence in the land that reared them.  We can do that.  The economic position is bleak.  It need not remain so.  We cannot tolerate this bleakness and frustration for ever. The people will respond to a courageous lead which will have in it new methods and new ideas.  One thing is clear.  Whatever our past thinking has been, it is patent to-day that all our past methods have given us two major problems, unemployment and emigration, the solution of which has completely challenged us and, having challenged us, has completely beaten us. Are we now to continue the same methods?  Are we to do in 1958 what we did in 1948, in 1938 and in 1928? Or will we re-appraise the whole situation, look at the picture afresh and cast aside the methods that have given us such dismal results and plan a Budget and a national economic policy which will offer some ray of hope to the people that they will be able to work out their earthly destiny in their own land in decent employment?</P>

      <P>I think I shall be able to conclude to-night all right.  Take, for instance, Deputy Norton's speech to-night: it is a great pity he did not write out that speech when he was a Minister and read it once a week because everything he said applies to his own time as Minister for Industry and Commerce.  He has the cheek to come along here now and attack us for the things he neglected to do and he expects, after being three years in office during two different periods, that Fianna Fáil should cure all these ills in a couple of weeks or a couple of months.  It is a great compliment to us and I know that Deputy Norton has a much greater belief in Fianna Fáil doing all these things than he ever had in the Coalition.  Nevertheless, he should have a little bit of shame in him and not attack us for the things he failed to do himself.</P>
      <P>He quoted a great many figures.  I will give the House one.  He said that local authority employment schemes had employed 20,000 men. That means that these men were in fact working for £30 per year.  The House can judge Deputy Norton's figures on that.  His other figures were about as accurate as that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy would want to revise his figures and give us something better than that.  The general trend of the debate here on the part of practically all the Opposition Deputies was that we had a unique opportunity when we came into office.  We had a unique opportunity&mdash;I admit it&mdash; because things could not have been worse and, no matter what we did, we could not have made them worse and, even if we did not do very much, we could only make them better.  From that point of view, we had a unique opportunity.  I hope to show Deputies opposite that something was done that was not done by the people who preceded us.</P>
      <P>We had, once more, from the Fine Gael Benches the old argument trotted out by Deputy Dillon and quoted by Deputy O'Sullivan and other satellites who move in the same orbit.  Deputy Dillon takes 1947 and he compares it with 1957.  Fine Gael have a very poor case when they have to take 1947 and talk about the exports in that year. No country in the world was exporting in 1947.  We had gone through a war. We had maintained our neutrality largely in face of the expectation of the Opposition Parties, because they had no hope whatever&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I said Deputy Dillon has over and over again compared 1947 with 1957.  I said we had just gone through a war period, in which we had remained neutral.  We had few friends. We were not able to get supplies.  We had no fertilisers; we had no petrol; we had no machinery.  Our land was exhausted.  We could not have had exports in 1947.  No country had exports then.  But Deputy Dillon bases the Coalition's exploits on a comparison of 1947 with 1957.  If those are the figures and that is the comparison on which Deputy Dillon's Party have to rely, then they have not very much to say for themselves.  Why do they not take 1938 or 1954?  It is most unfair to take 1947 and compare it with 1957.  Deputy Dillon has that particular speech off by heart.  He has repeated it 100 times and I suppose he will repeat it again.  Deputy Dillon rubs his hands.  He rubbed his hands <Col N="1552" /> that time, too, but for a different reason.</P>

      <P>What a comparison to make&mdash;1947 and 1957.  He talked about the exports of bacon and of butter, and the amount of wheat we grew, and so on and so forth.  We had just gone through six years of war conditions here.  When we talk to them about how they mismanaged things in 1956, they talk back about the Korean War. Such argument is hard to credit from any political Party.  Or they talk about the Suez crisis.  That is another of their arguments.</P>

      <P>I hope that Deputy Dillon will try to take a fairer comparison in future.  Let him take 1938, pre-war, or the last year Fianna Fáil was in office, 1954, and compare those two years with whatever he likes and let us see how we stood.  If he thinks they did better, good luck to him. But to take this thing with the rhetorical attitude of Deputy Dillon, talking about the small amount of butter, about the small amount of bacon, about the position we were in with regard to aphosphorosis, and so on, is the most ridiculous thing in the world.</P>

Deputy Corish said that if we had imposed taxes on tobacco, and so forth, in order to give something in the way of social welfare benefits, the Labour Party would have supported it.  All I can say is that they have changed their attitude.  In 1952, we increased the social welfare benefits by something like £7,000,000&mdash;we had to put on taxation, as a result&mdash; and, since 1952, I do not think a Labour man has ever missed an opportunity of talking about the &ldquo;savage Budget&rdquo; of 1952.  Am I to believe that Labour have changed their spots to such an extent that if I had come here with a Budget putting, say, a couple of million taxation&mdash;because to increase social welfare benefits, you cannot do very much under a couple of million&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In 1952, the social welfare benefits were raised by £7,000,000. Taxation was more than that, I admit. However, it was never even conceded, in my recollection, by a Labour speaker since then that even part of that 1952 taxation was for increased social welfare benefits.  We were attacked for a most savage Budget in every speech made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a good deal of talk here about how we treat certain classes in this Budget, and so on.  Deputies have attempted to make the case that the farmers were badly treated.  I should like to deal with that point and try to point out to the Dáil that we have been as fair as we can.  It is a very bad thing for Deputies to go too <Col N="1554" /> far in this.  A Deputy is quite entitled to point out that he thought it was a mistake, let us say, to make a cut in the butter subsidy; but when you go so far as Deputy Dillon went and when you go so far as to point out that the civil servants got a rise, that the industrial workers got a rise and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We will take all that for granted&mdash;and that the only class that got nothing and were victimised were the farmers&mdash;what is the object of that type of talk?  Is it not to incite the farmers into a spirit of opposition and, not only opposition, but a frame of mind of having been badly treated? That does not do any good.</P>

      <P>I believe that the Deputy who comes in with that sort of talk is not doing good to anybody.  It is appealing, if you like, to the lower instincts of the farmer&mdash;trying to make him discontented with his lot and feel he is being badly treated as compared with the other classes.</P>
      <P>Let us consider the position of the industrialists as against the farmers. What is the position?  Consider first the home market.  The home market is protected for the manufacturer, but it is reserved for the farmer completely. It is not protection; it is prohibition practically.  You cannot import butter, even if you pay £1 per lb. for it.  Neither can you import potatoes.  You cannot import anything else the farmer is producing.  Therefore, as far as the home market is concerned, the farmer is as well or better considered than the industrialist.</P>

      <P>I do not want cheers. <Col N="1555" /> Deputy Dillon loves the cheers from those sitting behind him.  We will have them putting up their hands, as they do in Red Square, and shouting: &ldquo;Dillon did it.  Whatever was done, Dillon did it.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Production subsidies are quoted.  We give certain grants to industrialists to start business here.  They get a grant to start a new industry, but, on the other side, we have production subsidies for agriculture.  In the first place, there is rate relief amounting to something like £5,500,000 for the year.  Farmers have all these schemes such as reclamation of land, grants on buildings, subsidies on lime and bovine tuberculosis.  Therefore I think, as far as grants for production are concerned, again the farmers are as well treated as the others.</P>
      <P>With regard to exports, industrialists, if they export, pay no income-tax. Neither does the farmer.  They are equal there.  Furthermore, export subsidies are paid on agricultural produce and are not paid, as far as I know, on any industrial product. Therefore, the farmer is as well treated as the industrialist and no good purpose is to be served&mdash;perhaps a political purpose, if you like, in that Deputy Dillon is trying to get a few votes in that way&mdash;as far as the welfare of this country is concerned, by putting forward the argument that the farmer is so badly treated.</P>
      <P>I want to say just a few words on the export of butter.  It must be remembered that the export of butter went up in 1957.  Deputy Dillon takes credit for that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We exported 280,000 cwt. of butter in 1957.  It was as much as we exported in the previous 15 or 16 years.  The Exchequer could not be expected to follow these exports, if they were to go up in that way.  The increase in expenditure on exports last year went up by over £2,000,000.  That is a very big matter for the Exchequer. We had to consider what we were to do.  We adopted a very fair compromise, in my opinion, of saying: &ldquo;You pay one-third and we pay two-thirds.&rdquo; The result is that, compared with 1956, if they export the same this year as they exported in 1957, the farmers will get 12 per cent. more for their produce than they got in 1956. We are taking 4 per cent. of that off by deducting this export subsidy and if they go on and double that export, say, do twice as much this year, their income will be increased by 24 per cent. but we take only 8 per cent. or less than 8 per cent. because, as it goes up, the percentage is less.  It is a mathematical fact.  That is all.</P>
      <P>I do not think that that was an unfair proposition and it is not true to say, as certain Deputies do, that the more they produce the less they get. They do not get less.  They will get 8 per cent., 12 per cent., 24 per cent., as the case may be, more, as their production goes up.  The point is, we came to the conclusion that we could not ask the taxpayer to follow them the whole way if it went up, let us say, by £2,000,000 or over £2,000,000, as it did during the last year.  I should say incidentally, that there is no manufacturer getting these terms at all.  There is no manufacturer getting a subsidy for his exports.</P>
      <P>Before I leave Deputy Dillon, may I say that a number of the Fine Gael Deputies like to recall Deputy Dillon and the 1948 Agreement.  Deputy Dillon and the 1948 Agreement are always quoted as the big departure of agriculture, if you like, in this country. I am quite sure that, apart from Deputy Dillon, there is not a single man in that Party who could tell me what was in the 1948 Agreement that got these great advantages for this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We shall come to it all right.  Deputy Dillon, talking in the Dáil on the 1948 Agreement, wound up by saying that it provides for the farmers of this country a sure and certain market at a remunerative price for every conceivable product that the land of Ireland can produce.  Would anybody on the Fine Gael side not think that conceivable products for export at that time would be butter and eggs and bacon?  They are conceivable products anyway.  But, Deputy Dillon&mdash;he was Minister at that time&mdash; said &ldquo;a certain market at a remunerative price for every conceivable product&rdquo;. Are we getting a remunerative market in England for butter?  Are we getting a remunerative market for eggs?  Are we getting a remunerative market for bacon?  I take it from the silence behind Deputy Dillon at the moment that the Deputies are not prepared to say that Deputy Dillon was telling the truth in 1948.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Wait a minute.  The Minister has only 15 minutes to speak. I am not going to intervene but the Minister must not take silence as consenting to what he says.  That is fair enough.  I shall deal with that in my own good time.  The Minister has only 15 minutes and he is entitled to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>What we are doing in this Budget and what we have been attacked for is that we are asking the farmers, if they have the same exports as last year, to contribute £700,000 out of their income for butter and to contribute something like £200,000 out of their income for bacon.  It is under £1,000,000.  Deputy Dillon, in 1955, I <Col N="1558" /> think it was, cut the wheat growers of this country by 12/6 per barrel.  That was £1,500,000 off the farmers. Deputies who sit behind Deputy Dillon accepted that.  We did not, of course. We did not accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely, we had a better case for attacking than Fine Gael have for attacking now because the wheat was there at the same level of production; it was not going up; it was not too high; it was just as it should be at that time.  That cut was brought about without any economic reason whatever. It was made by Deputy Dillon and the farmers suffered a loss of £1,500,000.</P>
      <P>Another point is that Deputy Dillon advised the farmers to take 1/- a gallon for milk.  If he had got away with that, the farmers would now be getting £6,500,000 less.  Of course, we would not attempt to do a thing like that, I need not tell you.  That is more than one could expect the farmers to stand.</P>
      <P>A number of Fine Gael speakers when talking in this debate said that they were down the country and found that there was a great feeling of discontent.  I am quite sure there is but all I can say is that, with certain Fine Gael people&mdash;I do not say all, because there is an awful lot of decent people in Fine Gael&mdash;whenever I see they are discontented I say we are doing well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a few notes about things that were said by various Deputies which I want to deal with in a very brief way.  Deputy McGilligan said that there is a credit squeeze on. He says that credits are being refused and old loans being called in.  All I can say from the returns is that there was something like £7,000,000 more out, lent by the Banks, at the beginning of this year than at the beginning of last year.  I do not know any more about that.  Deputy Norton thinks that I should know all about the bank business but he was quite content to let <Col N="1559" /> the banks carry on when he was Minister.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McGilligan said that we dropped price control because Fianna Fáil did not want it.  As a matter of fact, we brought in a Prices Bill and it was the Opposition in the Seanad, Labour and Fine Gael combined, that defeated the Bill.  So, the position was, as far as I can see, that we wanted the Bill but the followers of Fine Gael and Labour in the Seanad did not want it and threw it out and we had to come back here and use our majority to put the Bill through the Dáil and go back to the Seanad and say: &ldquo;You will have to take it whether you want it or not.&rdquo; That is the position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Larkin said that we were giving incentives to industrialists, capitalists, and giving no incentive to people to stay at home.  Fine Gael did the same.  Even Labour, when there was a Labour Minister for Industry and Commerce, did it too; we all have the same object I am quite sure&mdash;the Fine Gael Minister for Industry and Commerce, the Labour Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Fianna Fáil Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The object is to try to induce people to put their money into industry so that we can build up the economy and give more employment.  What better way is there of inducing people to stay at home than that?  I think it is a very silly point for Deputy Larkin to make.  It is one of those points that I have dealt with already of trying to incite one class to be dissatisfied with their lot because we are doing too much for another class.  It does not do any good to anyone.  It is all right for the person on the inside.</P>

      <P>Deputy Larkin said that we were providing less for housing.  I provided in the Estimates last year more for housing than was provided in the year before.  I cannot compel local authorities to take more.  Deputy Larkin is a very influential member of the Dublin Corporation.  Can he compel them to take more for housing?  If he does, I will give it to him.  So, do not blame me or blame the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no restriction on the money for housing.  It is the fact that the local authorities have not taken so much.  Schools were mentioned. I explained here before that last year I increased the Estimate by something like £400,000 more than the Coalition provided the year before. We did not spend it.  Towards the end of 1956, the Board of Works got an order from the Minister for Finance that school buildings could not be carried on on the same scale, and that plans and so on were cut down.  There was nothing prepared with regard to a school building programme for 1957. As a matter of fact we spent £400,000 less than the Estimate in 1957, and we have put £200,000 less in the Estimate this year, but we shall spend it all because the plans are being prepared. We have reversed the policy of the Coalition by having plans prepared.</P>
      <P>With regard to roads, my predecessor as Minister for Finance took £500,000 out of the Road Fund.  Last year I took nothing out of it but I put £900,000 into it.  I do not see that we can do any more for employment schemes than the Estimate proposes. To give Deputy Donnellan his due, he tried to get more.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Sullivan spoke of an old point concerning a motion introduced here in 1948 which I have always been accused of voting against.  I did.  It was a motion introduced by the Fine Gael Party, by Deputy O'Higgins and others.</P>
      <P>There were three points in the motion.  It was a motion to give concessions to a man who applied for an old age pension on the means test.  I remember saying at the time that two of the three points were already granted and we could not accept the third one. We voted against it and it was rejected. It had something to do with casual and part-time employment.  The Coalition were in office for six years and they did not implement that third point.  Why should a Deputy rake up this matter now, that we voted against it in 1948 whereas the Fine Gael Party were prepared to vote for it only when they were in opposition and not in Government?</P>

      <P>Deputy Corry raised a point about £250,000 which was voted in Dáil Éireann in 1953 for Steel Holdings. He made the point that it was never disclosed how that money was spent.  The answer is simple.  The money was never given.  It was never claimed by that company and, therefore, never spent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman spoke about civil servants.  The census of civil servants showed 400 fewer in January this year than last year but the census and the Book of Estimates may be different. The Book of Estimates, as Deputy Sweetman will realise, gives the number a Department is permitted to have but there are always vacancies and <Col N="1562" /> sometimes they are not filled very quickly.  As far as the Department of Finance is concerned, they encourage Departments to be slow in filling vacancies.  At any rate the figure for January this year shows a reduction of 400 on that for last year.  Gaeltacht Industries were taken over by the new board only in April.  Civil servants are still seconded to that board but they will be taken back in time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>They were not counted in the Book of Estimates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but they will be counted in the census.  Regarding newspapers, there was an import duty placed on newsprint in 1935.  In 1936 there was a licence provision inserted and that operated until 1956 when the import levy was put on.  The position last year, therefore, was that there was an import levy of 5 per cent. and an import duty of 5 per cent. for which there was a licence.  We took off the levy and the licence and, therefore, there is 5 per cent. on it at the moment.</P>
      <P>Deputies said that the Budget held no ray of hope.  Many Deputies condemn despondent talk but it is common enough to have a Deputy contradictory in his approach to things.  To say there is no ray of hope in the Budget is really to create despondency. That is all I can say about that at the moment.</P>
      <P>The Budget was, as far as I could make it, realistic, and it was calculated to promote national progress on sane lines.  I am quite prepared to admit that I gave no tax reliefs but the reliefs I announced last year for industrial export expansion began to operate in April and I had to meet £600,000 on foot of these reliefs.  In addition to that we had to provide £1,400,000 for increasing the salaries of public servants and about £3,000,000 for agricultural subsidies.  To provide for all these without increasing taxation was not an easy matter and, of course, Deputies have pointed out in their own way how it was done.  Anyway, we had to balance the Budget as best we could.  There was in addition over and above this a slight deficiency to be made up from last year's Budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1563" /> I should like to say just a few words on the capital Budget before I sit down.  We have been attacked very much on this capital Budget.  I want to say that it will at least provide for as much employment as last year because there are two points to be taken into account.  No. 1 is that we had to provide money at the beginning of last year to pay outstanding accounts and this year such accounts were not so acute.  Secondly, we had to provide the E.S.B. with much more capital for the importation of machinery last year than we had for the coming year.  If we take these two items into account we find there is as much under the headings that provide employment as there was last year.  I <Col N="1564" /> am not satisfied with that position.  I do not wish to claim that I am.  I think we should, if possible at all, do what we can to deal with the economic situation as far as the unemployment and emigration aspects are concerned.</P>
    <P>There is no use in any Deputy on the other side saying we are taking a complacent view of it.  We have certainly been seriously considering the unemployment situation and the emigration position too.  Whether or not it is a matter that can be dealt with fully in the capital Budget is another matter.  It is a big point and I think we could deal with it more fully on the Finance Bill.</P>

      <P>Statistics in relation to income-tax collected are not compiled in such a manner as to enable the information requested by the Deputy to be given.  Particulars of the net produce of income-tax under each Schedule are available for the years 1954-55 and 1955-56 and are given in the statement below.  The headings specified in the Deputy's question correspond with the following schedules respectively: (1)  with Schedule E, (2) with Schedule A, (3)  with Schedule B, (4), (5), (6) and (7) together, with Schedules C and D combined.</P>
      <P>As certain classes of the income specified under heading (4)  are chargeable to income-tax under Schedule C while other classes of that income are chargeable under Schedule D it is not possible to relate heading (4)  exclusively to either Schedule.

      <i>Note on the Net Produce of Income-Tax.</i>
    </P>
    <P>The net produce of Income-Tax for any year is the estimated <i>ultimate</i> yield from the tax assessed in that year, <i>whether actually collected in that year or later,</i> after deducting all discharges and remissions and setting off all repayments.  Many reliefs (including personal allowances) are allowable against total income but may be set against any part of the income.  Moreover, it may be difficult to say to what Schedule a relief which is allowable by repayment against one or other of different sources of taxed income should be allocated.  For these various reasons the division of the net produce between the Schedules is, to a slight extent, arbitrary.</P>
